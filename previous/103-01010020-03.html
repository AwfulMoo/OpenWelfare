If the payment nominee is not an excluded payment nominee, and the customer meets all other eligibility criteria, the customer will be income managed, with the payment nominee being responsible for determining allocations from the Income Management account of the principal</li>

If the payment nominee has an exemption from Income Management then this exemption will also apply to the principal if they would have been income managed under the Nominee Income Management - Compulsory Income Management (NIM-CIM)</li>

Termination of a payment nominee arrangement may result in a customer again becoming eligible for Income Management under the LTWPR measure where that payment nominee was an excluded payment nominee</li>

<p>A payment nominee can decide to have the principal (customer) issued with the BasicsCard. The system identifies that a customer has a payment nominee and will bring up an <strong>'assign card</strong>' screen at the end of the <strong>'authentication screen</strong>'. Here the payment nominee can choose to have the BasicsCard issued in the principal's (customers) name rather than their own.</p>
