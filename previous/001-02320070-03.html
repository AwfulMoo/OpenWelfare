<p>There are several different types of activities created for customers with mutual obligation requirements, whose payments may be suspended if they fail to attend an appointment with their Assessor.</p>

<p>A JSR/UPD activity with a keyword of '<strong>ESATATT</strong>' is created for all customers&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
experiencing vulnerability with mutual obligation requirements, <strong>and</strong></li>

'<strong>ES1</strong>' (failed to attend first cycle ESAt appointment), or</li>
			<li>
'<strong>ES2</strong>' (failed to attend second cycle ESAt appointment)</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>This activity acts as a flag on the customer record, to ensure that customers experiencing vulnerability are offered appropriate support to re-engage with their Assessor. It should <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-10010180-01.html">not be cancelled</a>, but may be held pending contact from the customer.</p>

<p>A Manual Follow Up (MFU) activity (also with keyword of '<strong>ESATATT</strong>') is created to notify the agency that the customer's payment can be immediately restored, where the customer has&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
arranged a new appointment with their Assessor (by contacting their Assessor or Employment Services Provider directly, rather than through the agency), or</li>
		<li>
attended their appointment with the Assessor</li>
		</ul>
<p>A small number of these MFU activities have a keyword of '<strong>JCAP1</strong>' (instead of '<strong>ESATATT</strong>'), when the customer has arranged a new appointment with their Assessor. The action required on these activities is the same (payment can be immediately restored).</p>

<p><strong>What triggers the activity&#58;</strong></p>

<p>The activity is triggered when customers experiencing vulnerability who are on payments with mutual obligation requirements, have been suspended because they failed to attend an appointment with their Assessor. Customer has been sent a letter advising that payments are suspended and requesting them to contact the agency to arrange a new appointment with their Assessor.</p>

<p><strong>Action required by staff&#58;</strong></p>

<p>This customer has been identified as potentially vulnerable, and likely to require additional support to re-engage with their Assessor.</p>

<p>Contact the customer to ensure that they are offered appropriate support. For example, a customer with a suspected mental illness may have limited insight into why they were referred for an assessment. Consider other options such as 'walk-ins' for customers who may have difficulty attending a booked appointment.</p>

<p>Action via Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) Attendance workflow. See <a href="../people-with-disability/008-06100010-01.html">Job Capacity Assessment (JCA) and Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) appointments</a>.</p>

<p>A NSS/JCA activity with keyword of '<strong>REPORT</strong>', '<strong>VOLNTR</strong>' or '<strong>REFER</strong>' is created when the Assessor submits the ESAt report, and is awaiting action by the agency to accept or return (reject) the report.</p>

<p>The keywords '<strong>REPORT</strong>' and '<strong>VOLNTR</strong>' both indicate that the report is submitted by the Assessor, awaiting acceptance by the agency. The two different keywords indicate whether the ESAt referral was initiated by the agency ('<strong>REPORT</strong>') or an Employment Services Provider ('<strong>VOLNTR</strong>'), however action by the agency is the same for both activities. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> the keyword '<strong>VOLNTR</strong>' does not indicate that the customer has voluntary participation requirements.</p>

<p>The keyword '<strong>REFER</strong>' indicates that the Assessor has reopened the report after submitting it and some information may be changed. Action is still required by the agency to accept the submitted report, as for '<strong>REPORT</strong>' and '<strong>VOLNTR</strong>'.</p>

<p>A NSS/JCA activity with keywords of '<strong>TT122</strong>' and '<strong>UNA</strong>' is created when a referral is finalised by the Assessor as '<strong>unable to complete</strong>'.

if the customer is receiving a payment with mutual obligation requirements and their payment has been suspended (with reason '<strong>ES1</strong>' or '<strong>ES2</strong>'), action will be required to reconnect the customer to their Assessor via the <strong>Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) Attendance</strong> workflow via <strong>Task Selector</strong> in Process Direct. See <a href="../people-with-disability/008-06100010-01.html">Job Capacity Assessment (JCA) and Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) appointments</a></li>

if the customer has been referred to the Assessor as a DSP volunteer (or not claiming or receiving a payment with mutual obligation requirements), action may be required to inactivate the customer's job seeker registration, to ensure that their Job Seeker Snapshot status does not remain pending.
