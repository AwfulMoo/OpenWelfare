<p>Gordon commenced operating a transport business through a private trust on 1 October 2017.  On 5 March 2018, Gordon suffered an injury which resulted in him needing to employ a driver to undertake the transport work.  On 29 November 2019 Gordon claimed and was granted Disability Support Pension.  Gordon failed to declare the trust as part of his claim.</p>

<p>On 1 November 2022, Gordon’s partner makes a claim for Age Pension and declares the trust as part of her claim.</p>

<p>The trust income tax returns and financial statements were prepared on the following dates&#58;</p>

<p><strong>Mary</strong></p>

<p><strong>Non-disclosure of new business</strong></p>

<p>Mary failed to disclose that she and Bob began a new business within the private company on 1 December 2015. She notified when they lodged their 2014-15 income tax return on 11 April 2016. This means the previously assessed derivation periods of 2013-14 or 2014-15 tax years are not relevant. New derivation periods apply for the attribution periods from 1 December 2015 onwards. Interim accounts (covering period 1 December 2015 to 11 April 2016) are used to assess <a href="../business-and-employers/043-04050010-01.html">attributed income</a> for the company including the new business.</p>

<p>The following information shows Mary's ongoing entitlement based on attributed income referable to attribution periods as follows&#58;</p>

<p>The attributed income is applied retrospectively. A debt results from the retrospective change of the derivation and attribution period. This is from 1 December 2015 to 11 April 2016.

<h3 class="collapsible" id="bp05_L2GT_Examples01">Super Expense equal to Super Guarantee (SG) amount </h3>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The following examples are based on an SG rate of 10% as applicable for the 2021/22 financial year. See <strong><a target="_blank" class="extwebsitelink" href="https&#58;//www.ato.gov.au/Rates/Key-superannuation-rates-and-thresholds/?anchor=Superguaranteepercentage#Superguaranteepercentage">A</strong>TO Super guarantee percentage</a>.</p>

<p><strong>No salary sacrifice to super</strong></p>

<p>In many instances, the superannuation expense is equal to the SG levy. Simply multiply the wage expense by the SG rate applicable for the tax year.  </p>

<p>For example<strong>, t</strong>he 2021/22 entity tax return shows the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Wage expense of $20,000</li>
		<li>
Superannuation expense of $2,000<strong> </strong> </li>
		</ul>
<p>CAOs can also check personal superannuation statements of the customer and partner for any SG amount(s). </p>

<p>The mandated SG contribution levy for wages of $20,000 is 10%, or $2,000. This is the same as the superannuation expense of the entity so there is no excess super contribution. No further action is required in this example.</p>

<p><strong>Employment income salary sacrificed to super</strong></p>

<p>Amounts salary sacrificed to super are employment income and are subject to the SG levy. Where the superannuation expense of an entity appears greater than the SG Levy amount, for example, wage expense is $20,000 and superannuation expense is $7,500 (10% of $20,000 is $2,000, not $7,500), CAOs need to determine the actual SG Levy amount by deducting any salary sacrificed amounts.</p>

<p>For example, the customer’s personal tax return shows&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Reportable super contributions (salary sacrifice) of $5000 on their tax return </li>
		<li>
Employer Contributions of the same amount on their super statement</li>
		</ul>
<p>The entity tax return shows&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Wage expenses of $20,000 </li>
		<li>
Superannuation expense of $7,500</li>
		</ul>
<p>As the personal tax return and super statement show an amount of $5,000 sacrificed to super, the total employment income of the controller or their associate is $25,000 ($20,000 wages plus $5,000 salary sacrifice). Deduct the salary sacrifice amount of $5,000 from the superannuation expense of the entity. This leaves an amount of $2,500.</p>

<p>The SG levy amount is applied to the total wages of $25,000, which equals $2,500 (10% of $25,000). This amount is equal to the super expense of the entity less the salary-sacrificed amount. No further action is required in this example. </p>

<p>The entity (employer) may pay an amount to superannuation that is greater than the mandated SG levy. The controller or associate may also choose to direct some or all of their pay to super before tax (salary sacrifice).</p>

<p>CAOs need to determine the SG levy amount, which is not considered income from employment, and therefore the excess super contributions to determine the assessable employment income of the controller or associate. See <a target="_blank" href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010050-01.html">Assessing salary sacrificing/salary packaging arrangements for employment income</a>.</p>

<p>CAOs should first check the personal superannuation statement of the customer and partner for any SG amounts. These will show as Employer superannuation guarantee contributions. The personal income tax return(s) must be obtained to determine salary-sacrificed amounts which are shown as Reportable Superannuation Contributions. They will also display as Employer Contributions on the superannuation statement. Salary sacrificed amounts are added to the customer’s employment income and deducted from the superannuation expense of the entity</p>

<p>For example&#58; the 2021/22 entity tax return shows&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Superannuation expense&#58; $12,500</li>
		<li>
Wage expense&#58; $20,000.</li>
		</ul>
<p>The SG rate for the 2021/22 financial year is 10%. See <a target="_blank" class="extwebsitelink" href="https&#58;//www.ato.gov.au/Rates/Key-superannuation-rates-and-thresholds/?anchor=Superguaranteepercentage#Superguaranteepercentage">ATO Super guarantee percentage</a>. The SG rate is applied to all earnings, including salary sacrificed amounts. As such, the excess super contributions need to be determined in order to calculate the correct SG amount. </p>

<p>Use the Excess super calculator to determine these amounts. Previously, the calculator only applied to pre 16 March 2017 cases to determine excess super contributions that were not an allowable deduction of the entity. The calculator can also determine excess super contributions to calculate assessable employment of the controller or associate under the post 16 March 2017 assessment rules. </p>

<p>Alternatively, the following formula can be used to calculate the SG amount and excess super contributions&#58;</p>

<p>E = S - &#123;P/(P+100&#125; X (S + W) where&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
P = superannuation guarantee expressed as a percentage</li>
		<li>
S = superannuation expense claimed</li>
		<li>
W = wage or salary expense</li>
		<li>
E = Excess superannuation not allowable</li>
		</ul>
<p>Applying the formula to the amounts&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
E = $12,500 - &#123;10/(10+100) X ($12,500 + $20,000)&#125;</li>
		<li>
E = $12,500 - &#123;10/110 X ($32,500)&#125;</li>
		<li>
E = $12,500  (0.0909090 X $32,500)</li>
		<li>
E = $12,500 - $2954.54</li>
		<li>
E = $9545</li>
		</ul>
<p>Assessable employment income is the employment income expense shown on the tax return, plus the excess super contributions&#58; $29,545 ($20,000 + $9,545). The formula also shows that the SG amount is $2954. This can be checked by applying the SG rate (in this case 10%) against the adjusted employment income amount&#58; $29,545 x 10% = $2954</p>

<p>If the customer has salary sacrificed an amount super as evidenced by Reportable super contributions on their tax return and/or Employer contributions on their super statement, deduct this amount from the entity superannuation expense and add it to the wage expense. The same method still applies after this adjustment.</p>
