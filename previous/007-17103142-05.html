<p><strong>Child in formal foster care</strong></p>

<p><strong>Scenario</strong>&#58; In 2017, Imal was removed from parental care and placed in the care of the Minister under a court order until Imal turns 18. Imal was placed in long term formal foster care. The service uploads the court order as evidence which commenced in 2017.</p>

<p><strong>Outcome</strong>&#58; As this order is more than 6 months old, a letter from a support agency / organisation to validate the care orders are still in place is needed. As Imal is in formal foster care, no additional information is needed to show Imal is ‘at risk’.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario</strong>&#58; Kungawo is in the care of a relative under an informal kinship arrangement between Kungawo's parent and the relative.</p>

<p><strong>Outcome</strong>&#58; As this is an informal arrangement, the service will need to supply evidence of the type of harm, abuse or neglect Kungawo is experiencing, to determine if Kungawo satisfies the requirements for child at risk.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario</strong>&#58; Jolly Rainbows childcare service upload a letter from a State protection agency for a child wellbeing determination for Michelle, which is being processed by Dharanish. The letter does not mention Michelle by name, but Dharanish notices there is reference to ‘3 year old child’ and Michelle is 3. </p>

<p><strong>Outcome</strong>&#58; Dharanish is able to use the evidence as he can reasonably identify the evidence relates to Michelle. This is similar where evidence names 2 children but not a third, which can often be the case for siblings.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario</strong>&#58; Bianca’s Buzzy Bees child care service previously applied for and was granted a determination for child Amber based on a statutory declaration as evidence. The Service lodges a further determination and uploads another statutory declaration.</p>

<p><strong>Outcome</strong>&#58; The statutory declaration cannot be used for the subsequent determination. A child care provider can submit a statutory declaration for initial determinations only where they are of the reasonable belief a child meets the definition of 'at risk' for ACCS (child wellbeing).</p>

<p><strong>Outcome</strong>&#58; TPO/AVO or DVOs may be provided as supporting evidence of a child wellbeing determination application. These must be accompanied with a supporting letter, demonstrating the child is ‘at risk’.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario</strong>&#58; A court order is in place since 2 January because Logan is in need of protection under state law. It is now August and the service has uploaded the court order for evidence that Logan is ‘at risk’.</p>

<p><strong>Outcome</strong>&#58; As the evidence provided is older than six months, the provider is required to supply a letter from a supporting agency stipulating the court order continue to be in place. The court order itself is not sufficient.</p>

<p><strong>Outcome</strong>&#58; Although the evidence is 5 months old in November, if the provider is applying for 13 weeks and the evidence supports a determination of 'at risk', the full 13 week determination period can be approved as the evidence is less than 6 months old from the applied determination start date.</p>

<p><strong>Outcome</strong>&#58; To check the currency of the evidence, in the Word Document Peter selects File and confirms the Last Modified date is 16 June 2021. Peter can now reject the determination as the evidence is more than six months old.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario&#58;</strong> A letter from a counsellor is uploaded as evidence for an application for Henry. The letter states Henry’s parent is experiencing mental health issues.</p>

<p><strong>Outcome&#58;</strong> Mental health issues are not sufficient to warrant the grant of ACCS (child wellbeing). Many parents/carers experience mental health issues and are able to effectively support their child/ren. Consideration needs to be given on each particular case. </p>

<p>For example&#58; It may be a grant if the counsellor stated&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Henry’s parent had no other support and is engaging with counsellors or support workers, and </li>
		<li>
there would be a potential for relapse, placing Henry at risk and leading to Child Safety involvement </li>		</ul>

		<ul>		<li>
Ruby’s diagnosis and physical/emotional impairments are outlined in detail, and </li>
		<li>
there is no information about why she is ‘at risk’</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Outcome&#58;</strong> Legislatively, the disability of a child can only be considered with other circumstances and matters relevant to determine if the child is at risk. If no other factors are mentioned, this would not meet evidentiary requirements and the claim should be rejected.</p>
