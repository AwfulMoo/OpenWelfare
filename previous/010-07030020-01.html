<p>Youth Allowance (YA) or ABSTUDY Living Allowance students may qualify for a Relocation Scholarship if they are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
dependent students receiving the away from home rate&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
whose family home is located in an inner regional, outer regional, remote or very remote Australia, or</li>
			<li>
whose family home is in a major city and are relocating to study in a regional area, and</li>
			<li>
who have to live away from the family home for study, <strong>or</strong></li>		</ul>
		<li>
independent students who are disadvantaged by personal circumstances, and</li>
			<ul>			<li>
six months before starting an approved scholarship course, lived in inner regional, outer regional, remote or very remote Australia, or</li>
			<li>
are relocating from a major city to study in a regional area, and</li>
			<li>
live away from their family home for study</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>and <strong>all</strong> of the following apply&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
receiving at least $1 of YA basic benefit or ABSTUDY Living Allowance in the period. Students receiving a nil rate who continue to receive either Energy Supplement or Youth Disability Supplement are considered to be receiving YA or ABSTUDY Living Allowance. Receiving Rent Assistance (RA), Pharmaceutical Allowance (PhA) or other supplements <strong>alone</strong> do not qualify the student for RS</li>
		<li>
undertaking an approved scholarship course</li>
		<li>
<a href="../students-and-trainees/010-07030050-01.html">commencing or continuing to undertake study for 35 days</a></li>
		<li>
not likely to receive a Commonwealth Accommodation Scholarship (CAS) in the next 12 months</li>
		<li>
not qualified for a relocation or similar scholarship payment in the preceding 12 months. (This can be shortened to a period of at least three months where such a determination would enable the person to qualify for RS on or near 1 January, provided they do not receive more than two RSs in a period of two successive years), <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
not receiving <a href="../payment-delivery/103-04010090-01.html">Residential Costs Option</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>Austudy recipients do not qualify for RS.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
There is no requirement for a recipient to be actually studying on the day they are paid the RS. See <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-07030020-01.html#bp01_L2GT_Qualification_d">Qualification date</a> below</li>
		<li>
A person studying online may be eligible to receive the RS. Online study is treated as an Australian major city campus</li>
		<li>
the locations of the RS family home and of the student's place of study are determined using the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS)</li>
		<li>
Students who will complete approved study overseas that contributes to their Australian Qualification while remaining enrolled in an Australian Institution may be eligible to receive the RS</li>
		</ul>
<p>A student is <strong>not</strong> qualified for RS if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
their RS family home is/was in an Australian major city location, at the time they start or started their course of study, and</li>
		<li>
their place of study is/was in an Australian major city location (even if the RS family home and the place of study are/were in different Australian major city locations)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>From 2 December 2017</strong></p>

<p>For qualification purposes, the RS family home location is assessed only once at the time of course start. A change of RS family home location(s) in a subsequent year is not used to reassess qualification but is used to determine the rate of RS payable. For example, where qualification is met at the time of course start and the RS family home location has changed to an Australian major city location in a subsequent year the ‘lower’ rate of RS is payable. Before 2 December 2017, RS would not have been paid.</p>

<p>Also, before 2 December 2017, the RS family home was being assessed for qualification purposes each year. Because of the changes applied from 2 December 2017, there may be some students that were previously&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
not paid RS in a subsequent year of study who will be paid RS in 2018 onwards, or</li>
		<li>
paid RS in a subsequent year of study who will not be paid RS in 2018 onwards</li>
		</ul>
<p>Verification of study location must be provided before RS is paid, if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a student whose RS family home is in an Australian major city location attends an institution, campus or placement that is in Australia and not classified as a major city location, or</li>
		<li>
they are studying overseas</li>
		</ul>
<p>If verification is not provided, RS will not be paid.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
ABSTUDY Students in State Care (not receiving Foster Care Allowance) are to be assessed for the purposes of RS the same way as ABSTUDY dependent students who were living away from home</li>
		<li>
RS is also available to some students receiving a payment under the Veterans' Children's Entitlement Scheme (VCES) or Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act Education and Training Scheme (MRCEATS). Relocation Scholarship under these schemes is paid by the Department of Veterans' Affairs (Veterans' Affairs), not by Services Australia. Students should contact DVA for further information. The <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-07030020-05.html">Resources</a> page has a link to DVA</li>
		<li>
<img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> Students can update their family home address using the 'Update Family Home address' online service via their Centrelink online account. Where a hand off is required for these online updates, staff can locate these via work allocation.

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Changing_indepe">Changing independence status to qualify for RS</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>If a student wishes to change their independence status to qualify for an RS, the following principles apply&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a person who has been granted independence under a non-reviewable criterion (such as workforce participation or age) cannot choose to revert back to dependant status</li>
		<li>
a person who has been granted independence under reviewable criterion (such as unable to live at home and parents unable to exercise responsibilities) may revert back to dependent only if their circumstances have changed and they no longer meet the independence criteria</li>
		<li>
a person who simultaneously meets multiple independence criteria (except due to age) can be considered independent under the criterion which provides them the greatest benefit</li>
		<li>
An independent student who is disadvantaged by personal circumstances who turns 22 years of age, will remain qualified for RS as long as they have received RS before they turned 22</li>
		</ul>
<p>The <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-07030020-05.html">Resources</a> page has Relocation Scholarship (RS) eligibility scenarios which has examples of changing independence status.</p>

<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Qualification_d"></a>
<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Qualification_d">Qualification date</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A student's RS qualification date is the first day in the period on which they meet <strong>all</strong> of the qualification criteria.</p>

<p>There is no requirement for a student to be actually studying on their qualification date for RS. This means a student could essentially be qualified and paid during a semester break.</p>

<p>For example, a student commences a three year degree in March 2017, but only claims YA on 10 December 2017 (during a semester break) as they are now qualified for payment. The customer is qualified for YA from 10 December 2017 and is also qualified for RS for 2017 as they are continuing to study for 35 days (as the course end date is November 2019). However, there needs to be a gap of at least 3 months before the next scholarship payment in 2018.</p>

<p>For <strong>new assessments</strong> (who have not received the RS previously), the qualification date is the start date of their course (institution start date) or student start date, whichever is later. RS will be paid with the student's first regular income support payment after the course commences as long as all qualification criteria are met.</p>

<p>For <strong>continuing students</strong> (those who have received the RS previously), the qualification date is the default study start date of 21 February. This is because each student starts studying on different dates for each year of study, and this information is not recorded on the student's record. However, different rules apply if the customer loses qualification for RS (for example, they withdraw from studies) and Service Officers need to check when the student actually commenced studies to determine if they were studying for 35 days before the change occurred.</p>

<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Payability"></a>
<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Payability">Payability</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>RS is not payable if <strong>income</strong> reduces the student's basic benefit of YA or ABSTUDY Living Allowance to nil, unless they continue to receive either Energy Supplement or Youth Disability Supplement. RS may become payable to the student later in the period, once they receive at least $1 of basic benefit.</p>

<p>A student whose RS family home is classified as being in an Australian major city location and who is studying in Australia at a location classified as not being in a major city location must provide appropriate verification of their study location (institution and/or campus) before RS will be paid. This includes students who are undertaking an approved placement or practical at a location that is not a typically recognised campus location for the educational institution (for example, a teaching placement at a school or a nursing placement at a hospital).</p>

<p>In 2010 and 2011, there were only two rates of Relocation Scholarship payable.A higher amount was paid in the student's first year of eligibility and in subsequent years only a lower amount was payable.</p>

<p><strong>Special provisions for 2010</strong></p>

<p>Transition provisions applied in 2010 in relation to the definition of the first year of eligibility.</p>

<p>Under the transition provisions, dependent students who first qualified for a RS on or after 1 July 2010 and before 29 July 2010, qualified for a higher amount of RS if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the student was not independent, and</li>
		<li>
the student was undertaking full-time study (or approved concessional study) in an approved scholarship course on 1 April 2010, and</li>
		<li>
the student moved away from home for the purpose of undertaking that study not more than six months before commencing the course in 2010, and</li>
		<li>
the student had not previously received a Commonwealth Accommodation Scholarship (CAS)</li>
		</ul>
<p>This provision was intended to prevent any disadvantage to students who relocated in late 2009 or in early 2010 in order to study in an approved scholarship course in 2010.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> students who qualified for the higher amount of RS under this provision could not qualify prior to 1 July 2010, and had to be studying an approved scholarship course 35 days after 1 July 2010. If reassessing an affected student, check to ensure the correct amount is calculated.</p>
