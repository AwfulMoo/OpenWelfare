<p><strong>Question&#58; Can a Centrepay business pass the transaction fee to the customer?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Centrepay businesses must not pass on the transaction fee or any other costs related to the use of Centrepay to customers.</p>

<p>Centrepay is a voluntary bill paying service to help Centrelink customers manage their expenses. </p>

<p>Advise the complainant that&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
the agency has an assurance framework in place to ensure all alleged breaches of Centrepay Policy and Terms are examined and acted on as appropriate</li>
		<li>
due to privacy provisions the complainant will not be provided with the outcome of the reviews or actions taken</li>
		</ul>
<p>Remind the customer that Centrepay is voluntary and the customer can cancel or vary their deduction at any time. If the deduction is cancelled, the business cannot restart the deduction without the customer’s consent.</p></td>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Is the customer required to use only Centrepay to pay for the service/s or good/s provided by a participating Centrepay business?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Businesses must have other payment options available for their Services Australia customers to use. Centrepay is voluntary and it is the customer's choice to use the service or not.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Does the Centrepay business need the customer's consent before they make a change to a deduction or restart a deduction?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Yes, a business will need the consent of the customer to start a new deduction, restart a cancelled deduction, or to increase either the target or the deduction amount. The business must get consent from each customer via a Centrepay Deduction Authority before these changes are made.</p>

<p>If a Centrepay deduction is cancelled by the customer, this is evidence the customer has withdrawn their consent. No cancelled Centrepay deduction can be reinstated until new consent is obtained from the customer via a Deduction Authority.</p>

<p>Businesses do not require the customer's consent to suspend, cancel, reduce, or to add end dates to the customer's deduction, as this is acting in the customer's best interests.</p></td>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Does the customer need the consent of the business before they start a deduction or make a change to an existing deduction?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; No, Centrepay is a voluntary service. Customers do not need to obtain the consent of the business before starting, cancelling or varying a deduction. However, if the customer cancels a deduction and monies are still owed to the business for goods or services, it is advisable the customer makes alternate arrangements to pay the business.</p>

<p>Some deductions, such as court fines and court infringements cannot be started or changed by the customer. Customers will need to contact the business. </p></td>

<p><strong>Question&#58; What will happen if the customer has outstanding amounts owed to the business due to cancelled, suspended or reduced deductions?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; The agency is not responsible for any outstanding amounts that might be owed. The customer will need to speak to the business to make alternative payment arrangements for the amounts owed.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Is it true that some Centrepay businesses cannot have current deductions increased, or have new deductions started?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Depending on the situation, this may be true. For example, if a business is suspended or additional conditions have been placed on the business. A <strong>DOC</strong> should be on the business record.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Is the business required to keep personal information of Centrepay customers private?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Businesses must securely store all information they receive from the agency and comply with all privacy laws. Deduction Authorities must be retained by the business for a period of 2 years after the last deduction has been made. The customer can find more information about the <a target="_blank" class="extwebsitelink" href="https&#58;//www.oaic.gov.au/agencies-and-organisations/app-guidelines/">Australian Privacy Principles</a> at the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner's website.</p>

<p class="info-box warning">For National Business Gateway only</p>

<p>Check to see if the BA has been received. If no BA is received the business will need to resend the BA. Information on how to submit BAs is located on the Services Australia Website.</p>

<p>If a 'shell record' is located, <strong>DOC</strong>s and/or activity notes on the record will state the stage the BA has progressed to, see <a href="../payment-delivery/103-09010010-01.html">Processing a Centrepay Business Application</a>. Advise the business the BA is currently being reviewed and a letter will be sent once a decision has been made to approve or reject their request. If notes advise additional information/documentation has been requested, advise the business of this requirement so they can supply this information to progress their application.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Has a complaint or feedback been received from a business about their suspension or withdrawal from the Centrepay program, the rejection of a Business Application, or the variation to the conditions for which they are approved to use Centrepay? </strong></p>

<p>These complaints do not need to be recorded in the Customer Feedback Tool.</p>

<p>A business can request a review of the agency’s decision to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
not approve the business to use Centrepay</li>
		<li>
vary the Centrepay Policy and Terms or impose additional conditions on the business's approval to use Centrepay</li>
		<li>
suspend the business’s approval to use Centrepay, or</li>
		<li>
withdraw the business's approval to use Centrepay</li>
		</ul>
<p>A request for a review of a decision must be submitted to the agency in writing within 10 working days of the business being notified of the decision in writing. The business should outline the reasons for seeking the review and include any relevant information to support their request.</p>

<p>A review of the decision will be undertaken by an Authorised Review Officer (ARO). The business will be notified in writing of the review outcome within 20 business days of receipt of the request.</p>

<p>At the completion of the review, the ARO will affirm, vary or set aside the original decision.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Why are there restrictions on how the business promotes its use of Centrepay?</strong></p>

<p>A business must not represent its approval to use Centrepay in a manner that represents endorsement of the business or its goods or services by the agency or the Australian Government. There are set criteria on how and what a business may use to promote Centrepay, as set out in the Centrepay Procedural Guide for Businesses. This guide is located on the Services Australia website. A business may seek approval to use non-standard Centrepay references by contacting the Third Party Program Team. Positional mailbox details can be found on the Third Party Program Team Intranet page. </p></td>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Why do there have to be payment options, other than Centrepay, for a customer to pay for the service or goods?</strong></p>

<p>Centrepay is a voluntary service. It is up to the Centrelink customer if they choose to use this service. As per the Centrepay Policy and Terms, a business must offer at least one other viable method of payment for Centrelink customers to pay their bills.</p></td>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Why are there restrictions on what type of goods or services a business provides?</strong></p>

<p>The purpose of Centrepay is to assist customers in managing expenses that are consistent with the purposes of their welfare payments and reducing financial risk. In keeping with that objective, certain expenses and payment arrangements are excluded from Centrepay.</p></td>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Is there a requirement for an approved business to keep Deduction Authorities?</strong></p>

<p>Centrepay businesses using Business Online Services to manage customer deductions are required to obtain and securely store a copy of the Deduction Authority provided by the customer for a period of 2 years after the final deduction is made.</p>

<p>The agency may request evidence of a Deduction Authority as part of an assurance review. A business may be found to be non-compliant if it is unable to provide the customer’s Deduction Authority.</p></td>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Business advises it has not received notification of updates to the Centrepay Policy and Terms</strong></p>

<p>The Centrepay Policy and Terms document is published in the Centrepay for Business section on the Services Australia website. The business is responsible for keeping up to date with any updates to the Policy and Terms when using Centrepay. If the business continues to use Centrepay after an update to the Policy and Terms, the business is considered to have agreed to the changes.</p></td>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Why can't Centrepay be used to pay for unregulated consumer leases?</strong></p>

<p>In keeping with the objective of Centrepay, it has been decided that unregulated consumer leases, those that run for an indefinite period of time or short term (less than 4 months) leases, are excluded from Centrepay due to the low levels of protection available to consumers. All unregulated consumer lease deductions through Centrepay were cancelled from 17 February 2017 and cannot be restarted. </p></td>
