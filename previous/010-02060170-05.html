<p><strong>Independent Boarding School (IBS) scholarship offered before 1 January 2019</strong></p>

<p>In October 2018, Fairholme Grammar School offer a scholarship to Lilly for the 2019 academic year. Because the offer of the scholarship was prior to 1 January 2019, the IBS scholarship rules apply.</p>

<p>Fairholme Grammar School meets all the criteria to be an approved school to offer an IBS scholarship under the pre 1 January 2019 rules. This includes a SES score of more than 100, a contribution of at least 15% of board and tuition charges and the involvement of the local Indigenous Education Consultative Body (IECB).</p>

<p>Lilly submits a claim for ABSTUDY in November 2018 and is approved for away from home payments under the IBS scholarship provisions.</p>

<p>Lilly’s twin Meg also wants to board away from home and in November applies to Fairholme Grammar School for an IBS scholarship. Fairholme acknowledges that it would be beneficial for both siblings to study together and in December 2018, also offer Meg an IBS scholarship for 2019. Meg submits a claim for ABSTUDY in January 2019. Meg is approved for away from home entitlements under the pre-1 January 2019 rules as that is the date of her scholarship offer, even though the ABSTUDY claim was lodged in January 2019.</p></td>

<p>In 2019 Guilderton Boys College’s total board and tuition charges are $23,000 per annum.</p>

<p>25% of the school’s combined board and tuition charges is $5750, which is less than the minimum <a target="_blank" href="../utils/RatesChart/rateschart.html">Boarding School Scholarship Approval Threshold</a> amount. Therefore Guilderton must contribute at least the minimum <a target="_blank" href="../utils/RatesChart/rateschart.html">Boarding School Scholarship Approval Threshold</a> amount for Isaac to be approved for away from home payments.</p>

<p>As 25% of the school’s combined board and tuition charges is $11,000 which is greater than the minimum <a target="_blank" href="../utils/RatesChart/rateschart.html">Boarding School Scholarship Approval Threshold</a> amount, the minimum scholarship contribution amount required by Brisbane must be at least $11,000.</p>

<p>In November 2018, Glen Isla College offer a scholarship to Missie for the 2019 academic year. As Glen Isla College’s total board and tuition charges are $36,000 per annum, Glen Isla College offer a scholarship to Missie for 25% (or $9,000) of their total board and tuition charges.</p>

<p>Because the IBS scholarship was offered before 1 January 2019, it is offered under the old rules. Whilst the school has contributed a minimum of 15% towards the scholarship, the school does not have a SES score of 100 or greater, and has not involved the local Indigenous Education Consultative Board in formulating the scholarship.</p>

<p>Missie cannot be approved for ABSTUDY away from home payments based on receipt of an IBS scholarship. The scholarship offer occurred prior to 1 January 2019 and therefore a scholarship must be offered under the existing rules in place in 2018.</p></td>

<p>In 2020, Lundy Grammar School advised that the scholarship for BJ would now contain only a $6,000 Scholarship Contribution Amount.</p>

<p>The Boarding School scholarship cannot be approved for BJ in 2020 because the school must continue to make a scholarship financial contribution under the same criteria (either the minimum <a target="_blank" href="../utils/RatesChart/rateschart.html">Boarding School Scholarship Approval Threshold</a> amount or 25%) as was the initial grant, for the life of the scholarship.</p></td>

<p>Scotch College must continue to make a scholarship financial contribution under the same criteria as was the initial grant, for the life of the scholarship.

<p>In September 2019 Gus’s mother died. Gus went home for the funeral and completed 6 weeks of cultural obligations within his community. Both Gus and the school agreed that under the circumstances, Gus should not return to school until the start of the 2020 academic year.

<p>The Department of Social Services determines which scholarships are approved for away from home rate for schools or providers seeking to be recognised as a Third Party Indigenous Scholarship provider.</p>

<p>Third Party Indigenous Scholarships are normally managed and delivered by a number of provider organisations, who have contracts or funding arrangements with either the Department of Social Services or the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet.</p>

<p>Services Australia has no role in assessing or determining either the scholarships or a qualifying school.</p>
