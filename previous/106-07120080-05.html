<p>Rebecca has recently been involved in an accident and as a result exhausted the funds available to Rebecca due to medical expenses. As a situation has arisen beyond Rebecca’s control it may be appropriate to grant payments under Section 24 provisions.</p>

<p>Hans visits Erica and their children every 6 months or so, and during the most recent visit left Erica $5,000 to help buy food, clothes, and pay general expenses.

There are restrictions on the transfer of Carly's income out of the country.</p>

<p>James has gone overseas temporarily to visit Carly and assist in the necessary preparations for Carly's emigration to Australia.</p>

<p>Clive has a savings account in the amount of $10 000, and also has a small overseas pension.</p>

<p>Due to the cost of living in the Philippines, Clive’s Australian Age Pension is several times the annual equivalent to the basic wage in that country.

<p>Penny has been married to Joshua for five years. Penny's relationship with Joshua is recognised under social security law due to the fact that they are legally married. Penny and Joshua are linked on the <strong>MS</strong> screen.</p>

<p>Penny has recently commenced a new 'member of a couple' relationship with Mark whilst still maintaining Penny's relationship with Joshua i.e. Penny has more than 1 partner. The agency does not recognise Penny's relationship with Mark because social security law does not recognise multiple relationships.</p>

<p>Section 4 of the Social Security Act 1991 appears to contemplate that a customer has 1 partner or none at all. The decision maker may therefore decide it would be appropriate to assess Mark as single under Section 24, taking into account unfairness or absurdities in the operation of the legislation. For example, the legislation inferring that a customer has 1 partner or none at all could be assessed as unfair to count 1 partner's income and assets against multiple partners, for which the Act provides no clarity.</p>
