<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>People receiving income support payments with mutual obligation requirements must show they are actively looking for work and participating in a range of tasks and activities that will help them into employment, unless Services Australia has granted the job seeker a temporary exemption from these requirements.</P>
<P>Job seekers on the following income support payments have mutual obligation requirements:</P>
<UL>
<LI>JobSeeker Payment (JSP)</LI>
<LI>Youth Allowance (YA) (job seeker)</LI>
<LI>Parenting Payment (PP) for a single customer (when their youngest child turns 6)</LI>
<LI>Special Benefit (SpB) (Nominated Visa Holders)</LI></UL>

<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_Types_of_Mutual>Types of mutual obligation requirements</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Mutual obligation requirements include a range of requirements a job seeker can be compelled to fulfil under social security law in return for ongoing income support. These include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>attending Employment Services Provider appointments</LI>
<LI>attending Services Australia appointments</LI>
<LI>undertaking job search</LI>
<LI>meeting a monthly points target (Workforce Australia participants only)</LI>
<LI>acting on referrals to jobs, and</LI>
<LI>participating in a requirement that fully meets their mutual obligation requirements</LI></UL>
<P>A job seeker's mutual obligation requirements are generally determined by:</P>
<UL>
<LI>their age</LI>
<LI>their assessed work capacity, and</LI>
<LI>whether they have primary responsibility for the care of a child</LI></UL>
<P>Job seekers have either full-time or part-time mutual obligation requirements.</P>
<P>Job seekers with <STRONG>full-time</STRONG> mutual obligation requirements should be:</P>
<UL>
<LI>looking for work, and</LI>
<LI>actively addressing any circumstances that may affect their capacity to undertake paid work</LI></UL>
<P>The following job seekers have <STRONG>part-time</STRONG> mutual obligation requirements:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Principal carer parents, once the youngest child in their care turns six years of age</LI>
<LI>Job seekers with a partial capacity to work (PCW) of 15 to 29 hours per week</LI>
<LI>Mature age job seekers, 55 years and over</LI></UL>
<P>The extent and combination of tasks activities that the job seeker is to undertake will vary depending on the job seeker's cohort. In general, the <STRONG>Job Plan</STRONG> will contain requirements set out but the job seeker's Employment Services Provider:</P>
<P>With the exception of Special Benefit (SpB) job seekers paid under the SpB Activity Test, Centrelink managed job seekers fully meet requirements by participating in approved activities.</P>
<P>The <A href="../job-seekers/001-09020000-03.html">Process</A> page contains information about how Service Officers make sure Centrelink managed job seekers fully meet their mutual obligation requirements.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>See <A href="../job-seekers/001-02140000-01.html">Community Development Program (CDP)</A> for information on job search and mutual obligation requirements for job seekers in CDP</P>
<P>The job seeker's Job Plan will include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>a points requirement, including a minimum job search requirement</LI>
<LI>any compulsory activities, and</LI>
<LI>personal responsibility requirement</LI></UL>
<P>Employment Services Providers must:</P>
<UL>
<LI>specify the minimum job search for each job seeker. This will display in the job seekers homepage, not in their job plan</LI>
<LI>specify the points target a job seeker is required to meet per month</LI>
<LI>adjust the points target and the minimum job search requirement appropriately based on each job seeker’s:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>personal circumstances</LI>
<LI>local labour market</LI></UL></UL>
<P>There are some circumstances where the number of job searches may be reduced by the provider. Service Officers have no authority to reduce the number of job searches. Providers will work with job seekers to decide the tasks and activities they use to meet the points target.</P>
<P>Any job seeker whose income support payment is reduced to nil because of employment income (their own or partner's) does not have mutual obligation requirements during the nil rate period.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<DIV class=twisty><A name=bp01_L2GT_Points_Based_Ac class=anchor></A>
<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_Points_Based_Ac>Points Based Activation System (PBAS)</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>From 7 December 2020, job seekers granted a participation payment in an NESM region had a PBAS target in their job plan as part of a trial. Existing job seekers in the NESM regions were also able to choose to join the trial. The trial ceased on 30 June 2022 and from 1 July 2022 PBAS has been extended to all job seekers.</P>
<P>Under PBAS job seekers accumulate a points target each month. This is instead of reporting a set number of job searches each month. A job seeker's points target is based on their personal circumstances and local labour market, and displays in their homepage on the Workforce Australia website.</P>
<P>Job seekers can accumulate points by completing a variety of tasks and activities, including job search-related activities, and recording them in their Workforce Australia homepage:</P>
<UL>
<LI>applying for a job</LI>
<LI>updating their career profile</LI>
<LI>going for a job interview</LI>
<LI>accepting a job offer, or</LI>
<LI>doing paid work</LI></UL>
<P>The points value for each activity is displayed in the job seeker's homepage. Job seekers can choose which tasks or activities they will undertake to meet their target. This gives job seekers greater flexibility in meeting their requirements.</P>
<P>If a job seeker exceeds the number of points they need, they can carry over that excess into the next reporting period (up to 50 per cent of their target). This will reduce the number of points they must get next month.</P>
<P>PBAS replaces the job search requirement in a job plan. All other mutual obligation requirements remain unchanged, for example attendance at appointments, activities, etc. Certain other activities may reduce the number of points required.</P>
<P>It is the provider's responsibility to set the monthly points target and to manage any disputes with the job seeker about:</P>
<UL>
<LI>whether the target is appropriate</LI>
<LI>whether the job seeker has a valid reason for not meeting a monthly points target</LI></UL>
<P>Advise the job seeker to discuss the matter with their provider if they:</P>
<UL>
<LI>disagree with their points target, or</LI>
<LI>dispute the number of points accumulated</LI></UL>
<P>Services Australia staff cannot view a job seeker's points target or accumulated points.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<LI>Job seekers with a partial capacity to work or temporary reduced work capacity (15 to 29 hours per week), and</LI>

<P>If Services Australia establishes that a job seeker is participating sufficiently in approved activities, Services Australia updates the Job Plan.. The job seeker is then suspended from Employment Provider Services.</P>
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> job seekers aged 55 years or over must remain connected with a Workforce Australia provider (although they are suspended from their caseload). They must attend any notified appointments with their Workforce Australia provider.</P>
<P>It is possible for some job seekers to maintain qualification for payment by having sufficient paid work to satisfy their mutual obligation requirements and to still be regarded as unemployed.</P>

<DIV class=block>
<P>Job seekers participating in Drug Court programs may be able to use this activity to meet their mutual obligation requirements. The activity should be included in their Job Plan for no more than six months at a time.</P>
<P>The Job Plan should:</P>
<UL>
<LI>be reviewed and updated every six months, and</LI>
<LI>take into consideration the person's individual Drug Court program obligations and their ability to look for and take up suitable work or study</LI></UL>
<P>Participants accepted into the program must follow an individual case management plan, which sets out the requirements of the 12 month program. This program is strictly monitored by the court and any deviance from the agreed program may result in the imposition of sanctions and in the last resort, expulsion from the program.</P>
<P>The following activities are mandatory for all participants:</P>
<UL>
<LI>attendance at court on a weekly, fortnightly or monthly basis</LI>
<LI>regular attendance at counselling sessions organised by the Department of Health and Aged Care and the Probation and Parole Service (P and PS)</LI>
<LI>attendance at programs organised by the Department of Health and Aged Care</LI>
<LI>TAFE programs such as numeracy and literacy, English as a second language, anger management, self-esteem, preparing for employment etcetera</LI>
<LI>urinalysis testing, and home visits by P and PS</LI></UL>
<P>As participants will be required to undertake set activities at set times, there may be limits to their ability to look for and accept full-time work. On rare occasions, the Drug Court may direct people who are currently working to stop work for a period of time so that they can undertake intensive rehabilitation to help them overcome their drug addiction. Most people in this situation will not qualify for income support payment, but where they do qualify, a penalty for voluntary unemployment is not to be applied.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
