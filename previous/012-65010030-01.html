R662 - The patient has already been supplied this Continued Dispensing item within the last months. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> from 1 May 2020, PBS Online reason code 662 for under co-payment prescriptions of continued dispensing items has been amended from a ‘warning’ to a ‘reject’.

<p>The pharmacist must determine whether a patient meets the requirements for the Continued Dispensing arrangements. A pharmacist must not rely solely on the PBS Online messages to determine if a Continued Dispensing supply is appropriate.</p>

<p>The 'not practicable to obtain prescription' condition requires that in determining whether to undertake a Continued Dispensing supply of a pharmaceutical benefit, the pharmacist must be satisfied that the person receiving the benefit has demonstrated that it is not practicable for them to obtain a prescription from their prescriber prior to the supply needing to occur. The usual prescriber must be unable to be contacted and/or is unable to provide an e-prescription or owing prescription.</p>

<p>For example, the patient may be unable to obtain an appointment (either face to face or by telehealth) to arrange a new prescription before their current supply runs out.</p>

<p>In addition, the pharmacist must also determine that other types of emergency supply options, such as an owing prescription, are not suitable for the circumstances.</p>

<p>The 'previous supply of pharmaceutical benefit' condition requires that, in undertaking a supply in accordance with the legislation, the pharmacist must be satisfied that the patient requesting the supply has previously been supplied that same pharmaceutical benefit on the basis of a prescription provided by a Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) prescriber. Under the Continued Dispensing expansion arrangements, the medicine must have been supplied to a patient within the last 3 months.</p>

<p>If the previous supply was via a PBS prescription, this would indicate to the pharmacist that the PBS prescriber had determined that the PBS prescribing restrictions (if any) had been satisfied.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The 'stability of therapy' condition requires the approved pharmacist to be satisfied that the person's therapy is stable. To establish stability of therapy, the pharmacist should consider&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
evidence of adherence to the prescribed therapy</li>
		<li>
persistence with the prescribed therapy, both in relation to the requested medicine and other medicines being taken by the patient</li>
		</ul>
<p>In establishing stability of therapy the pharmacist should also consider such things as the length of time that the patient has been taking the medicine being sought, and the absence of a hospital admission since last having the medicine prescribed.</p>

<p>A further prescription for the medicine following initial prescribing can also be of assistance in demonstrating stability of therapy. The Pharmaceutical Society of Australia (PSA) Guidelines will assist pharmacists in establishing the patient's stability of therapy.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The 'prior clinical review by Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) prescriber' condition requires that when establishing a patient's clinical history and their suitability for a Continued Dispensing supply, the pharmacist must determine that the patient has been taking the requested PBS medicine consistently for an uninterrupted period of time up to, and preceding, the request for a supply without a prescription.</p>

<p>The pharmacist must also be satisfied that since the patient began taking the medicine that they have received at least one clinical review by a PBS Prescriber that indicated an ongoing need for that medicine. For example, this could be demonstrated in the patient's dispensing history by consideration of the number of original prescriptions received.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>The 'prescription for last supply of pharmaceutical benefit' condition requires that the pharmacist must be satisfied that the patient's last supply of that medicine was via a prescription issued in accordance with the legislation. Without evidence that the previous supply was made via a PBS prescription, the pharmacist should not undertake a continued dispensing supply.</p>

<p>If the previous supply was a continued dispensing supply the pharmacist must not provide a subsequent consecutive Continued Dispensing supply. The pharmacist should instead consider other available emergency supply options.</p>

<p>In determining if this condition is met, the pharmacist must not rely solely on PBS Online information to determine if a Continued Dispensing supply is appropriate.</p>

<p>The Pharmaceutical Society of Australia (PSA) Guidelines provide further guidance for pharmacists on how to establish this information.</p>

Where the pharmacist identifies that the person has received a supply of the eligible pharmaceutical benefit as a continued dispensing supply within the previous 12 months they must not undertake a continued dispensing supply.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The 'declaration by patient supplied with pharmaceutical benefit' condition requires the patient receiving the Continued Dispensing supply, or their agent, to sign a declaration acknowledging that they have been supplied a pharmaceutical benefit without a Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) prescription.</p>

<p>This declaration will be made via the Consumer Declaration and Prescriber Notification Form.</p>

<p>The acknowledgement demonstrates that the patient, or their agent, understands that the supply has been undertaken without consultation from the patient's prescriber. Where a continued dispense supply occurs, the agent signing on behalf of the patient cannot be the pharmacist who undertook the continued dispensing supply. This acknowledgement forms part of the documentation required to be prepared and recorded.</p>

<p>The Consumer Declaration and Prescriber Notification Form are available in the pharmacy dispensing software.</p>

<p>The 'maximum quantity of supply' condition restricts a continued dispensing supply to a single PBS listed maximum quantity or number of units of the eligible pharmaceutical benefit. Pharmacists will not be able to provide repeat supplies under a continued dispensing supply. Under the expansion arrangements for Continued Dispensing, the supply quantity is restricted to the quantity listed on the PBS/RPBS schedule, regardless if a patient was previously prescribed an increased quantity. </p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Preparing_and_r">Preparing and recording information</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The 'preparing and recording information' condition requires the pharmacist to record any information gathered during the interaction with the patient that the pharmacist uses to substantiate their decision to undertake a Continued Dispensing supply.</p>

<p>For example, this could include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a record of the patient's history that captures information relating to stability of therapy</li>
		<li>
when the patient's last clinical review by a prescriber was undertaken</li>
		<li>
reasons why the patient's is unable to obtain a prescription, and</li>
		<li>
that their previous supply was via usual Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) supply mechanisms</li>
		</ul>
<p>This condition also requires the pharmacist to prepare a record of the Continued Dispensing supply to be provided to the patient's regular PBS prescriber (or practice where specific prescriber cannot be ascertained).</p>

<p>The Pharmaceutical Society of Australia (PSA) Guidelines will require that this communication (via the Consumer Declaration and Prescriber Notification form) occur within a 24 hour period of the continued dispensing supply occurring and&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
should include the person's name and address</li>
		<li>
date the medicine was supplied without a prescription</li>
		<li>
details of the medicine provided (including strength, form and instructions for use)</li>
		<li>
reason for the Continued Dispensing supply, and</li>
		<li>
a declaration by the person that they understood the supply was undertaken without consultation from their prescriber</li>
