<p>The Assessment worksheet is broken down into the following <strong>Sections</strong> to correspond with the sections completed by the applicant in the MIOC application&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Claim Details</li>
		<li>
Incident Details</li>
		<li>
Insured Person’s Details</li>
		<li>
Policy Details</li>
		<li>
Settlement and Plaintiff Costs</li>
		<li>
Defence Costs (and MIOC Expense Reconciliation)</li>
		<li>
Application Finalisation</li>
		<li>
Total Application Costs</li>
		</ul>
<p>At the top of the assessment worksheet, complete the sections for <strong>ARN</strong>, <strong>Insured</strong> <strong>person’s</strong> <strong>name</strong> (taken from the <strong>Insured person’s details</strong> section in MIOC) and <strong>Claim ID</strong> (taken from the <strong>Claim details</strong> section in MIOC).</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> for a subsequent application lodged against a migrated application, Assessing Officers will need to check the Insured Person’s name in HPE Content Manager (TRIM). </p>

<p>Assessing Officers can copy and paste information from MIOC into the document.</p>

<p>Follow the instructions and prompts noted on the assessment worksheet to complete the assessment process and determine an assessment outcome.</p>

<p>Complete all relevant questions of the assessment worksheet, selecting the <strong>Answer</strong> column checkbox that corresponds with the information provided in the MIOC application. Check that the evidence provided supports the information stated in the MIOC application. </p>

<p>MIOC determines what supporting evidence or documents are required based on the applicant’s answers to the questions.</p>

<p>All supporting documents are uploaded by the applicant in MIOC.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Select <strong>Supporting documents</strong> from the drop down menu at the top of the screen. This will take you to the <strong>Supporting documents</strong> section in the application</li>
		<li>
Select <strong>Download</strong> beside the document you want to view and <strong>Open</strong></li>
		</ul>
<p>The applicant may have supplied more than 1 relevant document as evidence of the information provided, or the same document for different categories of evidence.</p>

<p>For each question on the worksheet, locate the supporting document in MIOC, note the pdf/word document details in the <strong>Supporting Evidence location</strong> column of the worksheet. Note any relevant comments and/or discrepancies in the <strong>Comments</strong> column of the worksheet, as guided by the prompts and instructions on the worksheet.</p>

<p><strong>Question 1&#58;</strong> is this an Initial application?</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Answer the question by checking the ‘Yes’ checkbox for an initial application and move to question 3, or ‘No’ for a subsequent application and complete Question 2</li>
		<li>
Where the application is a subsequent application with no changes from the initial application (as indicated in MIOC under <strong>Claim Details</strong>), check the ‘No’ checkbox at question 2. Confirm all details against the previous applications for questions 3 to 13, noting any discrepancies, and go to question 14</li>
		<li>
For an initial application, or a subsequent application where changes to the initial application have occurred, select the ‘Yes’ checkbox at question 2 and  complete Questions 3 to 26 </li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Questions 2 to 10&#58;</strong> For the <strong>Claim Details</strong>, <strong>Incident Details</strong> and <strong>Insured Person’s Details</strong> sections of the assessment worksheet, note the relevant information provided in the MIOC application on the assessment worksheet.</p>

<p>For example&#58; at Question 6, note the Date of Notification (DoN) in the <strong>Comments</strong> column of the worksheet, open the relevant supporting document provided in MIOC and locate the specific details relating to notification of the claim to the insurer. Record the document <strong>Filename</strong> and <strong>Page number/s</strong> in the <strong>Supporting evidence</strong> location column on the worksheet. Determine if the information provided in the MIOC application is correct and supported by the evidence provided. Note any relevant findings or discrepancies in the <strong>Comments</strong> column on the worksheet.</p>

<p><strong>Supporting Evidence&#58; </strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
The evidence of the insurer approving indemnity of the insured person can be in the form of a Claims Verification Form (CVF), contract of insurance/policy schedule or a letter or email from the insurer</li>
		<li>
The Date of Incident (DoI) can be identified from court documents, such as the Statement of Claim (SoC), Notice of Claim (NoC), or a letter from the member stating details of the claim</li>
		<li>
The Australian state, territory or external territory in which the incident took place can be identified from court documents or a letter from the member stating details of the claim</li>
		<li>
The DoN can be evidenced by date stamped correspondence from the insured person to the insurer, or by a telephone activity log evidencing verbal notification</li>
		<li>
The evidence that the insured person was a practitioner of an eligible medical practitioner, confirming the member’s specialisation, may be identified from court documents, or other supporting documents, such as the CVF or policy schedule</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Questions 11 to 17&#58;</strong> Check the appropriate checkboxes in the <strong>Answer</strong> column of the worksheet and note the relevant <strong>Policy Details</strong>, taken from the MIOC application, in the <strong>Comments</strong> column of the worksheet. Open the supporting document provided in MIOC. Check that the details provided in MIOC are supported by the evidence provided. Record the location of the supporting evidence on the worksheet and note any comments or discrepancies.</p>

<p>Check the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the policy date range covers the DoN</li>
		<li>
the retroactive date of the policy is prior to the DoI</li>
		<li>
the limit of the insurance for the claim</li>
		<li>
there are no special conditions or sublimits applicable to the claim</li>
		<li>
any policy deductibles have been deducted from the claim</li>

		<li>
Copy and paste the invoice information listed under <strong>Defence Costs</strong> details (under invoice date, invoice number, amount claimed and cost shared) from MIOC into the spreadsheet</li>
		<li>
Check that each defence cost being claimed is supported by the invoice or evidence provided and that the agency’s calculation of the total defence costs reconciles with the total defence costs stated in the MIOC application</li>
		<li>
When all invoices have been checked, copy the expense reconciliation information from the template to the end of the assessment worksheet under <strong>MIOC Expense</strong> <strong>Reconciliation</strong>. Select the relevant checkbox to indicate the invoices have not been claimed in a previous application or if it is an initial application and doesn’t apply</li>
		<li>
<p>Where a financial discrepancy is identified, provide relevant comments in ‘Additional Notes’ under <strong>Recommendation</strong> in the assessment worksheet. For example, if GST has been claimed in an invoice, the discrepancy may result in a letter under section 38 of the Medical Indemnity Act 2002 being sent to the applicant to clarify the discrepancy. </p></li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Questions 24 to 25&#58;</strong> Answer the <strong>Application Finalisation</strong> questions. If there is no evidence to the contrary, select the ‘No’ checkbox and note ‘No evidence to contradict answer’ in the <strong>Comments</strong> column.</p>

<p><strong>Question 26&#58;</strong> Check that the amount calculated at ‘Total amount claimed in this application’<strong> </strong>in MIOC reconciles with the MIOC Expense Reconciliation spreadsheet. Note the total amount and claimed amount in the <strong>Comments </strong>column on the assessment worksheet under <strong>Total Application Costs</strong>. </p>

<p>Note any issues, discrepancies or comments in the <strong>Additional Notes </strong>section of the worksheet.</p>
