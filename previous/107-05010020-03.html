<p><strong>Advance payments and debts</strong></p>

<p>Advance payments are repaid from a customer's ongoing payments. They do not become a debt unless&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer's entitlement ceases before the advance has been fully repaid, or</li>
		<li>
the level of advance repayment is insufficient to repay the advance in a reasonable time</li>
		</ul>
<p>It will become a debt where&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer's FTB reduces substantially</li>
		<li>
the customer's rate does not change for 2 consecutive fortnights, and</li>
		<li>
the repayment of the advance will take an unreasonable amount of time. Equal to or more than 2 years, or 731 days</li>
		</ul>
<p>To qualify for an advance payment, a customer must not owe money to the Commonwealth. This includes&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
money that is being recovered or may be recovered by withholdings from their Centrelink payments, and</li>
		<li>
some debts that have been <strong>temporarily</strong> written off</li>
		</ul>
<p>The Write-off (<strong>OPWO</strong>) screen will have the reason for the write.</p>

<p><strong>Temporary written off debts</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
For Social Security advances, if the customer has a debt temporarily written off they are not entitled to an advance payment. This includes those with <a href="../families/007-11010090-01.html">non-lodger debts temporarily written off under the separated couples rule</a></li>
		<li>
For FTB advances, if the customer has a debt temporarily written off they will not be entitled to an advance. The exception to this is where the debt is temporarily written off due to&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
an ex-partner non-lodger, or</li>
			<li>
bankruptcy</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Permanently written-off debt</strong></p>

<p>A debt permanently written off is no longer recoverable through deductions. The customer is entitled to an advance if they meet other qualifications.</p>

<p>The Debt Programme is unable to provide any advice about <a href="../payment-delivery/103-05040000-01.html">qualification for an advance</a>.</p>

<p>Customers can make a repayment to finalise the debt to be <a href="../payment-delivery/103-05040080-01.html">eligible for an advance</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Issuing an advance payment when the customer owes a balance of less than 5 cents</strong></p>

<p>This may cause automatic rejection of any advance application.</p>

<p>Override the rejection in the workflow if the balance is less than 5 cents&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The advance can be paid if other conditions are met. The override option does not apply to advances of&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
FTB</li>
			<li>
Special Employment Advance (SEA), or</li>
			<li>
Pharmaceutical Advance (PhA)</li>		</ul>
		<li>
The debt will be finalised when the outstanding rounded amount is withheld on the customer's next payday</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Compensation payer debts</strong></p>

<p>The insurer pays compensation payer debts. They do not disqualify a customer from an advance payment. The Advance Payment cluster cannot distinguish insurer debts from customer debts. It will reject advance payment applications if insurer debts are outstanding.</p>

<p>The Advance Payments workflow has an option to override rejections caused by insurer debts.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> there is no override option for FTB, SEA or PhA Advances. These cannot be granted if there is an outstanding debt.</p>

<p><strong>Repayment for an advance</strong></p>

<p>For information about accepting a cash repayment for an advance, see <a href="../payment-delivery/103-05040050-01.html">Lump sum repayment of advance payment</a>.</p>

<p>A pension customer can receive multiple <a href="../payment-delivery/103-05040070-01.html">advance payments</a>. This may result in several debts if the customer ceases to be entitled to any payments.</p>

<p><strong>External Collection Agents (ECA) - customer receives letter from a contracted ECA.</strong></p>

<p>Referral of a debt to a collection agency for recovery, <strong>will not</strong> affect the customer’s credit rating. Protection of customers’ personal information is private and secure.</p>

<p>When a debt is referred to an ECA, the <strong>Status</strong>&#58; field will display as <strong>'D - Collection Agent'</strong>.</p>

<p>The Collection Agent (<strong>OPMC)</strong> screen displays the name of the ECA handling the relevant debt. See External Collection Agents (ECA) - debt collection agencies, for contact details of ECAs contracted to the agency&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
ARL Collect Pty Ltd (ARL)</li>
		<li>
Milton Graham</li>
		<li>
Probe Operations (Probe)</li>
		</ul>
<p>When the customer has received a letter from the contracted ECAs, the following applies&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the customer <strong>wants to discuss the debt</strong>, refer them to the original account payable letter for phone contact details of the relevant team</li>
		<li>
If the <strong>customer is current</strong>, advise them withholdings will start automatically. The system will display the debt status as <strong>'Determined - Collection Agent</strong>' until the first withholding is deducted from their payment</li>
		<li>
Ensure withholdings have been coded on the Withholding Instruction (<strong>OPWH)</strong> screen. Record details on a <strong>DOC</strong>. See <a href="../debts/107-05020020-01.html">Procedures for arranging withholdings to recover debts</a></li>
		<li>
If the <strong>customer is not current</strong>, advise them to call the ECA phone number in the letter. If the customer insists on talking to the agency, contact the Debt Recovery Team</li>
		<li>
If the customer wants to request an explanation or apply for a formal review of the debt, see <a href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/109-02000000-03.html">Request for an explanation or application for a formal review</a></li>		</ul>

<p>Where the status of a debt is <strong>DMC</strong> on the Debt List (<strong>OPDL)</strong> screen, staff can vary the debt amount without a debt recall. An exception to this is debts with reason codes FRR, FRC, FRA or NLD.</p>

<p>The calculated debt amount can be adjusted using the Debt Amount (<strong>OPDA)</strong> screen.</p>

<p>Debts that are&#58;</p>

no longer recoverable, are recalled from the ECA with debt status <strong>RND</strong> (recall no debt)</li>
		<li>
fully recovered, are recalled from the ECA with debt status <strong>FIN</strong> (debt finalised)</li>

<p><strong>Internal reviews and pausing recovery during the process</strong></p>

<p>Customers can ask for a pause on recovery when they request an explanation or apply for a formal review of the debt decision. If the person has more than 1 debt, the pause only applies to the debt/s being explained or reviewed. This applies when the customer asks for&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
an explanation by a Subject Matter Expert (SME), or</li>
		<li>
a formal review by an Authorised Review Officer (ARO)</li>

<p>For more information see <a href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/109-04020000-03.html">Recovering debts pending review of decisions</a>.</p>

<p>This pause extends to a debt decision under external review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) (first review). If a debt decision has already had an AAT first review, recovery cannot be paused unless the agency is issued with a Stay Order by the AAT second review.

<p><strong>Prison</strong></p>

<p><strong>Imprisonment</strong></p>

<p>In most cases, recovery of debts are deferred while a customer is imprisoned. The exception is when a customer can continue to pay their debt.</p>

<p>A deferred debt appears on the Debt List (<strong>OPDL</strong>) with a status of <strong>D - Pend Rcvr Actn</strong></p>

<p>Services Australia data matches with state and territory corrections services to determine imprisonment and release. If a customer is matched, recovery of their debt/s will be temporarily written off or restarted automatically. For current customers, a compliance review is generated.</p>

<p>Action is needed when an incarcerated or recently released customer who has not been data matched correctly is identified&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the debt has not been written off, and should be&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
send an <strong>ACTDOC</strong> using the keywords '<strong>ACTDRU</strong>' and '<strong>PRISON</strong>' to Compliance and Debt Operations. See <a href="../debts/107-05010020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Q_to_Z_debt_rec_7">Item 7 in Table 6</a></li>
			<li>
The <strong>ACTDOC</strong> must request a temporary write off of the debt</li>
			<li>
Include details of the customer's incarceration, and release date if known</li>
			<li>
Prison Liaison Officers (PLO) and authorised Compliance Officers have the delegation to temporarily write off debts via the Debt Action script</li>		</ul>
		<li>
If the debt is referred to an External Collection Agent (ECA), PLO's can recall the debt using the Collection Agent (<strong>OPMC</strong>) screen before actioning the temporary write off</li>
		</ul>
<p>In most cases, imprisoned customers are not eligible for payments. See <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-12000000-01.html">Prison admission process and claims during incarceration</a></p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Prison release</strong></p>

<p>In most cases, upon release, customers are eligible for a further 28 day deferral of recovery. PLOs can use the Debt Action script to apply a temporary write-off using the code <strong>STH</strong>. This allows the customer to receive their full entitlement for 2 pay periods.</p>

<p>PLO's will advise the customer there are a number of options available to repay their debt. They can negotiate a preferred payment arrangement option. If a PLO is not available prior to release, the customer can access the Money You Owe option online or call Compliance and Debt Operations to organise repayment.</p>

<p>If a customer has had interest charged while imprisoned, a Debt Recovery officer can apply an exemption from interest charge for the period of imprisonment. This may not be available in all cases. See <a href="../debts/107-02030030-01.html">Viewing and updating Interest Charge (IC) via Financial Customer Care in Customer First</a> for how to apply an exemption.</p>

		<li>
have a debt, and</li>
		<li>
do not have an arrangement</li>
		</ul>
<p>Data matching with the Australian Tax Office (ATO) Taxpayer Records system identifies COIs.</p>

<p>When a COI lodges their tax return, the ATO may need to send some or all of their tax refund to repay a debt owed. This action is the 'tax garnishee process’.</p>

<p>Before referring to Compliance and Debt Operations, determine if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the tax refund was 'garnisheed' as part of the tax garnishee process, or</li>
		<li>
‘off-set' as part of the family assistance payment reconciliation process</li>

<p>Direct all enquiries about family assistance reconciliation off-sets to Families. See <a href="../families/007-11060000-01.html">Debt offsetting during family assistance reassessment, reconciliation and claim processing</a>.</p>

<p>To check if the tax refund was 'garnisheed'&#58;</p>

go to the History Summary (<strong>HS</strong>) screen and check a Tax Garnishee Notice (GNOTDMNTGR) letter has been sent</li>

<p>The action required depends if the debt has been fully recovered or partly recovered.</p>

<p><strong>Debt is fully recovered</strong></p>

<p>A fully recovered debt requires adjustment by Compliance and Debt Operations before waiver is completed. Send an <strong>ACTDOC</strong> to Compliance and Debt Operations - see <a href="../debts/107-05010020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Q_to_Z_debt_rec_7">Item 7 in Table 6</a></p>

adjust the debt by $0.01c on the Repayment History (<strong>OPRH)</strong> screen, and</li>
		<li>
refer the <strong>ACTDOC </strong>back to the requesting area to complete the waiver</li>
		</ul>
<p>This will allow the staff member to amend the debt on the Add Waiver (<strong>OPWAA)</strong> screen. Reverse the $0.01c adjustment before finalising the debt.</p>

<p><strong>Debt is partly recovered</strong></p>

<p>If the decision is to waive a partially recovered debt, code the waiver. There is no need to contact Compliance and Debt Operations.</p>

<p>If <strong>repayments</strong> were made towards the debt being waived the customer may be entitled to a refund if there are no other debts. See <a href="../debts/107-05010020-03.html#bp03_tbl_E_to_P_debt_rec_16">Item 16 in Table 4</a>.</p>
