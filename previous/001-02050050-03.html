<P><STRONG>Labour market's perception of age</STRONG></P>
<P>This factor recognises the labour market's perception of age as an employment barrier, for example a job seeker aged 50 years or more might expect to encounter reluctance or bias from some prospective employers concerning health issues.</P>
<P><STRONG>Young job seekers</STRONG></P>
<P>Data modelling undertaken by the Department of Education, Skills and Employment showed that female teenagers were found to face higher relative labour market disadvantage than male teenagers.</P>
<P>Barriers for young people are recognised and awarded points in other factors including:</P>

<DIV class=showcont>
<P>The issue of inadequate recent work experience is generally seen as representing a disadvantage in seeking employment.</P>
<P>This is a particular issue/barrier for:</P>
<UL>
<LI>women because they are more likely to have left the work force for some time to accommodate family responsibilities (or for other reasons)</LI>
<LI>ex-prisoners and school leavers who have not had an opportunity to form work habits</LI></UL>
<P>This question asks the job seeker to identify their <STRONG>main</STRONG> <STRONG>activity</STRONG> over the last 2 years.</P>
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> job seekers are asked to identify their main activity in the 2 years preceding their current JSCI interview. The main activity must be recorded irrespective of whether it occurred in Australia or overseas. The main activity should be the activity that has occupied the greatest amount of time, not necessarily the most recent activity.</P>
<P>This factor recognises the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the impact on work performance of long periods of absence from the workforce</LI>
<LI>the lack of employer networks/contacts and loss of labour market attachment</LI>
<LI>the reluctance of prospective employers to employ job seekers who may be under-skilled or without appropriate experience</LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>Newly Arrived Migrants</STRONG></P>
<P>Newly arrived migrants may register as job seekers (if they are unemployed) with Services Australia from the time they arrive in Australia.</P>
<P>These job seekers are eligible to volunteer into provider services. They are not eligible for income support or fully eligible services from jobactive organisations during the recently arrived residents 2 year waiting period.</P>
<P>If these migrants become eligible for income support and/or fully eligible for services from Employment Services Providers, their job seeker registration with Services Australia remains current.</P></DIV>

<DIV class=showcont>
<P>This factor recognises the job seeker's highest level of educational attainment. Job seekers with greater levels of educational attainment generally have a greater advantage in the labour market.</P>
<P>Weightings allocated for Education Attainment are based on the responses to the questions asked on the <STRONG>Education</STRONG> page in the Online Participation Workflow (OPW) and the Looking For Work workflow.</P>
<P>The level of educational attainment is established through 2 questions relating to:</P>
<UL>
<LI>level of primary or secondary school education reached and</LI>
<LI>further education such as accredited certificates, diplomas, degrees and post graduate study</LI></UL>
<P>The available responses to select from in the drop down box are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Year 12/13 or equivalent (for example, Form 6 or Matriculation)</LI>
<LI>Year 11 or equivalent (for example, Form 5)</LI>
<LI>Year 10 or equivalent (for example, Form 4)</LI>
<LI>completed primary school but less than Year 10 or equivalent</LI>
<LI>special school/special support unit in school or equivalent</LI>
<LI>primary school or less or equivalent</LI>
<LI>did not go to school</LI></UL>
<P>The next question is have you <STRONG>completed</STRONG> any other qualification(s)? If the answer is '<STRONG>Yes</STRONG>', a further question is asked:</P>
<P>What are they? What qualification(s) have you completed?</P>
<UL>
<LI>Doctoral Degree or equivalent</LI>
<LI>Masters Degree or equivalent</LI>
<LI>Bachelor Degree or equivalent</LI>
<LI>Associate Diploma, Advanced Diploma, Associate Degree or equivalent</LI>
<LI>Tradesperson's qualifications (Certificate III or IV or equivalent)</LI>
<LI>Other non-trade Vocational Education and Training (Certificate II)</LI>
<LI>Other non-trade Vocational Education and Training Certificate III or IV</LI>
<LI>Vocational Education and Training Centre Certificate I or other Industry-specific licence or ticket</LI>
<LI>Course run by private or community organisation</LI>
<LI>TAFE qualifications at certificate level include qualifications recognised at Certificates I, II, III or IV in the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) such as Vocational Education and Training Certificate I completed at school or since leaving school</LI></UL>
<P>Associate Diplomas, Diplomas and Advanced Diplomas recognised in the AQF. Generally a minimum of 2 years full-time study is required to complete these qualifications, however it is not always the case.</P>
<P>Introduction of the AQF was phased in from 1995. Job seekers who completed a qualification prior to that date may need to match their qualification to 1 of the responses listed.</P>
<P>Responses should include education completed in Australia or the Australian equivalent of educational qualifications gained overseas.</P></DIV>

<DIV class=showcont>
<P>This factor recognises the significant difference in employability between job seekers with work qualifications and those without.</P>
<P>Points allocated for vocational qualifications are based on responses to questions on the <STRONG>Education</STRONG> page in the Online Participation Workflow (OPW) and the Looking for Work workflow.</P>
<P>These questions gather information about the job seeker's work qualifications and whether these qualifications are relevant in the labour market. They can also relate to a formal qualification which allows a person to work in a specific occupation.</P>
<P>The purpose of these questions is to identify recognised qualifications which offer an advantage to the job seeker in obtaining employment. Where a job seeker has 2 or more qualifications they should respond to the question with details of the qualification which provides the greatest employment advantage.</P>
<P><STRONG>What is considered vocational?</STRONG></P>
<P>Services Australia staff should generally accept the job seeker's own judgement about the vocational nature of their qualification, as they generally know if their qualification is required for a specific job. If they are unsure about the vocational nature of a particular qualification, the following examples should be used as a guide:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the added value of educational qualifications which have a vocational orientation (for example, a nursing or architecture degree compared to a general arts degree or a degree in philosophy)</LI>
<LI>trade qualifications required for particular occupations (for example, plumbing and electrical trade certificates)</LI>
<LI>other non-educational qualifications required for particular occupations for example:</LI>
<LI>special licences (including bus, truck and fork-lift), this does not include a standard car or motorcycle driver's licence as a formal qualification</LI>
<LI>tickets (for example, seaman's ticket) and other technical qualifications</LI>
<LI>Occupational Health and Safety (OH&amp;S), tickets should not be classified as vocational or work qualifications</LI>
<LI>short courses that are formally accredited or generally recognised by employers and constitute the basic prerequisites for entry to a particular occupation</LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>Unusable Qualifications</STRONG></P>
<P>If the job seeker answers 'Yes' to having a vocational qualification, they are next asked if there is some reason which prevents them using the qualification or working in the industry which recognises it.</P>
<P>There are 5 responses to why a job seeker cannot still use their qualification. Points are allocated if the job seeker falls into any of these categories. Again, Services Australia staff should rely on the job seeker's own understanding of their circumstances. If they require any advice, the Service Officer may need to make a judgement based on a discussion with the job seeker and their knowledge of local employment conditions.</P>
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> keep in mind that job seekers with overseas qualifications may require additional assistance as some overseas qualifications are not recognised in Australia.</P></DIV>

<DIV class=showcont>
<P>English Proficiency factor recognises the problems that may be faced by job seekers who have difficulty with spoken and/or written English.</P>
<P>Services Australia does not purchase professional assessments for job seekers who exhibit difficulty speaking, reading or writing English. For the JSCI, a job seeker's English proficiency is based on their own assessment of language and literacy skills in conjunction with the observations of the interviewing officer.</P>
<P>The JSCI uses a combination of the information recorded to allocate points for English proficiency levels.</P>
<P>The level of English skill recorded for the JSCI should be discussed with the job seeker. The job seeker must agree with any assessment of their English skill before it is recorded. If the job seeker claims good literacy, but the interviewing officer believes the person has minimal literacy skills, the job seeker's opinion must be recorded, unless an alternative is agreed. Where the Service Officer considers that the job seeker may benefit from Skills for Education and Employment (SEE) despite their responses to the English proficiency questions, the Service Officer may refer the job seeker to SEE after discussion of the benefits with the job seeker.</P>
<P>Job seekers who are to be referred to SEE must be referred for an ESAt at the same time.</P>
<P><STRONG>Language and literacy difficulties for sight impaired job seekers</STRONG></P>
<P>Some sign language users and sight impaired job seekers may have language and literacy difficulties, especially in the work place. Where these job seekers self-identify as having language and literacy difficulties, points are allocated for their response to this question.</P>
<P>The JSCI is also populated with information on whether the job seeker has attended any English language courses within the last 6 months.</P>
<P><STRONG>Remote job seekers</STRONG></P>
<P>Job seekers living in remote locations may lodge forms by mail or register over the phone. This is the least reliable situation to judge a job seeker's English language skills. Telephone interviews should only be used when it is impractical for the job seeker to attend an interview.</P>
<P>Language and literacy levels should be reassessed at the first opportunity for a face-to-face interview. In a telephone interview, the job seeker's ability to communicate effectively over the phone may provide the interviewing officer with an opinion of their ability to speak and understand English.</P>
<P>Record the job seeker's Read English and Write English responses as 'Very Limited' if the job seeker responds 'yes' to any question about requiring help to complete the form or having difficulty with reading or writing.</P>
<P><STRONG>JSCI interviews should occur face-to-face wherever possible.</STRONG></P>
<P>This increases the chance of Services Australia staff detecting a language or literacy barrier which could otherwise remain hidden. People with literacy barriers frequently make excuses when called upon to read or fill in a form. Typical excuses are: 'I forgot my glasses', 'my wrist is sore', 'I forgot my pen' or 'I was in a hurry'.</P>
<P>By observing and listening carefully to the job seeker during the interview, the interviewing officer can form an opinion on the job seeker's command of spoken English. See <A href="../job-seekers/001-02090010-01.html">Eligibility for Skills for Education and Employment (SEE)</A>.</P></DIV>

<P>Information for this factor is populated from information held in the Centrelink system. No questions are needed to be asked during the JSCI interview for this factor.</P>
<P>When explaining the job seeker's option to provide this information, it should be explained that the more information the job seeker provides, the better it is to determine the job seeker's employment needs.</P>
<P>People coming to Australia may face any number of difficulties entering the job market, including:</P>
<UL>
<LI>lack of knowledge about, and attachment to, the Australian labour market</LI>
<LI>lack of networks and/or contacts within the Australian labour market</LI>
<LI>cultural differences between their country of origin and Australia</LI></UL>
<P>The unemployment rates, in Australia, of job seekers from various countries have been examined to see which countries of origin result in the greatest disadvantage in the labour market. The points allocated reflect the employment experience of migrants from different countries in the Australian labour market.</P></DIV>

<P>The question relating to this factor is on the <STRONG>Personal Details</STRONG> page in the Online Participation Workflow (OPW) and the Looking For Work workflow. This question is voluntary.</P>
<P>Weightings allocated to Indigenous status recognise the employment disadvantage faced by Indigenous Australians.</P>
<P>Australian born job seekers only are asked whether they identify as an Aboriginal Australian or a Torres Strait Islander, and if they do, are they Aboriginal or a Torres Strait Islander. Job seekers can select more than 1 answer or they can choose not to answer.</P>
<P>The Privacy Protocol regarding the collection of personal information of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people issued by the Information Commissioner clarifies the rules relating to the collection of personal information, set out in the Privacy ACT 1988, regarding Indigenous status. Culturally sensitive information should only be asked for on a voluntary basis unless it is absolutely essential for agencies statutory functions. Questions about a person's Indigenous status should only be asked where the job seeker has the option of not responding. The option, 'do not wish to answer' is included to ensure a job seeker does not provide information which they are not required to or do not wish to provide.</P>
<P><STRONG>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people</STRONG></P>
<P>Disadvantages faced are related to:</P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>standards of health:</STRONG> Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have a considerably lower standard of general health compared with other Australians</LI>
<LI><STRONG>cultural requirements:</STRONG> this includes elements such as observance of cultural occasions and practices and the need for absences from employment to attend culturally significant occasions. These requirements can vary depending on lifestyle and may be more significant to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living traditional or semi-traditional lifestyles and those in recognised Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities</LI>
<LI><STRONG>cross cultural norms:</STRONG> this concerns the way Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people relate to the broader community and vice versa. It may include issues such as self confidence, self esteem and motivation</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Socio-economic factors:</STRONG> the factors that may contribute to unemployment include high levels of incarceration, homelessness, lack of adequate housing or substandard housing such as lack of running water, electricity and waste disposal</LI>
<LI><STRONG>income support history:</STRONG> a history of periods on income support indicates the difficulty of securing and maintaining work</LI>
<LI><STRONG>living a traditional, semi traditional or camp lifestyle:</STRONG> the barrier that might arise from not being in close contact with the regular labour market is especially prominent for this group</LI>
<LI><STRONG>small community social dynamic:</STRONG> where anonymity is not possible, and most residents know much about other residents can be a disadvantage</LI>
<LI><STRONG>access to employment opportunities:</STRONG> Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people may be disadvantaged due to a remote location and distance from a provider</LI></UL></DIV>

<DIV class=showcont>
<P>This factor recognises the disadvantages faced by Indigenous job seekers in rural and remote locations, where there is limited access to a labour market.</P>
<P>Disadvantage may also arise from a small community social dynamic, where anonymity is not possible, and most residents know much about other residents. In these circumstances, individuals in small communities can be regarded negatively by family and group association rather than considered on their merits.</P>
<P>The labour market disadvantage from cultural requirements can vary depending on lifestyle and may be more significant to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living traditional or semi-traditional lifestyles and those in recognised Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, than for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living in urban centres.</P>
<P>Furthermore, standard labour market measures are likely to underestimate the labour market disadvantage potentially faced by Indigenous job seekers in various parts of Australia.</P></DIV>

<P>This factor reflects the disadvantage of living in a particular geographic location. The local economy, unemployment rate and employment growth will determine the allocation of points for particular locations. Points for this factor are based on the job seeker's residential post code.</P>
<P>The job seeker's residential address is used in preference to the job seeker's postal address. The postal address may not reflect the actual location where the job seeker resides. This is particularly important in regional and remote locations where, for example, a remote community may use a central post office box address in a city or town for all correspondence to the community.</P>
<P>If a job seeker does not have a residential address recorded, the postal address postcode is used to determine the geographical location. It is automatically updated when a JSCI is reapplied either as part of a batch update, refresh or reapplication.</P></DIV>

<P>The questions of the 'Access to Transport' factor are to identify job seekers who may have difficulty attending interviews and/or travelling to and from work on a regular basis. These questions are displayed on the <STRONG>Transport</STRONG> page in the Online Participation Workflow (OPW) and the Looking for Work workflow.</P>
<P>The question '<STRONG>Do you have a valid driver's licence?</STRONG>' is to find out whether the job seeker <STRONG>has a valid driver's licence</STRONG>. Valid means that the driver's licence is paid for and not cancelled or suspended.</P>
<P>Some job seekers will have a learner driver's licence (or its equivalent) for a car. These job seekers should answer 'No' to this question.</P>
<P>Some job seekers will have a learner driver's licence (or its equivalent) for a motorcycle. These job seekers should answer 'Yes' to this question providing the learner driver's licence is valid.</P>
<P>'<STRONG>Do you have your own car or motorcycle that you can use to travel to and from work?</STRONG> This question applies to job seekers who answered 'Yes' to having a valid driver's licence. The purpose of this question is to find out whether or not the job seeker <STRONG>owns a car or motorcycle that he/she can use to travel to and from work</STRONG>.</P>
<P>The job seeker may not necessarily <STRONG>own</STRONG> the car or motorcycle. A job seeker may have unrestricted access to a car or motorcycle that he/she can use to travel to and from work but does not own the car or motorcycle. For example, a parent or relative may have loaned a car to the job seeker for him/her to use for an extended period of time. If this is the case, the job seeker should answer '<STRONG>Yes</STRONG>' to this question.</P>
<P>If the job seeker answers '<STRONG>No</STRONG>', then the question <STRONG>What can you use to travel to and from work?</STRONG> will be displayed. This question applies to all job seekers who do not have a valid driver's licence or do not have their own car or motorcycle that they can use to travel to and from work. The purpose of this question is to find out <STRONG>what sort of transport</STRONG> job seekers are able to use <STRONG>to travel to and from work</STRONG> when they do not own a car or motorcycle that they can use to travel to and from work.</P>
<P>Public transport also includes train, ferry or tram.</P>
<P>The job seeker should have sufficient or adequate access to these forms of transport. For example, if the job seeker can only access 'Other private transport' on weekends then another response should be selected. Similarly if they can only access public transport to reach limited locations then a more suitable response should be selected.</P></DIV>

<DIV class=showcont>
<P>Points allocated for contactability are based on a job seeker's access to a telephone.</P>
<P>A job seeker's chances of finding employment are directly related to their ability to make contact with, and be contacted by, both potential employers and Employment Services Providers.</P>
<P>Job seekers are considered 'contactable by phone' where they have at least 1 of the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>a home telephone in their own or someone else's name at their place of residence (including a telephone with a silent or unlisted number)</LI>
<LI>a mobile telephone</LI></UL>
<P>No questions are asked in the JSCI under this factor and the information is sourced from data already recorded on the Telephone Detail (<STRONG>TD</STRONG>) screen in the system. Service Officers should ensure the information is up to date during contact with the customer.</P>
<P><STRONG>Access to Telephone Messages</STRONG></P>
<P>Access to telephone messages from a neighbour's, friends or family member's phone is considered a barrier to employment. A job seeker is not considered contactable by phone, if this is the extent of the contact available.</P>
<P>Similarly, if the job seeker's only telephone access is a work telephone, this is not considered a reliable contact and the job seeker should not be recorded as being contactable by phone.</P></DIV>

<P>The questions relating to this factor are on the <STRONG>Medical conditions</STRONG> page in the Online Participation Workflow (OPW) and the Looking for Work workflow. This question is voluntary.</P>
<P>This question is included even though this information may have been collected from job seekers as part of their claim for income support or as part of their earlier registration as a job seeker.</P>
<P>This factor takes account of any disability or medical condition or workplace support needs that a job seeker has, acknowledging that these do impact on a job seeker's ability to obtain and maintain employment.</P>
<P>The points allocated for this factor are derived from the job seeker's responses to the JSCI questionnaire, supplemented by information contained in the JCA report where a JCA takes place.</P>
<P>To record the customer's medical condition in OPW, go to the <STRONG>Search for Medical Conditions</STRONG> page.</P>
<UL>
<LI>enter the code (from the list of conditions) in the <STRONG>Medical Conditions</STRONG> field, or</LI>
<LI>use the <STRONG>Medical Conditions text</STRONG> field to run a keyword search:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>typing text will only return conditions that start with the text provided</LI>
<LI>to search for a specific phrase or medical condition, place an asterisk (*) at the start and end of the search text to return matches with those letters in that order</LI></UL>
<LI>to return to the full list of conditions, click <STRONG>Clear</STRONG> and <STRONG>Search</STRONG></LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>Ability to work or look for work</STRONG></P>
<P>Service Officers must take care that they only record information about these conditions if they affect the job seeker's ability to work or look for work.</P>
<P>Some job seekers may disclose a disability that does not impact on their ability to work or to find work, for example a job seeker who wears glasses may record this as a disability, but during the interview it becomes clear that their eyesight has never represented a barrier to employment.</P>
<P>In these cases, Services Australia staff should record the response as 'No' to having any disabilities, medical conditions or addictions that affect their ability to work. If the responses have already been recorded, the response must be corrected and if in hard copy, must be initialled by the job seeker. No points will be awarded for conditions that do not impact on the job seeker's ability to work or to find work. Care also needs to be taken if a job seeker has <A href="../job-seekers/001-02050040-01.html">a short term illness/capacity</A>.</P>
<P><STRONG>Privacy issues</STRONG></P>
<P>The provisions of the Privacy Act 1998 allow for a job seeker to have a choice as to whether they provide personal information such as details of medical conditions. Consequently, the option 'Do not wish to answer' is included to provide job seekers with a choice of whether or not to provide this information.</P>
<P>There is no compulsion to provide details of any disclosed conditions, however, the job seeker should be advised that the more information they provide about any possible barriers to employment, the better Services Australia is able to determine the most appropriate assistance for them.</P>
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> at all times Services Australia must maintain the privacy of job seekers with communicable diseases and may only disclose this information to the Department of Education, Skills and Employment with the job seeker's consent or in accordance with law.</P>
<P>The JSCI may indicate that a job seeker who has a disability or medical condition be referred for an Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) referral). If referral for an ESAt is flagged, see <A href="../people-with-disability/008-03180010-01.html">Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) referral</A>.</P>
<P>The Department of Education, Skills and Employment and the Department of Social Services have developed a common assessment streaming process to ensure that job seekers with a disability are referred to the assistance which best meets their needs. Identified job seekers may be referred to Department of Education, Skills and Employment funded employment assistance or Department of Social Services disability employment services.</P></DIV>

<P>This information is asked on the <STRONG>Accommodation</STRONG> page in the Online Participation Workflow (OPW) and the Looking for Work workflow.</P>
<P>This question seeks to identify job seekers who are homeless or living in unstable or insecure accommodation. Weightings allocated for Stability of Residence recognise that job seekers living in unstable accommodation may experience a range of disadvantages.</P>
<P><STRONG>Short Stays in Caravan parks/Temporarily staying with friends</STRONG></P>
<P>The job seeker should decide whether the stay is to be a temporary or more permanent arrangement. If the job seeker considers their stay to be temporary, then the job seeker should answer 'yes' to the question.</P>
<P><STRONG>Young job seekers and insecure accommodation</STRONG></P>
<P>Young homeless job seekers often lead 'transient' lifestyles. However research shows that most do not remain homeless for extended periods of time.</P>
<P>The young people in this group include those who are leaving the state care and protection system. They may spend time living on the street before establishing a more stable home life. As well as the impact of their accommodation on their employability, there are a number of other related issues recognised by other JSCI factors.</P>
<P><STRONG>Older Homeless Job Seekers</STRONG></P>
<P>The circumstances which place these job seekers in insecure accommodation are often quite different to those faced by younger job seekers. Many older job seekers are likely to live in unstable accommodation for much longer periods of time.</P>
<P>Some members of this group may have lost touch with the mainstream community. They may not have the ability or desire to return to living within the mainstream community. These job seekers may be characterised by particular circumstances and employment barriers.</P>
<P><STRONG>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Job seekers</STRONG></P>

<P>This factor takes account of the labour market disadvantages faced by job seekers with particular living arrangements including people who live alone, lone parents caring for children and partnered parents with children aged younger than 6 years.</P>
<P>This information is asked on the <STRONG>Accommodation</STRONG> page in the Online Participation Workflow (OPW) and the Looking For Work workflow.</P>
<P>The Australian Bureau of Statistics has conducted a study which examined the impact of family status on a person's likelihood of long term unemployment. They found a significant relationship between family status and long term unemployment. The study suggested that people with responsibility for others (financial or otherwise), who gain personal support from others, are more likely to maintain job search efforts than those without this commitment and support.</P>
<P><STRONG>Living with Others or Living Alone</STRONG></P>
<P>Job seekers may seek guidance about which of the categories they fall into, particularly the 'Living with others, not family', and 'Lives alone'. They should consider the level of support they derive from the household where they live. A job seeker living in a share house with a group of close friends who provide considerable support and encouragement should be considered to be 'living with others'. However a job seeker living in share accommodation with people not well known to him or her, and who do not provide any emotional support, may be isolated and should be considered to live alone. Similarly, a job seeker living in a boarding house or hostel without a support network should be considered to be living alone.</P>
<P><STRONG>Family Members</STRONG></P>
<P>Adopted or foster children are considered sons or daughters for JSCI purposes. Children are considered dependants if they are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>under 15 years</LI>
<LI>15 - 19 years at secondary school</LI>
<LI>15 - 24 years attending tertiary education institution</LI></UL>
<P>Children outside these categories (such as adult children) are considered 'other family members'. Grandparents are also considered 'other family members'.</P></DIV>

<P>This information is asked on the <STRONG>Other Personal Factors</STRONG> page in the Online Participation Workflow (OPW) and the Looking for Work workflow. This is a voluntary question.</P>
<P>Points allocated for this factor recognise the barriers faced by ex-offenders.</P>
<P>The Privacy Act 1988 does not directly govern the collection of information about past convictions. However the Information Commissioner has issued guidelines, based on the conviction provisions of the Crimes Act 1914, as to when this information should be collected and how it should be collected. It is advisable that questions of this nature are only asked where the job seeker has the option of not responding.</P>
<P>The option 'Do not wish to answer' is included to ensure a job seeker does not provide information which they are not required or do not want to provide.</P>
<P>It is important to inform the job seeker that Services Australia is not seeking information about the nature of their offence, but only if they have a criminal conviction, and whether a custodial sentence was imposed.</P>
<P>The job seeker must be advised that the more information they provide about any possible barrier to employment, the better Services Australia is able to determine the most appropriate assistance for the job seeker. The job seeker should be assured that this information is confidential. It is not released to employers, or anybody else, without the job seeker's express permission. While job seekers should understand why this question is asked, they should not feel pressured to release this information or to discuss it.</P>
<P><STRONG>Custodial Sentences</STRONG></P>
<P>There are a variety of sentencing options available to the courts which involve a restriction on the individual's freedom. Job seekers may be unsure if the sentence they have served represents a custodial sentence. View the guide to identifying custodial sentences.</P>
<P><STRONG>Non-Custodial Sentences</STRONG></P>
<P>These convictions should be recorded as criminal offence with no custodial sentence served.</P>
<P>However Judges and magistrates can, in some circumstances, convict and fine an individual, and order that the conviction not be recorded against the individual. If the job seeker reports that this is the case, a conviction should not be recorded for the job seeker for this question.</P>
<P>A person placed on a good behaviour bond should only be recorded as a response if a conviction was recorded.</P></DIV>

<P>This factor recognises that certain personal characteristics, either individually or collectively, may impose further disadvantage on job seekers when seeking employment. These personal characteristics may include:</P>

<LI>problems with temper or violence</LI>
<LI>experienced or experiencing family and domestic violence</LI>
