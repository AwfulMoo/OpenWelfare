<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Determining_CCS">Determining CCS entitlement</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The rate of CCS a customer is entitled to receive is determined by a number of factors&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The combined family income </li>
		<li>
If the family have more than one child aged 5 or under</li>
		<li>
The level of activity of the customer (and partner, if they have one) and any exemptions in place</li>
		<li>
The age of the child and the type of child care service they attend</li>
		</ul>
<p>CCS entitlement is calculated as a CCS percentage and the number of hours per fortnight a customer is able to receive a subsidy for.</p>

<p>In general terms, the combined family income determines the CCS percentage. Families who have more than one CCS eligible child aged 5 or under can also receive a higher CCS percentage for one or more of their children. This is known as Higher CCS or multiple child subsidy. </p>

<p>The number of subsidised hours a customer is entitled to is determined by the amount and type of recognised activity the customer (and partner, if they have one) participate in each fortnight. Other factors can affect the number of CCS hours a customer can receive, such as&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
if they are caring for an adult or a child with a disability, or </li>
		<li>
if an exemption is in place</li>
		</ul>
<p>Child Care Subsidy is paid directly to a child care service to reduce the out of pocket child care costs a family pays. Any changes to CCS entitlement will impact&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the amount of CCS Services Australia pays the child care service, and </li>
		<li>
the family’s out of pocket child care fees</li>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_CCS_Changes_fro">CCS Changes from 10 July 2023</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>From 10 July 2023, CCS increased which means most families using child care now get more subsidy. </p>

<p>The maximum amount of CCS increased from 85% to 90% for families earning below the CCS low income threshold (CCS LIT).</p>

<p>Families earning above the CCS LIT and below the CCS higher income threshold (CCS HIT) may get a subsidy starting from 90%. The maximum CCS percentage of 90% decreases by 1% for each $5,000 of income they earn above the CCS LIT.</p>

<p>The income limit for families to be entitled to CCS (CCS HIT) has increased. </p>

<p>Families with income below the higher CCS higher income threshold (HCCS HIT) and more than one child aged 5 or under can still get a higher rate of CCS for one or more of their children. From 10 July 2023, the rates for standard rate children and higher rate children will be calculated using separate income tests.</p>

<p>See the <a href="../families/007-20090908-05.html">Resources</a> page for a graph showing the relationship between standard and higher CCS rates, and the effect of family income on the CCS percentage.</p>

<p>See <a href="../families/007-17103113-01.html">Entitlement for Child Care Subsidy (CCS) for more information about how CCS percentages are calculated</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Activity test changes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children</strong></p>

<p>From 10 July 2023, CCS introduced a base level of 36 hours per fortnight for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. For the 2023-2024 CCS year, this will be applied using a CCS rate override via exceptional circumstance coding.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> it is voluntary for families to advise they are caring for an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander child. Evidence is not required and not to be requested under circumstance.</p>

<p>Families may be entitled to more than the base level of 36 hours per fortnight based on their hours of recognised activity or other circumstances.</p>

<p>An income estimate is one of the main factors that determines a customer's CCS percentage. All CCS customers must provide an income estimate, which should reflect their circumstances for the year for themselves and their partner (if they have one).</p>

<p>The standard CCS percentage payable is on a sliding scale from 90% to 0% depending on the <a href="../families/007-17103114-01.html">combined family income</a>. Any changes to the combined family income could change the CCS percentage which will also impact the customer's out of pocket expenses and child care fees they pay.</p>

<p>For more information on calculating CCS entitlement, see <a href="../families/007-17103113-01.html">Entitlement to Child Care Subsidy (CCS)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> changes to a families combined income to above the lower income threshold can impact the number of subsidised hours of child care. See <a href="../families/007-17103115-03.html">Automatic Activity test results</a>.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>From 7 March 2022, a higher rate of CCS (Multiple Child Subsidy) was introduced for families with more than one CCS eligible child aged 5 or under.</p>

<p>Families with more than one CCS eligible child in care aged 5 or under may get a higher subsidy for one or more of their children.</p>

<p>The <strong>Entitlement </strong>table in Customer Summary will&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
identify any children attracting the higher rate of CCS, and</li>
		<li>
display any percentage increases</li>
		</ul>
<p>The ‘standard rate child’ is usually the eldest CCS eligible child aged 5 or under. This child will get the Standard CCS rate.</p>

<p>The ‘higher rate child’ is any CCS eligible child in the family younger than the standard rate child. This child will get the Higher CCS rate (Multiple Child Subsidy).</p>

<p>From 10 July 2023, CCS rates for standard rate children and higher rate children are calculated using two separate income tests.  As a result, any income estimate updates will impact standard and higher rate child/ren differently. </p>

<p>The maximum CCS rate for a higher rate child is 95%. Higher rate children can get a CCS percentage between 95% and 50%, depending on combined family income.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>From 11 July 2022, if a child has not used child care (including allowable absences) at least once in the previous 26 week period, they will not be eligible for CCS. This is known as the '<strong>26 week rule</strong>'.</p>

<p>Where a child's CCS is cancelled due to the 26 week rule, the cancellation will apply from the CCS Monday following the 26th week. In some circumstances, it may be more than 26 weeks. The cancellation cannot be retrospectively applied and where a child is the last CCS eligible child of a customer, the customers CCS will cancel.</p>

<p>If a family is entitled to Higher CCS for one or more of their children and one of their children is cancelled because of the 26 week rule&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
their CCS entitlement will be reassessed, and</li>

<p>Additional Child Care Subsidy (ACCS) provides extra fee assistance to families and children who are genuinely disadvantaged and facing barriers in accessing affordable child care.</p>

<p>A customer's ACCS being granted or recently ceasing will have a noticeable effect on the out of pocket expenses they will be charged by their child care providers.</p>

<p>The <a href="../families/007-20090908-03.html">Process</a> tab contains steps on how to check ACCS status, rates and relevant dates.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>CCS can be paid for up to 42 approved absence days (or up to 62 days for the 2019/20 year) for each child for any reason. The absence days per financial year relates to each child, not to each individual claimant. If the customer is reporting an increase in out of pocket child care fees, check that the absences for the relevant child/children have not been exhausted.</p>

<p>If a customer is experiencing unusual hardship or extreme circumstances, they can ask for increased CCS entitlement by way of an Exceptional Circumstances determination.</p>

<p>For customers on both CCS and ACCS, an Exceptional Circumstances determination can allow access to more subsidised hours.</p>

<p>For ACCS customers, a percentage increase can also be requested. Staff should check whether EXC determination has come to an end.</p>
