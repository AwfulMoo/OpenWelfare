<p>Young people who want to volunteer can directly register with their local TtW provider.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when registering a young person who wants to volunteer, on the <strong>Job Seeker Registration</strong> screen, select the <strong>volunteer</strong> box. This will bypass the Job Seeker Snapshot and flow through directly to the Online Diary</p>

<p>For job seekers with mutual obligation requirements&#58;</p>

<p>Job seekers receiving an income support payment and already participating with Workforce Australia, should be advised to discuss participating in TtW with their provider.</p>

<p>The <a href="../job-seekers/001-02050000-01.html">Job Seeker Snapshot</a> must be completed for all job seekers with mutual obligation requirements. It is not required for volunteers.</p>

<p>The Department of Education, Skills and Employment system will identify whether the job seeker is eligible for a TtW referral. If one exists locally, a TtW provider will be displayed in the <a href="../job-seekers/001-02060020-01.html">Online Diary</a> to allow referral.</p>

<p>After the completion of the initial Job Seeker Snapshot, the agency is not required to undertake a Job Seeker Snapshot change of circumstances review. Any change of circumstance is to be completed by the TtW provider.</p>

<p><strong>Job Seeker Snapshot referral outcomes</strong></p>

<p>For TtW job seekers with mutual obligation requirements, the following Job Seeker Snapshot outcomes apply&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Workforce Australia employment services and ESL - eligible job seekers must be referred to TtW if a provider is available in the Employment Region. This will be identified in the Online Diary</li>
		<li>
Indigenous job seekers aged 15 - 24 years - must be referred to TtW if a provider is available in the Employment Region. This will be identified in the Online Diary</li>
		<li>
Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) - job seekers should be referred to an ESAt if one is triggered. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> where the job seeker has not commenced in the TtW program, an ESAt referral recommendation has priority. Job seekers who have commenced and are participating in the TtW where an ESAt flags for non-medical reasons are not required to attend or be referred for an ESAt. Noting where the Job Seeker Snapshot triggers a medical ESAt and the job seeker has not previously been assessed for a Partial Capacity to Work (PCW) the job seeker should be referred to an ESAt once medical evidence is provided. An ESAt referral has priority over TtW</li>
		<li>
A TtW referral can be actioned by the Assessor on completion of the ESAt if applicable</li>
		<li>
Existing ESAt - where an existing ESAt result is applied to the job seeker's record&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
If the job seeker has a Partial Capacity to Work (PCW) or a Temporary Reduced Work Capacity (TRWC) of less than 15 hours, they do not require a compulsory TtW referral, but may volunteer</li>
			<li>
If the previous ESAt referral recommendation is TtW and the job seeker still meets eligibility the job seeker should be referred to TtW</li>
			<li>
If the job seeker has a PCW of 15 hours or greater and are in Workforce Australia employment services, they are eligible for TtW</li>
			<li>
If the previous ESAt outcome is Disability Employment Services (DES) - the job seeker must be referred to DES</li>
			<li>
If the job seeker is Workforce Australia employment services, including provider and online services the job seeker should be referred to TtW</li>		</ul>
		<li>
If the Job Seeker Snapshot identifies that a job seeker is eligible for TtW and would also benefit from participating in <a href="../job-seekers/001-02090000-01.html">Skills for Education and Employment (SEE)</a> or <a href="../job-seekers/001-02170000-01.html">Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP)</a>, concurrent referrals can still be made to these programs without impacting on TtW eligibility</li>		</ul>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> job seekers must be advised how provider appointment attendance can affect payability.</p>

<p>If a job seeker is eligible for TtW and RapidConnect applies, then Services Australia will not apply the TtW suspension and/or cancellation process if they fail to attend a TtW appointment.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Where there is a TtW provider in a job seeker's Employment Region, but they are unable to offer any appointments within 14 days, refer the job seeker to Workforce Australia employment services. The job seeker must not be disadvantaged by having a delayed payment commencement date based on RapidConnect rules.</p>

<p>Similarly, job seekers are not penalised under RapidConnect rules for being referred to a TtW provider within 14 days, where there are local Workforce Australia employment services appointments available within 2 days.

<p>If a TtW provider exists in the job seeker's Employment Region, but no appointments are available in the Online Diary the provider's contact details will be displayed&#58;</p>

Eligible job seekers with mutual obligation requirements must be referred to a TtW provider for an appointment within 2 days, but no later than 14 working days after the Participation Interview is run.</p>

<p>If a job seeker has been connected to Workforce Australia employment services in the last 91 days, for example, they are in the allowable break period, they cannot be referred to TtW.</p>

<p><strong>Warm Transfers</strong></p>

<p>Warm transfer TtW eligible job seekers to the provider if they have no access or limited/unreliable access to a phone that the provider can contact on. Warm transfers should be done via phone by staff in Smart Centres. If the job seeker has contacted in person and is being referred to TtW, ask them to contact the provider using the self-service phone in the service centre.</p>

<p><strong>Rescheduling appointments</strong></p>

<p>Job seekers subject to RapidConnect, if a TtW eligible job seeker requires their appointment to be rescheduled, existing <a href="../job-seekers/001-02030000-01.html">RapidConnect</a> rules apply.</p>

<p><strong>Change of address</strong></p>

<p>When a job seeker notifies Services Australia of a change of address, this information is automatically updated in the Department of Education, Skills and Employment's IT system.</p>

<p>If a job seeker has moved to a new location and their TtW provider services in the new area, they will be automatically allocated to the same TtW provider in their new area. If the original TtW provider does not service the new area, the job seeker will be randomly allocated a new TtW provider.</p>

<p>The job seeker will be automatically referred to another employment service if there is not a TtW provider which services their new address.</p>

<p><strong>Transfer by agreement</strong></p>

<p>Job seekers may transfer to a new provider if their current provider, their proposed provider and the job seeker all agree to the transfer. Job seekers should discuss a transfer with their current TtW provider or, if they are unable to, contact the Department of Education, Skills and Employment's National Customer Service Line.</p>

<p><strong>Transfers due to breakdown of the relationship between a job seeker and their TtW provider</strong></p>

<p>It may be appropriate for a job seeker to transfer to a different TtW provider where a job seeker and their TtW provider experience a breakdown of relationship. Where a job seeker advises Services Australia they are not able to work with their exisiting TtW provider, Services Australia should refer the participant to the Department of Education, Skills and Employment's National Customer Service Line.</p>

<p>An individualised and holistic approach to servicing disadvantaged youth is encouraged. Participants can engage with multiple programs concurrently where a provider or the Agency believes the participant can benefit. Concurrent servicing is restricted where programmes provide the same service (so a service that is specifically designed to assist with work readiness (such as Employability Skills Training) would not be allowable).</p>

<p>The following are examples of programmes that can be undertaken concurrently with TtW&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<a href="../job-seekers/001-02090000-01.html">Skills for Education and Employment (SEE)</a></li>
		<li>

		<li>

		<li>
<a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-03160000-01.html">ParentsNext</a> (may volunteer in TtW)</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the Job Seeker Snapshot identifies that a young person is eligible for TtW and would also benefit from participating in AMEP or SEE, the existing referral process for these programmes can be completed.</p>
