<p><strong>Question&#58; What is the difference between the Report Suspected Fraud application and Report Suspected Fraud and Corruption system?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; The Report Suspected Fraud and Corruption system is to report fraud identified by staff during the course of their regular duties. Staff working in Centrelink, Medicare and Child Support programmes can report suspected fraud and corruption against all Services Australia programmes.</p>

<p>The Report Suspected Fraud application is for members of the public or staff submitting a report on behalf of a member of the public.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; How much time do I have to complete the report?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; The <strong>Report Suspected Fraud and Corruption system</strong> times out after 30 minutes of inactivity. To prevent losing your report select 'Save' at the top of the page. If you don't have time to complete your tip-off, saving will temporarily store the report in 'My Unsubmitted Reports'. These reports will automatically be submitted seven days after the creation date.</p>

<p>The <strong>Report Suspected Fraud application</strong> times out after 15 minutes on a single page and the report will be lost. A time-out message will occur if this time limit is exceeded. If close to exceeding this time limit, select 'Continue' to save the report then click the 'back 'button in the report suspected fraud application to reset the timer. Each time a person selects the continue button and navigates to a new page, the timer is reset.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; How much detail needs to be recorded in a suspected fraud report?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; The report should contain as much detail as possible relating to the suspected fraud and corruption. There is no need to repeat the same information throughout the report. Remember the contents of this report could be viewed under a Freedom of Information (FOI) access.

<p><strong>Question&#58; Should I report suspected fraud and corruption by a child care provider and an individual in one report?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Yes. The Report Suspected Fraud and Corruption system allows child care providers (business/organisation) and individuals to be recorded in the same report.

<p><strong>Question&#58; Is it fraud for a parent to provide an income that does not reflect their current earnings?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Yes, it is fraud for a parent to knowingly provide a false or misleading statement to an officer s159 Child Support Assessment Act 1989</p>

<p>For example, a parent lodges an estimate of $0 and advises he is no longer working for ABC PTY LTD. Two months later a Service Officer receives an s120 notice response from a bank, which shows that the parent has continued to receive regular deposits from ABC PTY LTD. This information suggests that the parent may have provided a false statement to Child Support and this should be referred for further scrutiny.</p>
