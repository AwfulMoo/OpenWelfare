<p>This document outlines support for staff in handling instances when a member of the public, third party or nominee organisation records or takes photos of an interaction with Services Australia. This includes any type of audio, visual or audio-visual recording device.</p>

<p></p>
<div class="twisty">
	
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_General_informa"></a>
<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_General_informa">General information</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Privacy and security of staff, assets and customers while on Services Australia premises are a critical focus of Services Australia. </p>

<p>The Audio and Audio-Visual Recording policy provides all Services Australia staff with a clear and consistent approach for managing instances when members of the public record, or advise that they will record their interaction with Services Australia by using audio, visual or audio-visual recording devices.</p>

<p>Services Australia does not permit a member of the public, third party or nominee organisation to record an interaction in the face-to-face or telephony environments with any type of audio, visual or audio-visual recording device, other than making a reasonable adjustment for customers with disability. For example a customer who is deaf, has hearing loss or a speech disability.</p>

<p>In circumstances where permission to record is given, take steps to minimise the risks. Where possible, the conversation should take place in a location where third party conversations cannot be picked up by the recording. Use an interview room (in line with the guidelines for the use of interview rooms) so there is no risk of other interactions being overheard and recorded. Note this on the individual's record.</p>

<p>Where information relating to a third party may be discussed with the customer, the customer should be advised of the sensitive nature of that information, and to only use the recording for the purposes of helping the customer’s understanding of the conversation. </p>

<p>While not illegal, the privacy of other customers could be adversely affected if a customer records, films or takes a photograph in a service centre. Australian Privacy Principle 11.1 in the Privacy Act 1988 requires Services Australia to take reasonable steps to protect the personal information of its customers from misuse, interference and unauthorised access. </p>

<p>This policy is consistent with Services Australia's&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
obligations under the Australian Privacy Principles to control and protect customer and staff information</li>
		<li>
right as an occupier of premises to determine the circumstances under which a person is permitted to enter its premises</li>
		</ul>
<p>Any kind of surveillance undertaken by Services Australia is not covered by this policy.</p>

<p>If staff become aware that a member of the public or a customer is recording their interaction, the staff member should&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
tell the person that recording is not permitted by Services Australia</li>
		<li>
ask the person to stop recording and to delete the recording</li>
		<li>
if necessary, seek support from their leadership team</li>
		<li>
not try to take the device from the person</li>
		</ul>
<p>If a person refuses to stop recording&#58;</p>

<p>Authorised staff can direct them to leave the premises under Section 12 of Public Order (Protection of Persons and Property) Act 1971 Act using the following script&#58;</p>

<p>&quot;I am an authorised person for the purposes of paragraph 12(2)(c) of the Public Order (Protection of Persons and Property) Act 1971, and I am directing you to leave by virtue of the powers conferred under that Act. You will be liable to prosecution if you do not comply with this direction.&quot; </p>

<p>The authorised person can use a shorter version in some circumstances, as long as they achieve substantial compliance with the wording of the direction, including that&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they are authorised under the Public Order Act to direct that the person leaves the premises, and</li>
		<li>
that the person will be liable to prosecution if they fail to comply</li>
		</ul>
<p>See the <a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-07020060-05.html">Resources</a> page for a link to the Public Order Act intranet page.</p>

<p>Telephony staff can <a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-07020060-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Recording_a_pho">end the call</a>.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Third_party_and">Contact with external organisations</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>At times, Services Australia staff may need to contact an organisation to confirm or get information about customers. Some third party and nominee organisations may use call recording.</p>

<p>While Services Australia generally does not permit a third party or nominee organisation to record interactions and can ask that they stop the recording, ending a call may prevent the department from conducting its business. It may not be practicable or warranted in circumstances where the privacy risk is small. </p>

<p>Such organisations are typically required to comply with Commonwealth, state or territory privacy legislation, and know and comply with any surveillance legislation applicable to their call recording practices.</p>

<p>In these cases, if a caller identifies themselves from a Third Party organisation, confirming their organisation’s terms of usage, Services Australia Staff may proceed with the call when satisfied they are speaking to an authorised person/representative.</p>

<p>For further advice and information, refer to the <a href="https&#58;//intranet.internal.dept.local/Pages/section/customer-aggression-prevention-team-capt.html">Customer Aggression Prevention Team (CAPT)</a> or the Employment Law Team.

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Conversations can occur when a customer calls Services Australia, or interacts with a staff member face to face.</p>

<p><strong>Private activity</strong></p>

<p>Generally, it is not illegal for a person to make audio or audio-visual recordings where they are party to a private activity.  Given the public usually communicate personal information when conducting Services Australia business, it is likely that these interactions are private.</p>

<p><strong>Recording without consent</strong></p>

<p>Where a person is not a party to a private conversation, it is unlawful to record audible conversations without the consent of each party involved.</p>

<p>If a staff member believes that someone has unlawfully recorded an audio or audio-visual conversation, the staff member should discuss this with their manager. They may be directed to contact Services Australia’s Employment law and FOI branch and/or police for further investigation. A police report is an avenue open to all Services Australia staff.</p>

<p>Where a customer does not comply with a request to cease recording and to leave the premises, refer to Step 5 of the <a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-07020060-03.html#bp03_tbl_Recording_staff_Step05">Recording in a service centre</a> table on the Process Page.</p>

<p>Where a customer or third party organisation informs a staff member that a phone call is being recorded, Services Australia’s preferred position is that the staff member should end the call, see the <a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-07020060-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Recording_a_pho">Recording a phone call table</a> on the Process page.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Taking_photos_i">Recording visual content inside Services Australia premises</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Visual content can include photographs, video recordings (with or without audio) or social media live streaming.</p>

<p>While Services Australia does not permit a member of the public to record face-to-face or phone interactions, it is generally not illegal for a person to photograph or film another person without their consent, unless it is considered a private activity or a private conversation the person is not a party to.</p>

<p>Due to the nature of activity in Services Australia premises offering face to face services, it is unlikely that a photo or film could be classified as a private activity.  Services Australia therefore has limited ability to prevent publication of content. </p>

<p>If content is published, the staff member’s manager can contact the Media Branch to investigate whether the content can be removed. In order for a removal request to be successful, the content must breach the relevant platform’s terms and conditions and/or be illegal.</p>

<p>Outside a Services Australia premises can include footpaths or entrances outside service centres. It can also include any other location if the recording is made in connection with a staff member’s employment.</p>

<p>It is generally not illegal for a member of the public (for example, a customer or journalist) to photograph, film, or make an audio recording of a staff member outside of a Services Australia premises without their consent.</p>

<p>However, for staff safety and security, if a member of the public photographs, films or makes an audio recording of a staff member <strong>outside the workplace without their consent</strong>, the staff member should alert their manager as soon as possible and, if impacted, record the details in ESSentials. For more information about ESSentials recording, see <a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-07020050-01.html">Customer aggression - Reporting and recording incidents</a>.</p>

<p>The manager should seek advice from a <a href="https&#58;//intranet.internal.dept.local/Pages/section/regional-security-adviser.html">Regional Security Adviser (RSA)</a> if there are concerns about the staff member's safety. </p>

<p>The manager can also get advice if relevant from Employment Law Team and the Media Branch. See the <a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-07020060-05.html">Resources</a> page for contact details.</p>

<p>If the person has a Services Australia record, document details of the incident and the person’s response in the appropriate reporting system (CIMS, CUBA, CIRT, ESSentials). For more information, including when the person is a non-customer or unknown, see <a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-07020050-01.html">Customer aggression - Reporting and recording incidents</a>.</p>

<p>Published recordings can include audio, visual or audio-visual recordings of staff or customers. They can be published on social media, websites, or in hardcopy format.</p>

<p>If a member of the public publishes a recording, the staff member’s manager should contact the Media Branch to investigate whether recorded content can be removed. See the <a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-07020060-05.html">Resources</a> page for contact details.</p>

<p>For a removal request to be successful, the content must breach the relevant platform’s terms and conditions and/or be illegal. </p>

<p>This is particularly in relation to social media platforms. It is important to note that removal of posts is at the discretion of each individual social media platform. Social media platforms allow a broad range of commentary, which can include criticisms about Services Australia and its employees.</p>
