<P>Job seeker compliance decisions must be evidence-based decisions. This means the decision must be based on the relevant facts.</P>
<P>All compliance investigations include evidence from both the person who reported the failure or generated the investigation, and the job seeker. Whether any further evidence is required to reach a decision, will depend on the clarity and consistency of these two forms of primary evidence.</P>
<P>The decision maker must be confident they have sufficient evidence to establish the facts relevant to the reported failure to make an informed decision.</P>
<P>Any evidence collected as part of a compliance investigation should:</P>
<UL>
<LI>be specific to the compliance incident that has been reported</LI>
<LI>focus on the issues that must be considered to make a determination under the applicable legislation and policy. For example, the nature of the non-compliance event, circumstances that affected the reasonableness of the requirement, the job seeker's capacity to comply or to make prior contact (when relevant to the decision)</LI></UL>
<P>The Participation Solutions Team (PST)-skilled Service Officer or service centre Service Officers with UNPP security resource should attempt to gather sufficient evidence, complete the investigation and make a decision during the initial contact with the job seeker.</P></DIV>

<DIV class=showcont>
<P>Supplementary evidence is only required when there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusive decision without it and the further evidence or information is likely to influence the outcome of the decision.</P>
<P>When supplementary evidence is required, the decision maker should explore whether this information is already available online (for example, on the <STRONG>Circumstances Impacting Compliance</STRONG> screen) or the job seeker can immediately upload this using Upload documents.</P>
<P>Attempts to gather additional verbal testimony as supplementary evidence during initial contact with the job seeker should be made when this evidence will affect the outcome of the decision and:</P>
<UL>
<LI>it is not reasonable or practical for supplementary evidence to be immediately provided by the job seeker, or</LI>

<P>When a financial penalty for a mutual obligation failure is being considered, if supplementary evidence cannot be collected on the date of initial contact, a decision is made based on the available evidence.

<DIV class=showcont>
<P>When the job seeker requires time to source and supply supplementary evidence, the job seeker must be given a reasonable opportunity to provide this before a decision is made. The Participation Solutions Team (PST)-skilled Service Officer or service centre Service Officer with UNPP security resource negotiates this timeframe with the job seeker. The amount of time is not prescriptive however two working days is generally considered appropriate.</P>
<P>The Service Officer must:</P>
<UL>
<LI>explain the benefits of providing the evidence in the agreed timeframe and the impact that failing to provide the evidence may have on the decision</LI>
<LI>document in the <STRONG>Further Evidence</STRONG> section:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>what evidence was requested and why this is likely to influence the outcome of the decision</LI>
<LI>when it is due, and</LI>
<LI>the job seeker is aware a decision about the failure will be made based on the available evidence if not provided by the due date</LI></UL></UL>
<P>The workflow will navigate to the <STRONG>Save and Exit</STRONG> page and automatically select the appropriate save and exit option to temporarily remove the contact trigger pending the return of evidence. For Job Seeker Compliance Model compliance investigations, the system will auto restore payment if it is currently suspended 'DNA participation appointment' (APA).</P>
<P>On the Activity List (<STRONG>AL</STRONG>) screen, ensure the activity has been held with an appropriate due date, generally this will be the 'Due date given + 1'.</P>
<P>If the job seeker does not provide the evidence by the required date the contact trigger will be reinstated and the job seeker will not be able to complete their report until they have spoken to the PST. A decision should be made based on the available information. Facts that cannot be substantiated with evidence may either be given lesser weight, or may need to be disregarded.</P></DIV>

<P>A job seeker's statement is considered primary evidence in the investigation and must always be considered when investigating a reported non-compliance event. Compliance action is not applied without first affording the job seeker the opportunity to explain the circumstances that led to the reported incident of non-compliance.</P>
<P>Under the principles of natural justice, all job seekers have a right to a fair hearing when an incident of non-compliance is reported. This includes providing an opportunity to:</P>
<UL>
<LI>explain the circumstances that led to the alleged failure to comply, and</LI>
<LI>explain how the circumstances impacted their capacity to comply or ability to make prior contact (if relevant)</LI></UL>
<P>Generally this evidence is collected verbally, with a factual summary of the conversation recorded by the Participation Solutions Team (PST)-skilled Service Officer or service centre Service Officer with UNPP security resource.</P>
<P>When collecting a job seeker's statement the Service Officer is responsible for leading the discussion with the job seeker in a manner that uses:</P>
<UL>
<LI>open questions to encourage the job seeker to explain their version of what occurred and any factors they believed impacted compliance</LI>
<LI>specific questions if further clarification is required or to resolve inconsistencies</LI>
<LI>ensuring the conversation remains focused on the specific non-compliance event as reported</LI></UL>
<P>The Service Officer records a concise and factual summary of the job seeker's statement in the <STRONG>Compliance Investigation</STRONG> workflow. Any evidence the job seeker would be willing to provide to support their statements should be recorded as part of this statement.</P></DIV>

<P>Ongoing job seeker circumstances that had a direct and significant impact on the non-compliance event may inform the compliance decision.</P>
<P>When a job seeker is claiming an ongoing/intermittent circumstance directly contributed to non-compliance, check if the circumstance, impact and sufficient evidence are currently documented on the <STRONG>Circumstances Impacting Compliance</STRONG> screen. This screen can be accessed directly from the <STRONG>Compliance Investigation</STRONG> workflow.</P>
<P>If a job seeker's circumstances that impacted compliance is not recorded on the <STRONG>Circumstances Impacting Compliance</STRONG> screen, or there is insufficient information/evidence for the purposes of a compliance investigation, it must be gathered and documented on this screen during the investigation. Information recorded or updated on this screen during the investigation forms part of the evidence base for the investigation and can be viewed later as part of the completed summary for the compliance investigation.</P></DIV>

<DIV class=showcont>
<P>When there are discrepancies between a provider's statement and the job seeker's statement which would influence the decision, additional information/evidence may need to be considered.</P>

<P>The Report Assessment Summary of certain ESAts incorporates a 'risk of non-compliance' rating and details of specific vulnerabilities or barriers that may affect capacity to comply. This rating may inform a compliance decision.</P>
<P>When investigating an unemployment failure, work refusal failure or Job Seeker Compliance Model compliance action, an ESAt may be initiated if the Service Officer requires assessment of a possible medical condition, such as a neurological impairment, mental illness or learning disorder. This may include circumstances where the job seeker has no insight into their condition, and when their responses to the Job Seeker Classification Instrument (JSCI) do not trigger an ESAt.</P>
<P>When a Participation Solutions Team (PST)-skilled Service Officer determines an ESAt is required and the ESAt is not triggered by the JSCI (or a JSCI cannot be run), a referral using the referral reason of Participation Failure Pending (PFP) should be made. This referral reason ensures:</P>

<P>Evidence is weighted, or considered, to form an opinion about the probably, or most likely, version of events. As a general rule, evidence given the most weight in an investigation will be:</P>
<UL>
<LI>directly relevant to the incident</LI>
<LI>precise in nature</LI>
<LI>deemed to be from a reliable, trustworthy source, and</LI>
<LI>would be viewed as credible by others</LI></UL>
<P>The weight assigned to evidence will reduce for each of the above elements that is not met.</P>
<P>Facts that cannot be substantiated with evidence should either be given lesser weight or may need to be disregarded to form a decision.</P>
<P>When a claim is made that may affect the outcome of an investigation, several lesser weighted pieces of evidence may together result in an assessment this was the more probable version of events.</P>
<P>Evidence about a job seeker's circumstances around the time of the compliance event where the job seeker's circumstances do not directly relate to the incident under investigation may help establish the context in which the non-compliance event occurred, however, would not have the same weight as evidence that specifically relates to the non-compliance event.</P>
<P>If conflicting or insufficient evidence cannot be resolved by gathering further supporting evidence, weighing the evidence can assist in reaching a decision based on the 'balance of probability', such as, what is more likely to have occurred.</P>
