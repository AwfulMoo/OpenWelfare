Principal Carer Parents are not required to accept job offers that involve working more than 15 hours per week</LI>
<LI>Job seekers assessed as having a partial capacity to work are required to look for work of up to 15 hours per week, or their assessed capacity if less than 15 hours, that is within 60 minutes commuting time</LI>
<LI>Job seekers <STRONG>aged 55 or older</STRONG> have standard job search requirements but can satisfy their mutual obligation requirements with a combination of part-time and/ or approved voluntary work. They can however be required to accept full-time paid work if it is offered</LI>

<P>Job seekers assessed as having a partial capacity to work are only required to accept work to their assessed capacity.</P>
<P>It is <STRONG>not compulsory</STRONG> for job seekers to look for work outside their local area. Agreement must be reached with the provider.</P>
<P>If the job seeker does not accept the offer of suitable work they may be considered non-compliant. See <A href="../job-seekers/001-10100000-01.html">Refusing or failing to accept a suitable job offer</A>.</P>
<P>There are exceptions to the requirement to accept the offer of work, even if the customer has agreed to look outside their local area. See Policy under 1.1.U.55, Unsuitable work on the <A href="../job-seekers/001-09140000-04.html">References</A> page.</P>
<P><STRONG>Relocating:</STRONG> Job seekers may also be expected to accept work that requires them to live away from home where they have done this in the past, or if they have previously stated they are prepared to move to a particular location to work.

<LI>the location of either the workplace or the child care facility would make the total travel time to and from work unreasonable</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Is there evidence of adherence to a particular set of ethical, moral, or religious values?</LI>

<P>The requirement to accept all suitable job offers includes accepting all reasonable offers of additional hours. For 'full capacity' job seekers, all reasonable offers of additional hours must be accepted regardless of how many hours they are currently working.</P>
<P>An assessment must occur to determine whether the job seeker had reasonable excuse for declining the offer of additional hours.</P>
<P>The following factors should be considered:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Was there a formal job offer?</LI>
<LI>Would the additional hours be ongoing?</LI>
<LI>Was the job seeker given sufficient notice prior to the additional hours commencing?</LI></UL>
<P>It may be appropriate for a casual employee who was offered only a couple of hours of work at very short notice when they already had a prior engagement that it was not reasonable to expect them to break, to refuse the offer.
