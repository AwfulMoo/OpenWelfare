<p>The out of area job search expands the definition of suitable work. Job seekers who <strong>agree</strong> with their Employment Services Provider to seek work outside their local labour market are required to accept an offer of permanent full-time work (work of at least 35 hours per week for 12 months).</p>

<p>Job seekers assessed as having a partial capacity to work are only required to accept work to their assessed capacity.</p>

<p>It is <strong>not compulsory</strong> for job seekers to look for work outside their local area. Agreement must be reached with the provider.</p>

<p>If the job seeker does not accept the offer of suitable work they may be considered non-compliant. See <a href="../job-seekers/001-10100000-01.html">Refusing or failing to accept a suitable job offer</a>.</p>

<p>There are exceptions to the requirement to accept the offer of work, even if the customer has agreed to look outside their local area. See Policy under 1.1.U.55, Unsuitable work on the <a href="../job-seekers/001-09140000-04.html">References</a> page.</p>

<p><strong>Relocating&#58;</strong> Job seekers may also be expected to accept work that requires them to live away from home where they have done this in the past, or if they have previously stated they are prepared to move to a particular location to work. However, a job seeker is not usually expected to relocate if they are under 18, pregnant or have a dependent child.</p>

<p>If a job seeker considers work to be unsuitable because of their moral, cultural or religious beliefs, they should discuss this with their Employment Services Provider or with Services Australia if there is a doubt about the job seekers ability to meet their mutual obligation requirements and eligibility for income support.</p>

<p>The following criteria need to be considered to determine if the job seeker is able to meet their mutual obligation requirements&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Is there evidence of adherence to a particular set of ethical, moral, or religious values?</li>
		<li>
Are the lifestyle and practices of the customer consistent with the particular issues?</li>
		<li>
Has the customer refused a number of positions previously based on a wide range of religious or moral grounds?</li>
		<li>
Is there any evidence that the customer is not genuine in their objection?</li>
		<li>
What is the actual impact of their beliefs in their ability to meet their mutual obligation requirements?</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where work is considered unsuitable due to moral, cultural or religious reasons, record details on a <strong>DOC</strong>, including the customer's reasons and the decision to continue payments. If it is <strong>not</strong> considered unsuitable, compliance action should be initiated.

<p>Generally, a person is not compelled to take up self-employment, and they cannot be penalised for refusing work that could be described as self-employment.</p>

<p>The requirement to accept all suitable job offers includes accepting all reasonable offers of additional hours. For 'full capacity' job seekers, all reasonable offers of additional hours must be accepted regardless of how many hours they are currently working.</p>

<p>An assessment must occur to determine whether the job seeker had reasonable excuse for declining the offer of additional hours.</p>

<p>The following factors should be considered&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Was there a formal job offer?</li>
		<li>
Would the additional hours be ongoing?</li>
		<li>
Was the job seeker given sufficient notice prior to the additional hours commencing?</li>
		</ul>
<p>It may be appropriate for a casual employee who was offered only a couple of hours of work at very short notice when they already had a prior engagement that it was not reasonable to expect them to break, to refuse the offer. However, it may not be appropriate to refuse to take on an additional shift on an ongoing basis, without reasonable excuse.</p>
