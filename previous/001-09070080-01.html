<p>This document outlines how a Youth Allowance (YA) job seeker, under 22 years of age, may fully satisfy their mutual obligation requirements by undertaking study or training, or a combination of requirements for a minimum number of hours per week as part of their Job Plan.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>If a YA customer is enrolled in a course of study which would qualify under the rules for YA as a full-time student, then payment as a YA (student) should be considered in the first instance.</p>

<p>However, if a YA job seeker is participating in sufficient hours of suitable requirements or programs, they can fully satisfy their <a href="../job-seekers/001-09000000-01.html">mutual obligation requirements</a>.</p>

<p>This approved requirement option is known as 'Youth Activities' and can be applied where other activities that fully meet requirements, such as paid work, study (for principal carers) or short courses, do not apply.</p>

<p>If this is approved by Services Australia, (the agency), the job seeker is not required to look for work. They will be managed by the agency and not have to be referred to and participating in an Employment Service.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>When approving Youth Activities, the primary focus is whether the requirement or combination of requirements/programs will improve the job seeker's skills and qualifications and improve their prospects of gaining employment. Ideally, the requirement(s) will also improve the job seeker's work capacity and increase social participation.</p>

<p>Examples of requirements include, but are not limited to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a part-time vocational training course</li>
		<li>
unpaid work experience or voluntary work</li>
		<li>
paid employment or self-employment (meeting the <a href="../job-seekers/001-09070070-01.html">Sufficient Work Test</a>)</li>
		<li>
measures designed to eliminate or reduce any disadvantage the person has in the labour market</li>
		<li>
a self-employment development opportunity</li>
		<li>
training for Aboriginal program placement</li>
		<li>
an approved literacy course through TAFE/Adult Education Providers</li>
		<li>
a rehabilitation program, including a vocational rehabilitation program</li>
		<li>
a program of assistance as recommended by an <a href="../job-seekers/001-09070070-01.html">Employment Services Assessment (ESAt)</a> or <a href="../people-with-disability/008-06110000-01.html">Job Capacity Assessment (JCA)</a></li>

<p>To have Youth Activities approved, the YA job seeker has to be undertaking a 50 to 74 per cent study load (in a suitable vocational course of study, as per normal course approval policy) <strong>or</strong> a combination of requirements/programs for a minimum number of hours per week. The minimum hours required will depend on the job seeker's participation category&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>

		<div class="block">

<p>Local youth agency or State/Territory funded post school programs such as the NSW State Government Transition to Work (NSW TTW) program, Victorian Transition To Employment (TTE) Initiative or the National Disability Insurance Schemes SLES initiative can be approved as 'Youth Activities' for YA job seekers. These job seekers have no job search or other compulsory requirements, as participation in these programs will fully meet their mutual obligation requirements. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> NSW TtW is different to the national <a href="../job-seekers/001-02290000-01.html">Workforce Australia - Transition to Work (TtW)</a> program offered by DEWR.</p>

<p>Job seekers who have commenced or are due to commence NSW TtW, Victorian TTE or SLES within 8 weeks of applying for YA, need to have the program included as an approved requirement. The job seeker is not required to undertake any other activities prior to commencing the post school program.</p>

<p>In the past, job seekers with mutual obligation requirements were required to exit NSW TtW or Victorian TTE and commence in <a href="../people-with-disability/008-04030020-01.html">Disability Employment Services (DES)</a> in order to qualify for Youth Allowance (other) where DES was the recommended referral from an <a href="../job-seekers/001-02330000-01.html">Employment Services Assessment (ESAt)</a> or <a href="../people-with-disability/008-06110000-01.html">Job Capacity Assessment (JCA)</a>. Although this is no longer required in order to meet requirements and be eligible for payment, job seekers will still have to exit NSW TTW, Victorian TTE or SLES if they want to commence in DES, as the Department of Social Services does not allow full concurrency with these post-school programs and DES.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> job seekers who are in their final 6 months of participation in NSW TtW, Victorian<strong> </strong>TTE or SLES can directly register with a DES provider as an eligible school leaver, and start receiving DES assistance while they finalise their participation in the post school program.</p>

<p>To be eligible to participate in DES and NSW TtW, Victorian TTE or SLES concurrently a participant must&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
be in their final 6 months of participation in NSW TtW, Victorian TTE or SLES</li>
		<li>
meet eligibility requirements for DES as an eligible school leaver, and</li>
		<li>
have the capacity to benefit from DES and be able to fully and effectively participate in both programs at the same time</li>
		</ul>
<p>Existing arrangements regarding the concurrency of DES and post school programs continue to apply to job seekers who are not in their final 6 months of 1 of the 3 approved transition programs. For all other job seekers, NSW TTW, Victorian TTE or SLES cannot be undertaken concurrently with DES. Only once they have exited the post-school program, are they eligible to commence in DES under eligible school leaver arrangements. They are not required to undertake an ESAt for the purpose of accessing DES. If a job seeker has already commenced in DES, they cannot exit DES in order to undertake a local or state government transition program or SLES</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> job seekers participating in DES are not subject to points based activation. See <a href="../people-with-disability/008-04030110-01.html">Referring a job seeker to Disability Employment Services (DES)</a>.</p>

Youth Activities (YAC) should be recorded on the Activity and Exemption Summary (<strong>AEX</strong>) screen in Process Direct to reflect the job seeker's approved activity for no more than 6 months at a time. A Job Plan should be updated every 6 months and take into consideration the person's individual Drug Court program obligations and their ability to look for and take up work, or undertake study if appropriate. Once accepted into the program, participants will be required to follow an individual case management plan which will set out the requirements of the program. This program will be strictly monitored by the court and any deviance may result in the imposition of sanctions and in the last resort, expulsion from the program.</p>
