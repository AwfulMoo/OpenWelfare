<P>The amount of BAC or CAC subsidy is based on the gross employment income paid within the claiming period. For the date range span, the 'date from' will be the earliest payslip date and the 'date to' would be the latest payslip date.</P>
<P>Check if:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the employer entered the correct dates in the <STRONG>Date from</STRONG> and <STRONG>Date to</STRONG> fields in the claim</LI>
<LI>the date entered in the <STRONG>Date from</STRONG> field in the claim matches the beginning of the first payslip or payroll summary</LI>
<LI>the date entered in the <STRONG>Date to</STRONG> field in the claim matches the end date of the last payslip or payroll summary</LI></UL>
<P>If the employer provides a payroll summary as wage evidence, the payroll summary dates must align with the full claim period.</P>
<P>If an employer provides payslips and/or enters a date range in the claim for wages paid outside of the claiming period, ADMS will not include these wages in determining the subsidy to be paid. ADMS will only consider the wages paid for dates within the claim period when calculating the subsidy.</P>
<P>For example:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Claim period 1 January 2022 – 31 March 2022</LI>
<LI>Employer declares a:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>date range in the claim of 1 October 2021 – 31 March 2022, and</LI>
<LI>gross amount of $6,000 wages paid</LI></UL></UL>
<P>In this case, ADMS will only consider the wages paid for the period 1 January to 31 March 2022. To calculate the subsidy to be paid, ADMS will disregard wages paid for the period 1 October to 31 December 2021. This means only a proportion of the gross amount of $6,000 declared by the employer will be used to calculate the BAC or CAC subsidy.</P>
<P>If the employer has correctly entered a date range and/or wage evidence that starts or finishes outside of the claim period:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Advise the employer:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>wages paid to the apprentice outside the claim period are excluded from the subsidy calculation for that claim period</LI>
<LI>subject to eligibility, BAC or CAC subsidy for these wages can be claimed in the next claiming period (or were claimed for in the previous claiming period)</LI></UL>
<LI>Escalate to (Technical Peer Support) TPS, for referral to DEWR AWSE, if the employer disagrees with the subsidy calculation or wants to appeal. Procedure ends here.</LI></UL>

<P>Employers invited to claim the BAC and/or CAC wage subsidies may contact to request their claim is rejected or withdrawn. Examples of reasons employers may not want to proceed with their claim may include (but are not limited to):</P>
<UL>
<LI>apprentice may no longer work for them, or did not work for them in the claiming period, or</LI>
<LI>employer did not pay the apprentice during the claimed wage period, for example the apprentice was on leave without pay</LI></UL>
<P>If an employer has received a notification that a claim has been created for an apprentice, that they do not wish to claim a for, and the claim is in <STRONG>Ready</STRONG> or <STRONG>Draft</STRONG> status they should be encouraged <STRONG>not</STRONG> to submit the claim.</P>
<P>Claims in a <STRONG>Ready</STRONG> or <STRONG>Draft</STRONG> status will eventually expire, once the claiming time limit for that wage period expires, see the Resources page in <A href="../business-and-employers/043-22022208-05.html">Boosting Apprenticeship Commencements (BAC) and Completing Apprenticeship Commencements (CAC) wage subsidies for time limits</A>.</P>
<P>Tell the employer:</P>
<UL>
<LI>they may receive notifications from DEWR about the outstanding claim, and that these can be disregarded if they do not want to claim a subsidy for the apprentice</LI>
<LI>to speak with their AASN if they don't want to claim any further wage BAC and/or CAC wage subsidies for the apprentice</LI></UL>
<P>If the employer insists on submitting the <STRONG>Ready</STRONG> or <STRONG>Draft</STRONG> claim to be formally rejected, <A href="../business-and-employers/043-22032123-03.html#bp03_tbl_Employer_reques_Step03">go to Step 3</A>.</P>

<P>Confirm the reason why the employer does not wish to claim the BAC and/or CAC wage subsidy.</P>
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> if the reason the employer is requesting rejection is because the apprenticeship ceased prior to the wage period, confirm the date the apprenticeship ceased.</P>
<P>Read the following declaration to the employer and confirm their acceptance:</P>
<P>'I am duly authorised by the Employer or Group Training Organisation named in this claim application to make this declaration and enter into this Wage Subsidy Agreement on the Employer or Group Training Organisation's behalf. I acknowledge that, on my request:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the claim will be rejected, and</LI>
<LI>a wage subsidy will not be received, for this apprentice, for the relevant wage period</LI></UL>
<P>Rejection of this claim does not affect eligibility to claim a subsidy in subsequent wage periods. I will engage with my Australian Apprenticeship Service Provider regarding eligibility to receive a wage subsidy in future claim periods, and inform them if the apprenticeship has concluded.'</P>
<UL>
<LI>Copy and Paste the declaration into the <STRONG>Service Notes</STRONG> for the claim, then</LI>
<LI>Complete the DEWR AWSE line Contact Card</LI></UL>

<LI>complete both the <STRONG>Employer Declaration Accepted</STRONG> and <STRONG>Service Notes updated</STRONG> check boxes</LI>
<LI>submit the form</LI></UL>
<P>Service Officers will receive an acknowledgement email and a resolution email, once the DEWR AWSE line provide approval to reject the claim. No action is required in relation to either email. The rejection will be processed by a TPSO. <STRONG>Service Officers must not, under any circumstance reject claims.</STRONG></P>
