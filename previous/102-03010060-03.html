<p>Granny flats, retirement village units and sale leaseback arrangements are referred to as special residences.</p>

<p>The home ownership status of a customer or their partner residing in a special residence does not depend on who holds title to the premises. It is based on the amount of entry contribution paid. If more than the extra allowable amount was paid for their interest in a special residence then they are assessed as homeowners.</p>

<p>For customers vacating a retirement village, ongoing home ownership status depends on whether or not their entry contribution is refunded to them. Please contact the Level 2 Policy Helpdesk for assessment on a case by case basis. </p>

<p>For a <strong>partnered</strong> customer vacating a special residence the Social Security Act sections 1153 - 1157 defines the home ownership status of each member of the couple. For assistance in interpreting the Act, contact the Level 2 Policy Helpdesk.</p>
