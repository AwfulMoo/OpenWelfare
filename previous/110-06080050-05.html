<p>The same attribution rules apply to a partner review.</p>

<p>Consequential activities will not be automatically attributed to the partner review. The Service Officer must manually attribute the activity if they determine that the consequential action relates to the review.</p>

<p>After the partner review has started, a contact letter or advice can be issued on the primary review which also relates to the partner's circumstances.</p>

<p>Any Review Contact Period present on the primary review can be used to assess whether an action was <strong>indirectly triggered</strong> on the partner's record.</p>

<p>Rate increases should be attributed to a review if the review directly triggered that action.</p>

<p>Compliance/Service Officer should not avoid attributing an upward variation to a customer's rate because it will impact any downward variation savings that the review would realise.</p>

<p>The Compliance/Service Officer does not need to investigate or attribute a rate increase which has been indirectly triggered by the review unless it is a restoration, grant or re-grant action. It is unlikely that the review triggered the customer to obtain a higher rate of payment as this action would most likely have occurred regardless of the review.</p>

<p>The only <strong>exception</strong> to this is where the cancellation reason is not appropriate to attribute to a particular Review Type.

<p><strong>Automatic cancellations</strong></p>

<p>Customers on JobSeeker Payment (JSP) and Youth Allowance with high employment income are automatically cancelled when paid employment income precludes payment after six fortnights at nil rate. If the customer has permanent full time work they are not eligible for the six fortnights at nil rate, however working credits are taken into account prior to the automatic cancellation.</p>

<p><strong>Manual cancellations</strong></p>

<p>A customer in the above circumstances can also request to voluntarily surrender their payment and be cancelled manually by a Compliance/Service Officer.</p>

<p>If the customer is not in permanent full time employment, they must be advised that they may have entitlement to six fortnights at zero rate. The customer must also be advised that they can access working credits which may allow them to receive further payments.</p>

<p>These conversations must be included in a <strong>DOC </strong>to support that consideration has been given to the customer's future entitlement prior to the cancellation.</p>

<p>A cancellation for voluntary surrender which is directly processed by Business Integrity staff can only be attributed if the discussion on future entitlement has been <strong>DOC</strong>'d as per the above circumstances.</p>

<p>Recording of employment income and <strong>IOP</strong> or <strong>LOP</strong> exclusions</p></td>

<p><strong>Recording of e employment income</strong></p>

<p>Despite how the customer's employment income is recorded on the system (<strong>IOP</strong>, <strong>LOP</strong> or any other code), the employment income update is only attributable to a review if the customer has verified on-going employment income where the base rate is unchanging. For Employment Income Interventions (<strong>EIIP</strong> and <strong>EIIM</strong>) employment income does not need to be verified.</p>

<p>Employment income is not attributable to a review.</p>

<p>Evidence of the verified employment income must be documented. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> the base rate can be used if the customer is subject to shift work or overtime which is not always known at the time the determination is being made. This decision is based on the information already to hand, and must not be obtained separately via a second contact to a third party.</p>

<p><strong>IOP or LOP Exclusions</strong></p>

<p><strong>IOP or LOP is recorded in an activity which has another attributable rate change</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>IOP</strong> or <strong>LOP</strong> is an excluded action therefore any other customer rate changes which are included in that activity will not be attributable to the review. Create the action in a separate activity</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>IOP or LOP is included in an activity which cancels the customer's payment</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
The cancellation action is not available for attribution to the review as the cancellation was processed from within an activity that was excluded from attribution</li>
		<li>
The cancellation action must be processed in a separate activity for it to be available for attribution</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>IOP or LOP is included in an activity but did not impact the customer's next future payment at the time the update was recorded</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
The activity will be excluded from attribution but should be available to attribute. Report these to the Senior Practitioner or Quality Development Officer (QDO)</li>		</ul>
