If a student is studying at a University (other than Bond or Open Universities) which has a normal period of enrolment of a year, they may be able to take advantage of the aggregation of study load rules</li>
		<li>
Aggregating is 'adding' the study load of one period to another to determine whether someone is undertaking full-time study</li>

Most universities will have a normal period of enrolment of a year. As such, these students would need to have an aggregated Equivalent Full-Time Study Load (EFTSL) of 0.750 over the academic year to meet the 75% requirement</li>
		<li>
Therefore, if the student has dropped to a part-time workload in the current study period, they may still be considered a full-time student if their workload in a&#58;</li>

previous study period/s or</li>

<p><strong>For ABSTUDY students only</strong>, where the action cannot be resolved at the point of first contact, for example if the student does not know their last day of study/attendance, suspend the payments from date paid to + 1 for reason '<strong>OTH</strong>', within the suspension activity, <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-14010030-01.html">send a Q134 letter</a> detailing the reasons for suspension, the date of effect and the relevant section of the policy. The advice must also include the customer's review and appeal rights, then send an ABSTUDY action request <strong>Fast Note</strong> - select <strong>Auto Text</strong>, use <strong>Students, ABSTUDY &amp; Apprentices</strong> &gt; <strong>Update</strong> &gt; <strong>ABSTUDY action request</strong> for follow-up. See <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-10030020-01.html">Suspension of ABSTUDY Payments</a>.</p>

<p>As a general principle, action to cancel or suspend ABSTUDY (including Schooling A and ABSTUDY Pensioner Education Supplement) may be taken by Smart Centre Telephony staff where&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the student advises a change in circumstances which affects their eligibility for ABSTUDY, or</li>
		<li>
the student voluntarily ceases payments, <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
the action does not require a complex assessment (for example, cancellation/suspension of an ABSTUDY secondary school boarder record is complex)</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the student requests other assistance from Services Australia, identify if they are eligible for income support and/or other products. If a student has had Working Credits or an Income Bank in the last 12 months, they may be eligible to <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07020000-01.html">restore their previous Working Credits or transfer their Income Bank balance to Working Credits</a>. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the student is looking for work they may <a href="../job-seekers/001-19051556-01.html">qualify for JobSeeker Payment (JSP)</a> or <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-06030000-01.html">YA (job seeker)</a>.</p>
