<p>If a job seeker claiming or receiving income support payment becomes unemployed, the reasons for separation from employment must be established. This can happen via a SU1 or is based on the job seekers statement at new claim.</p>

<p>Review the reason for unemployment. Where both the job seeker's and employer's statements indicate unemployment was not voluntary or due to misconduct, a compliance investigation does not need to be generated. For example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Shortage of work</li>
		<li>
Unsuitability for this type of work</li>
		<li>
End of seasonal contract</li>
		<li>
Redundancy</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the employer has indicated any of the following reasons for unemployment, more information may be required to identify if a compliance action should be generated&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Unsatisfactory work performance</li>
		<li>
Misconduct as an employee</li>
		<li>
Employee ceasing work voluntarily</li>
		<li>
The employer has not indicated the reason for separation</li>
		<li>
Other</li>
		</ul>
<p>If&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the job seeker and employer statement differ or it is unclear if the reasons for unemployment occurred are voluntary or due to misconduct, <a href="../job-seekers/001-10060000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Identifying_vol_Step02">go to Step 2</a></li>
		<li>
there is no disagreement between the job seeker and employer statement that unemployment was voluntary or due to misconduct, <a href="../job-seekers/001-10060000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Identifying_vol_Step03">go to Step 3</a></li>
		<li>
both the job seeker's and employer's statements indicate unemployment was not voluntary or due to misconduct, do not generate a failure. Procedure ends here</li>		</ul>

<p>A compliance investigation is only generated where it is likely that the job seeker is unemployed due to a voluntary act or dismissed due to misconduct.</p>

<p>Advise the job seeker further information is required to establish their reasons for unemployment. Explain that income support payments made to job seekers are intended to provide support to those who are unable to support themselves. Leaving suitable work voluntarily or due to misconduct can affect whether income support payments can be paid.</p>

<p>Annotate the Progress of Claim <strong>DOC</strong>, where required, with the jobseeker's statement outlining their reasons for leaving work. Include any additional information that the job seeker has been asked to provide and the due date, to support their statement. Check the reason for unemployment on the SU1 or job seeker statement.</p>

<p>Further contact with an employer is required where&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the employer has provided additional information or free text that contradicts the reason for separation selected on the SU1</li>

the discussion with the job seeker gives rise to considerable doubt as to the nature of separation, or contradicts statements made by the employer</li>
		<li>
'unsatisfactory work performance' is recorded but there is no further explanation as to what this means</li>
		<li>
'other' reason is recorded, however the SU1 does not include adequate information to establish the reason for separation</li>
		<li>
the employer did not indicate a reason for separation</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>If contact with the employer is successful, or is not required&#58;</strong></p>

<p>Compliance action only applies if the work was suitable for the job seeker based on their individual circumstances at the time that they left the employment.

<p>If work was considered suitable and the job seeker has left voluntarily, consider their reasons for leaving. If they have a reasonable excuse, a penalty will not be applied.</p>

<p>All factors that significantly and directly impacted the decision to leave work are relevant matters for consideration. These include, but are not limited to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
age</li>
		<li>
mobility</li>
		<li>
qualifications</li>
		<li>
language proficiency</li>
		<li>
stability of accommodation</li>
		<li>
personal issues</li>
		<li>
behavioural issues</li>
		<li>
work history</li>
		<li>
geographical location</li>
		<li>
family and caring responsibilities</li>
		</ul>
<p>Leaving work voluntarily and accessing or increasing the reliance on a participation payment is a serious consideration. It is generally not reasonable for a job seeker to leave work for factors within their control.</p>

<p>For these reasons, the assessment of whether the voluntary unemployment was reasonable is usually related to whether the work was untenable or not, that is, the work had become unsuitable or it was unreasonable to remain in that job due to work related factors.</p>

<p>Further considerations to determine if the job seeker left work voluntarily may include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
any efforts made by the job seeker to retain their employment, for example, did they discuss issues they were experiencing with management and if so what action was taken</li>
		<li>
did they notify anyone of their decision to leave employment (include names, position and contact details)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Factors related to personal reasons outside of the job that do not make the work unreasonable include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
wishing to relocate to be near children, a new partner or re-join an ex-partner</li>
		<li>
wishing to relocate to a more agreeable climate or location, or</li>
		<li>
wanting to take up a sporting commitment or relocate pending retirement</li>
		</ul>
<p>Such reasons are not generally regarded as being reasonable for leaving work. A person would usually be expected to obtain new work to accommodate their external interests without having to rely on a participation payment.</p>

<p>Similarly, leaving work because the work or contract was going to be ceasing in the near future is not regarded as reasonable where the job seeker did not have another job to go to.</p>

<p>The compliance investigation focuses on establishing the facts relevant to the non-compliance event under consideration. This will enable an evidence-based decision in line with the legislative framework and policy intent.</p>

<p>When investigating whether a job seeker was dismissed due to misconduct, the relevant matters that must be considered include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
whether the employment was suitable work, and</li>
		<li>
whether an incident of misconduct occurred</li>
		</ul>
<p>The investigation does not consider whether the employee was correctly terminated or if the job seeker had a reasonable excuse for the misconduct. This is because misconduct is a behaviour within the job seeker's control. Where misconduct has occurred this is never considered reasonable.</p>

<p>Service Officers conducting the compliance investigation for new claims must attempt to contact the job seeker via an outbound call. Before calling, send a <a target="_blank" href="../self-service/133-05000000-03.html">pre-call desktop message (SMS)</a>.</p>

<p>Was the contact successful?</p>
		<ul>		<li>

Select the event date of the compliance action from the Outstanding section of the Participation Compliance Workflows screen to launch the Compliance Investigation workflow and review the information previously recorded.</p>

<p>When assessing the employer's reason for terminating employment, it is important to ensure the reason for termination was for misconduct at work and not because of the employee's general behaviour.</p>

<p>It would generally not be appropriate to apply compliance action if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the job seeker's individual circumstance led to an inability to produce satisfactory work</li>
		<li>
the job seeker's personal circumstances resulted in an inability to control their behaviour or to understand that such behaviour was not appropriate</li>
		<li>
dismissal was due to a very minor breach of conduct (such as being minimally late for work on a single occasion), the job seeker was not warned of dismissal, and was genuinely and reasonably unaware that their action or inaction would result in dismissal. However, some incidents that may seem minor, such as being late, can have significant repercussions for businesses and their reputations</li>
		</ul>
<p>It would be appropriate to apply compliance action where there is sufficient evidence to establish that dismissal was a result of&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a deliberate failure to produce/deliver a reasonable amount of work</li>
		<li>
unauthorised absences from duty without good reason</li>
		<li>
improper behaviour or practices, such as theft, assault or harassment of other employees or customers</li>
		<li>
actions that cause serious risk to the health or safety of other employees or customers</li>
		<li>
actions that threaten the reputation, viability or profitability of the business</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the job seeker is seeking an independent investigation by an external body into the reasons for the termination of employment, this process is outside the UNPP investigation and decision.</p>

<p>PST-skilled Service Officers or Service Officers with a UNPP security resource must complete their investigation using the evidence available at the time of the decision.</p>
