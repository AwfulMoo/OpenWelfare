<p>To record maintenance income received by a person who is not the natural or adoptive parent of the child, move the child from a non-biological child group to an active entitlement group and then update the Maintenance Action Test (MAT) code for the child to '<strong>NBP</strong>'. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-51050000-01.html">How to group children</a>.</p>

<p>Use the Maintenance Action workflow to record the maintenance income for a child or an entitlement group.</p>

<p>Correcting/deleting previous details needs to be done manually but only if those details were incorrectly coded when they were recorded. Details can only be corrected or deleted from the same screen on which the details were originally recorded. That is, on the child level screen or the group level screen.</p>

<p>To view Child Support assessment&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>In Process Direct&#58;</strong></li>
			<ul>			<li>
Go to the <strong>MNGS</strong> screen </li>
			<li>
Select the expand icon on the <strong>Maintenance Groups</strong> table for the relevant maintenance group</li>		</ul>

			<li>
Select the group or child to go to the Mtce Entitlement Group Detl (<strong>MNGD</strong>) or Mtce Child Details Summary (<strong>MNCD</strong>) screen.</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>If the customer advises of these circumstances, follow the relevant procedure&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
They wish to claim child support arrears for a private collect period when changing collection methods, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-51040030-01.html">Centrelink action when a Child Support collection customer is owed or receives child support arrears</a>. <br>Procedure ends here</li>
		<li>
They cannot privately collect the full amount of the child support assessment and would like to apply for an exemption (full or partial), see <a href="../separated-parents/277-51070060-01.html">Family Tax Benefit customer not receiving full child support entitlement privately</a>. <br>Procedure ends here</li>

<p>Voluntary maintenance is a payment/benefit received by a person who does not have a child support case for the relevant children.</p>

<p>Voluntary maintenance does not need to be coded if the customer has accepted the base rate for the children, as the FTB for the child/ren is restricted to the base rate. If the customer contacts to advise of any voluntary maintenance in this circumstance, the discussion should be recorded in a <strong>Note</strong>/<strong>DOC</strong>.</p>

<p>Maintenance income is affected when entitlement details are transferred from Child Support.</p>

<p>Voluntary maintenance is included in annual maintenance income. </p>

<p>Voluntary maintenance received during a DMA (Deciding Maintenance Action) period <strong>before</strong> a child support assessment has been completed will be included in the Maintenance Income Test (MIT) from the date that the voluntary maintenance started.</p>

<p><strong>Conversion of foreign currency amounts received directly from payer (overseas maintenance order cases)</strong></p>

<p>Where a customer is privately collecting an overseas court ordered amount from an overseas payer and the court order refers to the amount in a foreign currency, convert the amount into Australian dollars before coding. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-08020000-01.html">Foreign exchange rate processing for exchange rate conversion information.</a> </p>

<p>If a court order does not stipulate a dollar amount, but includes a percentage of the payer's ongoing income, customers need to provide evidence of the actual amount received, for example bank statements. The exchange conversion should then be applied to the start date of the period the payment relates to.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; there is no automatic process to review the exchange rate for these cases. Therefore a manual 'exchange rate' (Q888) Free Text letter needs to be issued in Customer First to notify the customer that the rate may be reviewed on request if the exchange rate used by Services Australia, differs by more than 5% from the current commercial rate. Also, where the amount of maintenance collected changes, they must notify the agency. </p>

<p>The <a href="../separated-parents/277-51030010-05.html">Resources</a> page contains text details for the (Q888) Free Text letter.</p>

<p>Record details on a <strong>Note/DOC</strong> and when satisfied with the outcome finalise activity.</p>

<p><strong>Voluntary maintenance received during a DMA period</strong></p>

<p>Where a customer has a child in a DMA period and that child has voluntary maintenance coded, the maintenance income in respect of the child is assessed in the MIT from the date the voluntary maintenance started and not from the start of the DMA period (unless the voluntary maintenance is recorded for the same date). </p>

<p>The <a href="../separated-parents/277-51030010-05.html">Resources</a> page contains examples.</p>

<p>Record actual private maintenance income received in relation to arrears that were accrued in a private collection period prior to 1 July 2012 or income where the customer has a partial maintenance exemption.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> prior to 1 July 2012, if the customer had a private arrangement to receive less than their full child support entitlement, they would fail the MAT unless they applied for collection by Child Support or were granted an exemption by a social worker. For example, due to family and domestic violence.</p>

<p>From 1 July 2012, if the customer has a private arrangement to receive less than their full child support entitlement, they will no longer fail the MAT. Instead, the customer is deemed to receive their full child support entitlement for the purpose of the Maintenance Income Test if it is reasonable for the payee to take action to privately collect their full entitlement. The customer may be able to apply for a partial exemption from the MAT.

<p>Recording actual amounts of privately collected maintenance where the customer has been granted a backdated full maintenance exemption, for example, family and domestic violence cases and a private collect child support assessment exists for that period.</p>

<p>When a customer has a private collect child support case and there are family and domestic violence circumstances present, it may be appropriate for a Social Worker to backdate an exemption.</p>

<p>The backdating of the exemption is to offset the effect of child support that the customer was deemed to have received, but may not have received due to the family and domestic violence circumstances. This enables Centrelink to re-assess their FTB entitlement based on the actual amount of child support they received during this period.</p>

<p>Customers can no longer ask Child Support to backdate the case end to align with the exemption start date. This means that where the customer is granted a full exemption from a date in the past, additional coding is required by Centrelink to remove the uncollected child support from the Maintenance Income Test (MIT).</p>
