<p><strong>Secretary Determinations of Temporary Financial Hardship</strong></p>

<p>A bushfire hits a small rural community and the only child care service in the area is burnt down.</p>

<p>Services Australia decides to make a determination of temporary financial hardship for all families with children attending the service in recognition of the additional costs they will incur in finding alternative child care arrangements.</p>

<p>In this scenario, the families need not apply to Services Australia for the determination. Families may need to confirm they are in financial hardship as a result of the bushfire.</p>

<p>A customer's partner dies and did not have life insurance. The customer has a part-time job (working 2 days a week) and has 3 children. As a result of the customer's partner's death, the customer is struggling to pay for child care fees as well as mortgage and other unforeseen expenses relating to the death.</p>

<p>The customer is experiencing temporary financial hardship and has had a substantial reduction in the ability to pay child care fees, as a direct result of the partner's death.</p>

<p>Example 2&#58;</p>

<p>A customer was a high income earner who recently lost their job and has now commenced casual work. Although they still estimate a relatively high income for the financial year, the family are struggling to pay child care fees as well as the mortgage and other financial commitments.</p>

<p>A customer has taken 2 weeks of leave without pay from their job for the purpose of recovering from minor surgery. This would not be considered to constitute a substantial reduction in the ability to pay child care fees, unless there is compelling evidence to support the determination of financial hardship.</p>

<p>Example 2&#58;</p>

<p>A customer applies for ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship) following a recent separation. The customer has steady employment income and is paying child care fees for 3 children. While the separation has caused a reduction in household income, the customer is deemed not to be in financial hardship as they were unable to demonstrate and provide evidence to show they are experiencing a substantial reduction in the ability to pay for child care fees.</p>

<p>The reduction in household income following separation was insufficient to demonstrate temporary financial hardship.</p>

<p>A customer and their partner's house was inundated by flood waters and the family needed to move into rented accommodation. Three weeks later, the customer's temporary employment came to an end. Both events were included in the ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship) application.</p>

<p>The financial burden of paying both a home loan and rent as a result of damage to their home was sufficient to grant the application.</p>

<p>The cessation of temporary employment was not considered for the purpose of this application. This means a further application could be made if the loss of employment continued to have an impact on the capacity to pay for child care fees after 13 weeks for the event granted expired.</p>

<p><strong>Multiple events - more than 1 considered</strong></p>

<p>A customer's house burns down, but this does not result in temporary financial hardship as the insurance company covered a significant amount of costs associated with relocation. However, the death of the customer's partner (a month later) and the loss of this income on top of extra out of pocket costs associated with the house burning down results in financial stress and a substantial reduction in the ability to pay child care for the 2 children.</p>

<p>The cumulative effect of both of these circumstances resulted in ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship) being granted. As both circumstances were considered in the decision, no further applications can be made for these 2 circumstances in the future.</p>

<p>A customer and their partner's house was inundated by flood waters and the family needed to move into rented accommodation. Three weeks later, the temporary employment came to an end.</p>

<p>The financial burden of paying both a home loan and rent for temporary accommodation (as a result of the flood) was sufficient to grant the application. The customer received the subsidy for 13 weeks.</p>

<p>As the cessation of temporary employment was not considered in the first determination, the customer makes a second application for ACCS (Temporary Hardship), producing evidence to support the application demonstrating the loss of employment continued to have a substantial impact on the customer's capacity to pay for child care fees.</p>

<p>A determination was made for a subsequent 13 weeks for the loss of employment event. The start date of this determination was directly after the first determination of 13 weeks ended.</p>

<p>A customer resigns from their job. A month later, part of the customer's home is damaged (roof and a front room) when a tree falls on the house. The customer does not have a mortgage, has savings available, and receives weekly rent from 2 investment properties owned.

<p>The Service Officer determines the customer's resignation does not meet eligibility criteria (for loss of employment) as a Temporary Financial Hardship event. While the customer experienced some damage to the house, it was not severe and the customer was still able to live in the house. After considering both circumstances, and their cumulative effect, it was determined the did not experience a substantial reduction in the ability to pay child care fees.</p>

<p><strong>Same Temporary Financial Hardship event – varying a previous determination</strong></p>

<p>A customer had been granted the full 13 weeks of ACCS TFH however due to stage 4 COVID-19 lockdown, was unable to send his child to childcare for the last 5 weeks of the 13 week period already granted for ACCS TFH. </p>

<p>The Service Provider submitted session reports with absences and decided not to waive the gap fee. The customer requests to vary the ACCS TFH period because they were able to pay the gap fees and did not require the ACCS TFH for this 5 week period as they were no longer in financial hardship. However, they need the remaining 5 weeks of ACCS TFH to assist with paying the full fees now that the child is able to return to child care.</p>

<p>The customer can voluntarily reduce the previous determination to reduce the number of weeks that they were granted. However, they will need to reapply for ACCS TFH for the same event and meet normal eligibility rules to be assessed for any remaining entitlement of ACCS TFH for the same event.</p>

<p><strong>ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship) applications and multiple children</strong></p>

<p>A customer and their partner have 4 children who attend child care. The customer applies for ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship) having suffered financial hardship when their house was lost in a fire.</p>

<p>While the customer could have nominated all 4 children in the application, only 2 of the children were nominated. ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship) is granted for 13 weeks for these 2 children.</p>

<p>Just before the 13 weeks expire, the customer applies for ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship) for the same event and nominates the other 2 children. The customer is again granted ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship) for 13 weeks for the other 2 children as the customer is able to demonstrate they are still suffering financial hardship and a reduction in ability to pay child care fees.</p>

<p>While the overall benefit is the same, separating the children into different claims helped the customer and partner to spread the additional support over a longer period while the home was rebuilt.</p>

<p><strong>Change of Circumstances</strong></p>

<p>A customer has left their home because of family violence and is living in a motel room with their small children. The cost of the motel was taken into account when a decision was made to grant ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship) for 13 weeks.</p>

<p>Six weeks later, the customer gains long term accommodation that is subsidised. The customer advises Services Australia of the change, attaching the new lease and evidence to demonstrate the additional costs being incurred in setting up the new home.</p>

<p>Services Australia reviews the new information to determine whether the customer's ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship) should be cancelled. Due to the ongoing expenses being incurred, impacting the ability to pay child care fees, the Service Officer varies the determination to 10 weeks, giving the customer additional support whilst setting up the new home.</p>

<p><strong>Exceptional Circumstances - Granting more than 120%</strong></p>

<p>A customer and their partner operate an isolated farm (2 hours from the nearest town) and use In Home Care (IHC) to look after their 2 children. They receive CCS only and their IHC service fee is $43 per hour.</p>

<p>Their property, including their home, is flooded. They move into the nearest town and IHC continues in their new temporary home. They apply for ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship), which is granted for 13 weeks.</p>

<p>The customer and their partner also need to tend to the stock affected by the flood, bringing in emergency feed supplies and travelling backwards and forwards to the farm each day. They ask to be considered for exceptional circumstances to cover the cost of child care and the increased hours required.</p>

<p>The customer was advised to speak to their IHC service regarding the increased ACCS percentage. Their service is responsible for applying to the Department of Education, Skills and Employment for an increased ACCS. The Department of Education, Skills and Employment will notify Services Australia (Level 3 Policy Helpdesk) if the increased percentage is approved.</p>

<p>In relation to additional hours, the request was referred to the Level 2 Policy Helpdesk for assessment with all relevant information and evidence included.</p>

<p>Due to the travel to and from the farm each day (it would be dangerous to travel alone), the customer is granted 140 hours per fortnight of subsidised care to take into account their additional 4 hours of travel each day.</p>

<p>Evidence used for the exceptional circumstances was in part information known to Services Australia - change of address and Rent Certificate - and additional information provided by the customer and partner.</p>

<p><strong>Exceptional Circumstances - Granting more than 100 hours</strong></p>

<p>A customer was recently involved in a car accident, in which their partner passed away. The customer has no other family or support group to assist with their caring responsibilities. An application for ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship) was granted for 13 weeks due to the financial hardship caused by the event.</p>

<p>The customer needs an urgent operation as a result of the accident and will be in hospital for 3 weeks, with a further at home recovery period of 6 weeks. During the recuperation period the customer has been advised against exertion in any way and will be taking strong medication, meaning they will not be able to adequately care for the 2 children.</p>

<p>The customer applies to Services Australia for 24-hour care a day for the 2 children, for the 6 weeks to cover the period of time in hospital and the recuperation period. The request was referred to the Level 2 Policy Helpdesk for assessment with all relevant information and evidence included. Based on the letter from the customer's doctor advising of the inability to care for children during recuperation, an Exceptional Circumstances Activity Test Result of 336 hour is granted for 6 weeks.</p>
