<p><strong>Customer received Lump Sum Bereavement Payment (LBP), then requests Partner Bereavement Payment (PBV)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Example A&#58;</strong></p>

<p>Ashleigh and Sam are a couple and were both receiving Youth Allowance (YA) as long-term social security recipients. Ashleigh advises Services Australia Sam died 2 weeks ago.</p>

<p>Ashleigh was issued an LBP of $2,500 immediately and the bereavement calculator showed that Ashleigh's PBV entitlement would be $2,700. The Q150 letter to Ashleigh included an invitation to apply for PBV and the SA490 PBV form.</p>

<p>Ashleigh returned the SA490 form the following week and a net payment of $200 PBV was issued.</p>

<p>The $2,700 PBV was offset by the $2,500 LBP already received.</p>

<p>The One Off Payment (<strong>OOP</strong>) screen now shows the LBP amount of $2,500 has been deleted and replaced by the PBV amount of $2,700.</p>

<p>Ashleigh has no debt raised for the LBP, as it has been fully offset by the PBV amount.</p>

<p><strong>Example B&#58;</strong></p>

<p>Fern and Peter are a couple and both were receiving JobSeeker Payment (JSP) as long-term social security recipients. Fern advises Services Australia that Peter died 2 weeks ago.</p>

<p>Fern was issued LBP of $3,000 immediately and the bereavement calculator showed that Fern's PBV entitlement would be $2,900. The Q150 letter was sent to Fern, but did not include an invitation to claim PBV.</p>

<p>3 weeks later Fern advised Fern wanted to claim PBV, as they were pregnant.</p>

<p>The bereavement calculator showed that Fern's PBV entitlement would be $2,900, based on Fern being 27 weeks pregnant when Peter died.</p>

<p>Fern was advised that Fern's PBV entitlement would be less than the LBP received. If Fern decided they still wanted to receive PBV, Fern would have a $100 debt raised for the LBP, as the offset of the PBV amount would be insufficient to cover the LBP.</p>

<p>The <strong>OOP</strong> screen would show the LBP amount of $3,000 as deleted and replaced by the PBV amount of $2,900.</p>

<p>Miranda claimed JobSeeker Payment (JSP) after their husband Leo died suddenly in an accident 3 weeks ago. Miranda received PBV of $2,800, but did not realise they were pregnant when they made the JSP claim.</p>

<p>Two weeks later, Miranda advises they are 16 weeks pregnant and provides a medical certificate with an expected date of confinement.</p>

<p>Miranda is now entitled to PBV of $5,350, which is based on being 11 weeks pregnant when Leo died.</p>

<p>A net payment of $2,550 is issued, as the $2,800 initial PBV has been topped up to reflect the current entitlement of $5,350.</p>

<p>The One Off Payment (<strong>OOP</strong>) screen now shows the PBV amount of $2,800 has been deleted and replaced by the new PBV amount of $5,350.</p>

<p>Carly and Hugh are a couple and were both receiving JSP as long-term social security recipients when Carly told us Hugh had died 3 weeks ago.</p>

<p>Carly was issued Lump Sum Bereavement Payment (LBP) of $2,700 immediately and the bereavement calculator showed that Carly's PBV entitlement would be $3,000. The Q150 letter to Carly included an invitation to apply for PBV and the SA490 PBV form.</p>

<p>Carly returned the SA490 form 2 weeks later and net payment of $300 PBV was issued. On the form, Carly advised Carly was not pregnant.</p>

<p>The $3,000 PBV was offset by the $2,700 LBP already received.</p>

<p>The One Off Payment (<strong>OOP</strong>) screen now shows the LBP amount of $2,700 has been deleted and replaced by the PBV amount of $3,000.</p>

<p>Carly has no debt raised for the LBP, as it has been fully offset by the PBV amount.</p>

<p>4 weeks later, Carly contacts us again to say they are 17 weeks pregnant and provides a medical certificate verifying this.</p>

<p>Carly is now entitled to PBV of $5,700, which is based on being 8 weeks pregnant when Hugh died.</p>

<p>A net payment of $2,700 is issued, as the $3,000 initial PBV has been topped up to reflect the current entitlement of $5,700.</p>

<p><strong>JSP customer claiming DSP when partner dies</strong></p>

<p>David, a JobSeeker Payment (JSP) customer, is claiming Disability Support Pension (DSP). David's claim had not been finalised when they advised their wife Sophia died. Sophia was receiving Age Pension. David was not a long-term social security recipient, so is not entitled to Lump Sum Bereavement Payment (LBP).</p>

<p>Death action on Sophia's record is held, pending the finalisation of David's DSP claim, which is referred for priority processing.</p>

<p>David's DSP is rejected, so PBV of $2,500 is paid.</p>

<p>David appeals the rejection. The appeal is successful and DSP is subsequently granted. David is now entitled to LBP of $2,000, which needs to be issued manually.</p>

<p>The PBV is not included in the benefit transfer adjustment amount, so is raised as a debt. There is no automatic offsetting of the LBP by the PBV.</p>
