<p>This document outlines how to determine unemployment for JobSeeker Payment (JSP) and Youth Allowance (YA) (job seeker).</p>
<div class="twisty">
	
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Eligibility_cri"></a>
<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Eligibility criteria</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>For a customer to qualify for JSP they must be unemployed. A customer cannot qualify for YA as a job seeker if they are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
employed in full-time paid work, or</li>
		<li>
employed on a full-time basis as an apprentice or trainee</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> YA customers starting a full-time Australian Apprenticeship may still be entitled to YA subject to the income test, but <strong>not</strong> as a job seeker.</p>

<p>Customers who are employed or studying and are <a href="../job-seekers/001-03020060-01.html">unable to undertake work or study due to a medical condition, illness or injury</a> and have a job or study to return to may still be eligible for JobSeeker Payment.</p>

<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Determine_if_cu"></a>
<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Determine if customer is unemployed</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>For JSP/YA (job seeker), an unemployed person can be broadly described as someone who is without paid work. But not everyone who is without paid work is unemployed, and some people in paid work can still be considered unemployed for JSP/YA (job seeker). Determining whether a person is unemployed at a particular time will depend on several factors.</p>

<p>All of the customer's circumstances need to be considered in determining whether they are unemployed.</p>

<p>As per Section 595 of the Social Security Act 1991, discretion should be exercised when determining unemployment to encourage increased workforce participation, rather than providing a disincentive for people to increase their hours of work. The extent of a person's compliance with any applicable <a href="../job-seekers/001-09020000-01.html">mutual obligation requirements</a> can be useful in determining whether a person is genuinely committed to engagement in the labour market.</p>

<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Selfemployed"></a>
<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Self-employed</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A person engaged in <a href="../business-and-employers/043-03030000-01.html">self-employment</a> may be regarded as unemployed if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the activity is on a small scale and designed to supplement income, rather than as an alternative to wages</li>
		<li>
the person invests capital in the business, but not time or effort</li>
		<li>
the business is a contracting or sub-contracting enterprise</li>
		</ul>
<p>If net income received from the business does not preclude payment and the customer can satisfy <a href="../job-seekers/001-09020000-01.html">mutual obligation requirements</a> based on their income and hours worked, a self-employed customer may receive payment and be considered unemployed. Job seekers with an Australian Business Number (ABN) are not automatically assumed to be self-employed. There is <strong>no</strong> requirement for customers with an ABN to have this cancelled to qualify for JSP or YA (job seeker).</p>

<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Unemployed due to stand down or industrial action</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p><strong>Stand down</strong></p>

<p>A stand down occurs when an employer is unable to offer an employee work for a short period of time, without having their employment terminated. Such a stand down could include a situation where a factory closes down for a few weeks over the Christmas holiday period or if a company has a short term lack of work. A customer who has been stood down is considered to be unemployed, even if the stand down is only temporary.</p>

<p>See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-05020110-01.html">Unemployed due to stand down</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Industrial action</strong></p>

<p>Depending on the circumstances that has led to industrial action, a customer may not be qualified for payment and may be required to serve an exclusion period.</p>

<p>See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-05020100-01.html">Unemployed Due to Industrial Action (UDIA)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Mature age</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A person aged 55 or over may still be regarded as unemployed, even though they may be participating in voluntary work and/or part-time work to fully meet their <a href="../job-seekers/001-09020000-01.html">mutual obligation requirements</a>.</p>

<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Casual employees</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>In some circumstances, such as when a customer is working casually, the Social Security Act 1991 allows them to continue to be considered unemployed even though they are not without paid work.</p>

<p>The duration of the employment, the hours worked and other relevant factors should be considered when determining whether a person can be deemed to be unemployed.</p>

<p>In general, a person working casually would not be regarded as unemployed if work in which earnings were sufficient to preclude payment of JSP/YA (job seeker) continued, or were expected to continue, for 12 weeks or more.</p>

<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Students</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>In general, full-time students are not considered to be job seekers and do not qualify for JSP/YA (job seeker) as they are not unemployed.</p>

<p>In most circumstances when a person is studying full-time, they should test their eligibility for a student payment.</p>

<p>To qualify for JSP/YA (job seeker), they should give up their studies or reduce their study-load to part-time, and should be willing to accept work if it is offered.</p>

<p>However, in certain circumstances a person studying full-time can qualify for JSP where they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
have transferred to the payment from Disability Support Pension (DSP) or Parenting Payment (PP) as a single person and were receiving Pensioner Education Supplement (PES) at the time, provided they are continuing in the same course for which they were receiving PES, or</li>
		<li>
are single principal carers receiving JSP and granted PES</li>
		</ul>
<p>JSP or YA (job seeker) are subject to normal <a href="../job-seekers/001-09020000-01.html">mutual obligation requirements</a>.</p>

<p>In some circumstances, a customer studying full-time can satisfy mutual obligation requirements when the <a href="../job-seekers/001-09070020-01.html">study is treated as an approved activity</a>.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A person who is on leave from their usual employment, whether paid or not, is not usually unemployed as their contract of employment is ongoing.</p>

<p>If the employer refuses to re-employ the person before the end of the leave, the leave is unpaid and no benefits are accruing while on leave, the person may be regarded as unemployed subject to mutual obligation requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the expectant mother exemption only applies from 6 weeks prior to the estimated date of birth and ends on the date of birth (whether or not the child is born alive). Expectant mothers should be encouraged to investigate their eligibility for Parenting Payment.
