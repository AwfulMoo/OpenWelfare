<p>The Pension Bonus Scheme closed to new registrations from 1 July 2014.</p>

<p>However, existing members may remain in the scheme and claim their bonus in due course, in line with existing arrangements.</p>

<p>A person can only claim the bonus if they registered in the scheme before 1 July 2014 and has not received an income support payment (except Carer Payment or Carer Service Pension) since first qualifying for Age Pension. Once registered, they must be an accruing member who meets the work test requirements, or a non-accruing member. A minimum period of 1 year must be accrued up to a maximum of 5 years to claim the PBP. A person can work for more than 5 years and remain a member of PBS as long as they continue to meet the work test (or be non-accruing).</p>

<p>PBP will be calculated on the last 5 full bonus years accrued. Work after age 75 years (age 70 years under the Department of Veterans' Affairs scheme) cannot contribute to the PBP. A post-75 member of the scheme must continue to meet the work test or be in a non-accruing period. Only accruing membership can be counted toward a member’s bonus. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> a post-75 PBS member in a disposal preclusion period must meet the work test. Periods of deferment prior to 1 July 1998 do not count.</p>

<p>The claim period is generally 13 weeks from when the member ceases to be accruing or non-accruing, although there can be an exception when the last bonus period is a part year period. Since 1 January 2008, there is a new provision to accept late claims for PBP made after 13 weeks if special circumstances exist, for example due to their illness or a family member's illness.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>There are 3 possible claim scenarios, depending on whether the member's <strong>last</strong> bonus period was a&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Full year</strong></li>
			<ul>			<li>
If a registered member of the PBS has <strong>both</strong> deferred claiming Age Pension for 1 year <strong>and</strong> worked 960 hours in that year, 1 full year bonus period has been accrued. The 960 hours can be worked at any time during the member's full year bonus period</li>
			<li>
If a member has accrued 1 or more full bonus periods and does not return to work, Age Pension and PBP must be claimed within 13 weeks after the end of the last full bonus period unless special circumstances exist</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Part year</strong></li>
			<ul>			<li>
When a member has accrued 1 or more full bonus periods and only works a part year in the last bonus period, the part year period can count if the work test is met</li>
			<li>
To be paid for the entire deferment period, including the part year period, the claim for Age Pension and PBP must be lodged within 13 weeks of ceasing to meet the work test. Claims made after 13 weeks if special circumstances exist may be accepted, but the part year is forfeited. When special circumstances exist there is some discretion to accept a late claim and if accepted the part year accrued still cannot be counted in the overall deferment period. Only full bonus periods can be counted</li>
			<li>
The date the member ceased to meet the work test for the part-year may be closely estimated using the work record table in the Pension Bonus Scheme work record form on the department’s website. The <a href="../older-australians/065-01010030-05.html">Resources</a> page contains a link</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Non-accruing period</strong></li>
			<ul>			<li>
If the member does not return to work after a <a href="../older-australians/065-07030020-01.html">non-accruing period</a>, Age Pension and the PBP must be claimed within 13 weeks of the end of the non-accruing period. The member can only be paid a bonus calculated on the number of years and days accrued before the commencement of the final non-accruing period.</li>

		<div class="block">

<p>Services Australia can accept PBP claims lodged up to 2 years after Age Pension was granted if the failure to claim PBP at the time was due in part to administrative error.</p>

<p>The following criteria must be met&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The person was a registered member of the scheme for more than 12 months</li>
		<li>
Administrative error played a part in the person not claiming PBP when they claimed Age Pension (for example the person's registration in the scheme was not noticed when indexing the claim or the PBP section was not completed)</li>
		<li>
The claim for Age Pension must have been lodged within 13 weeks of the PBS member failing the work test or within 13 weeks after a period of non-accruing membership ends unless there were other circumstances as outlined in the Guide to Social Security Law 3.4.7.80 under the headings 'Discretion to accept late claims' and 'Reasons to accept late claims' that would have allowed late lodgement of PBS claim</li>
