<P>Discuss the method of assessment with the customer. Request a profit and loss statement and suggest completion of a 3 month estimated profit and loss. </P>
<P>If a customer is unable to supply their own profit and loss statement, issue a <A href="../business-and-employers/043-03110050-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Forms">Profit and Loss Statement (SU580)</A>.</P>

A SU580 can be issued for the customer to complete. Every 3 months after the initial profit and loss statement has been provided, the customer must supply a new interim profit and loss statement that covers the full period from the start date of self-employment. Profit and loss statements should continue to be used for assessments until the recipient has lodged an income tax return which covers self-employment income for a period of 12 months</LI>
<LI>If this is a new customer with an existing business that has traded for a full financial year, the latest tax return should be supplied. If this is not indicative of the current state of the business it would be advisable for the customer to provide an interim 3 monthly profit and loss statement</LI></UL>
<P>Check that no assets (capital expenses) are included in the interim profit and loss statement as expenses. For more information, see <A href="../business-and-employers/043-03080040-01.html">Steps to assess an interim profit and loss statement</A>.</P>

<LI>This is the preferred method and includes setting reviews, recording real estate linked to a business and recording details on a <STRONG>DOC</STRONG></LI></UL>

<P>Adjust for <A href="../business-and-employers/043-03100020-01.html">non-allowable deductions</A> and non-assessable income such as one-off capital gains that are not part of the normal trading activity of the business by removing them from the profit and loss statement. (Customers may mistakenly include some setting up asset costs as expenses.) Take out investment income for financial assets that have been removed from the balance sheet (as these are to be coded on SVS, SIS or MIS and deemed). See <A href="../business-and-employers/043-03110060-01.html">Assessing sole trader assets</A>. Removing these amounts will give you an adjusted net profit/loss for the business.</P>
<P>If customer receives a wage or salary from the business, this must be added back to the net profit to get adjusted net profit or loss.</P>
<P>For more information, see <A href="../business-and-employers/043-03080040-01.html">Steps to assess an interim profit and loss statement</A>.</P>
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Cash Flow Boost payments paid by the Australian Tax Office to eligible small and medium sized businesses as part of the Australian Government COVID-19 stimulus response are exempt from assessment under section 8(8)(zt) of the Social Security Act 1991, and should not be included when assessing business income for a customer or their partner. Payments will be made for the March to June 2020 and June to September 2020 quarters. As these payments are not assessable income, they will also need to be removed from the profit and loss statement to determine the adjusted net profit/loss for the business.</P>
