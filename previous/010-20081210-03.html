<p>Travel paid for by a student, <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-02100180-01.html">non-student traveller</a>, parent or a third party can be paid as a reimbursement after the approved traveller/s journey has been completed.</p>

<p>ABSTUDY FAA is payable directly to the applicant, student or a third party who paid for, or provided, the transportation service.</p>

<p>Ensure eligibility checks are carried out and all supporting documentation is provided prior to reimbursing travel costs. See <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-02100050-01.html">Reimbursing fares and additional costs after travel has been undertaken for ABSTUDY</a>.</p>

<p>Reimbursement activities will require a booking to be created in TMA with a <strong>Booking Status</strong> of <strong>Reimbursed</strong>.</p>

<p>For non-student travellers, the current process of linking to a student or notional student booking within TMA still applies. Any payment in advance or reimbursement is then keyed on the student’s booking. This coding cannot be carried out against any other traveller type.</p>

<p>For organisations who claim reimbursement for multiple students, the total amount must be apportioned between each student to reflect their actual individual cost. For example, an organisation lodges a&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
bulk reimbursement claim for 10 eligible students, totalling $5,000. This would be apportioned on each student’s record at $500 each and paid to the organisation</li>
		<li>
bulk reimbursement claim for 10 students, totalling $5,000, however only 5 of the students are eligible. The total amount is still apportioned on each student’s record at $500 each, however 5 of these claims will be rejected, and the other 5 will be paid to the organisation</li>
		<li>
reimbursement claim for a charter flight for 10 students totalling $5000, however only 5 of the students are eligible. The total amount in this case must be apportioned between the 5 eligible students at $1000 each. The other 5 students’ claims will be rejected</li>
		</ul>
<p>For reimbursement activities, including claims for <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-02100230-01.html">additional costs</a> only, <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-20081210-03.html#bp03_tbl_Reimbursing_tra_Step02">go to Step 2</a>.</p>

<p>Students claiming payment in advance or reimbursement for an Away from Base activity will require a booking to be created in TMA with a <strong>Booking Status</strong> of <strong>Reimbursed</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> in some scenarios, there may be 2 bookings in TMA for an Away from Base activity. For example, an institution lodges an ABSTUDY Submission for away from base activity funding form (SY034) seeking advance funding, whereas individual students attending this Away from Base activity will seek their own pre-booked travel. see <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-20081210-05.html">Resources</a> for a link to the SY034 form. TMA allows multiple bookings to be made on the same forward travel date when the travel reason of Away from Base is selected.</p>

<p>For non-student travellers, the current process of linking to a student or notional student booking within TMA still applies. Any payment in advance or reimbursement is then coded on the student's booking. This coding cannot be carried out against any other traveller type.</p>

<p>For organisations who request bulk funding for multiple students, the total amount must be apportioned between each student to reflect their actual individual cost to attend the activity. For example, an organisation lodges a&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
bulk Away from Base claim for 10 eligible students, totalling $5,000. This would be apportioned on each student’s record at $500 each and paid to the organisation</li>
		<li>
bulk Away from Base claim for 10 students, totalling $5,000, however only 5 of the students are eligible. The total amount is still apportioned on each student’s record at $500 each, however 5 of these claims will be rejected, and the other 5 will be paid to the organisation</li>
		<li>
claim for a charter flight for 10 students totalling $5000, however only 5 of the students are eligible. The total amount in this case must be apportioned between the 5 eligible students at $1000 each. The other 5 students’ claims will be rejected</li>
		</ul>
<p>For payment/rejection of Away from Base assistance approved in principle, paid in advance or as a reimbursement, <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-20081210-03.html#bp03_tbl_Coding_Away_fro_Step02">go to Step 2</a>.</p>

<p>Separate letters will auto-generate for each payee recorded on the <strong>Reimbursements</strong> tab once the Away from Base activity is <strong>finalised</strong>. The letter only shows the outcome of the components relevant to the respective payees. For example, within an Away from Base claim, customer claims fares and a third party claims for accommodation and meals. In the letters issued, the customer will only see the fares component outcome, whereas the third party will see both the accommodation and meals components.</p>

<p>If a Service Officer determines a letter to the payee is not required (for example, they have notified the claimant by phone or is sending a Q999 to an organisation for a bulk claim), they can prevent the letter from sending by selecting <strong>No</strong> in the <strong>Issue Letter</strong> toggle for that payee.</p>

<p>Once all necessary coding is saved on the <strong>Reimbursements</strong> tab of the applicable Booking ID#, the Change of Circumstances activity (<strong>CoC Status</strong>) will show as <strong>Draft</strong>.</p>

<p>To finalise the Away from Base activity&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Navigate to the <strong>Reimbursements</strong> tab and select the <strong>ID</strong> number hyperlink of any component</li>
		<li>
Process Direct will open in a new window</li>
		<li>
Select <strong>Process</strong></li>
		<li>
Select <strong>Assess</strong>. The Entitlements (<strong>ELD</strong>) screen will display</li>
		<li>
To confirm the correct outcome for each component&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Customer payee type - view the result by navigating to the Payment Summary (<strong>PS</strong>) screen in Process Direct within the activity</li>
			<li>
Third Party or Organisation payee type - access the customer's record in Customer First while still in the provisional activity in Process Direct. Select the started activity from the Event Summary (<strong>ES</strong>) screen and navigate to the <strong>PS</strong> screen. Select the applicable payment from the <strong>PS</strong> screen and navigate to the Payment Details (<strong>PD</strong>) and Third Party Payment Details (<strong>PDD</strong>) screens to view the result</li>
			<li>
Customer First should <strong>only</strong> be accessed to confirm the correct Third Party payee. <strong>Do not amend or finalise the Away from Base activity in Customer First</strong></li>		</ul>
		<li>
If the outcome results in an overpayment&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
navigate to the Assessment Consequences (<strong>ASC</strong>) screen in Process Direct</li>
			<li>
confirm the debt is raised against the CRN of the applicable debtor</li>
			<li>
select <strong>Investigation Reqd</strong> in the <strong>Debt Action</strong> field</li>
			<li>
select <strong>Update</strong></li>		</ul>
		<li>
If the outcome results in unexpected arrears or a Before Limiting Date (<strong>BLD</strong>) line, this must be actioned in Process Direct prior to finalisation, see <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-08170000-01.html">Payment of arrears after reassessment</a></li>
		<li>
Select <strong>Finish</strong></li>
		<li>
If required, add notes in the dialogue box displayed and then select <strong>Finalise</strong></li>
		<li>
Close the message box which confirms the activity has been finalised</li>
		<li>
Close Process Direct and return to TMA</li>
		<li>
The <strong>CoC Status</strong> will still show as <strong>Draft</strong>. To ensure the status displays correctly, navigating to another tab in TMA and back to the <strong>Reimbursements</strong> tab will refresh the <strong>CoC Status</strong> to <strong>Completed</strong></li>
		<li>
If the <strong>Return Travel Date</strong> field on the <strong>Bookings</strong> tab was altered to facilitate payment for travel that occurred prior to the Start Date, this <strong>must</strong> be corrected back to the actual date of the return travel. Where the reimbursement activity has been selected for quality checking, this correction must occur after completion of the quality check</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the <strong>ID</strong> number hyperlink is selected and the activity is <strong>not</strong> completed in the secondary Process Direct window (for example, an error was encountered and the secondary Process Direct window is closed to resolve the error), the <strong>CoC </strong>status in the TMA will display <strong>For Manual Action</strong>. This status denotes a started activity, which <strong>must</strong> be finalised via Process Direct. Cancel the started activity in Customer First, <strong>do not amend or finalise the reimbursement activity in Customer First</strong>. Once the activity in Customer First is cancelled, reselect the <strong>ID</strong> number hyperlink in TMA and follow the process as above. While TMA will auto-record the decision within the <strong>Notes</strong> tab, the outcome must also be recorded on a <strong>DOC</strong> on the Document List (<strong>DL</strong>) screen in the relevant record/s. <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-20081210-03.html#bp03_tbl_Coding_Away_fro_Step12">Go to  Step 12</a>.</p>
