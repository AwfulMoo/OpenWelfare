<p>Staff without the relevant IM-ICT resource must transfer the call to the IM Access Support line.</p>

<p>The following must be actioned&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Ensure the customer's priority needs are being met and sufficient income managed funds are available to cover existing expenses. The results of the priority needs discussion must be recorded on the <strong>Priority Needs Expenses</strong> screen. See <a href="../payment-delivery/103-01040020-01.html">Changes to Income Management priority needs</a></li>
		<li>
Check the <strong>Expense Management Summary</strong> screen to confirm the customer has available funds for a regular UCP. If the customer does not have sufficient funds to issue a 30%/50% UCP, the amount requested should be reduced to an amount to allow for all priority needs to be paid. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> customers can elect a regular UCP for a lower amount than the maximum 30%/50% calculation even where the customer has funds available</li>
		<li>
Explain to the customer there are no restrictions on how their UCP can be spent</li>
		<li>
Advise the customer the UCP will be paid to them, or their payment nominee</li>
		<li>
Go to the Payment Destination Summary (<strong>PAS</strong>) screen and confirm the customer's payment destination for Service Reason '<strong>GPY</strong>' matches the customer's most recent payment type</li>
		<li>
If there are no details recorded, or the account number is incorrect, select '<strong>GPY</strong>' to go to the Payment Destination Details (<strong>PAD</strong>) screen to update account details. See <a href="../payment-delivery/103-04030010-01.html">Changing payment destination</a></li>

completing a Priority Needs discussion with the customer to ensure the customer's and their dependents priority needs are being met and sufficient income managed funds are available to cover existing expenses.

<div class="showcont">


<p>If a customer is in hardship and urgently requires access to their <strong>one-off</strong> UCP, funds can be issued via RTGS or EBT card.</p>

<p>Issuing an Income Management immediate payment via NPP, RTGS or EBT requires the relevant ICT resource and all requests should be sent to the Income Management helpdesk via webform. See the <a href="../payment-delivery/103-01050120-05.html">Resources</a> page for a link to the Income Management helpdesk webform.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the request for payment via RTGS or EBT is outside Income Management helpdesk hours, an Income Management Contact Officer (IMCO), State Income Management Coordinator (SIMCo) or authorised Service Officer in the Income Management Payment and Contact Team (IMPACT) can process the request.</p>

<p>When making a request for an immediate payment, Service Officers must include the following in the webform (where the Income Management helpdesk is available) or in a <strong>DOC</strong> on the customers record (if processing is to be completed by an IMCO, SIMCo or IMPACT Service Officer)&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The exceptional and unforeseen reason for the immediate payment and why the customer is unable to wait the usual processing time (1-2 business days)</li>
		<li>
The amount to be issued via immediate payment method (this may not be the same as the UCP)</li>
		<li>
The most appropriate method of issue for the customer (that is, NPP, RTGS or EBT). <strong>Note&#58;</strong> NPP is the preferred payment option if available. for more information see <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-18092746-01.html">Immediate payment by payment method New Payments Platform (NPP)</a></li>
		<li>
If requesting issue via RTGS, confirm the customer meets current guidelines for this payment method including hours of operation for RTGS and possibility of the customer's financial institution imposing fees and charges. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> RTGS will only appear as the next available payment option if an NPP payment to a customer's account has been unsuccessful (due to their nominated account not being NPP-enable, or the service itself is unavailable). For more information, see <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-10030040-01.html">Immediate payment by payment method Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS)</a></li>
		<li>
If requesting issue via EBT card, include EBT card number and confirm the customer is aware of the terms and conditions, and use of the EBT card. For more information, see <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-10030020-01.html">Immediate payment by payment method Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>When the webform or <strong>DOC</strong> has been finalised, contact the Income Management helpdesk, IMCO, SIMCo or IMPACT to advise of the immediate payment request.</p>
