</DIV>
<P>This document outlines how job seekers managed under the Targeted Compliance Framework are held to account for complying with compulsory requirements.</P>
<P></P>
<DIV class=twisty><A name=bp01_L2GT_Key_principles class=anchor></A>
<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_Key_principles>Key principles</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>The Targeted Compliance Framework is the job seeker compliance system that ensures job seekers serviced by Workforce Australia, Disability Employment Services (DES) and ParentsNext providers, comply with their compulsory mutual obligation requirements in return for receiving a participation payment.</P>
<P>The Targeted Compliance Framework ensures the small percentage of job seekers who repeatedly and deliberately fail to meet their compulsory requirements or who refuse suitable work, are appropriately held to account. At the same time, it provides early support for vulnerable job seekers to help ensure their requirements are appropriate, and a lighter touch for the majority of job seekers who are genuine in their efforts to find work.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P></P>
<DIV class=twisty><A name=bp01_L2GT_Personal_respon class=anchor></A>
<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_Personal_respon>Personal responsibility</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>The Targeted Compliance Framework has a strong emphasis on personal responsibility for meeting compulsory requirements and engagement with providers.</P>
<P>Personal responsibility is about helping to develop or reinforce work-like behaviours by giving job seekers ownership and personal accountability for:</P>
<UL>
<LI>ensuring their provider is aware of their circumstances, this ensures requirements in the current Job Plan/Participation Plan are appropriate and achievable</LI>
<LI>recording Personal Events in the Job Seeker Account calendar to ensure their provider is aware of these when requirements are scheduled</LI>
<LI>maintaining contact with their provider and engaging to their full capacity in compulsory appointments and activities</LI>
<LI>recording their own attendance at requirements where they are capable of doing so</LI>
<LI>accepting all offers of suitable work (<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> ParentsNext participants are not required to look for work), and</LI>
<LI>contacting their provider prior to a requirement or appointment's scheduled start time if unable to attend</LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<UL></UL>

<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_Leaving_or_refu>Leaving or refusing suitable work</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Unemployment and work refusal failures reinforce the expectation that participation payments are only available to those who are genuine in their efforts to move into paid work.</P>
<UL>
<LI>An <STRONG>unemployment failure</STRONG> is committed when a person leaves suitable work voluntarily (without a valid reason) or is dismissed from suitable work due to misconduct. When an unemployment failure is applied:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>Customers claiming a participation payment will be subject to an unemployment preclusion period, affecting the participation payment start day by 4 weeks (6 weeks where they received relocation assistance to move to take up the work)</LI>
<LI>Where a job seeker who is already receiving a participation payment commits an unemployment failure, their participation payment is cancelled and they cannot receive a participation payment is cancelled and they cannot receive a participation payment 4 weeks (6 weeks where they received relocation assistance to move to take up the work). If a job seeker's payment is cancelled for this reason, they will need to re-claim a participation payment to receive future participation payments</LI></UL>
<LI>A <STRONG>work refusal failure</STRONG> has been committed where the job seeker refused, failed to accept or did not commence work that they are capable of doing without a valid reason:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>Job seekers who refuse, fail to accept or commence suitable work have their payment suspended until they re-engage with their provider to discuss their reason for non-compliance</LI>
<LI>To reinforce the seriousness of these failures, participation payments are cancelled with a 4 week post cancellation non-payment period. Job seekers will need to re-claim a participation payment before they can receive a participation payment again</LI></UL></UL>
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> ParentsNext participants are not subject to unemployment failures or work refusal failures as there is no compulsory requirement for them to look for work.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>The TCF consists of 3 zones for job seekers and ParentsNext participants, these zones are called the:</P>
<UL>
<LI>green zone</LI>
<LI>warning zone</LI>
<LI>penalty zone</LI></UL>
<P>All job seekers start their return to work journey in the green zone. Providers are responsible for monitoring compliance with compulsory requirements. A mutual obligation failure occurs when a job seeker fails to comply with a compulsory requirement in their Job Plan or Participation Plan. When a mutual obligation failure occurs the provider records the non-compliance event in the Employment Services System (ESSweb). This may result in suspension of the job seekers payment.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P></P>
<DIV class=twisty><A name=bp01_L2GT_Job_seekers_who class=anchor></A>
<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_Job_seekers_who>Job seekers who are meeting their requirements - the green zone</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>As long as the job seeker is meeting their compulsory requirements, job seekers will remain in this zone for the duration of their time on a participation payment.</P>
<P>Job seekers in this zone are expected to let their provider know of their circumstances to help ensure requirements in their Job/Participation Plan are appropriate and achievable. The job seeker must maintain contact with their provider, engage to their full capacity and record their own attendance at requirements, including appointments and activities. Those who are unable to record or manage their own attendance should discuss this with their provider, or, if they are in Workforce Australia Online, with the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations Digital Services Contact Centre (DSCC). If a job seeker who usually records their own attendance is unable to do so on occasion (for example, due to an internet outage), they must contact their provider or the DSCC before close of business that day to avoid a potential suspension or demerit.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P></P>
<DIV class=twisty><A name=bp01_L2GT_First_mutual_ob class=anchor></A>
<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_First_mutual_ob>First mutual obligation failure in 6 months - entering the warning zone</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>When a mutual obligation failure is identified, the job seeker receives a notice telling them:</P>
<UL>
<LI>they may have missed a mutual obligation requirement, and</LI>
<LI>they must contact their provider within 2 business days to avoid having their payment suspended</LI></UL>
<P>If the job seeker does not contact their provider, their payment will be suspended after 2 business days. Their payment will remain suspended until they contact their provider and meet any reengagement requirements the provider sets.</P>
<P>Once the job seeker contacts, the provider will want to know the reasons why the job seeker failed to comply with the requirement. If the provider decides the job seeker did not have a valid reason for missing their requirement the provider will apply a demerit. The first demerit will move the job seeker from the green zone into the warning zone.</P>
<P>Generally, where a mutual obligation failure has occurred and the job seeker did not have a valid reason one demerit point is accrued. However, mutual obligation failures for non-attendance or misconduct at a job interview or for failing to act on a job offer are more serious and will fast-track the job seeker to the next assessment point. The TCF assessments points are the Capability Interview (conducted by the provider) and the Capability Assessment (conducted by Participation Solutions Team (PST) skilled Service Officers at Services Australia.</P>
<P>Each demerit contributes to the job seeker's demerit point count for 6 months. Job seekers return to the green zone automatically when all demerits expire.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P></P>
<DIV class=twisty><A name=bp01_L2GT_Repeated_nonco class=anchor></A>
<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_Repeated_nonco>Repeated non-compliance in the warning zone - Capability Interviews and Capability Assessments</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Mutual obligation failures, participation suspensions and demerits provide a warning and make it simple and easy for job seekers to understand the consequences of non-compliance and the link between participation and payment.</P>
<P>When a job seeker in the warning zone has a mutual obligation failure, they will receive a notice telling them:</P>
<UL>
<LI>they may have missed a mutual obligation requirement, and</LI>
<LI>they must contact their provider within 2 business days to avoid having their payment suspended</LI></UL>
<P>If the job seeker does not contact their provider, their payment will be suspended after 2 business days. Payment will remain suspended until the job seeker contacts their provider and meets any reengagement requirements the provider sets.</P>
<P>Provider contact following each mutual obligation failure provides the opportunity for job seekers to discuss their reasons for a mutual obligation failure and a chance to identify any circumstances impacting the job seeker's ability to comply with the requirements in their Job/Participation Plan.</P>
<P>Repeated non-compliance may trigger the next assessment point - a Capability Interview or a Capability Assessment. Failures relating to job interviews or job referrals also fast track the job seeker to the next assessment point.</P>
<UL>
<LI>A <STRONG>Capability Interview</STRONG> is conducted by a provider when a job seeker accrues 3 demerits within a 6 month period or has been fast tracked to this assessment point, unless one has already been completed within the previous 8 weeks</LI>
<UL>
<LI>The Capability Interview ensures the provider understands the impact of the job seeker's circumstances on their capacity, requirements are appropriate and job seekers understand the consequences of further non-compliance</LI>
<LI>Where the Capability Interview finds a job seeker is not capable of meeting their current compulsory requirements demerits are reset to zero, the job seeker returns to the green zone and the provider is responsible for re-negotiating the Job/Participation Plan</LI></UL>
<LI>A <STRONG>Capability Assessment</STRONG> is an assessment conducted by appropriately skilled Services Australia staff when a job seeker in the warning zone accrues 5 demerits in a 6 month period or has been fast tracked to this assessment point</LI>
<UL>
<LI>The Capability Assessment acts as a further check to ensure that all circumstances impacting compliance have been identified, their capacity has been appropriately assessed and their compulsory requirements are appropriate to their circumstances</LI>
<LI>Where the Capability Assessment finds the Job/Participation Plan is appropriate they enter the financial penalty zone</LI>
<LI>Where the Capability Assessment finds a job seeker is not capable of meeting their current Job/Participation Plan requirements demerits are reset to zero. The job seeker returns to the green zone and the provider is responsible for re-negotiating the Job/Participation Plan</LI></UL></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_Persistent_non01>Persistent non-compliance and the penalty zone</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Job seekers transition to the penalty zone where:</P>
<UL>
<LI>their provider considers requirements are appropriate to their circumstances (following a Capability Interview), and</LI>
<LI>a Capability Assessment conducted by Services Australia confirms the job seeker is capable of meeting their current Job/Participation Plan requirements</LI></UL>
<P>In this zone, job seekers who:</P>
<UL>
<LI>demonstrate full compliance for 3 months will return to the green zone (demerits reset to zero), and</LI>
<LI>those who continue to be non-compliant will face financial penalties or payment cancellation</LI></UL>
<P>If the job seeker commits a mutual obligation failure while in the penalty zone, payment suspension occurs immediately, encouraging job seekers to re-engage with their provider and their requirements. In addition, a Non-Compliance Report (NCR) triggers a potential financial penalty. Job seekers who had a valid reason for failing to comply are encouraged to contact their provider before they are due to report.</P>
<P>If the provider does not believe the job seeker had a valid reason for their non-compliance, a Provider Report is submitted and will become an active failure in the Services Australia system on the job seeker's reporting date.</P>
<P>Job seekers who do not wish to speak with a PST-skilled Service Officer about their reasons for not complying can accept the financial penalty for some failures as part of their reporting. Where a job seeker would like to present their reasons for non-compliance or the failure cannot be accepted as part of reporting, a compliance investigation must be conducted by a PST-skilled Service Officer. Where the job seeker is unable to establish reasonable excuse and the failure is applied, the job seeker will incur a financial penalty.</P>
<P>Escalating financial penalties and payment cancellation, based on the job seeker's penalty count, send a strong message that repeatedly failing to meet requirements is not acceptable:</P>
<UL>
<LI>a first financial penalty results in a loss of 50% of the fortnight's payment</LI>
<LI>a second financial penalty results in a loss of 100% of the fortnight's payment</LI>
<LI>a third financial penalty results in payment cancellation and a 4 week post cancellation non-payment period. Job seekers will need to reclaim before they can receive a participation payment again</LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_NonCompliance_>Non-Compliance cancellation and post cancellation non-payment period</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>A non-compliance cancellation occurs when a job seeker:</P>
<UL>
<LI>fails to accept or commence suitable work (work refusal failure)</LI>
<LI>voluntarily leaves suitable work without reasonable excuse (unemployment failure)</LI>
<LI>is dismissed from suitable employment due to misconduct as a worker (unemployment failure)</LI>
<LI>has a third financial penalty applied for a persistent mutual obligation failure</LI></UL>
<P>Where payment is cancelled, the job seeker enters a post cancellation non-payment period:</P>
<UL>
<LI>A post cancellation non-payment period is 4 weeks, or 6 weeks for an unemployment failure where the job seeker received Relocation Assistance for the job in the previous 6 months. During this period a participation payment is not payable. There are no waiver provisions for job seekers in financial hardship during this period, however the job seeker will maintain concession card and benefit rate Family Tax Benefit (FTB) eligibility</LI>
<LI>At the end of, or during, the post cancellation non-payment period, job seekers may reclaim a participation payment. They will be subject to <A href="../job-seekers/001-02030000-01.html">RapidConnect</A> and, if returning to payment at the end of the preclusion period, they return to the TCF zone they were in prior to the non-compliance cancellation</LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Services Australia is expected to work with providers to ensure job seekers understand what they need to do to receive a participation payment, and the impact non-compliance will have on their payment.</P>
<P>All staff have a responsibility to communicate the following messages to job seekers if they contact about a missed requirement or a participation suspension:</P>
<UL>
<LI>take personal responsibility to meet your requirements</LI>
<LI>talk with your provider about any circumstances that may be affecting your ability to meet your requirements</LI>
<LI>record personal events in your Workforce Australia calendar so your provider is aware</LI>
<LI>if there is good reason why you are unable to meet a requirement (such as attending an appointment or job interview, or participating in another activity) talk to your provider before the requirement</LI>
<LI>be aware of what will happen if you do not comply, and</LI>
<LI>if you miss a requirement, contact your provider as quickly as possible, within 2 business days to avoid payment suspension</LI></UL>
<P>Participation Solution Team (PST) skilled Service Officers with the WNPPD security resource or Service Officers who process job seeker claims and have a UNPP security resource are responsible for:</P>
<UL>
<LI>determining whether to apply failures where persistent mutual obligation failures are incurred without reasonable excuse (WNPPD only)</LI>
<LI>determining whether a work refusal (WNPPD only) or unemployment failure has been committed</LI>
<LI>cancelling payments following a third persistent mutual obligation failure, work refusal failure or unemployment failure</LI>
