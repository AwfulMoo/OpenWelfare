<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Key principles</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The Targeted Compliance Framework is the job seeker compliance system that ensures job seekers serviced by jobactive, Disability Employment Services (DES) and ParentsNext providers, comply with their compulsory mutual obligation requirements in return for receiving a participation payment.</p>

<p>The Targeted Compliance Framework ensures the small percentage of job seekers who repeatedly and deliberately fail to meet their compulsory requirements or who refuse suitable work are appropriately held to account. At the same time, it provides early support for vulnerable job seekers to help ensure their requirements are appropriate, and a lighter touch for the majority of job seekers who are genuine in their efforts to find work.</p>

<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Personal responsibility</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The Targeted Compliance Framework has a strong emphasis on personal responsibility for meeting compulsory requirements and engagement with providers.</p>

<p>Personal responsibility is about helping to develop or reinforce work-like behaviours by giving job seekers ownership and personal accountability for&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
ensuring their provider is aware of their circumstances, this ensures requirements in the current Job Plan/Participation Plan are appropriate and achievable</li>
		<li>
recording Personal Events in the Job Seeker Account calendar to ensure their provider is aware of these when requirements are scheduled</li>
		<li>
maintaining contact with their provider and engaging to their full capacity in compulsory appointments and activities</li>
		<li>
recording their own attendance at requirements</li>
		<li>
accepting all offers of suitable work (<strong>Note&#58;</strong> ParentsNext participants are not required to look for work), and</li>
		<li>
contacting prior to a requirement or appointment's scheduled start time if unable to attend</li>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Unemployment and work refusal failures reinforce the expectation that participation payments are only available to those who are genuine in their efforts to move into paid work.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
An <strong>unemployment failure</strong> is committed when a person leaves suitable work voluntarily (without a valid reason) or is dismissed from suitable work due to misconduct&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Customers will be subject to an unemployment preclusion period, affecting the participation payment start day by 4 weeks (6 weeks where they received relocation assistance to move to take up the work)</li>
			<li>
Participation payments are cancelled where a job seeker commits an unemployment failure. Job seekers have a 4 week wait and will need to re-claim a participation payment to receive future participation payments (6 weeks where they received relocation assistance to move to take up the work)</li>		</ul>
		<li>
A <strong>work refusal failure</strong> has been committed where the job seeker refused, failed to accept or commence work that they are capable of doing without a valid reason&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Job seekers who refuse, fail to accept or commence suitable work have their payment suspended until they re-engage with their provider to discuss their reason for non-compliance</li>
			<li>
To reinforce the seriousness of these failures, participation payments are cancelled with a 4 week post cancellation non-payment period. Job seekers will need to re-claim a participation payment before they can receive a participation payment again</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> ParentsNext participants are not subject to unemployment failures or work refusal failures as there is no compulsory requirement for them to look for work in their Participation Plan.</p>

<p>The TCF consists of 3 zones for job seekers and ParentsNext participants, these zones are called the&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
green zone</li>
		<li>
warning zone</li>
		<li>
penalty zone</li>
		</ul>
<p>All job seekers start their return to work journey in the green zone. Providers are responsible for monitoring compliance with compulsory requirements. A mutual obligation failure occurs when a job seeker fails to comply with a compulsory requirement. When a mutual obligation failure occurs the provider records the non-compliance event in the Employment Services System (ESSweb). This may result in suspension of the job seekers payment.</p>

<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Job seekers who are meeting their requirement - the green zone</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>As long as the job seeker is meeting their compulsory requirements, job seekers will remain in this zone for the duration of their time on a participation payment.</p>

<p>Job seekers in this zone negotiate compulsory requirements with their Employment Services Provider or their ParentsNext provider. They are expected to let their provider know of their circumstances (for example, when negotiating their Job/Participation Plan) to help ensure requirements are appropriate and achievable. The job seeker must maintain contact with their provider, engage to their full capacity and record their own attendance at requirements, including activities.</p>

<p>Once the job seeker contacts, the provider will want to know the reasons why the job seeker failed to comply with the requirement. If the provider decides the job seeker did not have a valid reason for missing their requirement the provider will apply a demerit. The first demerit will move the job seeker from the green zone into the warning zone.</p>

<p>Generally, where a mutual obligation failure has occurred and the job seeker did not have a valid reason one demerit point is accrued. However, mutual obligation failures for non-attendance or misconduct at a job interview or for failing to act on a job offer are more serious and will fast-track the job seeker to the next assessment point.</p>

<p>Each demerit contributes to the job seeker's demerit point count for 6 months. Job seekers return to the green zone automatically when all demerits expire.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Mutual obligation failures, participation suspensions and demerits provide a warning and make it simple and easy for job seekers to understand the consequences of non-compliance and the link between participation and payment.</p>

<p>When a job seeker in this zone has a mutual obligation failure, they will receive a notice telling them&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
It seems they have missed a mutual obligation requirement, and</li>
		<li>
they must contact their provider to avoid having their payment suspended</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the job seeker does not contact their provider, their payment will be suspended after 2 business days. Payment will remain suspended until the job seeker contacts their provider and meets any reengagement requirements the provider sets.</p>

<p>Provider contact following each mutual obligation failure provides the opportunity for job seekers to discuss their reasons for a mutual obligation failure and a chance to identify any circumstances impacting the job seeker's ability to comply.</p>

<p>Repeated non-compliance may trigger the next assessment point - a Capability Interview or a Capability Assessment. Failures relating to job interviews or job referrals also fast track the job seeker to the next assessment point.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
A <strong>Capability Interview</strong> is conducted by a provider when a job seeker accrues 3 demerit points within a 6 month period or has been fast tracked to this assessment point, unless one has already been completed within the previous 8 weeks</li>
			<ul>			<li>
The Capability Interview ensures the impact of the job seeker's circumstances on their capacity is understood, requirements are appropriate and job seekers understand the consequences of further non-compliance which is a referral to Services Australia for a Capability Assessment</li>
			<li>
Where the Capability Interview finds a job seeker is not capable of meeting their current compulsory requirements demerits are reset to zero, the job seeker returns to the green zone and the provider is responsible for re-negotiating the Job/Participation Plan</li>		</ul>
		<li>
A <strong>Capability Assessment</strong> is an assessment conducted by appropriately skilled Services Australia staff when a job seeker in the warning zone accrues 5 demerit points in a 6 month period or has been fast tracked to this assessment point</li>
			<ul>			<li>
The Capability Assessment acts as a further check to ensure that all circumstances impacting compliance have been identified and that the job seeker is in the right stream, their capacity has been appropriately assessed and their compulsory requirements are appropriate to their circumstances</li>
			<li>
Where the Capability Assessment finds the Job/Participation Plan is appropriate they enter the financial penalty zone</li>
			<li>
Where the Capability Assessment finds a job seeker is not capable of meeting their current Job/Participation Plan requirements demerits are reset to zero. The job seeker returns to the green zone and the provider is responsible for re-negotiating the Job/Participation Plan</li>

those who continue to be non-compliant will face financial penalties or payment cancellation</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the job seeker commits a mutual obligation failure while in the penalty zone, payment suspension occurs immediately, encouraging job seekers to re-engage with their provider and their requirements. In addition, a Non-Compliance Report (NCR) triggers a potential financial penalty. Job seekers who had a valid reason for failing to comply are encouraged to contact their provider before they are due to report.</p>

<p>If the provider does not believe the job seeker had a valid reason for their non-compliance, a Provider Report is submitted and will become an active failure on the job seeker's reporting date in the Services Australia system.</p>

<p>Job seekers who do not wish to speak to a PST-skilled Service Officer about their reasons for not complying can accept the financial penalty for some failures as part of their reporting. Where a job seeker would like to present their reasons for non-compliance or the failure cannot be accepted as part of reporting, a compliance investigation will be conducted by a PST-skilled Service Officer. A financial penalty is applied where the job seeker is unable to establish reasonable excuse.</p>

<p>Escalating financial penalties and payment cancellation, based on the job seeker's penalty count, send a strong message that consistently failing to meet requirements is not acceptable&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
first financial penalty results is a loss of 50% of the fortnight's payment</li>
		<li>
second financial penalty results is a loss of 100% of the fortnight's payment</li>
		<li>
third financial penalty results in payment cancellation and a 4 week post cancellation non-payment period. Job seekers will need to reclaim before they can receive a participation payment again</li>

<p>A non-compliance cancellation occurs when a job seeker&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
fails to accept or commence suitable work (work refusal failure)</li>
		<li>
voluntarily leaves suitable work without reasonable excuse (unemployment failure)</li>
		<li>
is dismissed due to misconduct as a worker from suitable employment (unemployment failure)</li>
		<li>
has a third financial penalty applied for a persistent mutual obligation failure</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where payment is cancelled, the job seeker enters a post cancellation non-payment period&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
A post cancellation non-payment period is 4 weeks, or 6 weeks where an unemployment failure related to a relocation job has been committed. During this period a participation payment is not payable. There are no waiver provisions for job seekers in financial hardship during this period, however the job seeker will maintain concession card and benefit rate Family Tax Benefit (FTB) eligibility</li>
		<li>
At the end of, or during, the post cancellation non-payment period, job seekers may reclaim a participation payment. They will be subject to <a href="../job-seekers/001-02030000-01.html">RapidConnect</a> and, if returning to payment at the end of the preclusion period, they return to the zone they were in prior to the non-compliance cancellation</li>

<p>Services Australia is expected to work together with providers to ensure job seekers understand what they need to do to receive a participation payment, and the impact non-compliance will have on their payment.</p>

<p>All staff have responsibility to communicate the following messages to job seekers if they contact about a missed requirement or a participation suspension&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
take personal responsibility to meet your requirements</li>
		<li>
talk with your provider about any circumstances that may be affecting your ability to meet your requirements</li>
		<li>
Record personal events in your jobactive Calendar so your provider is aware</li>
		<li>
if there is good reason why you are unable to meet a requirement (such as attending an appointment or job interview, or participating in another activity) talk to your provider before the requirement</li>
		<li>
be aware of what will happen if you do not comply, and</li>
		<li>
if you miss a requirement, contact your provider as quickly as possible, within 2 business days to avoid payment suspension</li>
		</ul>
<p>Participation Solution Team (PST) skilled Service Officers with WNPPD security resource or Service Officers who process job seeker claims and have a UNPP security resource&#58;</p>
