<p>This document explains Services Australia's process in approving paid work as an approved activity for job seekers who choose to use their paid work to satisfy their mutual obligation requirements.</p>

<p></p>
<div class="twisty">
	
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Approval_and_re"></a>
<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Approval_and_re">Approval and requirements</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Some job seekers may be able to use paid work to meet their <a target="_blank" href="../job-seekers/001-09000000-01.html">mutual obligation requirements</a>. Others can volunteer to participate in paid work as an approved requirement.</p>

<p>Where the paid work approved requirement fully satisfies a job seeker's requirements, Services Australia must approve it, regardless of whether the job seeker is currently managed by Services Australia or their provider. For job seekers in Workforce Australia and the Community Development Program (CDP), Services Australia must negotiate this requirement. For Disability Employment Services (DES) participants, their DES provider will update the Job Plan.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Sufficient_work">Sufficient work test requirements</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Paid work that meets the sufficient work test can be used to satisfy mutual obligation requirements for customers who&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
are principal carers</li>
		<li>
have a partial capacity to work (PCW) of 15 hours or more per week</li>
		<li>
are 55 years and over</li>
		</ul>
<p>The sufficient work test has 2 parts&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the minimum hour's requirement, and</li>
		<li>
the minimum remuneration requirement</li>
		</ul>
<p>A job seeker must meet both these requirements to satisfy the sufficient work test.</p>

<p>The sufficient work test requires these job seekers be&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
working at least 30 hours per fortnight, and</li>
		<li>
earning equal to or above the national minimum wage for the minimum number of hours required - that is, 30 hours per fortnight at the national minimum wage, or</li>
		<li>
employed in an occupation covered by an award, junior or trainee wage, the job seeker may be payable at a lower rate than the national minimum wage, if they are at least earning the applicable hourly award rate for their occupation for a minimum of 30 hours per fortnight</li>
		</ul>
<p>Job seekers with full-time mutual obligation requirements can also use work to fully satisfy their obligations, but the work must be at least 70 hours per fortnight, with income equal to or above the national minimum wage. If the employment is less, other activities like job search will be needed. They may still qualify for payment depending on the income test applicable for their circumstances.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>When a job seeker with part-time mutual obligation requirements has been declaring sufficient hours and earnings from employment to potentially fully satisfy their requirements, an activity and action item will automatically generate on their record. Service Officers must contact the job seeker and discuss the paid work to determine whether it can be approved as fully satisfying requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Workforce Australia</strong></p>

<p>If the job seeker's paid work is fully meeting their mutual obligation requirements, the approved requirement should be recorded on the Activity and Exemption Summary (<strong>AEX</strong>) screen on the job seeker's record.</p>

<p>The job seeker must lodge their Reporting Statement and declare their income to keep receiving an income support payment. The job seeker will be automatically suspended from Employment Provider Services, and there is no need for them to discuss this with their Employment Services Provider. However, if the job seeker would like to keep volunteering in Employment Provider Services, they would need to discuss this with their provider. Once Employment Provider Services have been suspended, the job seeker will be Centrelink managed.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> some job seekers' approved part-time work (PTW) requirement will be automatically updated if they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
are a principal carer, and</li>
		<li>
receiving JobSeeker Payment (JSP), Parenting Payment Single (PPS), or Youth Allowance (YA) (Job seeker), and</li>
		<li>
have declared in their last 2 consecutive fortnights that they worked at least 30 hours each fortnight and earned income equal to or above the national minimum wage</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Disability Employment Services (DES)</strong></p>

<p>If the job seeker's paid work is fully meeting their mutual obligation requirements, the approved requirement should be recorded on the Activity and Exemption Summary (<strong>AEX</strong>) screen on the job seeker's record. Services Australia must not negotiate a new Job Plan for DES participants at this stage, as this will result in the job seeker being exited from the DES program.</p>

<p>DES participants receive post placement and ongoing support and so should remain connected to their provider.</p>

<p>The DES provider will update the job seeker's Job Plan. The job seeker is still required to lodge their Reporting Statement and declare their income to keep receiving an income support payment.</p>

<p>Only if the job seeker chooses to exit DES, after discussions with their DES provider, will Services Australia need to negotiate a new Job Plan.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>If a job seeker is partially meeting their mutual obligation requirements, use the sufficient work test to establish the additional hours of work needed to fully meet their requirements. This is determined as follows&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
where the amount earned is already sufficient to meet the remuneration test, the person will need to do, or look for, at least the number of hours needed to increase their employment to the minimum number of hours needed, or</li>
		<li>
where the amount earned is insufficient, the person will need to look for, or do, the additional number of hours needed to meet the remuneration requirement</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> for principal carers with a dependent child who receive JobSeeker Payment (JSP), Youth Allowance (YA) or Parenting Payment (PP), activities and other mutual obligation requirements should be scheduled to occur during school hours (that is, generally between 9 am and 3 pm during school terms) unless otherwise requested or agreed by the principal carer.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Ministers_of_re">Ministers of religion</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>For ministers of religion who are either a principal carer of a dependent child or a person assessed as having a partial capacity to work (PCW), and are doing at least 30 hours of paid pastoral work a fortnight for their religious order, the amount of remuneration received does not have to be at the national minimum wage. These customers are fully satisfying their mutual obligation requirements and are not required to meet the sufficient work test.</p>

<p>Ministers of religion are to provide evidence annually to verify they are working 15 hours per week of paid work for their religious organisation. When the evidence is provided, the Service Officer records a Display on Access (DOA) <strong>DOC</strong> stating, 'customer is a minister of religion doing paid work for their religious organisation. They are not required to meet the sufficient work test.'</p>

<p>Connection to an Employment Services Provider for principal carers or job seekers with a PCW who are ministers of religion is voluntary whilst they are doing sufficient work to meet their participation requirements. However, a Job Seeker Registration Only (JSRO) registration should be done.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>If the job seeker does not fully meet their mutual obligation requirements through paid work, they can do another approved activity combined with their paid work.</p>

<p>For most job seekers, Services Australia can only approve combinations of activities that include an employment component, that is, paid work and self-employment, or, in the case of mature age 55+ job seekers, employment and voluntary work combinations. Any other combination of approved activities, like paid work and part-time study, must be negotiated between the job seeker and their Employment Services Provider.</p>

<p>For principal carers, Services Australia can approve a combination of approved study and suitable paid work or self-employment and paid employment (part-time work) where activities total a minimum of 15 hours per week or 30 hours per fortnight.</p>

<p>For example, a principal carer being paid by their current partner to provide child care to their own children would not be regarded as meeting requirements.</p>

<p>However, a principal carer who is involved in a viable family day care business and cares for other children in addition to their own may have this activity assessed for meeting mutual obligation requirements.</p>

<p>Similarly, a customer who is employed by, and gets income from, a business where their partner is involved in that business may have this income included and the activity assessed for mutual obligation requirements. Centrelink managed job seeker will be interviewed by a Service Officer and negotiate an appropriate Job Plan.</p>

<p>A failure to meet the requirements means the job seeker will no longer continue with their nominated activities as their principal requirement and must be referred to an Employment Services Provider, if not already active with one, and negotiate a new Job Plan.</p>

<p>Services Australia must negotiate a new Job Plan for Centrelink managed job seeker if the job seeker is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
under 55 and has given a reasonable excuse for 2 consecutive fortnights</li>
