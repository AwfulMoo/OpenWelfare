Where the customer is receiving CCS, make sure the correct DOV is used when updating the income estimate, as backdating DOV will also affect CCS.

		<li>
If FTB is CAN-OIS in the current financial year, FTB can be restored using the Family Income and Choices workflow. <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-05030020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Annual_income_e_Step03">Go to Step 3</a></li>

		<li>
If FTB was cancelled in the previous financial year or cancelled in the current financial year for a reason other than CAN-OIS or CAN-ENR, and they wish to commence receiving FTB as an instalment payment, record the estimate and payment choice manually.

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if FTB is cancelled and a manual restoration is not appropriate (for example, due to income estimate, cancellation period or customers request), clearly <strong>DOC</strong> the record stating why the payment was not restored. Depending on when/if the customer wishes to re-commence receiving instalment payments, they may have to lodge a new claim. Procedure ends here.</p>

<p>Customer requests their taxable income estimate be less than their taxable ISP year to date figure because when they lodge their tax return, business/investment loss reduces their taxable income.</p>

<p>Tell the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
while they receive an income support payment, the family income estimate will not reduce their amount of FTB Part A, however the income estimate can reduce the Part B rate</li>
		<li>
any business or investment loss for FTB purposes will be included when tax returns are lodged and FTB is balanced after the end of the financial year, and</li>
		<li>
to receive their full annual FTB entitlement, they must meet income lodgement requirements within 12 months of the financial year ending</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer’s Part B rate is reduced due to income and they request the business/investment loss is applied to their ongoing FTB Part B rate, check for evidence of the business loss on the Real Estate and Business (<strong>REBS</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>Is the loss clear on the <strong>REBS</strong> screen&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>, or credible evidence has been provided, <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-05030020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Annual_income_e_Step07">go to Step 7</a></li>
		<li>
<strong>No</strong>,</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Losses for ISP purposes and taxation purposes can differ</li>
			<li>
Before the loss can be applied to their ongoing rate of FTB, the customer will need to provide evidence of their expected loss. This may be a recent profit and loss statement or evidence of a previous year loss that will apply to the current financial year</li>
			<li>
Request evidence from the customer and <strong>DOC</strong> the discussion. The customer can use the <strong>Upload documents</strong> service to provide evidence. Once they have provided evidence, the customer will need to re-contact</li>
			<li>
The customer may also need to have their business income updated for their ISP. See <a href="../business-and-employers/043-03060020-01.html">Assessing and coding the Business details for sole traders and partnerships Mod F</a></li>
