<P>The decision to cancel CP is because the carer no longer provides constant care and attention.

<DIV class=showcont>
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> TCC does not need to be used if the carer is currently in a <A href="../bereavement/099-04000000-01.html">bereavement</A> period or if the care receiver has entered a <A href="../carers/009-06040070-01.html">nursing home on a permanent basis</A>.</P>
<P>The carer chooses to use their TCC entitlement to work/study for more than 25 hours per week.</P>
<P>TCC is recorded as the corresponding first and/or second 7 day period of the entitlement period that is being reported. The carer continues to qualify for CP at least until the end date of the temporary cessation of care or the expiry of the carer's allowable temporary cessation of care days. Code the temporary cessation of care on the Absence Details (<STRONG>ABSN</STRONG>) screen:</P>
<UL>
<LI>go to the Care Receiver Summary (<STRONG>CRS</STRONG>) screen and '<STRONG>S</STRONG>'elect the appropriate care receiver from the list</LI>
<LI>the Care Receiver Task Selector (<STRONG>CETS</STRONG>) screen is displayed</LI>
<LI>'<STRONG>S</STRONG>'elect 'Absence Details', and on the <STRONG>ABSN</STRONG> screen, code the:</LI>

<LI><STRONG>Start Date</STRONG> field with the first date of the absence (this will be either the entitlement period start date (EPSD) or the EPSD plus 7), and</LI>
<LI><STRONG>End Date</STRONG> field with the last date of the absence (this will be a multiple of 7 from the <STRONG>start date</STRONG>)</LI></UL>
<LI>if the CP carer is in receipt of CP and Carer Allowance (CA). Code the <STRONG>Reason</STRONG> field as '<STRONG>RCP</STRONG>' (for Respite for Carer Payment Only)</LI>
<LI>TCC for CP occurs in the following scenarios:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>Where a carer continues to provide constant care while in work/study and they temporarily have absences which exceed 25 hours in a week <STRONG>and</STRONG> the carer chooses to utilise temporary cessation of care, 7 days temporary cessation of care will be recorded. This absence will be counted for CP only</LI>
<LI>If the carer has temporarily ceased care of the care receiver, but the care receiver is in the care of the other CA shared carer during that period, no temporary cessation of care days will be utilised for CA. If the carer receives CP, this absence will be counted for CP only</LI></UL></UL>

<P>Record a <STRONG>DOC</STRONG> in the carer's record outlining the information provided by the carer. Ensure to record only the necessary employer details on a DOC.</P>
<P>Where the carer would receive nil payment due to the income test and some of that income is employment income from their (or their partner's), the carer may remain <A href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010160-01.html">current at a nil rate for a period of up to 6 consecutive fortnights</A> provided they continue to meet the qualification requirements for CP, including the constant care criterion.</P>
<P>Ensure the carer and their partner are on 2 weekly reporting if neither have employment income:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the carer does not need to be on 2 weekly reporting if CP has been cancelled</LI>
<LI>the carer and/or partner do not need to be placed on 2 weekly reporting if they have regular employment income that is paid monthly and they meet the <A href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010010-04.html">Pension Monthly Exception rule</A> </LI>
