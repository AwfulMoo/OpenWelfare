<p>An online or Assisted Customer Claim (ACC) for CCS/Additional Child Care Subsidy (ACCS) cannot be submitted until all required supporting documents have been uploaded. The exception is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
where the customer will provide bank account or Tax File Number details within 28 days. See <a href="../families/007-17103105-01.html">Exemption from providing Tax File Numbers when claiming Child Care Subsidy (CCS)</a></li>
		<li>
CCS/ACCS claims are combined with Family Tax Benefit (FTB), Paid Parental Leave (PPL) or Dad and Partner pay (DAP). Customers are advised what evidence is required and the due date on their receipt page. This is deemed a request for information, a further request is not needed unless additional information is required. See <a href="../families/007-17103136-03.html#bp03_tbl_Review_claim_an_Step16">Table 2, Step 16</a>, if further documentation is needed</li>
		</ul>
<p>When a paper claim is scanned to the customer's record, a Service Officer is to complete an ACC using details from the paper claim. <strong>Remember</strong>, any change of circumstances such as address updates must be updated before starting the ACC. Completing the ACC will create a Social Online Application (SOA) for the claim.</p>

<p>If no SOA shell exists, request a SOA shell via mySupport. The <a href="../families/007-17103136-05.html">Resources</a> page has a link.</p>

<p><strong>Service Centre Staff</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the customer lodges an offline (paper) claim&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Check all required evidence has been included with the claim</li>
			<li>
Scan the paper claim together with any supporting documents to the customer's record. This will generate an activity which will be allocated to an appropriately trained Service Officer for processing</li>		</ul>
		<li>
If the customer is lodging evidence for a submitted claim&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Scan the document onto the customer's record</li>
			<li>
Access the customer's record in Process Direct</li>
			<li>
Select the <strong>Transactions</strong> icon and click on the Claim ID hyperlink. The <strong>Claim Application</strong> page displays</li>
			<li>
Select the <strong>Tasks</strong> icon and update the status of documents required to <strong>Provided</strong>. Select <strong>Save</strong></li>
			<li>
Select the <strong>Status</strong> icon. If <strong>all</strong> required documents have been provided and the Claim Status is 'On hold', update by selecting <img src="../resources/images/process_direct_small/more%20options.png" alt="more options" title="more options" /> and selecting <strong>In Process</strong> from the dropdown menu. Select the <strong>Save</strong> icon. <br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the Service Officer changes the claim status the work item will be assigned to them. If they are not trained to process the claim, the Service Officer will need to return the claim to the pool. Go to the work items list and select <img src="../resources/images/process_direct_small/Multi_Select_icon.PNG" alt="Multi Selection" title="Multi Selection" />. Check the box for the relevant work item, and select <strong>Unassign</strong> to return the claim to the pool</li>		</ul>
		<li>
If a customer contacts because they have received notification that documents are outstanding but they state these have been provided, check the <strong>Tasks</strong> status within the claim</li>
		<li>
If the document is still showing as <strong>Required</strong>, view documents scanned at a service centre or uploaded by the customer by selecting the <strong>Documents</strong> icon in Process Direct</li>
		<li>
If the documents have been lodged, update the status to <strong>Provided</strong> as above</li>
		<li>
If not displaying via <strong>Documents</strong>, request the customer upload the documents again</li>		</ul>

<p>Most CCS online and ACCs (Assisted Customer Claims) are automatically assessed by applying the information provided with the eligibility criteria. Customers are advised of the outcome without the need for staff to manually review the claim.</p>

<p>Claims that require exception management, validation of selected data items, and new claims after a customer has been cancelled due to the second deadline will not auto assess. These claims will be allocated via Workload Manager to staff with the appropriate skill tag to manage.</p>

<p>All Additional Child Care Subsidy (ACCS) applications (Grandparent, Transition to Work, Temporary Financial Hardship and Child Wellbeing) require appropriately skilled staff to validate the information provided within the claim for the claim to be assessed.</p>

<p>A handoff process applies for situations where combined claims (CCS and FTB/PPL/DAP) are allocated to a Service Officer trained in CCS only. Families claims are to be processed in the order of submission by the customer, except where there is a CCS claim and a Families claim (e.g. FTB/PPL/DAP) on the record with the same submission dates. In this case the Families claim is to be processed first.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> this handoff process is to be used <strong>only</strong> when staff do not have all the skills required to action a customer's Families claim first before actioning the CCS claim. Service Officers proficient in all the payment types are to process all claim types in the required order at the time the claim is first allocated.</p>

<p>If skilled in CCS claims only and the above handoff process is required &#58;</p>

<p>Where a combined claim has been lodged, before processing the CCS claim, staff must check <strong>Document List</strong> to confirm the claim has not been withdrawn.

<p>Partner and child relationships must be reviewed/updated before starting to process a CCS claim.</p>

<p>Where a customer advises they are partnered and the customer or partner are currently in receipt of another payment, all linking activities must be finalised before assessing the CCS claim. See <a target="_blank" href="../ongoing-contact/102-05010000-01.html">Change in relationship status from single to partnered</a>.</p>

<p>Staff will need to check the information provided in the claim and compare to partner data in Customer First to determine if there are any updates, including historical, which are required to be completed in Customer First.</p>

<p>If any updates are completed in Customer First, a refresh will be required within Process Direct to continue processing&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Re-enter the claim via Inbox</li>
		<li>
On the <strong>Claim Application</strong> screen, select <strong>refresh</strong> icon at top right</li>
		<li>
Completion of the refresh will be confirmed</li>
		</ul>
<p>If relationships have been updated after claim submission has been started (no <strong>Link</strong> icon displays), regenerate the claim.</p>

<p>Action required on the<strong> Relationships</strong> screen depends on the customer's circumstances, what they have advised on their claim, and what is already recorded on the system.</p>

<p>To view/ update details, select the <strong>Relationships</strong> icon.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Known relationships</strong> table = information currently held in ISIS</li>
		<li>
<strong>Claim relationships</strong> table = information advised in the online claim or Assisted Customer Claim (ACC)</li>

If they display in <img src="../resources/images/process_direct_small/relationships_menu_icon.png" alt="" title="" /> after selecting process, they are linked to the customer.</p>

<p>The relationship details may only need updating if the tables contain different information.</p>

<p>There is a limit of one update per relationship type.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the customer indicates&#58;</p>

their or their partner's relationship to the child is Grandparent or Great Grandparent, and</li>

<p>The Service Officer's role in processing a CCS claim is to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
action errors, warnings and/or messages displayed </li>
		<li>
validate any evidence provided and </li>
		<li>
ensure the claim outcome aligns with payment eligibility and entitlement</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer is cancelled 2DL, the new CCS claim can only be backdated to the <strong>later </strong>of&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the date the customer met all the CCS income requirements, or</li>
		<li>
by using the 28 day backdating rules</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the latest date under the Income Lodgement Date column noted from Table 5 Step 1 is<strong> later </strong>than the date CCS would grant using the 28 day backdating rules&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
go to the <strong>CICLM</strong> table within the claim, and </li>
		<li>
correct the claim <strong>start date</strong> for each child within the claim to the first CCS Monday after the income lodgement date</li>
		</ul>
<p>When validating evidence lodged, ensure the relevant table(s) have been checked and updated correctly in line with the evidence provided, and the correct outcome displays on the Entitlement screen.

If updating information within the claim, check the current information by selecting <img src="../resources/images/process_direct_small/view-update-confirmed-data.jpg" alt="View/Update confirmed data" title="View/Update confirmed data" />.
