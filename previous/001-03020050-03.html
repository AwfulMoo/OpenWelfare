			<ul>			<li>

Finalise the activity via the Assessment Results (<strong>AR</strong>) screen. YA should then cancel with the reason 'Not a Full-time Student' (CAN-NST).

<p><strong>SUS-PCD status&#58;</strong> customers with an intention to study period coded whose end date has passed will be suspended for failure to provide course details (SUS-PCD). Their payment will then CAN-PCD automatically 13 weeks after the suspension date. The SUS-PCD period can affect processing other types of claims (e.g. job seeker claim). So it is important to update the <strong>NES</strong> screen with the <strong>event date</strong> SED + 1, <strong>Student Status</strong> 'NST' Not a Student and cancel the student CAN-NST, from the date the customer no longer had an intention to study where they advised within 13 weeks of the suspension decision.</p>

If no longer studying, identify if the customer is eligible for other income support as a job seeker.<br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> ABSTUDY Living Allowance <strong>secondary school students</strong> have payment entitlement up to 31 December each year. These customers must be advised of the option to stay on ABSTUDY and recontact to claim a job seeker payment within 14 days from 31 December. If wishing to transfer to a job seeker payment immediately (before 31 December) they must be advised activity test requirements must be satisfied as part of the new job seeker payment, and an ABSTUDY debt may result</li>
		<li>
Secondary boarders getting ABSTUDY boarding instalment payments have entitlements paid to the boarding institution on their behalf. These students must stay on ABSTUDY until 31 December and cannot transfer to another income support payment until 1 January. If a secondary boarder getting ABSTUDY boarding instalment payments meets hardship provisions, they may be entitled to claim ABSTUDY Additional Assistance for financial assistance until they qualify for other payments from 1 January. These customers must recontact within 14 days from 31 December to claim for a job seeker payment</li>
		<li>
ABSTUDY Living Allowance <strong>tertiary students</strong> are paid up to the date they cease study. Transfer provisions do not apply to ABSTUDY students, under Section 23 of the Social Security Act.

Run the standalone Looking for Work workflow</li>
			<li>
Check and update the current job seeker registration and ensure the customer is a Fully Eligible Participant (FEP) and the No Stream Services Referral Required (NSSRR) flag is removed</li>
			<li>
Check and update the JSCI as appropriate</li>
			<li>
Make an Employment Services Provider appointment. If the customer is a Centrelink managed job seeker, a <a href="../job-seekers/001-09100010-01.html">Job Plan must be negotiated</a> and completed</li>
			<li>
Check the system has automatically changed the activity type of FTS to JSE on the <strong>AEX</strong> screen at the SED+1</li>
			<li>
If the need for an ESAt is triggered and is required when the Looking for Work workflow was completed, advise the customer (where applicable) to get appropriate medical evidence as soon as possible. Evidence must not be supplied later than the lodgement date of their first Reporting Statement, to allow the ESAt referral to be made</li>
			<li>
If the job seeker has already completed Year 12 (or equivalent) or a Certificate III or higher and details are confirmed via the <strong>EDCH</strong> screen, ensure the <strong>Y12/Equiv Verified</strong> field on the <strong>NES</strong> screen is updated with an appropriate code. For example, '<strong>OTH</strong>' (other evidence as appropriate)</li>
			<li>
If the job seeker has not already completed Year 12 (or equivalent) or a Certificate III or higher they will be identified as an early school leaver and they will need to undertake study, training, job search or other approved activities to satisfy their mutual obligation requirements. Refer the job seeker to a provider. Ensure they are Stream B as a minimum</li>
