<p>Centrelink is the most appropriate program to provide an explanation of a care decision made by Centrelink. A SME will provide the explanation of the care decision.</p>

<p>An explanation of a care decision may result in a reassessment (Secretary initiated review). However, an explanation is not a formal review. A customer can apply for a formal review of the decision without requesting an explanation, or at any time after requesting an explanation of the decision.</p>

<p>If a formal review of the decision has already been completed&#58;</p>

<p>There may be times when both Centrelink and Child Support are asked to review the same care decision. The request for review that was made first must be finalised first.</p>

<p>The <strong>!COAD</strong> screen shows details of all requests for review lodged with either Child Support or Centrelink. It should indicate the care periods the review relates to (see note below). Child Support objection information will display only on the <strong>!COAD</strong> screen of the carer who lodged the objection, even though the objection outcome has effect for all relevant carers for that care decision. Check other carer’s records if there is no review on the customer’s record.</p>

<p>Appeal information on the <strong>!COAD</strong> screen will be exchanged with Child Support to ensure they are aware of any care decision and care period under review by Centrelink.</p>

<p>To view the <strong>!COAD </strong>screen&#58;</p>

Go to the <strong>CHS</strong> screen for the relevant child/ren</li>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Child Support appeal indicators do not always display against the care period they relate to.

<p>There may be times when both Centrelink and Child Support are asked to review the same care decision. The review request that was lodged first must be finalised first.</p>

<p>This screen shows details of all appeals lodged with either Child Support or Centrelink and the specific care periods related to the appeal. Child Support objection information will display only on the <strong>!COAD</strong> screen of the carer who lodged the objection, even though the objection outcome has effect for all relevant carers for that care decision.</p>

<p>Appeal information on the !<strong>COAD</strong> screen will be exchanged with Child Support to ensure they are aware of any care decision and care period under review by Centrelink.</p>

<p>If a Child Support objection was lodged first but has not been finalised, the Centrelink review will be held until the objection is finalised. This is because the care percentage determined by the first review will need to be applied in the second review.</p>

<p>An ARO can review a care decision that has been reviewed by an Objections Officer and vice versa.</p>

<p>However, an ARO cannot change the care percentage determined by the Objections Officer and an Objections Officer cannot change the care percentage determined by the ARO. </p>

<p>Even though an ARO cannot change a care percentage decision made by an Objections Officer, the effects of the decision can be reviewed and changed if appropriate. For example, a change in the rate of Family Tax Benefit (FTB) that resulted from the care decision or a debt that was raised as a result of the care decision.</p>

<p>Once the objection and/or review is completed, if any party wants to appeal the review decision, they must apply to the AAT. See <a href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/109-03030000-01.html">Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT)</a> for more information.</p>

<p>If the customer requests a review by the AAT&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If a review was completed by an ARO, the review will already be recorded in the APL system. The ARO must prepare the review evidence for External Review of Decision Team to send to the AAT</li>
		<li>
If an objection was completed by an Objections Officer but there has been no ARO review, and an affected party has requested an AAT appeal, create an appeal record in the APL system. To do this, run the <strong>Internal Review/Explanation</strong> script and choose 'I am bypassing the DM/ARO Level as the initial review was completed by Child Support and the customer has requested an AAT appeal'</li>

<p>Previous recorded entries can be changed if required. For example, incorrect care period linked to appeal.</p>

<p>If the review is not on the child's <strong>!COAD</strong> screen, it may be because an incorrect reason was selected when running the script.
