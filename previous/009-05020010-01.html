<p>This document outlines information on how to calculate the Adult Disability Assessment Tool (ADAT) score as part of a new claim or review process for Carer Payment (CP) and/or Carer Allowance (CA).</p>

<p>On 9 August 2018, the Adult Disability Assessment Determination (1999) was replaced by the Adult Disability Assessment Determination (2018).</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_ADAT_details">ADAT details</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The ADAT has been designed specifically for use in the assessment of an adult care receiver's functional ability, emotional state, behaviour and special care needs, to determine their carer's entitlements to CP and/or CA.</p>

<p>The ADAT contains 2 questionnaires that together measure the amount of help the care receiver needs to undertake basic activities of daily living such as mobility, communication, hygiene, eating and management in a range of cognitive and behavioural areas. This may include supervising and prompting the care receiver to undertake these daily activities. The responses from the questionnaires are used to calculate a score indicating the level of care needed because of that person's disability or medical condition.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>An adult care receiver (aged 16 years or over) who is likely to suffer from their disability permanently or for an extended period may qualify 2 or more carers for separate Carer Payments if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
each carer personally provides constant care for the care receiver, such as care required for a significant period each day (at least the equivalent of a normal working day). This care can overlap and does not necessarily have to be in separate periods</li>
		<li>
each person can fully satisfy the qualification criteria</li>
		<li>
the care receiver's Adult Disability Assessment Determination (ADAD) score is 80 or more, including a Treating Health Professional (THP) score of 32 or more. Such a high score indicates the care receiver's needs are high</li>
		</ul>
<p>Re-use provisions may apply, however contact the Carer Helpdesk. See the <a href="../carers/009-05020010-03.html">Process</a> page for more information.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if an adult care receiver is certified as being in the final phase of a terminal illness only that part of the CP and/or CA Medical Report for a person 16 years or over (SA332a) needs to be completed. The care receiver is automatically assessed as having a qualifying ADAD score of 30. However, if 2 or more carers wish to claim CP the care receiver will need to be reassessed using another SA332a and have an ADAT score of 80 or more (and 32 or more from the THP).</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Calculating_the_ADAT">Calculating the ADAT score</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The ADAT is a system-based tool - the answers to questions from the forms completed by the Treating Health Professional (THP) and the carer are coded straight onto a carer's Centrelink record and results are then system calculated. While the system calculates the scores in the ADAT, these scores are derived from information provided by the THP and the carer.</p>

<p>The <strong>medical report</strong> for an adult care receiver must be completed by one of the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a legally qualified medical practitioner</li>
		<li>
a registered nurse (including psychiatric nurse, mental health nurse or geriatric nurse)</li>
		<li>
a physiotherapist</li>
		<li>
an occupational therapist</li>
		<li>
any member of an Aged Care Assessment Team</li>
		<li>
an Aboriginal Health Worker may be considered equivalent to a THP if the carer lives in a remote area such as a remote Aboriginal community, there is likely to be a delay from obtaining a report from a THP, and the care receiver's medical condition was originally diagnosed by a medical practitioner (this decision can only be made by the Team Leader/ Senior Support Officer of the local processing team)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Responses on the medical report can be clarified with the THP if the Service Officer is not satisfied the report is accurate. Alternatively, a new medical report can be requested. The replacement medical report must be completed by a different THP.</p>

<p>If the THP is a close relative (parent, child, sibling or grandparent) of the carer or care receiver, there may be a conflict of interest. Service Officers must use discretion in determining whether the ADAT assessment is an accurate reflection of the adult care receiver's disability care needs.</p>

<p>A person who is<strong> not in the approved list</strong> may be accepted as an approved THP on a case-by-case basis only. Only use this discretion after <strong>all</strong> the following have been met&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
an SA332a has been completed by a THP from the approved THP list </li>
		<li>
the carer indicates that another approved THP could not provide adequate information</li>
		<li>
a person not on the approved THP list is familiar with the care receiver’s condition and care needs and is qualified to provide an assessment</li>
		<li>
the Carer Helpdesk supports issuing an SA332a for this person to complete (if one has not already been provided), and </li>
		<li>
after the carer has provided an SA332a completed by a person not on the approved THP list, the Carer Helpdesk supports using that report</li>
		</ul>
<p>See examples of using this discretion in the Guide at 3.6.9 on the <a href="../carers/009-05020010-04.html">References</a> page.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; the agency does <strong>not</strong> have the authority to approve the addition of a class of persons to the approved list of THPs, such as psychologists. This must be authorised by the Department of Social Services.</p>

<p>When a CP and/or CA Medical Report for a person aged 16 years or over SA332(a) has been obtained to review a decision, code the information as a new entry with the same 'effect date' so the new information is assessed from the same date as the original decision.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>If an adult care receiver satisfies the re-use provisions they medically qualify their carer for both CP and/or CA without the need for a new ADAT assessment. If an adult care receiver has a terminal illness, and the Treating Health Professional (THP) medical report indicates they are not expected to live more than 3 months, the care receiver is medically eligible to qualify their carer for both CP and/or CA without the need for an ADAT assessment.</p>

<p>If an adult does not have a terminal illness, the ADAT enables a combined score to be calculated from 2 questionnaires, one completed by the THP and one by the carer, and is used to assess qualification for carers claiming CP and/or CA for an adult, and/or application for Special Disability Trust. It cannot be used for any other purpose, for example Disability Support Pension assessments.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>The ADAT questionnaire completed by the carer of the disabled adult care receiver is contained in&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> the online claim for CP and/or CA</li>
		<li>
Assisted Customer Claim (ACC)</li>
		<li>
CP and/or CA - Caring for a person aged 16 years or over (SA406)</li>
		<li>
customised claim forms - CA only (SA409), CP only (SA410) or CP and CA (SA411), or</li>
		<li>
Review of care provided - CP and/or CA - Caring for a person - aged 16 years or over (SA010)</li>
		</ul>
<p>The Treating Health Professional (THP) questionnaire is contained in the SA332(a). The THP can complete the form if the care receiver is aged at least 15 years and 9 months. The questions on the SA332(a) are not about specific disabilities or medical conditions, the aim is to assess the level of disability, and how that impacts upon the disabled adult and their carer.</p>

<p>If the carer or the THP has ticked more than 1 answer for any question, the answer that gives the highest ADAT score should be accepted. If no answer has been provided, the carer or THP should be contacted to find out why. The carer or THP should be given the opportunity to answer unanswered questions. If the ADAT produces a qualifying score and there are unanswered questions which have no bearing on the carer's qualification for CP or CA, staff are not required to contact the carer or THP but should document this on the carer's record.</p>

<p>A functional assessment rating is calculated for each portion of the ADAT (for example, the carer portion and the THP portion). The THP score must reach a certain level before the carer's score is taken into account. If the THP score on its own and the combined score are both sufficiently high, the care receiver may qualify a carer for CP and/or CA.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>For CP and/or CA claims, information previously gathered under the Adult Disability Assessment Determination (ADAD) 2018 or terminal condition assessment for CP and/or CA (adult) may be re-used. Re-use provisions are automatically assessed when a carer claims online or the First Contact Concessions, Carers and Seniors (FCCCS) workflow is run. </p>

<p>Re-use may apply for new or previous carers.</p>

<p>Even if the reuse provisions apply, Service Officers need to be satisfied that the previous ADAT reflects the current care needs and the carer meets the daily care and constant care requirements. If the Service Officers believes there is a reduction in the care receiver's care needs and is not satisfied that the care receiver would achieve a qualifying THP score and/or overall ADAT score for the respective payment, a new ADAT can be requested.</p>

<p>Clarification of the provision of care should only be sought if there are circumstances indicating the carer is <strong>not</strong> providing constant or daily care. </p>

<p>In these instances, Service Officers must determine whether a person is qualified for CP and/or CA based on all the relevant material before them, and that <strong>all</strong> of the qualification criteria have been satisfied. If the carer qualifies under re-use and Service Officers have concerns about the provision of constant or daily care, carers and THPs can be contacted to clarify the care that is required and is provided, however carers are <strong>not required</strong> to provide care schedules or care plans.</p>

<p>Consider the following factors&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>

<p>A carer may elect to provide a new THP medical report and ADAT carer questionnaire with new information for an adult care receiver instead of re-using previous medical reports.</p>

<p>If a medical report or carer questionnaire has been lodged when the re-use or reclaim provisions apply, see information on the <a href="../carers/009-05020010-03.html">Process</a> page.</p>

<p>If the most recently provided THP medical report and ADAT carer questionnaire do not satisfy all the qualification requirements for re-use or reclaim, or there is no link between the carer and care receiver identified when claiming online or ACC is used, the carer will be presented with a link to download&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a CP and/or CA Medical Report - for a person aged 16 years or over SA332(a), and</li>
		<li>
if eligible, the carer's online claim/ACC will include the ADAT carer questionnaire</li>
		</ul>
<p>If FCCCS is run, the carer will be issued&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
an SA332(a), and</li>
		<li>
a Claim for CP and/or CA (SA404) along with a CP and/or CA - Caring for a person aged 16 years or over (SA406), or</li>
		<li>
if eligible, the carer's customised claim form will include the ADAT carer questionnaire</li>
		</ul>
<p>Re-use provisions cannot be applied if a carer's payment has been cancelled as a result of the carer failing to provide a medical report or ADAT carer questionnaire required for a medical review.</p>
