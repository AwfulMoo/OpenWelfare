<p><strong>Answer&#58;</strong> A demerit is recorded in the Employment Services System (ESS) when a non-compliance event occurs. The demerit may be removed by the provider if the provider determines the job seeker had a valid reason for the non-compliance event.</p>

<p>Demerits are fully managed by the provider. Job seekers who contact to enquire about a demerit should be referred to their provider.</p>

<p><strong>Answer&#58;</strong> Where the job seeker is in the warning zone and accrues 3 demerit points a Capability Interview is conducted by the provider. If the job seeker accrues a fifth demerit point a Capability Assessment is conducted by Services Australia. Job seekers may be fast tracked to the next assessment point after accruing a demerit for a job interview or job referral failure.</p>

<p>The aim of both a Capability Interview and a Capability Assessment is to determine if the job seeker is capable of meeting their current Job/Participation Plan requirements and they understand the consequences of further non-compliance.</p>

<p>If it is determined that the job seeker is capable of meeting their current Job/Participation Plan requirements the outcome of the&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Capability Interview is that the job seeker remains in the warning zone with 3 demerit points accrued</li>
		<li>
Capability Assessment is that the job seeker transitions to the financial penalty zone</li>
		</ul>
<p>In either assessment, if it is determined that the job seeker is not capable of meeting their current compulsory requirements, then the demerits are removed, the job seeker returns to the green zone and the provider renegotiates their Job/Participation Plan.</p>

<p><strong>Answer&#58;</strong> Job seekers in the financial penalty zone must have full compliance each fortnight to receive their full entitlement that fortnight.</p>

<p><strong>Answer&#58;</strong> No, as payment is cancelled the person may reclaim a participation payment if they require income support again.

<p>They will be subject to <a href="../job-seekers/001-02030000-01.html">RapidConnect</a> and will return to the zone they were in prior to cancellation.</p>

<p>Sophia voluntarily left a job and immediately claimed a participation payment. The Service Officer with Unemployment Non-Payment Period (UNPP) security resource assessing the claim conducted an investigation, talking to both Sophia and the previous employer. The Service Officer determined that Sophia did not have a reasonable excuse for voluntarily leaving a job that was suitable and therefore Sophia has an unemployment failure.</p>

<p>The penalty for an unemployment failure is an unemployment preclusion period and Sofia will have to wait 4 weeks before the participation payment starts.</p>

<p>If, in the last 6 months, Sophia had received relocation assistance for the job Sophia left, the wait would be 6 weeks.</p>

<p>Jack didn't attend a provider appointment. When the provider records the non-attendance, Jack is sent an SMS telling him to contact his provider or his payment may be suspended. Jack contacts the provider within 2 business days to discuss the non-attendance. The provider decides no valid reason exists and applies 1 demerit. Jack is now in the warning zone with 1 demerit point. Each demerit lasts 6 months and then it expires. The provider also notifies a reconnection requirement, when the provider records Jack has met this requirement the payment will be restored.</p>

<p>Non-compliance in the warning zone is fully managed by the provider.</p>

<p>Jack is in the warning zone with 1 demerit accrued. Jack did not attend a job interview so the provider records the non-compliance and speaks to Jack about the reason for not going. The provider decides that Jack does not have a valid reason and explains to Jack that failing to attend job interview is considered a more serious mutual obligation failure. As a result Jack has been fast-tracked to 3 demerits points and must now undertake a Capability Interview. Jack cannot accrue any further demerits until the Capability Interview is completed.</p>

<p>As Jack has accrued 3 demerit points within 6 months a Capability Interview is required. The provider conducts the Capability Interview to make sure that Jack has the opportunity to talk about any issues that may be impacting the capacity to comply, all relevant circumstances have been identified and fully considered, and that the requirements are appropriate. The Job Seeker Classification Instrument (JSCI) is also reviewed to ensure Jack is in the right stream.</p>

<p>If after reviewing current circumstances the provider confirms that Jack is capable of meeting the activities in the current Job Plan, Jack will remain in the warning zone with 3 demerit points accrued.</p>

<p>Jack behaved in an inappropriate manner while at a job interview and is fast tracked to the next assessment point - a Capability Assessment conducted by Services Australia. The provider notifies Jack of the requirement to contact Services Australia and participate in a Capability Assessment. Jack's payment will be automatically restored after this.</p>

<p>A Service Officer in the Participation Solutions Team (PST) who has received the appropriate pre-requisite learning conducts the Capability Assessment. They check that all relevant circumstances have been identified an appropriately verified or assessed through an Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) where this is required. They also make sure Jack is in the correct servicing stream and that Jack is realistically able to comply with compulsory terms of the Job Plan and that these are in keeping with the relevant legislation and policies.</p>

<p>The Participation Compliance workflow is used to record the Capability Assessment, including any significant and ongoing circumstances that are impacting Jack's capacity to comply with requirements that are not already captured.</p>

<p>If Jack is capable of meeting the current terms of all requirements in the Job Plan Jack will move into the financial penalty zone.</p>

<p>If Jack is not capable of meeting current requirements in the Job Plan due to ongoing circumstances, the service stream has changed, the Job Plan contains a term that Jack cannot be compelled to meet, Jack will return to the green zone with the demerits reset to zero. Jack's provider will then renegotiate the Job Plan.</p>

<p>When Jack did not attend a Work for the Dole activity, a mutual obligation failure occurred. Jack's provider suspends the payment, and also sends a Non-Compliance Report to Services Australia.</p>

<p>This report passes through automatic validation processes in both the Employment Services System (ESS) and Services Australia IT system.</p>

<p>Jack receives an SMS advising that if there is a reason for not attending the activity, Jack needs to talk with the provider first before Jack is due to report. If the provider does not accept Jack had a valid reason for not attending the failure becomes active on Services Australia system on Jack's reporting date.</p>

<p>When Jack reports, if there is no valid reason for failing to attend, Jack can choose to accept the financial penalty for some failures while finalising the reporting without speaking with Services Australia.</p>

<p>Jack did not establish a reasonable excuse for failing to attend so the PST-skilled Service Officer applied a financial penalty. As this is Jack's first financial penalty, Jack will lose 50% of the fortnight's payment from the current entitlement period. This includes the basic allowance after the application of the income test and any add-ons that are paid with the participation payment, such as Rent Assistance.</p>

<p>The PST-skilled Service Officer explains to Jack that a second financial penalty results is a loss of the full fortnight's payment and a third financial penalty results in payment cancellation. Jack will then need to reclaim a payment if needed and will have to wait 4 weeks before receiving a participation payment again.</p>

<p>Jack does not have a reasonable excuse for non-attendance at a compulsory activity and a financial penalty is applied.</p>

<p>The PST-skilled Service Officer tells Jack, 'This is your third financial penalty so your payment has been cancelled. You will not be able to receive payment for 4 weeks. You can still use your concession card and you will still receive the same amount of Family Tax Benefit that you are currently getting.</p>

<p>You can reapply for payments during your post cancellation non-payment period however you will have to wait until the end of the 4 week non-payment period before your payment starts again. There is no hardship or waiver provisions during the non-payment period.</p>

<p>If you do start receiving a payment again, you will have a RapidConnect appointment with your provider, negotiate a Job Plan and you will remain in the financial penalty zone. If you have a penalty for a mutual obligation failure it will be your first penalty in the penalty count this time around, and your will only lose 1 weeks payment.</p>

<p>When you have fully complied with all your compulsory requirements for 3 months, you will return to the green zone'.</p>

<p>Jack's provider spoke about a job Jack was supposed to start but never turned up for. As Jack did not have a valid reason and the job suitable, the provider submits a report for Services Australia to investigate a work refusal failure.</p>

<p>The PST-Skilled Officer also determined that the work was suitable and Jack did not have a reasonable excuse for refusing the work. The penalty is a non-compliance cancellation and Jack has to wait 4 weeks before receiving a participation payment again.</p>

<p>Jack re-claims a participation payment after the post cancellation non-payment period. Jack returns to the green zone which is the zone he was in in prior to the non-compliance cancellation.</p>

<p>Where the job seeker returns to the warning zone, the accrued demerits are not reset to zero but may expire after 6 months. Likewise, if they are in the financial penalty zone the penalty count does not re-start from zero but may expire after 3 months.</p>

<p>However, a work refusal does not accrue a demerit, nor is it included in the penalty count.</p>
