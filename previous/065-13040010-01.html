<p>This document outlines the accommodation supplements payable to residential aged care services. Accommodation supplements are payable to residential aged care services on behalf of eligible permanent residential care recipients.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Accommodation_s">Accommodation supplement</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The accommodation supplement is paid to residential aged care services on behalf of care recipients to whom <strong>all</strong> of the following apply&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
They entered care on or after 20 March 2008</li>
		<li>
They cannot pay for some or all of their accommodation costs, and</li>
		<li>
They are eligible for assistance with accommodation costs based on an assessment of their financial circumstances</li>
		</ul>
<p>Permanent residential aged care recipients will contribute to the cost of their accommodation if they can afford it. Services Australia assesses the care recipientâ€™s financial circumstances effective for the date they enter care, including means not disclosed (MND). This is done as part of the aged care means assessment process. Services Australia and the Department of Veteransâ€™ Affairs will do the aged care means assessment by using 1 of the following methods&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
An assets assessment for care recipients who entered care between 20 March 2008 and 30 June 2014</li>
		<li>
A combined assets and income means assessment for care recipients who entered care on or after 1 July 2014</li>
		</ul>
<p>Prior to 1 July 2014, a means assessment was known as a Residential Care Assessment (RCA). The RCA covered 2 different assessment types (Residential Care Income Assessment and Residential Care Assets Assessment). See <a href="../older-australians/065-09000000-01.html">Aged care means assessment</a> for more information on these assessment types and who conducted them. </p>

<p>The care recipientâ€™s resident status (for example, <strong>low means</strong> or <strong>not low means</strong>) determines whether the care recipient is entitled to any assistance with their accommodation costs. Residential aged care services may be eligible to receive the accommodation supplement where the care recipient is assessed as <strong>low means</strong>. See <a href="../older-australians/065-22022446-01.html">Aged care - correction to resident status</a> for more information on care recipientsâ€™ resident status.</p>

<p>There is no application process. Services Australia automatically pays the accommodation supplement to the aged care services in respect to eligible care recipients. </p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Accommodationr">Accommodation-related supplements</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Services may receive the following accommodation-related supplements based on the permanent residential care recipientsâ€™ circumstances including when they entered into care&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Accommodation supplement (all schemes)</li>
		<li>
Accommodation charge top-up supplement (Post 2008 scheme)</li>
		<li>
Higher accommodation supplement (Post 2008 scheme)</li>
		<li>
Transitional accommodation supplement (Post 2008 scheme)</li>
		<li>
Pensioner supplement (Pre 2008 scheme)</li>
		<li>
Concessional resident supplement (Pre 2008 scheme)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Accommodation-related supplements are indexed twice a year on 20 March and 20 September. Current and historical rates are available on the Department of Health and Aged Careâ€™s Schedule of subsidies and supplement website. See the <a href="../older-australians/065-13040010-05.html">Resources</a> page for a link to the Schedule. </p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Accommodation supplement</strong></p>

<p>The accommodation supplement paid for an eligible care recipient can be reduced if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the care recipient entered care between 20 March 2008 and 30 June 2014, and had net assets over the threshold amount on the day they entered care</li>
		<li>
the care recipient entered care from 1 July 2014 and have either net assets or income over the relevant threshold</li>
		</ul>
<p>See <a href="../older-australians/065-09000000-01.html">Aged Care means assessment</a> for more information on these assessments.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Accommodation charge top-up supplement</strong></p>

<p>Services are eligible to receive an accommodation charge top-up for care recipients who entered care between 20 March 2008 and 19 March 2020, and at the time&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
were high-care recipients</li>
		<li>
were on income support</li>
		<li>
had to pay an accommodation charge on entry</li>
		<li>
the charge would have been higher if the care recipient was not in receipt of an income support payment</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p><strong>Higher accommodation supplement</strong></p>

<p>Eligible residential aged care services for higher accommodation supplement applies to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
new residential aged care services that was built on or after 20 April 2012</li>
		<li>
existing residential aged care services that were significantly refurbished on or after 20 April 2012</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p>The intention of the higher accommodation supplement is to encourage residential aged care services to improve their amenitiesâ€™ quality. </p>

<p>Residential aged care services not built or significantly refurbished after 20 April 2012 may be eligible for the standard accommodation supplement. Residential aged care services refurbished status can be viewed via the Aged Care Staff Portal (ACSP). See the <a href="../older-australians/065-22040405-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Using_the_Aged_06">Using the Aged Care Staff Portal to view a residential care serviceâ€™s Refurbished status (Service in Context)</a> table for the process on how to view this.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; the Department of Health and Aged Care automatically sends residential aged care servicesâ€™ Refurbished status information to Services Australia.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Transitional accommodation supplement</strong></p>

<p>The transitional accommodation supplement is payable to residential aged care services for permanent residential care recipients getting low-level care. </p>

<p>It is paid by making up the difference between the accommodation supplement and the higher pensioner supplement that it replaced. </p>

<p>Residential aged care services are eligible for the transitional accommodation supplement if the care recipient meet all of the following criteria&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they entered permanent residential aged care after 20 March 2008 and before 20 September 2011 </li>
		<li>
they are eligible to pay an accommodation bond</li>
		<li>
the level of the accommodation supplement for them would be lower than the level of pensioner supplement it replaced</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p><strong>Pensioner supplement</strong></p>

<p>The pensioner supplement is paid to a service to help cover eligible care recipientsâ€™ accommodation costs. </p>

<p>A service is eligible for a pensioner supplement for a care recipient where they are a pre-2008 reform care recipient and either&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
have a dependent child</li>
		<li>
are getting an income support payment but have not agreed to pay a large accommodation bond</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p>A service will not receive payment for ineligible care recipients if they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
do not have a dependent child, and </li>
		<li>
entered care before 20 September 2009 and paid, or agreed to pay, an accommodation bond that was more than 10 times the basic aged pension at the time they entered care, or</li>
		<li>
entered care on or after 20 September 2009 and paid, or agreed to pay, an accommodation bond that was more than 9 times the basic aged pension at the time they entered care</li>
		</ul>
<p>Accommodation bond amounts are rounded up to the nearest $500 for calculation purposes. </p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Concessional resident supplement</strong></p>

<p>Residential aged care services are eligible to receive the concessional resident supplement for care recipients if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they entered permanent residential aged care between 1 October 1997 and 19 March 2008</li>
		<li>
at the time they entered care, the service was certified</li>
		<li>
they were concessional care recipients based on an assessment of their financial circumstances at the time they entered care </li>
		</ul>
<p>At the time they entered care, concessional care recipients could not be asked to pay an accommodation bond or accommodation charge. The supplement is not available for respite care recipients. </p>

<p>The concessional resident supplement rate depends on whether the residential aged care service is new or significantly refurbished since 20 April 2012. The rate is also dependent on the aged care serviceâ€™s supported resident ratio. </p>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>


<p></p>
<div class="twisty">
	
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Supported_resid"></a>
<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Supported_resid">Supported resident ratio </h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A permanent residential care recipient is considered to be a supported care recipient when they are&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
assessed under the pre 2008 or post 2008 means assessment scheme </li>
		<li>
either Concessional, Assisted, Supported or Low Means care recipients</li>
		<li>
receiving hardship assistance for their accommodation costs</li>
		</ul>
<p>The ratio does not apply to respite care recipients and care recipients in extra service places. </p>

<p>The number of supported care recipients who reside in residential aged care service is then compared to the total number of care recipients. This determines when the maximum rate of accommodation supplement is used, to calculate the amount payable to aged care services, prior to taking into account a care recipientâ€™s contribution amount. </p>

<p>Up to 30 September 2022, aged care services must have over 40% supported care recipients in care on any day to get the full accommodation supplement amount. </p>

<p>If they do not have over 40% supported care recipients in care on any day, the maximum rate of accommodation supplement payable is reduced by 25% on each day the service did not have over 40% supported care recipients. </p>

<p>From 1 October 2022, the 40% supported resident ratio was simplified so that the 25% reduction is calculated over a calendar month rather than on individual days. </p>

<p>This means, over a calendar month, the 25% reduction will not apply in that month if the residential aged care service <strong>had </strong>40% or more supported care recipients on average. </p>

<p>Aged care services can view a breakdown of the Supported resident ratio via their payment statement. See the <a target="_blank" href="../older-australians/065-13100040-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Using_the_Aged_01">Using the Aged Care Staff Portal to view and download payment statements (Service in Context)</a> table for the process on how to view this.</p>
