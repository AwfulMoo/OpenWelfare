		<div class="block">

<p><strong>Restrictive item</strong> is an administrative term used by Medicare and it relates to the identification and processing methods used when items should not to be paid together.</p>

<p>Certain items listed in the MBS are not payable&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
when performed with other procedures or services </li>
		<li>
unless eligibility criteria are met, or</li>
		<li>
exceptional circumstances apply</li>
		</ul>
<p>The requirements for payment of Medicare benefits for these services are usually included as part of the description of service.</p>

<p>Some types of restrictions applied to MBS items are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
patient’s age</li>
		<li>
time dependency</li>
		<li>
aftercare periods</li>
		<li>
item restrictions</li>
		<li>
item associations</li>
		<li>
patient eligibility</li>
		<li>
health professional eligibility</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Assessing rules</strong> are added to MBS items in the Medicare mainframe. These rules and return messages provide advice to help Service Officers assess a claim. It may also explain why an item will pay without intervention.</p>

<p>When a return message presents in a claim Service Officers should&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
read the message in full (PF8 to read additional pages)</li>
		<li>
read any text/notation in the claim and patient history</li>
		<li>
review the assessing rules for the restrictive items</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p>The rules are not intended to cover every restrictive situation. </p>

<p>An item may display as restrictive with another but both may be eligible Medicare benefits.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Complete_medica01">Complete medical service</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A general principle in the MBS is that each professional service listed is a complete medical service in itself.</p>

<p>There are items that describe comprehensive or combined services. This means the item includes other individual services, which are essential to that complete medical service.</p>

<p>If a health professional performs a comprehensive or combined item, they shouldn’t bill the individual services that make up the complete medical service.</p>

<p>If more than one item covers a service it is the health professional’s responsibility to understand the item’s description and requirements before billing.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Principles_for_">Principles for assessing restrictive items</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Restrictions or exclusions are most common within the Surgical Operations Group (T8) of the MBS because of the complex nature of these services. </p>

<p>Carefully assess every restrictive situation to decide the correct benefit payable. The precise description of service contained within the MBS must be taken into account. </p>

<p>There are times where a restriction can apply in one situation but not in another. For example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the services were performed at separate times during the same day, or </li>
		<li>
where the services were performed on separate parts of the body</li>
		<li>
the services can be co-claimed in specific circumstances</li>
		</ul>
<p>Additional information may be required to support the payment of benefits where a restriction applies between 2 (or more) items. Health professionals can provide additional information in the claim transmission or notate on the account. The patient’s claiming history may also be needed to support payment of a restricted item.</p>

<p>If additional information to support the assessment is not available, reject the service/s.</p>

<p>Medicare claims are not to be automatically paid or rejected without checking the account/claim and other assessing aids, for example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
QITI, or </li>
		<li>
the MBS</li>
		</ul>
<p>If a claim is received with clinical details (for example service text, additional notations or an operation report), refer to <a href="../your-health/011-18120406-01.html">Assessing complex Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) claims with clinical details</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Bilateral and unilateral items</strong></p>

<p>Specific assessing rules apply to MBS items with the words bilateral and unilateral in their descriptor. </p>

<p>Unilateral means occurring on, performed on, or affecting one side of the body or one of its parts.</p>

<p>Bilateral refers to both sides of the body or affecting the right and left sides of the body or the right and left organs of the body.</p>

<p>If a unilateral item has an equivalent bilateral item, the health professional should use the appropriate item for the services provided.</p>

<p><strong>MBS item description interpretations</strong></p>

<p>Restrictive situations commonly take place where an item has a description stating&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a particular limitation, for example the service can’t be performed with another item within the group, or</li>
		<li>
the inclusion of other services </li>
		</ul>
<p>Below are common terms found in item descriptions. These are legislative limitations that may prevent the payment of Medicare benefits&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
as an independent procedure</li>
		<li>
where no other procedure is performed </li>
		<li>
not being a service associated with </li>
		<li>
not being a service to which another</li>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_As_an_independe">As an independent procedure</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Medicare benefits are not payable when an item containing the term <strong>as an independent procedure</strong> and another procedure&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
are performed through the same incision </li>
		<li>
occur in the same body area; or</li>
		<li>
where one procedure is an essential part of the other </li>
		</ul>
<p>When assessing an independent procedure item restriction, check the descriptions of both items and the assessing rules. </p>

<p><strong>Acceptable text</strong></p>

<p>If either restrictive item mentions a body area, the independent procedure is not payable if performed on the same body area even if performed through a separate incision. An independent procedure pays a Medicare benefit where the account and/or text notes ‘separate body area’ or similar.</p>

<p>Where there is no mention of a body area in either item, the independent procedure will only pay a Medicare benefit if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
performed through a separate incision, and </li>

the account/text notes ‘separate incision’, ‘separate sites’, lists the separate sites, or similar</li>

<p>There are situations where a subsequent attendance provided on the same day is a continuation of an earlier attendance. For example, a patient sees a GP and is given a prescription for a vaccine. The patient returns to have the injection administered after dispensing by the pharmacy. This is a continuation of the initial attendance and is only billed to Medicare once.</p>

<p>To be paid for claims for multiple attendance/consultation items with the same date of service (DOS), health professionals must provide text to support their claiming. </p>

<p><strong>Principles for deciding if text is acceptable</strong></p>

<p>Health professionals are responsible for claiming appropriately in line with&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
legislation, and </li>
		<li>
what is accepted by their peers as clinically appropriate</li>
		</ul>
<p>Service officers are responsible for deciding if the health professional has provided enough evidence to show they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
understand the rules of the items being claimed</li>
		<li>
believe the services are clinically relevant to the patient</li>
		<li>
have met the requirements to be paid for the items they are claiming</li>
		</ul>
<p>Generally, items with time-based restrictions (for example item 23) are for&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
separate occasions (times), and </li>
		<li>
separate conditions (reasons)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Generally, items for specific conditions or services can only be claimed with other attendance items if they are for <strong>separate conditions (reasons)</strong>. Health professionals encourage patients presenting with multiple clinical matters to book a separate consultation. In some cases this may not be possible or in the patient’s best interest</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> other categories in the MBS (for example pathology or diagnostic imaging services) may have other requirements. See <a href="../your-health/011-42080000-01.html">Diagnostic imaging assessing rules in Medicare</a> or <a href="../your-health/011-42090000-01.html">Pathology assessing rules in Medicare</a> for more information.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>There are items that place limitations on the number of times a service can be provided within a specified period of time in order to pay Medicare benefits. </p>

<p>Where an item description limits the number of times an item can be paid, additional services will not pay a Medicare benefit. If the description outlines the situation, additional services are paid. </p>

<p>Time dependency rules can be applied where there is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
limitations on the number of services that can be performed in a day or specified time period</li>
		<li>
requirements for notating a time difference or separate occasion between the services</li>
		<li>
a specific number of related items which can be claimed in a certain time period</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> there are instances where multiple time dependency rules apply to the one item.</p>

<p>See <a href="../your-health/011-42120030-05.html">Resources</a> page for examples of assessments of items with time dependency restrictions.</p>

<p><strong>Rolling vs calendar year</strong></p>

<p>Rolling and calendar years are 2 period types used to decide how the total number of services are calculated when an item description limits the number of services payable in a 12 month period.</p>

<p>A <strong>rolling year</strong> is defined as a 12 month period of time preceding the date of service claimed. For example, 13104 planning and management of home dialysis is calculated on a 12 month rolling year. </p>

<p>A <strong>calendar year</strong> is defined as the one year period of time that begins on 1 January and ends 31 December. For example, Better Access mental health plans and treatment services are calculated per calendar year. </p>

<p><strong>Special considerations&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Where a leap year occurs during the rolling year, the period becomes 366 days. This may require a request for a restriction lift </li>
		<li>
Where a claim is submitted late or out of order, the time dependency calculation is on date of service and date of processing. This will impact claims which are capped yearly. For example, where a patient can only have 12 services in any rolling or calendar year. A late submitted claim may not be payable if the total services on the patient history reaches the maximum allowed.</li>
		</ul>
<p>For example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Rolling year&#58;</strong> if a Medicare benefit can only be paid for a service once in a rolling year&#58;  </li>
			<ul>			<li>
the service was performed on 1 July 2012, another Medicare benefit for that same service is payable on or after 1 July 2013</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Calendar year&#58;</strong> if a Medicare benefit can only be paid for a service once in a calendar year&#58; </li>
			<ul>			<li>
the service was performed on 1 July 2012, another Medicare benefit for that same service is payable on or after 1 January 2013</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Time dependencies based on months</strong></p>

<p>Some time dependencies are for a specific number of months. For example, item 732 can only be claimed every 3 months. However, as February was only 28 days, the system will reject claims before 2 May 2021. This may require a request for a restriction lift.  </p>

<p>MBS items that apply to surgery include attendances necessary for the purposes of post-operative treatment of the patient. Post-operative treatment is generally referred to as <strong>aftercare</strong>.</p>

<p>Aftercare is deemed to include all post-operative treatment given by medical practitioners. It includes&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
all attendances until recovery from the operation</li>
		<li>
the final check or examination, regardless if the attendances are in hospital, private rooms, or the patient's home</li>
		</ul>
<p>Some items include or exclude aftercare in their item description. Where 'excluding aftercare' or similar is listed in an item’s description, Medicare benefits are payable for relevant post-operative treatment attendances.</p>

<p>Attendances that don’t form part of normal aftercare pay a Medicare benefit. These services need to have the account endorsed with the following before a benefit is paid&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>not normal aftercare</strong></li>
		<li>
<strong>NNAC</strong> or similar</li>
		</ul>
<p>Services which are not considered normal aftercare fall into 2 categories of services&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
attendances for a condition not related to the operation; or</li>
		<li>
attendances for complications arising from the operation</li>
