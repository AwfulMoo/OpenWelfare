		<div class="block">

<p>A Notice of Judgment or Settlement advises Services Australia (the agency) that a decision has been reached about a compensation claim for an amount greater than $5,000 (including legal expenses).</p>

<p>Under section 22 of the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995 (HOSC Act) the notifiable person has an obligation to advise the injured person of a potential debt liability. </p>

<p>This must occur in writing before settlement can occur. Question 2 on the Notice of Judgment or Settlement form (MO022)&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
asks the notifiable person to confirm this has occurred, and</li>
		<li>
is not compulsory</li>
		</ul>
<p>Under section 23 of the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995 (HOSC Act) a compensation payer or their representative must advise the agency of settlement or judgment within 28 days of the date the compensation was fixed. The agency needs the notification to be on a MO022.</p>

<p>The agency is required to recover the eligible Medicare benefits and residential care costs, once a judgment or settlement has been reached about the compensable injury or illness.</p>

<p>Under section 29(3) of the HOSC Act 1995, if valid notification of judgment or settlement is not received by the agency within 28 days from the date the compensation amount was set, the compensation payer is liable to repay any debts identified in the notice of charge. </p>

<p>They will get a compensation payer has not complied with legislated notice requirements letter (Z2809). Any payment made will be treated as an ad-hoc payment and will be applied to the notice of charge. </p>

<p>Under the Social Security Act 1991 (SS Act) an insurer or compensation payer may need to wait for a Centrelink clearance before releasing a compensation payment to the person. An advance payment can still be made to the agency without committing an offence under the SS Act, or the compensation payer may wait for a notice of charge. However a valid Notice of Judgment or Settlement is required to be submitted to the agency within 28 days (under section 23(2) of the HOSC Act).</p>

<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Apportionment of liability for Medicare Compensation Recovery </h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Apportionment of liability as a result of contributory negligence is a formal agreement or finding that reduces the amount of compensation that would otherwise be payable. Where apportionment of liability applies, the total amount payable to the agency is reduced by the proportion of liability for the injury or illness attributed to the injured person as indicated in the judgment or settlement documents if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the judgment or settlement fixes the amount of compensation on the basis that liability for the injury has been apportioned between the injured person and compensation payer, and</li>
		<li>
as a result, the amount of compensation is less than it would have been if liability had not been apportioned</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Evidence of liability</strong></p>

<p>The agency must be satisfied that settlement has been fixed on the basis that the original amount of compensation has been reduced as a result of an apportionment of liability.</p>

<p>The Medicare Compensation Recovery Notice of Judgment or Settlement form (MO022) form or settlement documents must include the percentage of apportionment attributed to the injured person.</p>

<p>Acceptable documentation to support an apportionment, if not provided on the MO022 is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
judgment or court order</li>
		<li>
consent order</li>
		<li>
terms of settlement</li>
		<li>
deed of release or discharge</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Reducing the amount owed</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
When the amount of compensation is reduced because an apportionment of liability has been applied for contributory negligence, the amount owed to the agency is reduced by the proportion of liability attributed to the injured person</li>
		<li>
For example, if the amount owing is $1,000 but 20% liability has been apportioned to the injured person in the claim, the recoverable amount is reduced by 20% to $800</li>
		<li>
When the notice of charge is issued, the reduced amount owed to the agency is automatically calculated in MCRS. The notice of charge will show the reduction</li>
		<li>
A notice of charge may be amended if a request is made within the 2 year reviewable period and supporting apportionment of liability settlement documents are provided</li>

<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Judgment fixes the amount of past expenses</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>When the 'amount of past medical expenses' and/or the 'amount of past nursing home, residential care or home care expenses' are fixed by a court at the time of judgment, this could mean either&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The total amount of medical and/or care costs has been established by the courts, and the Notice of Charge cannot exceed this amount, or</li>
		<li>
The Medicare and/or care costs recovery amount has been determined by the courts, and this is the amount the agency must recover</li>
		</ul>
<p>A judgment may deal differently with the medical and care costs. Each cost may have a recoverable amount set or effectively capped by the judgment independently of the other. </p>

<p>If one, or both, has <strong>not</strong> had the recoverable amount determined by the courts, a notice to claimant (NTC) must be issued to establish the related amount (of medical or care costs not set) which is recoverable.</p>

<p>To determine if the fixed costs are a maximum allowable, or the actual Medicare recovery amount requires an interpretation of the judgment. While not always applicable, wording in the judgement&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
may be direct and specify the amount recoverable by Medicare, or it may refer to the Medicare expenses. These indicate this is the amount the agency must collect on the Notice of charge (NOC)</li>
		<li>
may be more general and refer to the Medical and or care expenses amount. This indicates it is the maximum available for collection. In these cases the amount listed on the NOC cannot exceed this amount. If the agency has not yet established the recoverable amount, an NTC must be issued to determine the NOC</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the judgment is unclear that it includes fixed amounts for Medical or Medicare, escalate the matter to Program Management. </p>

<p>Like Medicare, Centrelink may recover benefits paid when a customer is paid compensation, however Centrelink has priority in recovery. </p>

<p>The agency cannot recover more than the total fixed compensation amount. Therefore, the maximum amount available for Medicare to recover is the total amount of compensation less the amount payable to Centrelink.</p>

<p>The Notice of Judgment or Settlement (NOJS) form and capture screen in MCRS contains a question/field to record the amount recoverable by Centrelink. However this is a non-compulsory. It is recognised that this information is not normally going to be available at settlement, so is not required on the form.</p>

<p>Medicare Compensation Recovery has no role in recovering the amount payable to Centrelink.</p>
