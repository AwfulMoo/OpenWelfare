<p><strong>ACP through a medical clinic or medical professional (parent was single at the time the child was conceived or the partner did not consent to the procedure)</strong></p>

<p>Individuals who have conceived a child via ACP through a medical clinic or medical professional should have documentation from the clinic or medical professional that the ACP took place. Such documentation can be accepted as verification of the ACP.</p>

<p>If at the time the child was conceived, the parent did not have a partner (or the partner did not consent to the ACP), generally, there is no other parent of the child, regardless of whether the donor is known or unknown. The decision maker should confirm that no other parent is named on the child's birth certificate. <strong>If there is no other parent named on the birth certificate</strong>, the parent would not be required to take reasonable maintenance action to receive more than the base rate of FTB Part A for the child. The MAT code IVF should be coded in these cases.</p>

<p>However, <strong>if there is another parent named on the birth certificate</strong> they should be referred to Child Support for a decision on whether the person named as the parent on the birth certificate is a parent for child support purposes. This will then determine whether reasonable maintenance action needs to be taken. If Child Support determines that the person named as the parent on the birth certificate is not a parent for child support purposes, the individual is not required to take reasonable maintenance action to receive more than the base rate for the child. MAT code to be applied is IVF in these cases.</p>

<p>Where the donor is known, the customer should be referred to Child Support for a decision on whether the donor is a parent for child support purposes. This will then determine whether reasonable maintenance action needs to be taken. If Child Support determines that the donor is not a parent for child support purposes, the individual is not required to take reasonable maintenance action to receive more than the base rate for the child. MAT code to be applied is IVF in these cases.</p>

<p>Centrelink must confirm that Child Support have rejected the application before coding IVF in these cases. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-51010040-01.html">Centrelink action when an application for child support assessment is rejected by Child Support</a> for further details.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> before referring the case to Child Support, Centrelink should consider whether any MAT exemptions apply (other than IVF).</p>

<p>In cases where the donor is known and the recipient has advised that they will not provide the name of the donor, Child Support will be unable to register the case.

<p>Dean and Ian were in a same-sex relationship and in May 2009 had a child together through a surrogacy arrangement where they were both named on the court order as parents of the child.</p>

<p>Dean was in receipt of Family Tax Benefit for the child as a single customer as their relationship was not recognised for family assistance purposes.</p>

<p>In June 2009, Dean and Ian separated and Dean continued to have 100% care of the child. Dean was provided with an exemption from meeting the MAT due to same-sex parentage not being recognised.</p>

<p>From 1 July 2009, Dean's exemption from meeting the MAT is reviewed and subsequently removed and Dean is required to obtain child support from Ian within 91 days (13 weeks) as Ian was recognised as the other parent based on the court order.</p>

<p>If Dean fails to take reasonable action to obtain child support from Ian, or does not apply for another exemption, then Dean may only be eligible to receive the base rate of Family Tax Benefit Part A for the child.</p>

<p>A decision has been made that (you need/your partner needs) to take reasonable action to obtain child support for (affected child name/s) to continue to receive more than the minimum rate of Family Tax Benefit Part A.</p>

<p>Choose option&#58;</p>

<p>This is because the birth certificate provided shows that (affected child name/s) has two legal parents.</p>

<p><strong>Or</strong></p>

<p>This is because we have not received a document or a receipt indicating the procedure was undertaken by a medical professional or medical clinic. You should also provide a copy of a birth certificate if you haven't already done so.</p>

<p>What (you need/your partner needs) to do</p>

<p>If (you are/your partner is) already receiving child support in the form of regular cash or lump sum payments, for example, mortgage payments, household expenses or school fees, you will still need to apply for a child support assessment.</p>

<p>You also need to call us on 136 150 so we can let you know how this may affect your Family Tax Benefit.</p>

<p>If there is a reason that makes it difficult for (you/your partner) to apply for a child support assessment for (affected child name/s), please call 136 150 so we can discuss your options.</p>
