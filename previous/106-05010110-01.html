		<div class="block">

<p>For Australian Apprentice claims lodged prior to 1 July 2018, the ABSTUDY claim must be lodged within 14 days of the intent to claim in order to receive payment (where eligible) from the date of lodgement of intent to claim</p>

<p>From 1 July 2018, Australian Apprentices will receive payments (where eligible) from the date they actually submit a complete claim unless they are a vulnerable customer.</p>

<p>Australian Apprentices may be entitled to an extension of time to lodge their claim due to a medical condition or special circumstance. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-18032700-01.html">Intent to claim and vulnerable customers</a>.</p>

<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Backdated payments</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>For an ABSTUDY student's start date to be backdated, a claim must be lodged by the appropriate closing date, which is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the end of the calendar year of the year of study if applying for a full-year course</li>
		<li>
the end of the course if applying for a course of less than 1 year (this includes short courses that overlap consecutive calendar years)</li>
		<li>
by end of the calendar year in which the course started. For a late starting course (a late starting course is a course of 30 weeks or more that starts between 1 April and 30 June or between 1 August and 31 December in the year of study)</li>
		</ul>
<p>A late lodgement concession may be granted if claims are lodged outside the closing dates due to circumstances beyond the applicant’s control.</p>

<p>The decision to backdate ABSTUDY cannot cover the same period for which the customer was in receipt of a Social Security payment (for example, JobSeeker Payment (JSP), Youth Allowance (YA), or Austudy). There must be a loss of entitlement for these payments to be cancelled retrospectively. The backdating of ABSTUDY is not an acceptable reason for a retrospective cancellation. See <a href="../job-seekers/001-19051528-01.html">JobSeeker Payment (JSP) job seekers returning to full time study</a>.</p>

<p>Where a customer has received the Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment (PLDP), and ABSTUDY is to be retrospectively backdated, eligibility to the PLDP will be affected and will need to be rejected. See <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-20080418-01.html">Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment</a>.</p>

<p>This does not apply to Family Tax Benefit (FTB) where the ABSTUDY payment is clearly more beneficial and/or the FTB customer agrees to a retrospective cancellation of FTB.</p>

<p><strong>From 1 January 2020</strong>, children aged 16-19 years can still be considered an FTB child if they are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
receiving an ABSTUDY payment as a full-time secondary student</li>
		<li>
living away from home, and</li>
		<li>
boarding to study</li>

<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Family Tax Benefit (FTB) to ABSTUDY when turning 16</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Some customers who apply for ABSTUDY Living Allowance from their 16th birthday may lodge their ABSTUDY claim after they turn 16 years of age. The ABSTUDY Living Allowance can be backdated to their 16th birthday. However, as FTB may have been paid for the student, this would create an FTB overpayment.</p>

<p><strong>From 1 January 2020</strong>, students aged 16-19 years receiving ABSTUDY Living Allowance can still be considered an FTB child if they are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a full-time secondary student</li>
		<li>
living away from home, and</li>
		<li>
boarding to study</li>
		</ul>
<p>This means the student can receive ABSTUDY and the parent/guardian can be paid FTB for the student.</p>

<p>Where the secondary student remains living at home to study, the FTB customer and the student must decide which payment is most beneficial in their individual circumstances, before backdating ABSTUDY.</p>

<p>If the FTB customer cannot be contacted, ABSTUDY is only to be granted from date paid +1 of the FTB (where the secondary student is living at home), unless it is obvious ABSTUDY is more beneficial. For example, they are eligible to be backdated living away from home allowances.</p>

<p>The system will automatically cease FTB for the student from the grant date of the ABSTUDY (where the secondary student is living at home).</p>

<p>Customers in receipt of ABSTUDY for undertaking secondary school studies, remain eligible for ABSTUDY payments up until 31 December. Customers who are continuing studies in the next available study period are eligible for payments from 1 January.</p>

<p>If FTB was paid (instead of ABSTUDY when student living at home) for a customer to undertake their secondary school studies and they complete the school year, their FTB entitlement may not always pay up to 31 December.</p>

<p>See <a target="_blank" href="../families/007-07040060-01.html">Study requirements for Family Tax Benefit children aged 16 years or over</a>.</p>

<p>Therefore, to ensure there is no gap in payments, the customer can transfer to ABSTUDY and be paid from date paid to +1, as long as they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
are intending to enrol in a full-time or concessional study load, in an approved course, in the next available study period</li>
		<li>
lodge a claim for ABSTUDY by the closing date, which is 31 December in the year secondary study is completed, and</li>
		<li>
qualify for ABSTUDY</li>
		</ul>
<p>The system will automatically cease FTB for the student from the grant date of the ABSTUDY if they are 16 years of age or over and living at home to study. If the secondary student is aged 16 years or over and is living away from home to study and boarding, FTB can continue in addition to the ABSTUDY.</p>
