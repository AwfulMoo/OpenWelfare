	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The Department of Health have provided updated policy advice on how a practitioner can obtain agreement from their patient for an assignment of benefit for <strong>face-to-face services</strong> that are bulk billed during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Where a patient is seen face-to-face and the health professional chooses to bulk bill, reasonable steps must be taken to obtain a signature agreement. For example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Written signature</li>
		<li>
Medicare easy claim, patient selects either the <strong>OK</strong> or <strong>yes</strong> button on the EFTPOS terminal</li>
		<li>
Email agreement, or</li>
		<li>
Signature of a responsible third party</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>However</strong>, if the patient refuses to sign the form, that is, does not want to touch the pen or paper, the practitioner can obtain the agreement verbally. To do this the health professional must&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Identify on the form that the patient is unable to sign the assignment of benefit and include the reason, for example, COVID-19, risk of exposure to COVID-19, Verbal agreement, Telehealth, Phone consult</li>
		<li>
Notate the verbal agreement of assignment of benefit in the patient’s clinical notes</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> this policy is a temporary measure, currently effective until <strong>31 December 2022</strong>.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Manual bulk bill claims</strong></p>

<p>To support this temporary policy, bulk bill manual claims received with a date of lodgement from 13 March 2020 can be accepted, where the following has been provided&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
A completed header, signed by the health professional and witness</li>
		<li>
An assignment of benefit form with&#58;</li>
		<li>
patient’s signature, or</li>
		<li>
the reason why the patient is unable to sign the assignment of benefit form, for example, COVID-19, risk of exposure to COVID-19</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> this policy only applies where the patient refuses to sign (that is, does not want to touch the pen and/or paper). The above information does not replace existing policy for all other ‘unable to sign/blank signature’ scenarios.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Bulk_billing">Bulk billing</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Bulk billing, also known as direct billing, is when a health professional bills Medicare directly for any medical or allied health service that a patient receives. Bulk billing is available to all persons in Australia who are eligible for a Medicare benefit under the Medicare program.</p>

<p>Where a health professional and a patient enter in to a bulk bill arrangement, the&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Servicing health professional undertakes to accept the relevant Medicare benefit as full payment for the service. <a href="../your-health/011-43030000-01.html#bp01_L2GT_Additional_charges_f">Additional charges for that service cannot be raised</a>, <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
Patient assigns their right to the Medicare benefit to the servicing health professional, allowing the benefit to be paid directly to the health professional</li>
		</ul>
<p>Health professionals must lodge claims for assigned benefits in accordance with the approved forms and within a period of 2 years from the date of service. <strong>See also&#58;</strong> <a href="../your-health/011-43040000-01.html">Bulk bill latter day adjustment (LDA) claims in Medicare</a>.</p>

<p>There is no minimum age restriction for a patient to assign their right to a Medicare benefit to the servicing health professional. However, the patient must have the capacity to understand what they are signing. Health professionals must use their discretion to determine a patient's capacity.</p>

<p>Bulk billing cannot be used as a form of debt collection for unpaid accounts.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> section 20A of the Health Insurance Act 1973 allows a patient to assign their right to a Medicare benefit to the health professional who has rendered the service.</p>

<p>The <a href="../your-health/011-43030000-05.html">Resources</a> page contains a link to the Medicare Benefit Schedule (MBS) Online Explanatory Note GN.7.17, which has further information about bulk billing.</p>

<p>A patient can assign their right to a Medicare benefit to the servicing health professional by signing a completed and approved assignment of benefit form for manual and online claiming. The patient or other responsible person must not sign a blank or incomplete assignment of benefit form.</p>

<p>Under section 20B (3) of the Health Insurance Act 1973, a copy of the completed form must be given to the patient or other responsible person after the patient has signed the form.</p>

<p>Where the servicing health professional (for example, GP) requests pathology services, but the patient does not physically attend the Approved Pathology Practitioner (APP) as the pathology sample was collected by the servicing health professional, the patient may complete an assignment of benefit voucher at the time of the visit to the requesting health professional (for example, GP) to assign benefits for the APP's service.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
Patient’s parent</li>
		<li>
Guardian</li>
		<li>
Other responsible person</li>
		</ul>
<p>In the absence of a parent, guardian or responsible person, the ‘patient signature’ section should be left blank.</p>

<p>Where the signature space is either left blank or another person signs on the patient's behalf, the assignment of benefit form must include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the notation 'Patient unable to sign', <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
in the 'Practitioner's Use' section, the reason why the patient was unable to sign, for example, unconscious, injured hand</li>
		</ul>
<p>For Medicare Easyclaim, consent from the patient, the patient's parent, guardian or other responsible person is acceptable by pressing the OK or YES button on the EFTPOS terminal.</p>

<p><strong>Responsible person</strong></p>

<p>'Responsible person' refers to an adult person accompanying the patient or in whose care the patient has been placed. A responsible person can include someone who&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
is the parent or guardian</li>
		<li>
holds power of attorney</li>
		<li>
holds a guardianship order</li>

health professional's staff</li>
		<li>
hospital proprietor or staff, <strong>or</strong></li>
		<li>
residential aged care facility proprietor or staff</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Patient unable to sign - sensitive issue</strong></p>

<p>If the health professional determines that the reason the patient is unable to sign is of a highly sensitive nature, they can notate 'due to medical condition' or ‘due to sensitive condition’ in the 'Practitioner's Use' section. This would only be the case if revealing the reason would&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
constitute an unacceptable breach of patient confidentiality, <strong>or</strong></li>
		<li>
unduly embarrass or distress the recipient of the patient's copy of the assignment of benefit form</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> This should not be routine practice, and ‘extenuating circumstances’ is not acceptable notation for the lack of patient signature.</p>

<p>If the claim is a resubmission of a previously submitted claim, refer to the section <strong>Bulk bill resubmissions</strong> for further information.</p>

<p><strong>Patient unable to sign- deceased</strong></p>

<p>The health professional and patient must have entered into a bulk bill agreement at the time of service including having the patient sign the assignment of benefit form.</p>

<p>Where a signature is not obtained from a patient, a signature from a responsible person is acceptable. A responsible person can be&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the executor of the will</li>
		<li>
an appointed administrator</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the notation ‘patient deceased’ is not a sufficient reason for a health professional not obtaining a signature on the assignment of benefit form. A signature <strong>must</strong> be provided on the assignment of benefit form, from either the patient or the responsible person.</p>

The electronic device used to capture the signature is able to replicate the existing form approved for the purposes of subsection 20A(1) of the Health Insurance Act 1973</li>

The signature on the electronic device is reliable and identifies the patient and indicates that patient's intention to assign the Medicare benefit</li>

<p>A patient's refusal to sign the assignment of benefit form is different to a patient being unable to sign the form.

any consumables that would be reasonably necessary to perform the service, including bandages and dressings</li>

<p><strong>Exception</strong></p>

<p>The only exception where an additional charge against a bulk billed patient can be raised is where the patient is provided with a vaccine or vaccines from the health professional's own supply held on the premises.</p>

<p>This exception only applies to general practitioners and other non-specialist health professionals in association with attendance items 3 to 96 and 5000 to 5267 (inclusive). It only relates to vaccines that are not available to the patient free of charge through Australian Government or state government funding arrangements or available through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). The additional charge must only be to cover the supply of the vaccine.</p>

<p>Where a health professional chooses not to bulk bill a patient, they may privately raise an additional charge against a patient, such as for a consumable.</p>
