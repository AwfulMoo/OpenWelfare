<p>Before discussing the travel details and caring situation, CO are to provide the customer with some general information about Carer Payment and Carer Allowance and the respite/portability provisions available to them.</p>

<p><strong>Suggested dialogue&#58;</strong></p>

<p>'The purpose of today's call is to provide you with some information regarding Carer Payment and Carer Allowance and to review your caring situation.</p>

<p>There are specific criteria to be eligible for Carer Payment and/or Carer Allowance. The common eligibility criteria of these payments is that constant care and attention is being provided on a daily basis.</p>

<p>We understand that providing care is very demanding and carers will need to have a temporary break from the caring situation. We call this type of break or absence from care 'respite'.</p>

<p>A carer can take up to 63 days respite in each calendar year for taken a break from the caring situation. These days may be used for any purpose including overseas travel for either the carer or the care receiver.</p>

<p>If the carer is travelling overseas, there are specific portability rules around how long CP and/or CA can be paid whilst a carer is overseas taking into account the use of the allowable respite days.</p>

<p>CP and/or CA payments can continue to be paid if all 63 days are used within a calendar year. If a carer decides to have further breaks from care exceeding 63 days in a calendar year, they will not be eligible for CP and/or CA and their payments may be cancelled.</p>

<p>If an absence from care is or becomes permanent, this means that care is no longer being provided and CP and/or CA will cease to be payable.</p>

<p>I will provide you with more detail in regards to this as we go through and check your caring situation'.</p>

<p>If the customer exceeds the total allowable 63 days for temporary cessation of care (TCC) (respite), CP and/or CA may continue for more than 63 days if there is a '<strong>special reason</strong>'.</p>

<p>To determine if a customer is eligible for an extension beyond 63 days respite CO will need to consider the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the reason for ceasing care would need to be outside the control of the customer and consistent with the need for, and provision of, personal care and attention, a 'special reason', and</li>
		<li>
the customer would resume providing home care at the required level after a definite period. See <a href="../carers/009-06010090-01.html">Temporary cessation of care (respite) for more than 63 days</a></li>
		<li>
whether portability provisions affect the Carer Payment and/or Carer Allowance. See <a href="../carers/009-03100010-01.html">Carer Allowance (CA) and Carer Payment (CP) interaction of portability and temporary cessation of care (respite) rules</a></li>

<p>'<strong>Special reasons</strong>' is determined by an APS5/APS6. CO will need to consult with their Quality Development Officer (QDO) and/or Team Manager (TM) to get approval to apply an extension. Following consultation, refer to <a href="../carers/009-06010090-03.html#bp03_tbl_Assisted_proces_Step02">Temporary cessation of care (respite) for more than 63 days</a> for coding requirements from Step 2 in Table 1.</p>

<p>Before applying the temporary cessation of care provisions (respite) COs will need to be satisfied that&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the cessation of care is temporary, and</li>
		<li>
each case considered on its own merits, refer to</li>
		</ul>
<p>See <a href="../carers/009-06010010-01.html">Temporary Cessation of Care (respite) provisions for Carer Payment (CP) and Carer Allowance (CA)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>When applying respite CO needs to consider&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
whether portability provisions apply (if the customer has travelled overseas) in relation to Carer Payment and/or Carer Allowance</li>
		<li>
whether the customer and care receiver travelled together</li>
		<li>
the current travel details as well as any previous travel or non-travel related respite that may have occurred whilst the carer was current on Carer Payment/Carer Allowance within the scope period</li>
		<li>
was the cessation of care temporary</li>
		</ul>
<p>Use the information obtained during the discussion with the customer to determine if the customer can access any respite or a possible extension of respite. See below to assist in assessing and updating the customer's record&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<a href="../carers/009-03100000-01.html">Carer Payment (CP) and Carer Allowance (CA) overseas absences</a></li>

		<li>
<a href="../carers/009-06010090-01.html">Temporary cessation of care (respite) for more than 63 days</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>Use the Temporary cessation of Care workflow tool where possible to update the travel period absences for the relevant calendar year/s.</p>

<p>Care <strong>must</strong> be taken when updating <strong>Historical calendar years</strong> or <strong>Historical days in a current calendar year</strong>, especially where it has been determined that care has resumed. If the customer has ongoing entitlement to CP/CA do not cancel the payments. Any debt will need to be worked out manually for the historical period.</p>

<p><strong>Debt Calculation</strong></p>

<p>Use the <a href="../debts/107-03020040-01.html">Payment Summary Tool</a> to help calculate any debt resulting from the above assessment.</p>

<p>Debts would normally occur from the 64th day of respite exceeding. This is dependent on the assessment that has been determined, that is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
has an extension been applied</li>
		<li>
do the portability rules affect the allowable days, the departure date and any return date</li>
		<li>
other respite days used outside of travel</li>
		</ul>
<p>If unsure on how to code historical respite days and/or calculate a debt, check with the Quality Development Officer.</p>

<p>All debts that can be calculated via the Centrelink system and explained using <a href="../debts/107-03020020-01.html">ADEX</a> should be calculated that way. Only use <strong>MultiCal</strong> if the Centrelink system calculation is not possible or the outcome is not correct.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
Debt schedule - do the debt dates/date of event (DOV) match the period? </li>
		<li>
Have the updates/coding been entered correctly?</li>

			<ul>			<li>
Working Credit Balance Summary (<strong>WCBS</strong>)</li>
			<li>
Income Bank (<strong>NIB</strong>)</li>
			<li>
Employment Income Assessment (<strong>EIA</strong>)</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Can a reassessment be made using the Benefit Action (<strong>BA</strong>) screen? </li>

Use <strong>REA</strong> in relevant host system, or</li>
			<li>
<strong>RCR</strong> in <strong>PEN/PGA</strong> (for cancelled PEN and PGA records) and leave <strong>Reason</strong> blank</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> check if <a href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/109-06030000-01.html">Review of Assessment (ROA)</a> coding is needed to generate allowable arrears. Do this when corrected income is less than declared, but the system did not generate arrears for those periods/fortnights.</p>

<p>If an <strong>ADEX</strong> debt calculation&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
can be undertaken, the overpayment must be calculated with the customer over the phone where possible</li>
		<li>
is not possible, a <a href="../debts/107-03020030-01.html">MultiCal debt calculation</a> may be required</li>

<p>For help using tools to calculate debts, see the <a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-13050120-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Intranet_links">Resources</a> page for a link to Calculators and Tools.</p>

<p>It is recommended to use the debt advice template when raising debts from verbal updates. COs can change the information recorded in the debt advice to suit the customer situation.</p>

<p>See <a href="../debts/107-04010030-05.html">Sending Account Payable letters</a> for debt reason codes, default text for the Account Payable (<strong>OPAOD</strong>) screen, and the rules for entering free text.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when a debt includes both a Carer Payment (CP) or Carer Allowance (CA) component and a Carer Supplement (CS) component, the system will not issue the account payable notice.</p>

<p>Send a <strong>Q417</strong> letter which breaks down the debt amount for these 2 components. The <strong>Debt Action</strong> script will issue the letter in these cases. See <a href="../carers/009-07010000-01.html">Carer Supplement (CS)</a> for more information.</p>

<p><strong>Deceased customers</strong></p>

<p>For procedure on raising debts, see <a href="../debts/107-04010110-01.html">Requesting refunds and raising debts for deceased customer</a>.</p>

<p>If required, a Payments and Integrity social worker may be able to assist with advising executors regarding the debt, see <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-12070000-01.html">Social workers role in Payment and Integrity</a>.</p>
