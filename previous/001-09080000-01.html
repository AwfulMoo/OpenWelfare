<H2 id=_Toc344898764>About Work for the Dole</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Entry into the WFD program provides job seekers with an opportunity to improve their job prospects, get valuable work experience and help their local community.</P>
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> for information regarding requirements under Community Development Program, see <A href="../job-seekers/001-02140000-01.html">Community Development Program (CDP)</A>.</P>
<P>Job seekers undertaking WFD will have their activities negotiated by their jobactive provider. Providers use the Targeted Compliance Framework to manage WFD requirements.</P>
<P>Services Australia does not refer job seekers to WFD, but is responsible for informing job seekers of their mutual obligation requirements and determining if financial penalties apply for mutual obligation failures committed by job seekers in the financial penalty zone.</P>
<P>The job seeker continues to be subject to the usual requirements to comply with requests from Services Australia and to meet their mutual obligation requirements throughout their placement on WFD.</P>
<P>The <A href="../job-seekers/001-09080000-05.html">Resources</A> page contains a link to the Department of Education, Skills and Employment website regarding Work for the Dole (WFD) as well as WFD provider contacts in each state and territory.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<H2 id=_Toc344898764>Annual Activity Requirement (AAR) and the Work for the Dole Phase</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Job seekers aged 18 and over participating in jobactive and receiving income support have <A href="../job-seekers/001-09000000-01.html">mutual obligation requirements</A>, which includes meeting an <A href="../job-seekers/001-09070200-01.html">Annual Activity Requirements for jobactive</A>. An AAR is the set number of hours that eligible job seekers must complete in approved activities when they are in the Work for the Dole Phase. The Work for the Dole Phase is a six-month consecutive period each year. The number of hours each week that job seekers participate in Work for the Dole (WFD) or other approved activities will vary according to their age and work capacity.</P>
<P>While job seekers are undertaking WFD, they must continue to meet their mutual obligation requirements, including undertaking job search activities and attending provider appointments.</P>
<P>See <A href="../job-seekers/001-09070200-01.html">Annual Activity Requirements for jobactive</A> for additional information.</P>
<P>Note: for information regarding WFD requirements under the Community Development Program (CDP), see <A href="../job-seekers/001-02140000-01.html">Community Development Program (CDP)</A>.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<H2 id=_Toc344898764>Work for the Dole activities</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Work for the Dole is for job seekers participating in jobactive. It is a work experience program which places job seekers in activities where they can build new skills, experience and confidence to move from welfare to work while giving back to their community. A variety of WFD activities and placements are available. Some examples include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>computer graphics work</LI>
<LI>animal or wildlife shelter activities</LI>
<LI>retail work</LI>
<LI>rehabilitation of public parks</LI>
<LI>office administration</LI>
<LI>warehouse duties</LI>
<LI>gardening and maintenance</LI></UL>
<P>Activities must provide benefit to the broader community, improve employment prospects of participants and reduce alienation of unemployed people from their community.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P></P>
<DIV class=twisty><A name=bp01_L2GT_WFD_referrals class=anchor></A>
<H2 id=_Toc344898764>WFD referrals</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>The jobactive provider has full responsibility for referring job seekers to a WFD activity.</P>
<P>Service Officers cannot make direct referrals to WFD and must direct job seekers interested in participating in WFD to their provider to discuss referral and placement.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P></P>
<DIV class=twisty><A name=bp01_L2GT_Compulsory_Work class=anchor></A>
<H2 id=_Toc344898764>Compulsory Work for the Dole requirements</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Job seekers aged 18 to 49 years who are receiving a full rate of income support payment will normally have Work for the Dole as the principal activity to meet their <A href="../job-seekers/001-09070200-01.html">Annual Activity Requirements</A> unless they:</P>
<UL>
<LI>have arranged with their provider to meet their AAR through another approved activity that will start at the time they become subject to the AAR, or</LI>
<LI>are already undertaking other approved activities at the time they enter the Work for the Dole Phase</LI></UL>
<P>Job seekers aged 50 and over may choose to undertake Work for the Dole <STRONG>or</STRONG> other approved activities to meet their AAR. Job seekers aged 50 and over can choose <STRONG>not to</STRONG> undertake WFD to meet their AAR, but must undertake other compulsory approved activities that must be included in their Job Plan. The provider cannot compel them to undertake WFD to meet their AAR.</P>
<P>When the job seeker commences in an activity to meet their AAR, the jobactive provider will enter it into the job seeker's Job Plan and advise the job seeker that they must comply with the activity. The activity will automatically display on the Activities and Exemptions Summary Screen (AEX), showing the start and end dates as per the Job Plan.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P></P>

<H2 id=_Toc344898764>Voluntary participation</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Job seekers under 18 years of age cannot participate in WFD, even if they wish to volunteer.</P>
<P>Job seekers receiving employment assistance as a volunteer (Stream A Voluntary) are not eligible to do WFD.</P>
<P>Principal Carer Parents and those assessed as having a Partial Capacity to Work who do not have compulsory participation requirements of any age can volunteer for Work for the Dole.</P>
<P>Job seekers aged 50 and over with full-time mutual obligation requirements must undertake approved activities to meet their mutual obligation requirements (including any AAR), and may volunteer to undertake Work for the Dole as part of these activities.</P>
<P>Job seekers, aged 50 and over, with full-time mutual obligation requirements, cannot be compelled to undertake Work for the Dole. However, if they choose to voluntarily undertake Work for the Dole to meet their requirements, and not just during the Work for the Dole phase to meet AAR, the activity must be entered as a compulsory activity in the Job Plan by their jobactive provider.</P>
<P>A job seeker receiving a part-rate income support cannot be compelled to participate in Work for the Dole or another approved program of work. These job seekers can participate in Work for the Dole as a voluntary participant.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<H2 id=_Toc344898764>Payments, supplement and services during Work for the Dole</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Work for the Dole participants remain entitled to their income support payment (that is, JobSeeker Payment (JSP), Special Benefit (SpB), Youth Allowance (YA), Disability Support Pension (DSP) or Parenting Payment (PP)) and receive an additional fortnightly <A href="../job-seekers/001-09080040-01.html">supplement</A> to assist with the costs of their WFD placement. Job seekers are eligible for the supplement regardless of the WFD activity being undertaken on a compulsory or voluntary base, to help with the costs of attendance.</P>
<P>Job seekers are not able to be in receipt of the WFD supplement and the Pensioner Education Supplement (PES) at the same time.</P>
<P>Job seekers may be eligible for <A href="../families/007-17103148-01.html">Additional Child Care Subsidy (ACCS) (Transition to Work)</A> whilst participating in work for the dole.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Job seekers who are exempt from their mutual obligation requirements and who do not continue to voluntarily participate during the exemption period, at any stage during an entitlement period, will have their WFD supplement suspended. The suspension will be applied from the exemption start date for job seekers with mutual obligation requirements. The supplement will be reinstated on the following day after the exemption has ended, unless the job seeker volunteered to participate within the exemption period. In this case, the supplement will only be paid if there was participation during the entitlement period.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<P>As part of negotiating a WFD requirement:</P>
<UL>
<LI>job seekers are expected to take personal responsibility for working with their provider to identify circumstances that have the potential to impact on their ability to participate so that requirements are appropriate to their circumstances</LI>
<LI>providers must ensure that the compulsory requirement is consistent with relevant legislation and policies, do not exceed prescribed maximum limits set out in social security law and that they have considered the job seeker's personal circumstances and assessed capacity</LI></UL>
<P>The Job Plan includes the WFD requirement, the individual days and locations the job seeker is required to attend. These are scheduled by the provider.</P>
<P>Providers are responsible for managing compliance of these requirements under the Targeted Compliance Framework. For further information, see <A href="../job-seekers/001-10070080-01.html">Failing to attend or satisfactorily participate in a compulsory activity</A>.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
