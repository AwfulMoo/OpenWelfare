		<li>
For a person born (or migrated to Australia) after approximately 1988 links to a parent should exist. For example, family assistance, Child Care payments, maternity payments</li>
		<li>
The person could have been linked as a partner / nominee to a person who has previously received a payment from Services Australia</li>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the record is created in the incorrect environment and a claim is granted, the customer will <strong>not</strong> receive a payment.

<p>A customer’s eligibility must be established as early as possible during a verbal claim. The verbal claim template will advise staff when a customer has not met eligibility criteria – the process of collecting claim information can cease at certain points, with the customer being advised that the Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment is not a suitable payment for them.</p>

<p>It is not a requirement for a customer to give evidence. </p>

<p>Customers must be asked to provide the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
date of exposure (if known)</li>
		<li>
start date of self-isolation, quarantine or caring period</li>
		<li>
date a personal instruction from a <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-20080418-03.html#bp03_tbl_Common_definiti_2">required authority</a> to self-isolate or quarantine was received, if relevant.

<p>For the purposes of receiving the Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment, the <strong>start date of the period the customer is claiming is the start of the</strong>&#58;</p>

<p>Staff will use this date in the <strong>Date affected by the event </strong>field when running the Disaster Recovery Payment Claims workflow. For first claims, this is <strong>always</strong> the start of the self-isolation, quarantine or caring period.
