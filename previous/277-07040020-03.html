<p>When the initial or subsequent estimate details load and pend in the Client Income window, 1 of these intrays generates&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>PENDING ESTIMATED INCOME</strong> (initial estimate), or</li>
		<li>
<strong>PENDING CLI AMENDED EST</strong> (subsequent estimate) </li>
		</ul>
<p>The estimate details are recorded in a notepad on the pended entry in the customer’s <strong>Client Income</strong> window.</p>

<p>The notepad identifies if the estimate was lodged via CS online or the app.</p>

<p>There can be more than 1 pended entry. For example the customer has submitted&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Initial estimates on different days, or</li>
		<li>
Client amended estimates with different dates of event</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Initial estimates do not meet the 85% validity requirement</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
These are automatically made invalid and rejected in Cuba</li>
		<li>
An ME1-1 letter automatically generates advising the estimate election was invalid</li>
		<li>
The customer has no objection rights</li>
		<li>
No manual intervention is required </li>
		<li>
Select the ‘Find’ function and ‘show history’ option to view the cancelled entry</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>An estimate will not load and pend in the Client Income window under these circumstances</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Where the customer submits&#58;</strong></li>
			<ul>			<li>
more than 1 initial estimate for the same financial year on the same day</li>
			<li>
a subsequent estimate and after submits another on the same day for the same case or cases </li>
			<li>
an Income Tax Declaration (ITD) for the Last relevant year of income (LRYI) which pends to Cuba and on the same day they also submit an initial estimate</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>The system is unable to pend the estimate in Cuba</strong>. One of the following intrays then generates&#58;</li>
		<li>
<strong>CS Online Pending Initial Est</strong>, or</li>
		<li>
<strong>CS Online Pending Sub Est</strong></li>
		</ul>
<p>The estimate details are recorded in a notepad in the customer’s Communication window. Review the notepad. If appropriate&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
Record the estimate information in the Estimate Income window. <strong>Apply the correct date of notification</strong></li>
		<li>
Add the <strong>Communication</strong> window notepad to the estimate notepad </li>
		<li>
Pend the estimate. For help see&#58;</li>

			<li>
<a href="../separated-parents/277-30010330-01.html">Estimates Cuba Process Help</a></li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>There can be <strong>CS Online Pending Initial</strong> or <strong>Sub Est</strong> intrays as well as pended estimates in the Client Income window. </p>

<p><strong>Review estimate information</strong></p>

<p>Check the information provided by the customer to identify if there are any anomalies to clarify with the customer. For example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
$0 estimate with new employment recorded as the reason for estimate </li>
		<li>
the annualised ATIs for the YTD and estimate are considerably different but show the same employer </li>
		<li>
conflicting information supplied by the customer in the notepad compared to the amounts recorded</li>
		<li>
multiple estimates submitted </li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> check if the customer has an overseas address or OS Tax Income/OS Est Income recorded in the <strong>Client Income</strong> window. This may indicate an overseas estimate and the income amounts need to be converted to AUD. See the <a href="../separated-parents/277-07040020-05.html">Resources</a> page for a link to the international income converter.</p>

<p>Contact the customer if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the election is the first estimate for the financial year, or</li>
		<li>

<p>An income estimate is an election that a parent can make to have their assessment based on their expected Adjusted Taxable Income (ATI) for a year of income, or for part of a year of income.</p>

<p>Lodging an estimate may not be the most appropriate option when a customer's income has changed. </p>

<p>Discuss the customer’s circumstances to help them decide whether an estimate is an appropriate option.</p>

<p>Consider whether Post Separation Income may be an option rather than an estimate – Refer <a href="../separated-parents/277-07100000-03.html">Post separation income for Child Support parents</a>. To help with the discussion see <a href="../separated-parents/277-07040030-03.html">Conversation Guide – Table 1 Estimate Best Option</a> and <a href="../separated-parents/277-07040030-03.html">Conversation Guide – Table 3 Estimate process</a>.</p>

<p>Tell the customer that <strong>if they elect to estimate their income</strong>&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the assessment will be calculated on the income they tell Child Support they expect to earn between the start of the estimate and the end of the financial year. Payments (ongoing or lump sum) under the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), the National Redress Scheme or withdrawals under the First Home Super Saver Scheme are not considered as income for Child Support purposes </li>
		<li>
they need to notify Child Support of any changes to their income during the financial year</li>
		<li>
the estimate will be reconciled after the end of the financial year, which could result in a child support debt if the estimate is not accurate. If a debt is raised when the estimate is auto reconciled as a result of tax lodgement, their tax refund will be automatically intercepted and applied to the debt </li>
		</ul>
<p>If a customer's <strong>income varies</strong> during the financial year, lodging an estimate may result in a higher assessment than if an estimate was not lodged. <strong>Circumstances where an estimate may not be the most appropriate option</strong> include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Customers with contract or seasonal work who experience income fluctuations during the financial year. If they expect their taxable income to be similar to the ATI used in their assessment, lodging an estimate may not be appropriate</li>
		<li>
Customers who cease employment but expect to obtain new employment within a short period with income similar to, or more than, the relevant ATI</li>
		<li>
Customers expecting redundancy and who are yet to receive an employment termination payment (ETP), or customers who are expecting to receive a lump sum payment from another source. Explain the taxable component of the lump sum will be included in their estimated ATI if received during the estimate period and the consequences if this occurs. Ensure the customer understands they have the option of lodging the estimate after the lump sum is received</li>
		<li>
Customers whose child support case is due to end before the end of the financial year who would prefer to avoid potential retrospective changes (due to estimate reconciliation) after their case has ended</li>
		<li>
Customers who have lodged multiple estimates or previous estimates have been inaccurate. For more information, <a href="../separated-parents/277-07040020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Confirm_estimat_Step06">go to Step 6</a></li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> customers may advise that the income used in their assessment is wrong or has changed. However the ATI is not just based on taxable income. They may not understand the inclusion of other component amounts. For example, taxable income is $40,000 but ATI is $60,000 as it includes $20,000 for a Reported Fringe Benefits Total (RFBT). <a href="../separated-parents/277-07040020-04.html#bp04_L2GT_Policy">References</a> has a link to the Child Support Guide 2.4.4 Child support income for an explanation of ATI.</p>

<p>For an estimate to be complete the customer must provide&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
an indication of the case(s) the election will apply to. <br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> reverse accounts in Cuba do not represent separate cases. If the customer has a role of both payee and payer in 1 case, the estimate must be recorded for both roles in Cuba</li>
		<li>
the estimated ATI that is, the taxable income and other component amounts for the financial year, or the remainder of the financial year</li>
		<li>
the YTD ATI, except when the estimate is to commence at the start of a new financial year or it is a subsequent estimate in the financial year</li>
		<li>
the reason for lodging the estimate, which is an explanation of why their income has reduced or changed. Providing the reason for the estimate helps in determining the accuracy of the estimate. However, if a reason is not provided, and the estimate is valid and accurate in all other aspects, then the estimate cannot be refused</li>
		</ul>
<p>Some customers may elect to provide their ATI components as single amounts for example Taxable income $32,400pa plus reportable fringe benefits $8,700pa. The estimate cannot be refused if the customer does not or will not provide details such as the name of employer, frequency of income, etc. However, Service Officers must be satisfied with the accuracy of the YTD ATI and the estimated ATI before accepting the estimate.</p>

<p>The customer may not have all information required to make the estimate complete. For example, they do not have other component details. In this case tell the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
what information is required to finalise the estimate</li>
		<li>
the date the information is required within 14 days</li>
		<li>
if the information is not provided by the advised date&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the estimate will be rejected as it will be incomplete and the current assessment will continue</li>
			<li>
if they disagree with the decision they can lodge a new estimate when they have all the relevant information which will delay the start date</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>If the final decision to reject the estimate as incomplete has not been explained, contact the customer to explain the decision before rejecting the estimate. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-01010000-01.html">Contact with Child Support customers</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> there may be times when the customer cannot provide their YTD ATI information, for example, they are incarcerated and do not have the information. It may be appropriate to request the information from the employer by issuing a S161 notice.</p>

<p>If the estimate has been lodged in writing or via online contact the customer to clarify missing details before rejecting the estimate.</p>

<p>If the customer cannot be contacted by phone, send a Request for Client to Contact CSA (MX1-1) letter. Include the appropriate text so the customer understands what is required, see <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-30010400-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Create_a_CAL">Letters Cuba process help, Create a CAL</a>.</p>

<p>A customer cannot object to this decision. They will need to contact Child Support to lodge a new estimate. This estimate can only be taken from the date they make the new election.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> an estimate cannot be refused because the YTD ATI is considered too low. The estimate cannot be treated as incomplete or invalid if YTD ATI is provided.

<p>An estimate election will be valid if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
There is a current child support assessment (stage 2 case)</li>
		<li>
There is no Income Amount Order in force relating to the estimating parent on the day of the election or for any part of the remainder of the financial year for any children of the assessment. For example, if an agreement or order sets a periodic amount for 1 child but a younger child is assessed under the formula the customer would be unable to estimate their income for use in the formula for the younger child. An estimate election can be made the day after the Income Amount Order ceases to apply.

<p>To lodge an estimate, the current child support assessment must be based on&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a taxable income as assessed by the ATO (or an overseas authority where the customer is resident in a reciprocating jurisdiction or in the case of a receiving parent who is resident in a non-reciprocating jurisdiction where the claimed for child/ren of the case are still eligible, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-07040020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Estimates_for_i_Step03">Step 3 in Table 3</a>) or,</li>
		<li>
an ITD provided by the customer, that Child Support is satisfied is accurate</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; payments (ongoing or lump sum) under the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), the National Redress Scheme or withdrawals under the First Home Super Saver Scheme are not considered as income for Child Support. </p>

<p>If the assessment is not based on an ATO assessed income or an ITD, offer the customer the option to provide an ITD. For more information, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-07010000-01.html">Income processing for Child Support customers</a>.</p>

<p>For more information about the validity requirements of estimates, <a href="../separated-parents/277-07040020-04.html#bp04_L2GT_Policy">References</a> has a link to the Child Support Guide 2.5.1&#58; Income estimates for a year of income.</p>

<p>A customer can advise Child Support that their initial estimate is no longer accurate by making a subsequent estimate at any time during the financial year. A subsequent estimate can also be replaced at any time during the financial year with another subsequent estimate.</p>

<p>A subsequent estimate can be accepted after the year of income has ended if the estimate has not been reconciled and the new estimate election is more than the previous estimate election.</p>

<p>When taking a subsequent estimate, the following must be obtained and recorded&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
date of the election (notification date) when the customer advised Child Support of a change in their circumstances and made a subsequent estimate</li>
		<li>
date of event when the current estimate (initial or subsequent estimate) became inaccurate</li>
		</ul>
<p>Income details must be taken from the date of event. The start date (effective date) of a subsequent estimate is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Date of event if the subsequent income estimate is higher than the preceding estimate. The exception is when the subsequent estimate decreases the assessment, for example paying parent’s estimate changes their liability from a fixed annual rate (FAR) to an annual rate less than FAR. In this circumstance the date of the election will be used</li>
		<li>
Date of the election if the subsequent estimate is less than the preceding estimate. The exception is when the subsequent estimate increases the assessment, for example, a paying parent’s estimate changes their liability from a minimum annual rate to a FAR. In this circumstance the date of event will be used</li>
		</ul>
<p>In some cases, Cuba is applying the<strong> incorrect date of effect</strong> when applying an amended estimate of income. The errors have occurred where a customer has provided an update (a higher estimate figure) to an existing estimate of income. Cuba is incorrectly using the notification date, rather than the date of event.</p>

<p><strong>Check the case liability rates</strong> to ensure the <strong>correct start date</strong> is being applied.</p>

<p>If Cuba does not apply the correct start date, delete the amended estimate and re-key with the same information and dates. <strong>Do not</strong> alter the dates. If this correction is not done at the same time the amended estimate is taken, contact the customer to explain the correction and impact on their assessment.</p>

<p>Where there are several subsequent estimates loaded after the affected estimate, delete these entries to allow for deletion and re-keying of the affected amended estimate. Then re-key subsequent estimates using the original information. Check letters for both the estimating and non-estimating parent to ensure only relevant letters issue.</p>

<p>The customer may be disadvantaged if there was a delay between the date of event and the date of election, and the subsequent estimate is lower than the preceding estimate, and the income earned between the date of event and the date of the election is different to the regular income after the date of election. For example the customer received a lump sum payment after the event date but before the date of the election, but they will only receive fortnightly Centrelink or salary income after the election date.</p>

<p>Escalate these cases to a Specialised Assessments Program Support Manager before accepting the subsequent estimate.</p>

<p>If the calculations for the subsequent estimate show that the new income is lower, identify the income the customer estimates they will receive from the date of the election to the end of the financial year. This is the amount of the income estimate election.</p>

<p>If a subsequent estimate increases the assessed rate above the minimum rate, a 28 day 'grace period' will apply before the increased assessed rate will be applied. For more information <a href="../separated-parents/277-07040020-04.html#bp04_L2GT_Policy">References</a> has a link to the Child Support Guide 2.4.12&#58; The Minimum Annual Rate of Child Support.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> YTD ATI is not required for a subsequent estimate. If a customer becomes aware that the YTD ATI provided in their initial estimate is incorrect, they may elect another amount at any time until their estimate has been reconciled. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-07040020-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Update_the_Year">Table 8</a>.</p>

Use the <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-07040030-03.html">Conversation Guide – Table 4 Lump Sum</a> to tell the customer they have the option to carry the unused portion into their subsequent estimate.

<p>Lump sums are generally payments received on 1 single date, however this term can also include periodic amounts confined to a specific date set within the estimate period. For example a contract for $850 per week for the period 1 November 2018 - 31 March 2019.</p>

<p>The information belowpopulates relevant letters sent to the customer. </p>

<p>Payments (either ongoing or as a lump sum) received by customers under the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), the National Redress Scheme or withdrawals under the First Home Super Saver (FHSS) Scheme are not considered as income for Child Support purposes. If a customer includes these payments as an income source or it is found the customer is receiving these payments&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
document for information only</li>
		<li>
<strong>do not include</strong> in any income calculations</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>YTD amount</strong></p>

<p>The YTD amount is the customer’s ATI received from the start of the current financial year and the day before the estimate is lodged. </p>

<p>Record each type of income in this period. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> the YTD Calculator is only enabled for estimates after 01 July of a Financial Year.</p>

<p>See <a href="../separated-parents/277-07040020-05.html">Resources</a> for links to National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) and National Redress Scheme.</p>

<p><strong>Is the estimate to start on the first day of a new child support period?</strong> </p>

<p>The YTD information is from 1 July to the day before the estimate’s start date. </p>

<p>If the customer is unable to confirm their YTD at the time of the estimate election&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
record as much information as the customer is able to provide</li>
		<li>
ask the customer to call back within 14 days with the YTD income details </li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>An estimate&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>cannot</strong> be refused because the YTD is considered too low</li>
		<li>
<strong>can</strong> be refused if satisfied that the YTD ATI provided by the customer is more than the amount likely to be the total of the actual income component amounts for this period (that is the YTD is overstated)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Tell the customer the YTD ATI will be used when reconciling the estimate and must be accurate. If the customer becomes aware the YTD ATI provided in their initial estimate is incorrect, they may notify another amount at any time before the estimate is reconciled.</p>

<p>An example of when customers may inadvertently overstate the YTD is when they have received lump sum payments from their previous employer. There are 4 types of lump sum payments and customers often advise the total as their YTD whereas not all these amounts are included in a customer's ATI.</p>

<p>Lump sum payment D in the customer's payment summary is the tax-free component of a genuine redundancy payment or an early retirement scheme payment and is not taxable (and not included on a tax return) and does not form part of the ATI.</p>

<p>Lump sum B in the customer's payment summary is the amount paid for unused long service leave that accrued before 16 August 1978. Only 5% of this amount is included as assessable income on a tax return and forms part of the ATI. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-07040020-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Additional_info01">Table 5</a></p>

<p>If no YTD income is provided, do not accept the estimate as it is incomplete (outlined in <a href="../separated-parents/277-07040020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Confirm_estimat_Step07">Step 7 in Table 1</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Estimate Income&#58;</strong></p>

<p>This is the customer's estimated ATI for the financial year or the remainder of the financial year if the election is after 1 July. If the customer is unsure of their taxable income and/or other component amounts they should check information with the ATO, their accountant or other relevant sources. The Services Australia website publishes a guide with information about Centrelink payments and whether they are taxable or non-taxable. If the customer is unsure of whether their Centrelink or DVA payment is a specified tax-free pension or benefit, they should check with Centrelink or DVA to confirm whether it fits the definition. For more information, <a href="../separated-parents/277-07040020-04.html#bp04_L2GT_Policy">References</a> has a link to the Child Support Guide 2.4.4.10 Adjusted Taxable Income.</p>

<p>See <a href="../separated-parents/277-07010020-01.html">Derived income for Child Support customers</a> for more information about DVA income and <a href="../separated-parents/277-03030000-01.html">Direct requests for information from Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) (CS)</a> for information about the process for making, a request or to see a list of payment names included in the data exchange (only incomes that are included in a parent’s ATI are part of the data exchange, DVA payments which are not a component of ATI are not provided).If information needs to be requested about Centrelink income, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-04080010-01.html">Manual information request about a Centrelink customer record</a>.</p>

<p>An estimate can be refused if satisfied the customer's actual taxable income and other component amounts (that is their adjusted taxable income) for the estimate period is likely to be higher than the amount estimated (that is the estimated ATI is understated). See <a href="../separated-parents/277-07040020-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Additional_info01">Table 5</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Estimate and YTD Income calculators</strong></p>

<p>The Estimate and YTD Calculators record how the estimated ATI and the YTD ATI were determined. Document additional details in the <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/elements/macros/EstimateDocumentation.html">Estimate documentation</a> macro. See <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-07040030-03.html">Conversation Guide – Table 2 Estimate Calculator</a> and <a href="../separated-parents/277-01030000-01.html">Documenting Child Support information in Cuba</a>.</p>

<p>If the customer insists on providing their ATI components as single amounts, for example Taxable income $32,400pa plus reportable fringe benefits $8,700pa, a <strong>workaround</strong> will need to be applied. Explain to the customer, in order to record their estimate election the taxable income will be recorded as a weekly amount. Document that the income component was provided as a single amount and recorded as weekly to enable loading to the system. Document any calculations.</p>

<p>The Annual/Period Income details indicator can be changed at any time to reflect how a customer provides their income information. For example, a customer may provide their expected net rental income for the remaining estimate period and their reportable fringe benefits as an annual amount. Selecting '<strong>Period</strong>' for the net rental income and '<strong>Annual</strong>' for the reportable fringe benefits provides for accurate recording and calculation of the customer's information.</p>

<p><strong>85% rule</strong></p>

<p>The annualised amount of the first estimate election, must be 85% or less of the customer’s ATI for the LRYI. Cuba performs the 85% validity check against the LRYI used in the assessment.</p>

<p>Cuba will display a message after <strong>Calculate</strong> is selected. If the estimate is greater than 85% of the LRYI confirm with the customer that the amount provided is correct.</p>

<p>For example, customer’s case will end 15 November 2021, they lodge an estimate of income 01 October 2021. The customer has an increase to their income between the period where their case ends (15 November 2021) and then end of the financial year (30 June 2022).</p>

<p>Customer will be unable to lodge a subsequent estimate after 15 November to reflect their increased income. The estimate will still be reconciled based on the taxable income for the full 2021/2022 financial year (Actual ATI).

<p>The residency status of a customer will affect the income information Child Support is able to use in a child support assessment. The relevant income/taxation legislation of the reciprocating jurisdiction applies when calculating the ATI. Generally, the ATI is the customer's gross income less allowable deductions. For example, not all countries allow 'negative gearing' for property investments. Before determining a parent's ATI, check the Residency window to ensure the <a href="../separated-parents/277-08310000-01.html">residency of the customer has been considered</a>.</p>

<p>If the YTD ATI is zero or is 10% higher or lower than expected, confirm with the customer if the YTD ATI amount provided is correct and seek an explanation of the amount. See <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-07040030-03.html">Conversation Guide – Table 5 Year to Date</a>.</p>

<p>If residency issues have been identified, take the estimate and refer the customer for a residency decision. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-08310010-01.html">Residency Referrals for Child Support customers - Domestic Service Officer</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a residency decision determines the parent is a resident of Australia, target foreign income should be included in the estimate.

<p>If the customer is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction, convert the estimated income&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the assessment is based on an overseas taxable income (OST) and the parent resides in the reciprocating jurisdiction where the OST was earned, use the same average yearly exchange rate used for calculating the OST</li>
		<li>
If the assessment is based on an Australian taxable income and the parent now resides in a reciprocating jurisdiction, use the average yearly exchange rate for the last full financial year for the reciprocating jurisdiction</li>
		<li>
If the parent resides in a different reciprocating jurisdiction, use the average yearly exchange rate for the last full financial year for the reciprocating jurisdiction where the parent now resides</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the payee is resident of a non-reciprocating jurisdiction their income will be recorded as Target Foreign Income. Convert the income manually using the exchange rate available on July 1 of the relevant Australian financial year in which the money was earned or derived and round off to the nearest whole dollar. Send an email to International Disbursements to request the required exchange rate. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-07030000-01.html">Income processing for Child Support customers (International parents)</a>.</p>

<p>Ensure the foreign income amount is identified and converted directly from the currency in which the income was earned or derived. For example, if the customer is paid in US currency, but they live in England, the estimate and YTD amounts must be converted from US dollars, not English pounds.</p>

<p>Use the <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/elements/macros/InternationalIncomeConverter.html">International Income Converter</a> macro to help with the income conversion. If the currency required is not available, send an email to the International Disbursement team to request the required exchange rate.</p>

<p>If the customer is an Australian resident and they include target foreign income in their estimate and/or YTD amount&#58;</p>

<p>There may be situations that require a new estimate to be processed with a start date in the past.</p>

<p>For example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
if there is a document on Cuba that clearly shows a customer advised Child Support that their income had changed and requested to lodge an estimate but the Service Officer did not act on the request</li>
		<li>
the customer's circumstances meet the criteria that allows for deeming of an estimate start date. <a href="../separated-parents/277-07040020-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Deeming_Policie">Resources</a> has links to the deeming policies</li>
		<li>
other circumstances where Child Support has determined that an earlier estimate start date is appropriate, for example customers impacted by a natural disaster. Specific information would be communicated to staff outside Operational Blueprint if this is to be implemented</li>
		</ul>
<p>Cuba will allow an estimate election to be recorded with a retrospective start date.</p>

<p>For more information, see the <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-30010330-03.html#bp03010000_Record_an_estimate_o">Estimates Cuba Process Help, Record an estimate of income (post 1 July 2010 provisions)</a>.</p>

<p>Once an estimate is loaded with a retrospective start date that is not as a result of applying a deeming policy, forward the Pending Estimated Income intray to your aligned Service Support Officer for approval. This approval step is not required if loaded by SO5 level or above.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Service Support Officer approval is not required when applying a deeming policy. When using a deeming policy it is important to include appropriate documentation to support the decision.</p>

<p>When taking an estimate from a customer who is not in Australia, request documentary evidence to support the customer's claims. The decision to accept an estimate of this type without evidence must be made by a Service Support Officer.</p>

<p>Refuse an estimate if satisfied the customer's actual taxable income and other component amounts (that is their adjusted taxable income) for the estimate period is likely to be higher than the amount estimated. An estimate can also be refused if the YTD ATI is likely to be lower than the amount provided. A customer's poor estimate history alone is not reason to refuse an estimate.</p>

<p>Refuse an estimate where there&#58;</p>

are unclarified discrepancies</li>
		<li>
is a dispute over assessable income and allowable deductions</li>
		<li>
seems to be no change to the customer's ATI despite their claim the ATI has reduced</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the ability to refuse an estimate election is not limited to the circumstances above.</p>

<p><strong>Unclarified discrepancies</strong></p>

<p>The estimate may include inconsistent information which cannot be clarified by the customer or from available information such as evidence obtained or searches of the ATO system or Cuba. This may include where&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
there is an error in the calculation of the estimate which cannot be clarified</li>
		<li>
there is an error relating to the number of days in the remaining period, or</li>

<p><strong>Dispute over assessable income and allowable deductions</strong></p>

<p>It is not a Service Officer's role to determine which amounts are assessable or deductible for tax purposes. However, there may be occasions where an amount could not possibly be assessable or deductible in any circumstance, for example child support payments are not allowable deductions for tax purposes in Australia. If there is reason to believe that the actual ATI is likely to be higher than the estimated income, then the estimate election must be refused.</p>

<p><strong>No change to ATI</strong></p>

<p>If a customer cannot adequately substantiate their reason for making an election, and if satisfied that their actual income is likely to be higher than the estimate, refuse their estimate.</p>

<p>For example if a customer states they have lost their job but they are not receiving unemployment benefits, they should be asked why they are not receiving benefits. Ask the customer to explain how they plan to support themselves while unemployed. Ask the customer to supply their termination certificate or other evidence of the resources available to them. If there is doubt the customer has ceased employment check with the previous employer.</p>

<p>If satisfied that the actual income is likely to be more than the estimated income, then the estimate can be refused.</p>

<p>If the estimate is to be refused&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>

<p>If an estimate election is refused, it is taken to have never been made and the customer is able to lodge a new estimate at any time.

<p>A reverse case occurs when both parents are assessed to pay child support for a child. Cuba generates 2 linked cases with different case numbers to show each parent’s liability reflected in an assessment. The reverse cases could be active at the same time or for different periods of time.</p>

<p>Reverse cases are part of the same legal case. The incomes used for each parent need to match in all parts of the same legal case. <strong>All estimates</strong> for a parent in a financial year must be reflected in both reverse cases so that they <strong>exactly</strong> match. If not, the estimates will not reconcile correctly and may cause unfair outcomes for one or both parents.</p>

<p>Manual intervention may be required if the existing case and the reverse case have different child support periods or different incomes or both.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> check eligibility because non-estimate related errors or liability changes need to be resolved before starting any manual intervention process.</p>

Identify all the estimate entries not applied (or not applied to exactly match) in each of the reverse cases. This includes all <strong>Estimates, CLI Amended Estimates</strong> and <strong>CSA Amended Estimates</strong>.</li>
		<li>
For each entry&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
capture screen pictures of the <strong>Estimate Income - Production and Estimate Components Details - Production</strong> windows</li>
			<li>
take copies of the original notepad from each estimate and amended estimate. These can be added to the records applied on the reverse case, in addition to the Correcting Errors submission notepad</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Some estimates on a reverse case may not be missing but may have been recorded incorrectly (for example, with an incorrect start date or with incorrect income details). Incorrectly recorded estimates will need to be deleted before they are recorded correctly in accordance with these instructions&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
open a new estimate window to record the missing estimate/s. Ensure that the dates and amounts of each estimate/amended estimate on the reverse cases reflect the correct details and exactly match</li>
			<li>
even if a reverse case starts and/or ends on a different date, the estimate details, including the start date of the estimate, must still exactly match on each case. This will only be possible <strong>if</strong> the CSPs are aligned before recording the estimates.<br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> each time an estimate is recorded the CSPs must be realigned. This is because Cuba automatically saves eligibility and removes the CSPs added when each estimate is recorded.</li>
			<li>
add the Correcting errors submission notepad, and a copy of the notepad from the relevant estimate on the original case, to each added estimate entry. The copy of the original notepad can be preceded by a note stating&#58;<br>‘As per the Error correction submission notepad, this estimate is being keyed to align estimate records on reverse cases. The original notepad from the estimate is copied below'.</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Check the status of the newly added estimate entry&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
an estimate entry for dates after a reverse case ended will have a status of <strong>Recorded</strong>. This is correct as that estimate entry would not be directly used in the assessment for that case number. (However, that entry will still be used to ensure a correct reconciliation result for other estimates in that same financial year)</li>
			<li>
an estimate entry which applies to a period where the case was active, may also show as <strong>Recorded</strong>. Eligibility will need to be run and saved, as Cuba needs to apply these estimate entries to the assessment. After, eligibility is run, the estimate status should update correctly to <strong>Currently Used</strong></li>
			<li>
an estimate entry which was added to a reverse case with a start date before that case role commenced, will have a status of <strong>Currently Used</strong>. If a subsequent estimate is added that also has a start date before the case role commenced, the status of the preceding estimate will update to <strong>Revoked</strong>, and the subsequent estimate will have a status of <strong>Currently Used</strong></li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Are there more estimates to add?</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes,</strong> return <a href="../separated-parents/277-07040020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Aligning_revers_Step04">to Step 4</a></li>
