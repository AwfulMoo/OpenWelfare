<div class="showcont">


<p>Relationships must be reviewed/updated before starting to process a claim. These include both <strong>partner</strong> and <strong>child</strong> relationships.</p>

<p>Action required depends on the customer's circumstances, what they have advised on their claim, and what is already recorded.</p>

<p>If the customer/partner is receiving an income support payment, and advises they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
are separated, request a MOD S and place claim on hold for verification of separation, reason <strong>Referral - Families</strong></li>
		<li>
become partnered, request MOD P and place claim on hold, reason <strong>Referral - Families</strong></li>
		</ul>
<p>In some cases, the claim may need regenerating to allow changes to relationships. If the marital status does not display any edit or delete option, this means coding has already commenced within the claim. To make changes to the Marital Status (<strong>MS</strong>) table select <strong>Regenerate Claim</strong> to clear the claim updates. This will enable the edit or delete option to be displayed to allow any changes to relationship details.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when a claim is re-generated, any provisional data added after claim submission will be removed, and must be manually entered again. </p>
</div>

<div class="showcont">


<p>View/update details via the Transaction Summary (<strong>TS</strong>) screen in the Link Summary (<strong>LS</strong>) and Marital Status (<strong>MS</strong>) tables. In an online claim updates will automatically populate on the <strong>LS</strong> and <strong>MS</strong> tables. In a paper claim, these updates will need to be completed manually.</p>

<p>Relationship details only need updating if the tables contain different information to the information provided in the claim. Relationship data (including partner’s and children) should only be deleted or edited if recorded in error. If the relationship data is no longer applicable (e.g. the customer has become married), add a new line.</p>

<p>For instructions on how to action updates on the <strong>LS</strong> and <strong>MS </strong>tables, see <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-20012938-01.html">Process Direct navigation, common screens and functions</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> conduct a thorough search for the partner’s/child’s record. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07030010-01.html">Searching for a customer on the system</a>.</p>

<p>Multiple records increase the risk of payment errors, intertwining and potentially fraud. Multiple records may also impact the confidence people have in the quality and correctness of the information Services Australia holds.</p>

<p>If the child record is an incorrect environment <strong>and</strong> is in a different environment to the customer/partner, link the child before processing the claim. See <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-05050120-01.html">Linking a child to a customer's record</a>.</p>

If there is a requirement to obtain child support, a Maintenance Action Requirement letter will automatically issue to the customer if they are in the 13 week (91 day) <strong>DMA</strong> (deciding maintenance action) grace period when the FTB claim is granted. In most cases, a customer will be given an automatic DMA period of 13 weeks (91 days) for a child from the relevant date of event. A manual workaround may be required to simulate a DMA period for the customer</li>
		<li>
In Process Direct, go to <strong>MNGS</strong> screen. Select the relevant child using the drop down option, go to Maintenance Action Results (<strong>MNMA</strong>) table. On <strong>MNMA</strong> table, if the DMA period has not stimulated correctly, escalate the case to the National ICT Referral Officer (NIRO). See <a href="../separated-parents/277-51070000-01.html">Maintenance Action Test (MAT) for FTB customers</a></li>
		<li>
For shared care, Child Support will register 1 child support case instead of 2. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-51070080-01.html">MAT for customers with shared care</a></li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Update maintenance details</strong></p>

<p>Customer has indicated they have taken action to obtain child support. Update maintenance data using current procedures. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-51070000-01.html">MAT for FTB customers</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Spousal maintenance</strong></p>

<p>Customer has indicated they receive spousal maintenance. Follow current procedures for assessment and coding. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-51080020-01.html">FTB customer receives spousal maintenance</a>.</p>

<p>Go to <strong>MNGS</strong> screen. Check that all children are correctly grouped according to child support entitlement.</p>

<p>Before creating a new group, check if the child should be placed in an existing group. When adding a child, the preference is that the child is placed&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
In a group that child’s other parents name against it (option 1)</li>
		<li>
In a group with any full sibling (option 2) or</li>
		<li>
In a new group if the above options do not exist</li>
		</ul>
<p>Only 1 current relationship or non-biological group can be created. A separate entitled group must be created for each paying parent.</p>

Is the correct number of Flexible PPL days connected to the PPL period?</li>
			<li>
If the customer has claimed Flexible PPL days separately from their PPL period, are these being paid from the correct date/s?</li>
			<li>
If the PPL period start date falls on a weekend, the <strong>ELD</strong> screen may display the proceeding Monday's date, even though the system is correctly paying from the nominated start date. Check the <strong>XDS</strong> screen to verify that PPL is being paid from the correct date</li>
			<li>
Is the correct date on the Child In Customer Care (<strong>CHC</strong>) and Child in Primary Care (<strong>CIPC</strong>) screen? The child’s date of birth will default. This must be updated to the date the child entered care if this is different from the child’s date of birth.

<p><strong>PPL Residency</strong></p>

<p>A datalink with the Department of Home Affairs will, where possible, automatically populate residence details for customers from 1 September 1994 to date, as well as citizenship and movement information for the customer if it is available. For a Services Australia customer, the Department of Home Affairs will advise of any future changes to their visa subclass or if they, their partner or their child leaves or returns to Australia.</p>

<p>Service Officers should check the assessment and ensure the PPL period is only granted when the primary claimant has been residentially qualified for every day from the date of birth. For children that were born or adopted&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
before 1 July 2020, failure to meet this will result in full rejection of PPL</li>
		<li>
on or after 1 July 2020, failure to meet this may result in component rejection of the PPL period only. The customer may be eligible for Flexible PPL days if they were residentially qualified on the child’s date of birth or adoption but lost eligibility before their PPL period start date</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where the assessment result is incorrect, the details must be investigated through normal escalation process, for example, referral to National ICT Referral Officer (NIRO) or Service Support Officer (SSO).</p>

<p>If the customer meets eligibility requirements for PPL due to having an exemption for the Newly Arrived Residents Waiting Period (NARWP), the exemption will be applied for any Flexible PPL days that are connected to their PPL period. If they have claimed any Flexible PPL days separately, their residency status will be checked the day before the claimed dates. These customers are encouraged to connect all of their Flexible PPL days to their PPL period to ensure that any changes to their exemption do not adversely impact their eligibility for Flexible PPL days.</p>

<p><strong>PPL claim - Income for Financial Year ending 20XX - Error E704P1</strong></p>

customer has not provided PPL income details for the relevant financial year, or</li>
		<li>
information has failed to be loaded onto the customer record from the online claim</li>
		</ul>
<p>Income details need to be collected for the relevant financial year. This is the financial year before the date of claim or the actual date of birth (whichever is earlier). The claim cannot be assessed until the correct income year has been recorded.</p>

<p>Once received, <strong>if P1INC screen will not accept updates to the relevant financial year</strong>, the claim details will need to be re-entered via a SOA shell to input the correct financial year income details.</p>

<p><strong>PPL only claim lodged. Marital status update advised in claim - Error E340CU</strong></p>

<p>When processing a PPL only claim and linking or unlinking a partner, the <strong>AC </strong>screen may require coding. If the <strong>AC</strong> screen presents with error <strong>E340CU&#58;</strong> ACR details do not match the customer's relationship status, the following workaround is to be applied.</p>

<p><strong>Current on payment when marital status changed</strong></p>

<p>If the customer or partner were receiving income support payment or FTB on the date the marital status changed, action the marital status and AC coding using the relevant income support payment or FTB coding rules.</p>

<p>To action the change, contact the customer to confirm the details that applied on the date of the marital status change. E.g. accommodation details, partner FTB income estimate.</p>

<p>Generally PPL claims must be lodged within 12 months of the child’s date of birth or adoption. Investigate whether exceptional circumstances apply. See <a href="../families/007-07030170-01.html">Exception processing of Paid Parental Leave scheme claims</a>.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
Any older child/ren already linked to the PPL/FTB record are not linked to the DAP claim, as this will cause the DAP claim to reject incorrectly with reason PTL (child's date of birth/entry into care is before 1 January 2013)</li>
		<li>
Only the relevant child assessed for DAP is linked to <strong>the DAP/PND-POB</strong> claim</li>
		<li>
The Entitlements (<strong>ELD</strong>) screen is correct before finalising the PPL/FTB claim. Note&#58; ensure that an exhaustive search has been done to find any existing child record. This will minimise the risk of creating multiple records. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07030010-01.html">Searching for a customer on the system</a> for further details</li>
		<li>
The partner's DAP claim outcome is checked and it is not rejecting incorrectly. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> the Child in Customer Care (<strong>CHC</strong>) screen for a DAP only customer should not be updated</li>

<p>Customers who meet the PPL Extended Work Test can nominate a start date in the past, even when their claim and proof of birth is lodged more than 28 days after the child’s birth/entry into care. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> Customers cannot receive PPL and JobKeeper payment for the same period. See <a href="../families/007-07030020-01.html">Assessing Parental Leave Pay (PPL) claims</a> for more information about assessing a claim for PPL for customer’s receiving JobKeeper Payment.</p>

<p>If the customer and/or their partner are receiving an income support payment (ISP) or Family Tax Benefit (FTB) during the backdated PPL period, an outbound contact must be made to discuss the potential overpayments their PPL will have on their ISP and FTB payment/s. Where appropriate the customer may change their nominated start date to another date in the future to prevent being overpaid.</p>

<p>The overpayment will be automatically calculated on the <strong>ELD</strong> screen.</p>

<p>The debt shell created will also need to be actioned in <strong>Customer First</strong> as part of this process. See <a href="../debts/107-18040300-01.html">Raising ISP debts for customers granted PPL and DAP</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when a customer nominates a PPL period start date in the past the PPL exemption (<strong>P1EX</strong>) screen will display ‘Backdating the start date'. This field is an automatic code, entered by the system. It is protected and staff cannot manually change this exemption code.</p>

<p>The <strong>Prescribed Payment indicator</strong> field on the PPL Work Test History (<strong>P1WH</strong>) screen will be set to <strong>Yes</strong> if the customer has received the COVID 19 Disaster Payment in their 10 month qualifying period. This indicator can be changed to <strong>No</strong> or vice versa if required. This can only be updated during the new claim process or while the payment status is <strong>ASS</strong>essed.</p>

<p>Where a customer has received COVID-19 Disaster Payment and has requested their PPL start date to be backdated, the Paid Parental Leave Exemption (<strong>P1EX</strong>) screen will display ‘Backdating the start date’. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> the ‘Backdating the start date’ code will only appear after the claim has been finalised.</p>

<p>Customers cannot receive PPL and COVID-19 Disaster Payment for the same period.</p>

<p>Make outbound contact if, during the backdated PPL period, the customer and/or their partner received an income support payment (ISP) or Family Tax Benefit (FTB), including Newborn Upfront Payment/Newborn Supplement (NBU/NBS). Discuss the potential overpayments that backdating their PPL start date will have on their ISP and FTB payment/s.

<p>PPL arrears can be automatically offset against a PPL or ISP overpayment if the PPL arrears and overpayment occur in the same activity. This is done to reduce the overpayment amount.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> ISP overpayments are only offset if the overpayment is due to getting PPL for the same period.</p>

<p>The overpayment and arrears are automatically calculated on the Entitlements (<strong>ELD</strong>) screen and offset against the PPL arrears. If an offset has occurred&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the <strong>Adj Ind&#58;</strong> displays 'Y' on the PPL and ISP lines</li>

<p>The Daily Rate Component (<strong>RAC</strong>) screen can be used to view details the overpayment and arrears amounts used in the offset. <strong>Man Adj Reason</strong> of 'OFS' displays for relevant period/s.</p>

<p>From 4 June 2021, the standard withholding rate for PPL is 100%. The withholding amount can be viewed on the Payment Summary (<strong>PS</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>PPL and DAP is treated as income for calculating the rate of payment for ISPs.</p>

<p>This will result in customers (and/or their partners)&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
receiving a reduced rate of income support payment when they are getting PPL/DAP</li>

entering a 6 fortnight nil rate period (only applicable where the customer/partner also has other income), or</li>
		<li>
losing their entitlement to their income support payment and any associated concession cards (that is cancellation of income support payment)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> no additional coding is required by staff for PPL and DAP payments to affect the customers rate of ISP. They will automatically be treated as ordinary income.</p>

<p>If PPL/DAP is granted from a past date, this may cause an ISP overpayment. Before finalising the claim attempt to make 1 outbound contact to affected customers to discuss potential payment impacts claiming PPL/DAP will have on their income support payment. If appropriate the customer may change their nominated start date to another date in the future to prevent being overpaid their income support payment. See <a href="../families/007-05040030-01.html">Change of circumstances for Dad and Partner Pay (DAP)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>If an overpayment is incurred&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
it will be automatically calculated on the <strong>ELD</strong> screen. PPL arrears and ISP overpayments will automatically offset to reduce the overpayment amount before a debt shell is created.

<p>Customers and/or their partners whose income support payment has cancelled due to PPL/DAP income may be able to have their payment resumed, if they have regained entitlement to an income support payment at the end of the PPL or DAP period.</p>

<p>To follow up customer's income support payment entitlement at the end of the PPL or DAP period, staff processing <strong>post birth</strong> PPL or DAP claims need to create a review <strong>DOC</strong> on the customer's (and/or their partner's) record in <strong>Customer First</strong> using the <strong>Fast Note</strong> template <strong>Families</strong> &gt; <strong>Claims</strong> &gt; <strong>PPL/DAP income and income support payment</strong>, in cases where&#58;</p>

		<li>
the customer (and/or their partner) have entered a 6 fortnight nil rate period, or</li>
		<li>
the PPL or DAP nominated start date is in the future</li>
		</ul>
<p>Add the appropriate keyword based on PPL or DAP and the payment type as per the keyword information provided on the <a href="../families/007-17100603-05.html">Resources</a> page.</p>

<p>View scanned documents via <strong>Document Tools</strong> in the <strong>Quick Links</strong> tab.</p>

<p><strong>Verbal claims</strong> for family assistance payments should only be completed when a customer is deemed unable or unsuitable to complete an online claim, when <a href="../families/007-01030110-01.html">helping eligible remote Indigenous customers</a> or when <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-06010020-01.html">helping customers in crisis or financial hardship</a>. For verbal claims, the customer must agree to the privacy agreement before starting the claim. Before the ACC can be submitted the customer must meet <a href="../families/007-01010100-05.html">signature requirements</a> by either accepting the Verbal Signature Declaration or returning a signed Families Declaration Form (FDF). See <a target="_blank" href="../self-service/133-03010070-03.html">Review and submitting the claim ACC table in Online and Assisted Customer Claims (ACC) for Family Assistance, Parental Leave Pay (PPL) and Dad and Partner Pay (DAP)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Families in Crisis or Remote Indigenous customers</strong></p>

<p>Families in crisis who are experiencing difficulty in understanding or complying with claim requirements, or that require a speedy outcome to meet immediate financial needs, or remote Indigenous customers who have language or literacy barriers affecting their capacity to use forms or online claims, may also be eligible to submit a Verbal Signature Declaration.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> from 10 June 2019, Family Tax Benefit (FTB) top-ups, supplements, lump sum claim amounts and instalment arrears can be used to recover any family assistance, social security, student assistance and Paid Parental Leave scheme payment debts. This will occur even if the customer has a current payment arrangement. Previously, FTB amounts could only be used to recover FTB, Child Care Benefit (CCB) and Child Care Rebate (CCR) debts.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> claims must always be coded and processed using the correct date of receipt. This date can sometimes differ from the 'capture date' used to confirm the date of a claim which has been scanned. Staff can confirm the correct date in <strong>Document Tools</strong> in Customer First. This screen displays both the 'date of receipt' and the 'capture date'.</p>

<p>Update all relevant question sets with information provided by the customer. If all information is not available, an attempt to obtain the missing information verbally or a Q777 must be issued, see <a href="../families/007-17100602-01.html">Pre-processing checks for standalone and combined claims for family assistance and/or Paid Parental Leave payments</a>. The ACC workflow can be saved and continued at a later time.</p>

<p>If a serial number has been provided with the Newborn Child Declaration (FA081) or Claim for Bereavement Payment (FA008), this <strong>must</strong> be entered within the ACC. If an error is encountered when entering the serial number, see the 'Online Claim Data Load Errors and Messaging' attachment on the <a href="../families/007-17100603-05.html">Resources</a> page for information including what action to take.</p>

Select <strong>Process</strong> <strong>claim</strong> to continue. For verbal claims, the <a href="../self-service/133-03010070-03.html">verbal signature declaration</a> must be read and accepted or the FDF must be printed and signed before the declaration tick box is selected and claim submitted. By ticking the Declaration box on the <strong>Review your claim</strong> page, the Service Officer is confirming that the declaration script has been read to and accepted by the customer.</p>

<p>If the verbal signature declaration has not been accepted and the FDF is not printed before the claim is submitted a signature block will not appear and the claim cannot be assessed without the claimant's signature. A new verbal claim will need to be completed for the FDF to be generated.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the adopted child was not previously known to the customer or linked on the customer's record, create a new child record/Customer Reference Number (CRN), even if a CRN already exists, and link the new record to the adoptive parent. This protects the privacy of the adoptive parent, birth parent and the child. However, follow up action to avoid multiple records will still need to be taken on the previous child record.</p>

<p>If a new child record is created, no information about the adoptive parent or child (including CRNs) is to be noted on the birth parent/previous carer's record. The only information that should be available is the birth/payment information retained via previous child CRN and notes to advise that the child has been subsequently adopted.</p>

<p>Prior to assessing the CCS claim, check Customer First for lodgement of other Family Assistance claims.</p>

<p>CCS claims and Families legacy claims are to be processed in the order of submission by the customer. The exception is where there is a CCS claim and a Families legacy claim (e.g. Family Tax Benefit (FTB)) on the record with the same submission dates. In these cases, the Families legacy claim is to be processed first.</p>

<p>Where a Virtual Service Reason (VSR) activity for the CCS claim is present on Activity List (<strong>AL</strong>) in Customer First and is preventing the completion or assessment of the Families legacy claim, the VSR activity can be cancelled from <strong>AL</strong>. No action is required to regenerate this activity as it will be automatically recreated by Process Direct when the CCS Claim is assessed.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> certain <strong>income test determinations</strong> cannot be changed on review.

<p>As a consequence, a <strong>debt</strong> would generally not be raised following updates to the PPL income details. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> an exception would be if the income determination resulted from the person knowingly making false or misleading representations or providing false or misleading information or documents, the person is taken not to have satisfied the income test. Such debts are recoverable and will be investigated.</p>

<p>A separate claim <strong>may</strong> be required to assess entitlement for each financial year.</p>

<p>A Centrelink Lump Sum (CLK LSC) will be automatically created to assess the customer's entitlement for the previous year if it is identified that <strong>potential</strong> eligibility exists for a previous financial year.</p>

<p>If a pre-birth claim has been lodged and the child was born/adopted in the previous financial year but the proof of birth/adoption and extra details are lodged in the following financial year, provided this is within 28 days of the child's expected date of birth/entry into care, the FTB claim is to be assessed from the birth/care date. <strong>Do not</strong> make the CLK LSC (FTB/ASS-AIU activity) not effective. A lump sum claim is not required in this circumstance. The <a href="../families/007-17100603-05.html">Resources</a> page contains an example.</p>

<p>Check if the customer's FTB may be restored. See <a href="../families/007-07090030-01.html">Restoration of Family Tax Benefit (FTB)</a>.</p>

<p>Otherwise, if FTB is assessing for a previous year not claimed, FTB for the  previous year must be made not effective by coding the FTB Status Override (<strong>FYSO</strong>) screen&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
code the <strong>Start Date</strong> and <strong>End Date</strong> fields with the dates of the previous financial year (for example, 1 July XX - 30 June XX)</li>

<p>If the customer meets eligibility requirements for PPL due to having an exemption for the Newly Arrived Residents Waiting Period (NARWP), the exemption will be applied for any Flexible PPL days that are connected to their PPL period. If they have claimed any Flexible PPL days separately, their residency status will be checked the day before the claimed dates.

<p>PPL and DAP is treated as income for calculating the rate of payment for ISPs.</p>

<p>This will result in customers (and/or their partners)&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
receiving a reduced rate of income support payment when they are getting PPL/DAP</li>
		<li>
entering a 6 fortnight  nil rate period (only applicable where the customer/partner also has other income), or</li>
		<li>
losing their entitlement to their income support payment and any associated concession cards (that is cancellation of income support payment)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> no additional coding is required by staff for PPL and DAP payments to affect the customers rate of ISP. They will automatically be treated as ordinary income.</p>

<p>If PPL/DAP is granted from a past date, this may cause an ISP overpayment. Before finalising the claim attempt to make <strong>1</strong> outbound contact to affected customers to discuss potential payment impacts claiming PPL/DAP will have on their income support payment. If appropriate the customer may change their nominated start date to another date in the future to prevent being overpaid their income support payment.</p>

<p>If an overpayment is incurred&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
it will be automatically calculated on the <strong>AR</strong> screen. PPL arrears and ISP overpayments will automatically offset to reduce the overpayment amount before a debt shell is created</li>
		</ul>
<p>the debt shell created will also need to be actioned as part of this process. See <a href="../debts/107-18040300-01.html">Raising ISP debts for customers granted PPL and DAP</a></p>

<p>Customers and/or their partners whose income support payment has cancelled due to PPL/DAP income may be able to have their payment resumed, if they have regained entitlement to an income support payment at the end of the PPL or DAP period.</p>

<p>To follow up customer's income support payment entitlement at the end of the PPL or DAP period, staff processing <strong>post birth</strong> PPL or DAP claims need to create a review <strong>DOC</strong> on the customer's (and/or their partner's) record using the <strong>Fast Note</strong> template <strong>Families&gt;Claims&gt;PPL/DAP</strong> <strong>income and income support payment</strong>, in cases where&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer's (and/or their partner's) income support payment has cancelled due to PPL or DAP income</li>
		<li>
the customer (and/or their partner) have entered a 6 fortnight nil rate period, or</li>
		<li>
the PPL or DAP nominated start date is in the future</li>
		</ul>
<p>Add the appropriate keyword based on PPL or DAP and the payment type as per the keyword information provided on the <a href="../families/007-17100603-05.html">Resources</a> page.</p>

<p>Select <strong>DOC</strong> on <strong>AL</strong> screen and enter the PPL or DAP end date + 1 in the <strong>Resubmit date</strong> field to put the started <strong>DOC</strong> activity on hold until the end of the PPL or DAP period.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Farm Household Allowance (FHA) customers may still be entitled to receive a part rate of FHA during their PPL/DAP entitlement periods, regardless of the rate paid. These days are included in the cumulative 1460 days a customer may receive FHA. Depending on their circumstances, a customer may choose to preserve their entitlement to FHA and cancel FHA. Effected customers can discuss their circumstances with their Farm Household Case Officer (FHCO) or call the Farmer Assistance Hotline. If a customer asks for FHA to be cancelled, advise they will have to submit a new claim if they would like to receive payments in the future.

<p>If the customer indicated they did not meet the work test due to family and domestic violence, the Service Officer must&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
check for evidence of employment and then </li>
		<li>
refer the claim to a social worker</li>
		</ul>
<p>The social worker will assess whether the family and domestic violence affected the customer’s ability to work during their work test period. The social worker may contact the customer to discuss the circumstances over the phone. If there is enough evidence already on the customer’s record, the social worker may complete a file assessment. </p>

<p>Once the social worker has completed their assessment, they will&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
annotate the social worker referral <strong>DOC</strong> with the outcome, and </li>
		<li>
take the claim off hold to be reallocated to a Service Officer for processing</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> due to privacy and safety concerns, do not use the term ‘family and domestic violence’ on the customer’s record. Instead, use the phrase <strong>s 24B(2)(a) of the Paid Parental Leave Rules 2021</strong>. For example, the social worker assessment will advise that the customer meets/does not meet the requirement per s 24B(2)(a) of the Paid Parental Leave Rules 2021. Fast notes for grant/reject/NEF claims must also refer to this section and not ‘family and domestic violence’.</p>

<p>The Service Officer will then receive the claim and complete their assessment, with regard to the social worker assessment and evidence of employment. </p>

<p>When the Service Officer has made a determination, this needs to be update it within the <strong>PPL Work Test</strong> guided procedure. The Service Officer will also need to confirm that the social worker assessment has been completed by selecting ‘<strong>Yes</strong>’ for the ‘SWO Assessed’ question. The claim outcome fast note must not refer to family and domestic violence. Select the <strong>‘meets requirement per s 24B(2)(a) of the Paid Parental Leave Rules 2021</strong>’ option.</p>

<p>In many cases, relevant claims will be not-effective automatically when finalised on the <strong>AR</strong> screen, based on information coded/not coded.</p>

<p>PPL can only be paid for 1 child from a multiple birth. Where the customer has already received PPL for 1 of the children from the multiple birth the PPL claim for the subsequent child in most cases should be rejected.</p>

<p>When linking the child on the Manage Dependant child workflow, only select one of the children from the multiple birth to be linked to the PPL pre-claim. If more than one child is selected, an error will present when attempting to finalise the claim.</p>

<p>However, in the rare event there is a significant delay between the births of the children it may be possible for PPL to be paid for more than 1 child. These cases must be referred to level 2 Policy Helpdesk with all additional evidence for investigation.</p>

<p><strong>Debt offsetting - FTB</strong></p>

<p>From 10 June 2019, FTB top-ups, supplements, lump sum claim amounts and instalment arrears can be <a href="../families/007-11060000-01.html">used to recover</a> any family assistance, social security, student assistance and Paid Parental Leave scheme payment debts. This will occur even if the customer has a current payment arrangement. Previously, FTB amounts could only be used to recover FTB, Child Care Benefit (CCB) and Child Care Rebate (CCR) debts.</p>

<p><strong>Debt offsetting - PPL</strong></p>

<p>PPL arrears can be used to <a href="../debts/107-04070010-01.html">recover</a> determined or due PPL debts, and offset PPL or ISP overpayments that were generated in the same activity. These amounts will be offset against each other so the payment does not issue and subsequently raise a debt on the same day.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> PPL offsetting applies only to payments of PPL or overpayments of an income support payment (ISP) that result from the customer getting PPL for the same past period. This is because PPL is treated as ordinary income for calculating the rate of ISP.</p>

<p>PPL arrears offsetting will occur even if the customer has a current payment arrangement. Any residual amount will then be paid to the customer. See <a href="../debts/107-04070010-01.html">Parental Leave Pay debt raising, debt offsetting and recovery</a>.</p>
