liquid assets, and</li>

		<div class="block">

<p>The income assessed for a non-customer care receiver is based on their personal circumstances (for example, single or partnered, living with a parent/guardian, etc.), and their income in the appropriate tax year as set out in the SSA. It does <strong>not</strong> include any non-taxable income.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58; </strong>Paid Parental Leave (PPL) is not exempt income for the CRIA test, as it is taxable income.</p>

<p>National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) funds, whether received periodically or as a lump sum (including interest accrued), which are deposited into an account specifically for the purpose of managing the customer's NDIS plan, are exempt from the income and assets tests and deeming. They do not need to be reported but if they are should not be considered in the income and asset assessment.</p>

<p>Once income qualification is established, the non-customer care receiver assets test is applied.</p>

<p>There are different types of Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) payments and different processes to follow when customers advise they <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-03050010-01.html">receive DVA income</a>.</p>

<p>For care receivers income thresholds and asset limits see the <strong>Carer Payment (CP) - Care Receiver Income and Asset Limits</strong> link on the <a href="../utils/RatesChart/rateschart.html?carer%20payment">Rates and Thresholds</a> page.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Adult_care_rece">Adult care receivers</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>If the adult care receiver is receiving a social security pension or benefit, or income tested payment from DVA, they are exempt from the CRIA test. However, DVA Disability Pension and War Widow(er)'s Pension (WWP) are non-income tested. Care receivers receiving either of these payments should be tested under the non-customer CRIA test. If a care receiver is receiving WWP or WID <strong>in addition</strong> to a DVA Income Support Supplement (ISS), they are <strong>not</strong> subject to the non-customer CRIA test.</p>

<p>An adult care receiver can qualify their carer for CP, if the <strong>only</strong> reason they are not being paid a social security pension, or income tested payment from DVA is because they have not been an Australian resident for a long enough period. This means they have met all other requirements such as incapacity for Disability Support Pension (DSP) and passed the income and assets tests applicable to each type of payment.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
ABSTUDY is <strong>not</strong> defined as a social security pension or benefit, therefore a care receiver receiving ABSTUDY does <strong>not</strong> exempt the carer from the non-customer CRIA test</li>
		<li>
Only social security pension and income tested payments from DVA can qualify under the residence criteria. This means a qualification for JobSeeker Payment (JSP), Youth Allowance (YA) or Special Benefit (SpB) will not meet the requirements of the Social Security Act, section 198(7) of the legislation</li>

<p>If a non-customer care receiver's assets are over the minimum care receiver assets test limit, they may be exempt from the test depending on the value of their assets, liquid assets and the income amount that will be used in calculating the income limit.</p>

<p>Liquid assets limits are $6,000 for single people and $10,000 combined for partnered people. For care receiver assets test limits see the <strong>Carer Payment (CP) - Care Receiver Income and Asset Limits</strong> link on the <a target="_blank" href="../utils/RatesChart/rateschart.html?carer%20payment">Rates and Thresholds</a> page.</p>

<p>A decision may be made to exempt a non-customer care receiver from the non-customer care receiver assets test where all the following conditions are met&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a request has been made by the carer (for an adult care receiver) or the carer/parent (for a child care receiver or 2 or more child care receivers)</li>
		<li>
the request is that the assets test not be applied</li>
		<li>
the request provides a written estimate of the appropriate taxable incomes for the current tax year</li>
		<li>
the estimate is accepted as being reasonable</li>
		</ul>
<p>The effect of these exemption provisions is that some people with assets above the care receiver assets test threshold will be considered to meet the assets test if their liquid assets and current income are below the exemption thresholds.</p>

<p>They still need to meet the care receivers' income threshold. The Process page identifies the persons whose assets and income are to be included in the relevant tests. For care receiver income thresholds and asset limits see the <strong>Carer Payment (CP) - Care Receiver Income and Asset Limits</strong> link on the <a target="_blank" href="../utils/RatesChart/rateschart.html?carer%20payment">Rates and Thresholds</a> page.</p>

<p>National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) funds, which are deposited into an account used to manage the customer's NDIS plan, are exempt from the income and assets tests and deeming. This includes funds received periodically or as a lump sum, including interest accrued. These funds are not required to be reported or if reported should not be taken into account in the income and assets assessment.</p>

<p>Assets that are obtained to assist the care receiver in respect of their disability (for example, motorised scooters) are exempt from the assets test. Where there have been modifications made to a car, the value of the modifications are exempt however, the value of the car that does not relate to the modifications is assessable. Service Officers need to verify the value of the modifications and subtract this amount from the final value of the motor vehicle. However, if the car is exclusively designed for use by a disabled person, for example special wheelchair access, special driving controls, other design features, then the whole value of the car would be exempted.</p>

<p>Where a customer, their partner or dependent child is disabled and there is an increase in the value of assets as a result of purchase or modifications (that is, to a car or home) to accommodate disabilities, these assets are disregarded when assessing the total value of the asset.</p>
