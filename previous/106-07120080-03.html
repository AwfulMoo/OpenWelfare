<p>Section 24 assessments for customers not in a multiple relationship can only be conducted once the customer is linked to their partner on the Marital Status (<strong>MS</strong>) and Link Partner (<strong>LP</strong>) screens. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> a formal MoC assessment <strong>is not</strong> required if the customer is not linked to their partner.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> where there are Family and Domestic Violence (FDV) issues identified, it may be appropriate not to establish the initial partner link depending on the individual customer circumstances. Engagement with a Social Worker may be appropriate to discuss the customer’s situation to determine if they should be linked or not.</p>

<p>It may also be appropriate at this time to request/gather information for a retrospective period (that is, where a customer in receipt of single rate of payment fails to notify the agency that they were partnered).

<p>Consider the customer’s circumstances. As part of the assessment, consider the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Is there a special reason to be considered in the couple’s circumstances?</li>
		<li>
Is there a lack of being able to pool resources for the couple as a result of the circumstances?</li>
		<li>
Is there financial difficulty as a result of the couple’s circumstances?</li>
		</ul>
<p>In <strong>all</strong> cases there must be unusual, uncommon, abnormal or exceptional circumstances. For customers in a multiple relationship, consideration needs to be given to any unfairness or absurdities that would be considered to present 'special circumstances'. Examples of some Section 24 cases are included on the <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07120080-05.html">Resources</a> page.</p>

<p>The system will not allow a customer to be linked to more than 1 partner. The customer will therefore be coded as single on the system but will need to be paid a <strong>manual partnered rate</strong>. Their rate of payment must be coded manually to the equivalent of the <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-08180000-01.html">partnered rate</a>.</p>

<p>If the customer is in receipt of PPS and qualifies for Parenting Payment Partnered (PPP), they will be paid PPS at the manual partnered rate. It is important to calculate the <strong>manual</strong> partnered rate by applying the PPP income test, not the PPS income test.</p>

If there is a later breakdown in the relationship, normal maintenance action is required</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Excess income of the central partner will affect the rate of all additional partners' payments, so the calculation of the manual rate must be done as if the customer was actually partnered on the system using the relevant partnered income and assets tests</li>
		<li>
Excess income of the multiple partners will affect the rate of the central partner. If more than 1 partner has income and/or assets which would affect the central partner's rate, calculate the central partner's rate separately using each of the multiple partner's income and/or assets. The lowest rate payable to the central partner is the one applied. This must be done manually if the central partner is not linked to the partner whose income and/or assets have been used to determine the rate of payment</li>

Family assistance reconciliation - Manual intervention into family assistance reconciliation will need to be undertaken for the manual rate paid to additional partners (only) in multiple relationship cases.

<p>The decision maker has determined that the customer can be treated as single under Section 24.</p>

<p>The customer is considered as single under Section 24 and is to be paid at the single rate. The customer may already be recorded as 'single' on the <strong>MS</strong> screen however the <strong>MS</strong> screen must be updated following the Section 24 decision and the Section 24 (S24) relationship qualifier code recorded. This update is only required on the customer's record due to the fact that the customer's partner has been considered to be in a member of a couple relationship and is therefore already linked to another person. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07120080-05.html">Resources</a> for an example.</p>
