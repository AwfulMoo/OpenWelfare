<p>CA is a payment that recognises the impact of a care receiver's disability on the family. The greater the level of disability, the greater the impact. CA provides financial assistance to the carer in respect of a care receiver aged 16 years or over with a severe level of disability. CA acknowledges the impact of significant levels of disability on the family in social, occupational, emotional and financial terms.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>CA (16 years or over) is assessed under the <a href="../carers/009-05020000-01.html">Adult Disability Assessment Tool (ADAT)</a>. The ADAT measures the functional ability and care needs of the care receiver.</p>

<p>The section 954A Social Security Act 1991 qualification provisions are outlined in <a href="../carers/009-03020040-01.html">Eligibility for Carer Allowance (CA) when caring for a disabled adult in a private home not shared by the adult and carer</a>.</p>

<p>A person is qualified for CA for an adult with a disability, if the <strong>care receiver</strong>&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
is an Australian resident, and</li>
		<li>
is a family member of the person or is a person approved in writing by the Secretary - see the <a href="../carers/009-03020030-04.html">References</a> page, and</li>
		<li>
has been assessed and rated under the ADAT, with a total score of at least 30, and a Treating Health Professional (THP) score of at least 12, and</li>
		<li>
has a functional impairment (a physical, intellectual or psychiatric disability) sufficient to necessitate the provision of care, and is either&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
in the terminal phase of a terminal illness certified by a medical practitioner, and is expected to live for less than 3 months. Their carer will generally qualify for CA (16 years or over) without further investigation subject to meeting the other qualification criteria, <strong>or</strong></li>
			<li>
is likely to suffer from the disability permanently or for an extended period (that is, care is required for 12 months or longer), <strong>and</strong></li>		</ul>
		<li>
receives care on a daily basis from the carer in a private home that is the residence of the carer and the care receiver. If the home is not shared by the carer and care receiver, but is still a private residence, the carer may still qualify for payment under section 954A of the Social Security Act 1991. See <a href="../carers/009-03020040-01.html">Eligibility for Carer Allowance (CA) when caring for a disabled adult in a private home not shared by the adult and carer</a>. A link to the Guide definition of 'daily basis' in connection with CA (including examples) can be found in the <a href="../carers/009-03020030-04.html">References</a> page section, under the heading Carer Allowance (CA) definitions</li>
		<li>
has confirmed their identity. See <a target="_blank" href="../initial-contact-general/106-09010000-01.html">Identity Confirmation</a> for more information</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; the <strong>carer</strong> must also be an Australian resident and have confirmed their identity.</p>

<p>There are no legislative age limits applicable to carers, claims from carers of any age can be accepted, including carers under the age of 16 years.</p>

<p>A care receiver aged 16 or over may be eligible for an income support payment. If the care receiver wants to claim an income support payment this must be done separately, the care receiver is required to lodge a claim with all the required supporting documents.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a carer is qualified for CA (caring for a disabled adult), that disabled adult cannot then qualify to receive CA for caring for another disabled adult. However, an adult care receiver may also qualify to receive CA (child) for a dependent child or children with disabilities in their care. Where service officers may have concerns regarding the carer's capability to care for someone else, a referral to social work may be appropriate.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A check for basic qualification (e.g. residence, income and assets) is to be completed before the referral to a Social Worker to ensure unnecessary referrals are not made. Once basic qualification can be established, all carers under 18 years of age <strong>must</strong> be referred to a Centrelink social worker <strong>before</strong> the claim is finalised. Carers over the age of 80 years of age are to be referred to a Centrelink social worker <strong>after</strong> the claim has been finalised. The referral is to ensure the carer has the physical and emotional capacity to provide the level of care required and to be given information and assistance in accessing support services.</p>

<p>While there are no legislative age limits applicable to carers, claims from carers <strong>under 18 years of age</strong>, or <strong>80 years of age or older</strong>, require a mandatory referral to a social worker.</p>

<p>It is necessary to ensure that the carer can and does, provide the care receiver with the level of care and attention on a daily basis that is required. A very young or elderly carer may have difficulty accessing support services and resources. A social worker can provide assistance in this regard.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A person may qualify for CA for 2, but no more than 2, adults with a disability who meet the CA (16 years or over) criteria, and may qualify for each dependent child with a disability that meets the CA (under 16 years) criteria, regardless of the number of children.</p>

<p>Care should be taken when a carer who is already receiving Carer Payment (CP) and/or CA contacts to claim CP and/or CA for a second care receiver. A discussion should be had with the carer as to whether CP is more appropriate for the new care receiver, this will all depend on the individual aspects of the carer and care receiver's circumstances. If the new care receiver is suffering from a terminal medical condition, it may be more appropriate to claim CP for the new care receiver due to bereavement provisions.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>CA may be <strong>shared by 2 people</strong> who care for the same care receiver(s), provided the 2 carers are not members of a couple. The 2 sections of the Social Security Act under which people sharing the care of an adult care receiver may be paid are s954 (CA adult) and s954A (CA adult 'living apart'). A carer who qualifies for CA under s954 can only share CA with another carer under s954. Similarly a carer getting CA under s954A can only share CA with another carer under s954A. However, a carer cannot be paid under section 954A if someone is already being paid, or has lodged a claim and been determined qualified, in respect of that care receiver under section 954. For detailed information about 2 carers for CA, see <a href="../carers/009-03010030-01.html">Shared care for Carer Allowance (CA)</a>.</p>

<p>Two carers may share one payment of CA under section 954A provided that together they are providing the 20 hours of personal care per week and this care is being provided on a daily basis.</p>

<p>If 2 carers who receive a shared care rate of CA for the same care receiver advise that they have become partnered, CA can no longer be paid to both partners. See <a href="../carers/009-03050040-01.html">Changes to shared care for Carer Allowance (CA)</a>.</p>

<p>A situation may arise where a carer ceases to qualify for CA when they move out of the care receiver's home (or are already a non co-resident carer under section 954A), and a qualified co-resident carer claims CA under section 954. The first carer would no longer be qualified under either section 954 or section 954A, as someone else qualifies under section 954. If the first carer is still providing daily care, however no longer qualifies for CA, care should be taken to cancel their CA.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> extending lodgement of a claim from 14 days to 13 weeks provisions (due to a medical condition) have not changed.
