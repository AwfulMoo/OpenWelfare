<p>If the customer needs more time to complete the EIC, they can request an extension either online or by contacting us.</p>

<p>To request an extension to the original due date, the customer needs to select the '<strong>Need more time?'</strong> link from the <strong>Employment Income Confirmation</strong> page.</p>

<p>Where the customer calls requesting a first and second extension, the CO should action the extension via the <a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-13090000-03.html#bp03_L2TT_Assisted">Assisted</a> process.</p>

<p>Each extension is an extra 14 days, and the customer can only request this twice. The following information message will display to the customer where they have accepted the first extension&#58;</p>

<p>'If you do not confirm or change your information by (the new due date), we will use the details from the ATO to check we paid you the right amount.</p>

<p>You may also request more time.'</p>

<p>The customer is advised before they accept the second extension that if they still require more time after two extensions, they can call us.</p>

<p>After the second extension has been accepted by the customer the '<strong>Need more time?'</strong> link will no longer display on the screen.</p>

<p>Where the customer calls for a further extension, the CO runs the <strong>Staff Extension</strong> guided procedure. The CO can grant an extension where the customer provides a suitable reason.</p>
