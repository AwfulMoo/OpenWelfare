For <strong>non-pension customers</strong>, advise the customer they are only entitled to 1 advance each 12 months even if the current advance is paid off sooner. <strong>Exception&#58;</strong> any Parenting Payment recipient who applies for an advance within 28 days of separating from their partner may receive an advance payment regardless of when they received their last advance, as long as any earlier advance has been repaid</li>
		<li>
A <strong>pension customer</strong> may receive up to 3 <a href="../payment-delivery/103-05040070-01.html">advance payments in a 13 fortnight period</a> depending on any other advances made in the last 13 fortnights and any monies owed from previous advance payments received. Paying an outstanding advance early will not benefit the customer if the advance is less than 13 fortnights old. Where multiple advances exist, it is recommended that advances over 13 fortnights old, or the oldest advance that is under 13 fortnights old, be recovered earlier than advances granted more recently</li>
		<li>
A <strong>Family Tax Benefit (FTB) customer</strong> can receive 1 regular advance payment and 1 or more one-off FTB advance payments as long as the total amount of the advance payments does not exceed their maximum FTB advance payment amount. Repaying an existing regular advance payment early will not entitle the customer to another regular advance sooner as they are only payable every 182 days (26 weeks)</li>
		</ul>
<p>An additional FTB advance payment cannot be received if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
there is any amount outstanding on an FTB advance payment granted more than 12 months previously, or</li>

the amount available to be advanced (that is, the gap between the customer's maximum FTB advance payment amount and the total of the existing outstanding FTB advance payments) is less than the minimum advance amount</li>
