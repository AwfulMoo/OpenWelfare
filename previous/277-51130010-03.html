<p>The system calculates an adjustment but does not apply it.</p>

<p>For backdated periods between 1 July 2006 up until 30 June 2011, it is assumed that the customer is collecting the new assessment amount from date paid to plus one (DPT + 1) and that they have not collected child support arrears or repaid child support in relation to the retrospective child support assessment. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-51040030-01.html">Child Support collection customer is owed or receives child support arrears</a>.</p>

<p>When the child support entitlement load is received via the data exchange, the system calculates the net variation between the old and new assessments from the start date of the new assessment up to and including 30 June 2011 at the latest. The details can be viewed on the Child Support Assessments (<strong>MNGR</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>A letter is sent to the customer asking them to advise Centrelink if they collect child support arrears they are owed, or if they repay any child support.</p>

<p>The letter advises the customer that if they would like to request a review of their FTB entitlement as a result of the backdated assessment, they should contact Centrelink within 13 weeks of the date the notification was received from Child Support.</p>

<p>If the customer contacts, <a href="../separated-parents/277-51130010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Retrospective_c_Step05">go to Step 5</a>.</p>

<p>The assessment is automatically applied.</p>

<p>From 1 July 2011, it is assumed that the customer is collecting the amount as assessed by Child Support. If the customer has a retrospective&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
decrease to their child support assessment and the customer is private collect, the customer's FTB will be assessed on the lower child support assessment and they may receive a top-up at reconciliation</li>
		<li>
increase to their child support assessment and the customer is private collect, the customer's FTB will be assessed on the higher child support assessment. Mandatory Continuous Adjustment (MCA) may be invoked to reduce the customer's ongoing payment to offset any potential reconciliation debt identified as a result of the increased assessment</li>
		</ul>
<p>For both increases and decreases, no debts/arrears are raised/paid during the financial year due to maintenance income changes. However, MCA may be invoked to offset any potential overpayment identified as a result of the change.</p>

<p>Even though the customer is sent a letter asking them to advise Centrelink if they collect child support arrears or repay any child support, no action is required as the customer is automatically assessed based on the new information from Child Support.</p>

<p>The customer may however, request a review of the decision to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
use a backdated higher assessment as this could have a significant impact on their ongoing rate and reconciliation outcome, or</li>
		<li>
apply a backdated decrease to their child support assessment where they are required to repay child support</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the customer wants to apply for a formal review of the actual increase or decrease in their child support assessment, they will need to contact Child Support.</p>

<p>If the child support assessment has been retrospectively increased and the customer advises that the liable parent is not going to pay the child support arrears, it may appropriate for the customer to seek legal advice about enforcing the payment.</p>

<p>If the customer later advises that a child support arrears payment has been made in relation to the retrospective child support assessment for the 2011-12 financial year, refer details to Child Support Unit (CSJ).

<p><strong>Child support assessment retrospectively decreased - customer is required to repay money to the payer</strong></p>

<p>If a customer is required to repay child support due to a backdated decreased reassessment, they may be able to receive arrears of FTB for the financial year(s) that the child support overpayment covers. For arrears to be payable, customers generally must apply for a formal review within the specified timeframe. The time limit for customers to apply for a formal review is the later of 13 weeks after they receive notification of the review by Child Support, or 52 weeks after the original decision was made. Refer to <a href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/109-06010000-01.html">customer initiated review of decision</a> for further details on timeframes</p>

<p>If the customer advises that they are required to repay child support as a result of a retrospective decreased assessment&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Where the 'payee' is required to repay any amount of child support, the amounts repaid need to be removed from the MIT calculation in order for the FTB to be reassessed for the relevant financial year(s)</li>
		<li>
The <strong>Child Support Unit</strong> (CSJ) will need to confirm with Child Support whether the 'payee' is required to repay the debt to the 'payer' before reassessing the FTB entitlement</li>

<p>From 1 July 2012, private collect customers are deemed to receive 100% of their assessed amount, regardless of how much they are actually collecting.</p>

<p>If the customer receives less than their full entitlement, any arrears received at a later date that relate to the deemed period are not counted when they are actually received. This is because the arrears have been deemed to have been received in the income year to which they relate.</p>

<p>From 1 July 2012, if the customer advises they are unable to privately collect an arrears amount accrued as a result of a backdated child support assessment which applies to a period commencing on or after 1 July 2012, the unpaid amount, in most cases, cannot be adjusted (see <strong>Exception</strong> below)&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
if the customer is not able to collect the new higher assessment ongoing, they may wish to consider changing from Private to Child Support collect</li>
		<li>
advise the customer that it may be appropriate to seek legal advice about enforcing the unpaid child support arrears</li>
		<li>
if the customer provides a letter from a Legal Practitioner stating they are not able to assist, as it would not be cost effective to do so, refer the customer to a Social Worker to consider a partial maintenance exemption for the relevant financial years (which would allow the unpaid arrears to be removed from the MIT). See <a href="../separated-parents/277-51070090-01.html">Exemptions from seeking child support for Family Tax Benefit (FTB) customers</a></li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Exception&#58;</strong> When a customer has a private collect child support case and there are family and domestic violence circumstances present, the customer may have been underpaid or not paid child support at all. In these cases, it may be appropriate to backdate the exemption. The backdating of the exemption is to offset the effect of child support that the customer was deemed to have received in these circumstances. This enables Centrelink to re-assess their FTB entitlement based on the actual amount of child support they received during this period. This may be relevant in the following customer scenarios&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
It may be appropriate to have a social worker assess an exemption for the retrospective period if the customer advises that they attempted to collect the arrears and the attempt created a situation where there is now a fear of family and domestic violence as a result. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-51070090-01.html">Exemptions from seeking child support</a></li>
		<li>
Alternatively, the customer may have already been granted a family and domestic violence exemption and the backdated re-assessment is now impacting their FTB rate for the current financial year. See Step 7 of <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-51030010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Recording_priva_Step07">Recording private maintenance income on Centrelink systems</a> for further details of how to code the actual income received by these customers</li>
		<li>
In some cases, customers who have been granted an exemption may have elected to 'opt out' of child support collection from a date in the past. Retrospectively changing the collection method to private collect will mean that the full Child Support assessment will be deemed as received for FTB purposes and this may generate FTB debts. See Step 7 of <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-51030010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Recording_priva_Step07">Recording private maintenance income on Centrelink systems</a> for details of how to code the actual income received by these customers</li>
		<li>
If the customer elects to change from private collect to Child Support collect, they can request collection of unpaid child support for up to three months immediately prior to the transfer (up to 9 months in exceptional circumstances). See <a href="../separated-parents/277-51040010-01.html">Applying for Child Support Collection</a></li>		</ul>

<p>Overpayment (OVP) method</p>

<p>The amount of the debt will be left as an overpayment owed by the payee to the payer. If there is an ongoing liability between the two parties, this will reduce the amount of the overpayment by 100%. The payer will not make any payments to the payee until the value of the overpayment has been offset by what should have been paid. The amount that is being offset against the payee's overpayment is considered received maintenance income for Maintenance Income Test (MIT) purposes.</p>

<p>Whether the child support debt is being recovered by the Overpayment or CR Methods, the customer needs to be put on the Entitlement Method as the amounts drawn down against the debt each month will not be received via the data exchange. Therefore it will appear that the payee&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
is not receiving any child support (for the Overpayment Method) until the full amount of the debt has been drawn down, or </li>
		<li>
is only receiving a portion of their child support assessment (CR Method) until the full amount of the debt has been drawn down. With the CR Method, the customer may continue to receive ongoing child support payments. Only a portion (for example 50%) of the payments made by the payer will go towards the debt, with the other 50% going to the payee (and displayed on the MNGP screen).</li>
		</ul>
<p>A <strong>Display on Access</strong> <strong>DOC</strong> needs to be recorded on the customer’s record to advise that the Entitlement Method has been coded and must be maintained for the financial years that the child support debt is being repaid. If the customer insists on changing to the Disbursement Method, tell the customer that they will incur a reconciliation debt, as the total amount drawn down against the debt will only be assessed at reconciliation.</p>

Put the <strong>Fast Note</strong> on hold with a resub date of 1st July.
