<LI>The system will create online task or issue letter 28 days out from expiry date</LI>

<LI>Assess outcomes from participation in a recent program or activity, and any follow up action required</LI>
<LI>Investigate whether the job seeker's circumstances have changed since the last review was undertaken (for example, now homeless, have an illness or changed family circumstances resulting in a possible exemption for a period)</LI>
<LI>Where necessary re-run the Job Seeker Classification Instrument (JSCI) and refer for an Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) as required</LI>
<LI>Investigate whether all barriers to employment have been addressed</LI>
<LI>Discuss with the job seeker other options in terms of further activities the job seeker could undertake to improve employment prospects</LI>
<LI>For Centrelink managed job seekers, review the existing Job Plan and <A href="../job-seekers/001-09100010-01.html">update</A> it as necessary</LI>
<LI>If not already referred and it is appropriate, refer the job seeker to a suitable Employment Services Provider.

<P>Actions and discussion points for PAA Review appointments include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Assess outcomes from participation in a recent program or activity, and any follow up action required</LI>
<LI>Investigate whether the job seeker's circumstances have changed since the last review was undertaken (for example, now homeless, have an illness or changed family circumstances resulting in a possible exemption for a period)</LI></UL>

<LI>there has been a change of circumstances</LI>

<LI>the QTI activity has expired, and the job seeker is likely to be eligible for Quarterly Participation Interview, as it appears they still have a partial capacity to work (PCW) or temporary reduced work capacity (TRWC) of less than 15 hours per week</LI></UL>
<LI>Consider whether a referral is required for a Job Capacity Assessment (JCA)</LI>
<LI>Investigate whether all barriers to employment have been addressed</LI>
<LI>Discuss with the job seeker other options in terms of further activities the job seeker could undertake to improve employment prospects</LI>
<LI>For Centrelink managed job seekers, review the existing Job Plan and <A href="../job-seekers/001-09100010-01.html">update</A> it as necessary</LI>
<LI>If not already referred and it is appropriate, refer the job seeker to a suitable Employment Services Provider.

If the customer has already completed a period of participation in the recommended program - for example, exited from Disability Employment Services (DES) with an employment or education outcome - the customer would generally not be referred back to the same program on the basis of the original ESAt/JCA</LI>
