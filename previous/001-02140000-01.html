<p>This document outlines the Community Development Program (CDP). CDP provides an integrated and flexible approach to participation and employment services for people living in 60 Department of Employment and Workplace Relations designated remote servicing regions in Australia.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The CDP is the Government's remote employment and community development service. CDP is aimed at preparing participants for work while contributing to the goals of their community. CDP providers tailor a package of assistance suited to each individual participant based on their needs and readiness for employment. </p>

<p>CDP activities are also designed to support local communities and be responsive to available and future employment opportunities.</p>

<p>The CDP offers participants a pathway to learn new skills or build upon existing skills, to increase their experience and work-readiness through work-like activities and placements in real work settings.  </p>

<p>For eligible participants living in one of 60 remote servicing regions, CDP is the only <a href="../job-seekers/001-02060000-01.html">Employment Services Provider</a> type available. The following employment services are <strong>not</strong> delivered in the 60 remote servicing regions&#58;</p>

<p>Participants who are provider managed have a Job Plan negotiated with their CDP provider.</p>

<p>In negotiating Job Plans with CDP participants, providers consider each participant's assessed capacity and individual circumstances.</p>

<p>For 'assessed capacity', see <a href="../job-seekers/001-09070180-01.html">Job seekers with a partial capacity to work or a temporary reduced work capacity</a>.</p>

<p>There are no specific requirements for CDP participants according to their age group or participant category, e.g. for principal carer parents or participants aged over 55.</p>

<p>Minimum hourly requirements do not apply for CDP participants. If a CDP participant elects to participate in an activity such as Work for the Dole, the provider records in the Job Plan the number of hours the participant has volunteered to undertake. If the participant does not participate in the activity for the elected number of hours, penalties will not apply, as their participation is voluntary.</p>

<p>If a participant does not elect to participate in an activity, the hourly requirements in their Job Plan are zero.</p>

<p>CDP participants who are Centrelink managed have a Job Plan negotiated by Services Australia. The type of plan to be negotiated is determined automatically by the system, based on information sent by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations IT system, and depends on whether a CDP provider referral is in place or not.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
must not advise the participant on the likely outcome of a transfer request, Services Australia is not able to advise whether a transfer will be approved</li>
		<li>
should advise the participant to discuss the request with their current provider</li>
		<li>
may advise the participant that a transfer can be approved where they can demonstrate extenuating circumstances as to why the transfer would be beneficial to them</li>
		<li>
may advise the participant of the transfer process </li>
		<li>
where appropriate, may support the participant to request the transfer, with the participant’s consent</li>

<p>CDP participants who approach Services Australia about a breakdown in their relationship with their CDP provider organisation should be advised to discuss their situation with their provider in the first instance.

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The CDP will be replaced with a new remote jobs program. </p>

<p>It will be developed in partnership with First Nations people, with learnings from trials and consultation feeding into program design.</p>

<p>The new remote jobs program will&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
increase economic opportunities and jobs in remote areas </li>
		<li>
support community needs and aspirations, and</li>
		<li>
give communities more control to determine local projects</li>
		</ul>
<p>The start date of the new program is to be decided. Up until the new program commences, CDP providers will continue to deliver their services as usual, including supporting CDP participants. Current CDP services will continue through an extension of CDP provider agreements to 31 October 2024.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Trialling Pathways to Real Jobs</strong>&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
The Trialling Pathways to Real Jobs trial commenced from November 2022</li>

		<li>
<strong>New Jobs Program Trial</strong>&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
The New Jobs Program Trial is expected to commence in the second half of 2023</li>

		<li>
<strong>Ngaanyatjarra Lands Trial</strong>&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
The Ngaanyatjarra Lands Trial  commences from July 2023 and is focussed on testing approaches in very remote regions with thin labour markets</li>
