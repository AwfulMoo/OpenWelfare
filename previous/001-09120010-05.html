<TD><A name=bp05_tbl_Assessment_of_p_Differen class=anchor></A>
<P>Difference between 'permanent medical condition' and 'long term incapacity for work'</P></TD>
<TD>
<P>It is important to distinguish between a permanent medical condition and a permanent (or long term) incapacity for work. A job seeker who is permanently incapacitated for all work of 8 hours or more per week (for at least 2 years) cannot generally be granted a temporary incapacity exemption.</P>
<P>A permanent medical condition may, or may not, cause a permanent incapacity for work depending upon circumstances. For example, a person with well-controlled asthma may be suited to undertake full-time activities for mutual obligation requirements under normal circumstances. If they have a temporary exacerbation of their asthma, they may seek an exemption from mutual obligation requirements because of a temporary exacerbation of a permanent condition.</P>
<P>An exemption may be granted if it is clear from all available information that the incapacity for work is likely to be temporary. For example, if the medical certificate lists the primary condition as 'permanent' and states that the prognosis (impacts on customer's capacity for work) is expected to be 3-12 months. In this case a service officer may accept that this is a temporary exacerbation of a permanent condition.</P>
<P>Customers should not be asked to go back to their treating medical practitioners, to change existing opinion on whether a condition is 'permanent' or 'exacerbation of a permanent condition' or 'temporary'.</P>
<P><STRONG>Example 1:</STRONG> A job seeker with an amputation has a permanent medical condition, which may affect their ability to work, according to the type of amputation. Consider whether there has been a missing limb from birth, or an amputation as the result of trauma/injury. For instance, a job seeker with an amputation below the knee may no longer be able to work as a roof-tiler but may successfully be able to work/be retrained as a call centre sales person.</P>
<P><STRONG>Example 2:</STRONG> A job seeker with hearing impairment may not be able to work in an environment with a lot of background noise (for example, bar work, machinery workshop) or where good hearing is critical (such as medical reception, childcare), however may successfully work in areas such as car detailing, computer programming or clerical work with appropriate workplace support.</P>
<P><STRONG>Example 3:</STRONG> The impact of a mental illness can vary widely - some people may experience only a minor impact, while for others it may have a major impact on their lives. A job seeker with depression may make a good recovery with counselling and medication, and may benefit from referral to Disability Employment Services (DES). Another job seeker with the same condition may have a long history of limited benefit from various medications and treatments, and the medical history may indicate that the job seeker is unlikely to have the capacity to work full-time within 2 years.</P>
<P></P></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD><A name=bp05_tbl_Assessment_of_p_Contacti class=anchor></A>
<P>Contacting job seeker about inviting a Disability Support Pension (DSP) claim</P></TD>
<TD>
<P>Only invite a job seeker lodging a medical certificate to claim DSP if there is clear evidence that they are likely to meet all medical eligibility criteria. Valid sources of evidence include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>a recommendation in a Job Capacity Assessment or Employment Services Assessment</LI>
<LI>health and allied health professional advice from Assessment Services or the Health Professional Advisory Unit, or</LI>
<LI>evidence that the job seeker is manifestly eligible, such as where they are terminally ill or have a list 1 or 2 condition (see <A href="../people-with-disability/008-03030140-01.html">Granting Disability Support Pension (DSP) (manifest)</A>)</LI></UL>
<P>Do not invite a DSP claim based solely on the fact that a medical condition is permanent, or on how long the symptoms are expected to affect the job seeker's capacity to work.</P>
<P>If a decision is made to invite a claim for DSP:</P>
<UL>
<LI>make at least 2 genuine attempts to phone the job seeker</LI>
<LI>where contact is successful and the job seeker or nominee accepts the invitation to claim DSP, run the First Contact Concessions, Carers and Seniors (FCCCS) workflow</LI>
<LI>if contact is not possible, run the DSP invite to claim guided procedure</LI>
<LI>take care to avoid requesting unnecessary additional medical evidence (for example, if an Assessor has advised that available evidence is sufficient for a manifest grant), and further medical evidence is clearly not required</LI></UL>
<P>Where contact with the job seeker is made, and they indicate they <STRONG>do not</STRONG> wish to make a claim for DSP, run the <STRONG>DSP Invite to claim</STRONG> guided procedure.</P>
<P>The <STRONG>DSP Invite to claim</STRONG> guided procedure can be used to invite suitable JobSeeker Payment (JSP), Parenting Payment Single or Youth Allowance recipients to claim DSP.</P>

<P>Details:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The job seeker's incapacity is wholly or mainly caused by their drug and/or alcohol dependency or misuse</LI>
<LI>Medical evidence indicates the <STRONG>primary</STRONG> medical condition is drug and/or alcohol dependency or misuse. Finalise the guided procedure and do not apply the exemption due to Drug and/or Alcohol dependency or misuse, to create an activity on the Activity List (<STRONG>AL</STRONG>) screen to enable a Q549 letter to be sent to the job seeker to advise that an exemption has not been applied:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>select the activity from the <STRONG>AL</STRONG> screen, and finalise to issue the letter</LI></UL>
<LI>The Non-Applied Exemption (NAE) can also be manually recorded via the Medical Conditions (<STRONG>MC</STRONG>) screen if the guided procedure is not available</LI></UL>

<P>Details:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The job seeker's or participant's incapacity for work or study or participation is expected to continue for at least the next 2 years. Only use this reason where available medical evidence clearly shows that the job seeker is expected to be incapacitated for at least the next 2 years</LI>
<LI>This determination is based on available medical evidence, including the medical certificate completed by the job seeker's medical practitioner (if applicable) and an ESAt report</LI>

<LI>Evidence shows that the customer will be incapacitated for all work of at least 8 hours per week for at least the next 2 years</LI>

<P>Insufficient evidence supplied</P></TD>
<TD>
<P>Details:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Example 1 - the job seeker has provided a non-standard medical certificate which clearly doesn't provide enough information to assess an exemption request</LI>
<LI>Example 2 - the service officer is not satisfied with the integrity of the information on the medical certificate, including suspected fraud</LI>
<LI>Example 3 - the medical certificate provided by the job seeker was issued too long ago and can no longer be considered a current and valid assessment of their medical condition</LI>
<UL>
<LI>when deciding to apply this reason, consider if it was reasonable for the job seeker to supply their medical evidence at an earlier date. For example, if the job seeker was comatose and did not have someone to act on their behalf, it would be unreasonable for the job seeker to provide the medical certificate until after they were well enough to do so</LI></UL>
<LI>If the job seeker is still seeking an exemption, advise them they need to provide a valid medical certificate from their medical practitioner</LI></UL>
