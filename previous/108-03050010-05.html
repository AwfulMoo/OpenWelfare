<p>Disability Compensation Payments – formerly Disability Pensions - were counted as income for social security purposes before 1 January 2022. Disability Compensation payments are still income for <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-06040000-01.html">Low Income Health Care Cards (LIC)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> this payment is not to be referred to the Compensation Management Team</p>

<p>There are four 'categories' of Disability Compensation Payment that will display on the Department of Veterans' Affairs Summary (<strong>DVAS</strong>) screen&#58;&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>General Rate</strong>(displayed as a percentage)</li>
		<li>
<strong>Extreme Disablement Adjustment</strong></li>
		<li>
<strong>Intermediate Rate</strong></li>
		<li>
<strong>Special Rate</strong> - Totally &amp; Permanently Incapacitated (TPI) or Temporarily &amp; Totally Incapacitated (TTI)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Customers may also qualify for Specific Disability Item payments. These will be in addition to the Disability Compensation Payments mentioned above and must be coded separately on the <strong>DVAS</strong> screen.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
A change in rate may result in a debt or arrears before 1 January 2022 because of the inclusion of Adjusted Disability Pension on the customer and/or partner record. A rate of Defence Force Income Support Allowance (DFISA) would have been generated on the <strong>DFS</strong> screen, for customer and/or partner</li>
		<li>
<a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-03060000-01.html">Defence Force Income Support Allowance (DFISA)</a> ceased from 1 January 2022, in line with the change to the assessment of Adjusted Disability Pensions</li>
		</ul>
<p>Limiting Amount (LMT)&#58; Disability Compensation Payment can be affected by compensation from another source. The compensation offsetting occurs on the basis that a person should not be compensated twice for the same injury or illness, regardless of them being eligible from more than one source. To ensure the offset is accounted for, a Limiting Amount may be applicable and recorded on the DVAS and will reduce the amount of Disability Compensation Payment being assessed by the system.</p>
