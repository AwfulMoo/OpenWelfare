<p>Service Pension</p></td>

<p>This is an income support payment broadly equivalent to the Age Pension and Disability Support Pension. A Service Pension can be paid to veterans on the grounds of age or invalidity, and to eligible partners, widows and widow(er)'s. It is subject to income and assets tests.</p>

<p>In recognition of the premature ageing and loss of earning power, which may result from the intangible effects of war service, Service Pension has certain advantages over the equivalent Centrelink payments, including&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Age Service Pension can be payable from 60 years of age for veterans</li>
		<li>
Australian veterans in receipt of Service Pension have a greater health care entitlement</li>
		</ul>
<p>Service Pension is primarily payable to Australian, Commonwealth and allied veterans. However the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (VEA) also provides for payment of Service Pension to the partner of an eligible veteran, and a widow or widow(er) of a deceased eligible veteran.</p>

<p>The three different forms of Service Pension are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Age Service Pension</strong> - payable to veterans who are at least service pension age</li>
		<li>
<strong>Invalidity Service Pension</strong> - payable to veterans who are permanently incapacitated for work</li>
		<li>
<strong>Partner Service Pension</strong> - payable to the partner, widow, or widow(er) of an eligible veteran. Partner Service Pension is not payable if in receipt of a War Widow(er)'s Pension</li>
		</ul>
<p>Service Pension is payable to eligible veterans, their partners, and widow(er)'s if the veteran satisfies all four eligibility criteria&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Veteran Status</strong> - as defined in section 5C of VEA</li>
		<li>
<strong>Qualifying Service</strong> - as defined in the VEA</li>
		<li>
<strong>Residency Requirements</strong> - is an Australian resident and present in Australia when the claim is lodged. Commonwealth and allied veterans must be an Australian resident for at least 10 years or more unless they have recognised refugee status, or became incapacitated for work while an Australian resident</li>
		<li>
<strong>Age Requirements</strong> - 60 years for Veterans claiming Age Service Pension, no age requirement for Veterans claiming Invalidity Service Pension and variable age requirements for Partner Service Pension depending on circumstances</li>		</ul>

<p>Social Security Age Pension</p></td>

<p>From 26 March 1998, veterans receiving Disability Compensation Payment from DVA who are eligible to receive Social Security Age Pension (and their partners who are eligible for Age Pension) have the choice of receiving their Pension from either DVA or Centrelink.</p>

<p>DVA acts as an 'agent' for the Department of Social Services and any Social Security Age (or Wife Pension before 20/03/2020) paid by DVA is assessed under the provisions of the Social Security Law.</p>

<p>Veteran Payment (VP)</p></td>
<td>

<p><strong>This is not to be confused with Veteran Supplement (VSP). Check the name before continuing.</strong></p>

<p>VP is a short-term income support payment paid by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. It provides help to veterans while they are awaiting determination on a claim for liability for a mental health condition. The partner of a VEP recipient can also receive VP.</p>

<p>It was introduced on 1 May 2018, with DVA accepting claims backdated to 17 April 2018.</p>

<p>VP is subject to an income and assets test and is taxable income.</p>

<p>Recipients may claim with Services Australia while still in receipt of VEP from DVA. Contact is to be made with the DVA Clearance Team to negotiate an end-date for the VP payment. <strong>Claims are not to be rejected without consultation with DVA</strong>.</p>

<p>Income Support Supplement (ISS)</p></td>
<td>

<p>ISS is paid to Australian war widow(er)s by DVA. It provides a regular income in addition to the Wholly Dependent Partner (WDP) payment or War Widow(er)'s Pension (WWP), which replaced the social security pensions payable to war widow(er)s before 20 March 1995.</p>

<p>To be eligible for ISS the person must be&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
an Australian war widow(er) or a wholly dependent partner under Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Scheme (MRCA), and</li>
		<li>
an Australian resident and residing in Australia</li>
		</ul>
<p>ISS is subject to income and assets tests. WWP and WDP are counted as income for ISS purposes.</p>

<p>The combined amount of ISS and Rent Assistance (RA) cannot exceed the ceiling rate for ISS, unless the RA is paid as part of the Family Tax Benefit.</p>

<p>ISS may be granted based on invalidity if the claimant is permanently incapacitated for work. Invalidity ISS paid to a person who is under age pension age is non-taxable income.</p>

<p>Pension supplement has been rolled into the rate of ISS.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> ISS cannot be paid at the same time as a DVA Service Pension, Veteran Payment or a social security pension or allowance.</p>

<p><strong>DVA Compensation Payments</strong></p>

<p>Compensation payable by DVA falls into two categories&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
those representing an inability or reduced ability to work</li>
			<ul>			<li>
provided in the form of Incapacity Payments</li>
			<li>
payments are subject to the compensation recovery provisions in respect of income support payments</li>		</ul>
		<li>
payments to compensate veterans and other eligible persons for physical or mental incapacity caused by war or eligible defence service, and the effects of that loss on lifestyle</li>
			<ul>			<li>
achieved through the payment of Adjusted Disability Pensions, ancillary benefits and the provision of medical treatment for service related disabilities</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>DVA also compensates the dependents of veterans who died because of injuries or illnesses that were related to their service, for example, through the payment of War Widow(er)'s Pension (WWP).</p>

<p><strong>Disability Compensation Payment</strong></p>

<p>The Disability Compensation Payment is paid to compensate veterans for injuries or diseases caused or aggravated by war service or certain defence service on behalf of Australia. Disability Compensation Payments – formerly Disability Pensions - were counted as income for social security purposes before 1 January 2022.</p>

<p>A person must have had a specific type of service in order to qualify as a veteran or member of the Forces under the Veterans' Entitlement Act 1986.</p>

<p>The amount of Disability Compensation Payment paid depends on the level of incapacity and is made up of 2 components - medical impairment and lifestyle rating. The medical impairment rating and lifestyle rating are combined to determine the degree of incapacity, which is then converted to a payment rate. The greater the incapacity suffered by the person, the more payment they will receive.</p>

<p>There are four 'categories' of Disability Compensation Payment payable&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>General Rate</strong> - payable in multiples of 10% up to 100%</li>
		<li>
<strong>Extreme Disablement Adjustment</strong> - for those over 65 years of age</li>
		<li>
<strong>Intermediate Rate - </strong>bridges the gap between General Rate and Special Rate for those with a partial capacity for work</li>
		<li>
<strong>Special Rate</strong> - Totally &amp; Permanently Incapacitated (T&amp;PI) or Temporarily &amp; Totally Incapacitated (TTI)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Customers may also qualify for Specific Disability Item payments. These will be in addition to the Disability Compensation Payments mentioned above and must be coded separately on the <strong>DVAS</strong> screen.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
A change in rate may result in a debt or arrears before 1 January 2022 because of the inclusion of Adjusted Disability Pension on the customer and/or partner record. A rate of Defence Force Income Support Allowance (DFISA) would have been generated on the <strong>DFS</strong> screen, for customer and/or partner</li>
		<li>
<a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-03060000-01.html">Defence Force Income Support Allowance (DFISA)</a> ceased from 1 January 2022, in line with the change to the assessment of Adjusted Disability Pensions</li>		</ul>

<p><strong>Permanent Impairment</strong></p>

<p>Payments may be made under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence Related Claims) Act 1988 (DRCA) or the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Scheme (MRCA) and represent compensation in respect of any permanent physical and/or mental impairment in combination with any lifestyle restrictions.</p>

<p>Payments made under DRCA are an actuarial lifetime equivalent lump sum only.</p>

<p>Payments made under MRCA can be paid as&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Fortnightly payments</li>
		<li>
An actuarial lifetime equivalent paid as a lump sum</li>
		<li>
A combination of a lump sum and fortnightly payments. There are set percentages that can be taken as a lump sum and fortnightly payments</li>
		</ul>
<p>Lump sums are treated as exempt for social security income assessment purposes. Fortnightly payments are to be included as income (DFISA attracting) before 1 January 2022.</p>

<p>For Family Tax Benefit, lump sums are deemed to be income in the tax year they are received.</p>

<p>The amount of bereavement payment that is paid to eligible dependents is based on the fortnightly amount received before death. If the recipient took the full amount as a lump sum, no bereavement payment would be payable.</p>

<p><strong>Special Rate Disability Pension (SRDP)</strong></p>

<p>SRDP is a non-taxable payment, however before 1 January 2022, it was assessed as ordinary income for social security purposes (DFISA attracting). It is also included in the assessment of <a href="../families/007-07080000-01.html">adjusted taxable income for family assistance payments</a>.</p>

<p>SRDP is available to ADF personnel who&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
have an injury or disease assessed at 50 or more impairment points which is likely to continue indefinitely</li>
		<li>
are in receipt of incapacity payments, and</li>
		<li>
are assessed as being unable to undertake paid work for more than 10 hours per week and unlikely to be helped by rehabilitation to undertake paid work for more than 10 hours per week</li>
		</ul>
<p>The customer can choose to receive incapacity payments until age 65 or an SRDP for life, but cannot receive both concurrently.</p>

<p>SRDP is equivalent to the Disability Compensation Payment at the Special Rate (TPI) but is reduced by all other compensation already paid for permanent impairment and by Commonwealth funded superannuation payments.</p>

<p>SRDP is reduced on a dollar for dollar basis by&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the weekly rate of Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Allowance (MRCA) incapacity or permanent impairment payments</li>
		<li>
an equivalent amount if any permanent impairment compensation was taken as a lump sum</li>
		<li>
Disability Compensation Payment</li>
		<li>
permanent impairment and non-economic loss compensation paid under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence Related Claims) Act 1988 (DRCA) for other injuries or diseases</li>
		</ul>
<p>The balance of the SRDP is offset by the Commonwealth funded component of superannuation received at a rate of 60 cents in the dollar.</p>

<p>The customer is entitled to receive the following from DVA&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a death benefit payable automatically to eligible dependents and funeral help</li>
		<li>
a Repatriation Health card (Gold card)</li>
		<li>
help with the education of dependent children</li>

<p><strong>Limiting amounts</strong></p>

<p>DVA compensation payments, (for example, Disability Compensation Payment) can be affected by compensation from another source. The compensation offsetting occurs on the basis that a person should not be compensated twice for the same injury or illness, irrespective of whether they have eligibility from more than one source.</p>

<p>If a reduction in the entitlement to War Widow(er)'s Pension or Disability Compensation Payment exists due to compensation offsetting we continue to record the full amount and maintain separately the limiting amount calculated by DVA. The amount included in the income test for income support payments before 1 January 2022 is the difference between the gross rate of compensation less the Limiting Amount.</p>

<p>A Limiting Amount (LMT) recorded on the <strong>DVAS</strong> screen will reduce the amount of Disability Compensation Payment being assessed by the system</p>

<p>Income Support Supplement (ISS) for war widow(er)'s was introduced on 20 March 1995. Before that date, war widow(er)'s were able to receive an income support payment under social security law, however, the rate of entitlement was fixed at a maximum ceiling or 'frozen' rate of $124.90.</p>

<p>The dollar amount of social security age, carer, wife or disability support pension paid to a war widow(er) was assessed in the same way as for other pensioners - that is, based on the person's income and assets with the war widow(er)'s pension taken into account as income. However, the maximum amount of ISP payable could not exceed $124.90.</p>

<p>If the war widow(er) was partnered, their social security pension and the partner's pension were calculated based on the combined income and assets of both partners, with the WWP taken into account as income.</p>
