<p>This document outlines information about recognition as a specialist or consultant physician for Medicare. Specialist recognition allows recognised medical practitioners to access specialist or consultant physician attendance items in the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS). It also allows access to other relevant items in the MBS for recognised specialists or consultant physicians registered for Medicare purposes in a particular specialty.</p>

<p>There are 3 sections under the Health Insurance Act 1973 to be considered for specialist recognition, these are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Section 3D – applies to permanent residents and Australian citizens. This applies for recognition as a specialist only and not consultant physicians. The relevant college will advise Services Australia that the medical practitioner is now a fellow having successfully completed their course of study</li>
		<li>
Section 3DB – applies to a permanent resident or Australian citizen who has fellowship with an Australasian college or is recognised as a specialist with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra). The medical practitioner may be subject to section 19AB if they are an overseas trained doctor (OTD) or foreign graduate of an accredited medical school (FGAMS). For medical practitioners who do not hold fellowship and are recognised as a specialist with Ahpra, recognition can only be granted for a period of 2 years</li>
		<li>
Section 3E – applies to temporary residents who have fellowship with an Australasian college or are recognised as a specialist with Ahpra. For medical practitioners who do not hold fellowship with an Australasian college and are recognised as a specialist with Ahpra, recognition can only be granted for a period of 2 years. Medical practitioners previously granted specialist recognition under section 3E are required to reapply for specialist recognition every 2 years or if they become a permanent resident or Australian citizen</li>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>These applications are referred to as 3D applications.</p>

<p>Under section 3D of the Health Insurance Act 1973&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the medical practitioner does not have to apply directly to Services Australia for recognition</li>
		<li>
an Australasian specialist medical college will advise the Chief Executive Medicare that a medical practitioner has obtained fellowship for their specialty and satisfies the criteria for recognition as a specialist</li>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Applications for specialist recognition are considered by the delegate of the Chief Executive Medicare and the Minister for Health under section 3DB (permanent residents or Australian citizens) or 3E (temporary residents) of the Health Insurance Act 1973. The delegate makes a determination and advises the applicant in writing of the outcome.</p>

<p>The date of recognition may be a date in the past but cannot be earlier than the date the medical practitioner satisfied the criteria for recognition as a specialist or consultant physician.</p>

<p>The date Medicare billing can commence may not always be the date of recognition as other factors must be taken into account. For example, if a medical practitioner is an overseas trained doctor (OTD), they must hold a valid section 19AB exemption to access Medicare benefits. Access to Medicare benefits will be determined by the dates and locations specified in the section 19AB exemption.</p>

<p>If a determination was made under section 3E, the medical practitioner must advise Services Australia when they become a permanent resident or Australian citizen. They need to re-apply for specialist recognition under section 3DB. </p>
