<p>A secondary school student is <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-02060010-01.html">entitled to away from home rate allowances</a> (Living Allowance, Rent Assistance (RA) and Remote Area Allowance (RAA)) across vacation periods, even when the student returns to the permanent home for the holidays. The <strong>AD</strong> screen <strong>must</strong> be coded to match the<a target="_blank" href="../students-and-trainees/010-02060010-01.html"> eligibility period for away from home rate</a> to ensure qualification for RAA matches the eligibility period for away from home rate.</p>

<p>If the student's home address is in a RAA specified area, record only a Home (<strong>HOM</strong>) address on the <strong>AD</strong> screen. Do not record the Term (<strong>TER</strong>) address. This facilitates correct payment of RAA for the full entitlement period.</p>

<p>To ensure the term address is recorded on the customer's record, a Display on Access (<strong>DOA</strong>) <strong>DOC</strong> can be created. If the student wants to receive mail at their term address, code a <strong>POS</strong> (postal) address with the term address details.</p>

<p>If the student's home address is not in a RAA specified area, record a <strong>HOM</strong> address and details of the location the student is residing whilst studying as a <strong>TER</strong> address.</p>

<p><strong>Tertiary and secondary non-schooling students</strong></p>

<p>The customer's address details coded must include the student's actual <strong>HOM</strong> address as well as the <strong>TER</strong> address at the study location. Tertiary students are subject to normal <a href="../rural-and-remote-australians/002-04010000-01.html">Remote Area Allowance entitlement provisions</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Payment on Advice</strong></p>

<p>ABSTUDY secondary school students boarding at a school, in an approved ABSTUDY Homestay arrangement, or at a hostel that is a signatory to the <a target="_blank" href="../students-and-trainees/010-02060040-01.html">ABSTUDY Standard Hostels Agreement</a> <strong>must</strong> have <a target="_blank" href="../students-and-trainees/010-02060020-01.html">their payments delivered to the school or hostel</a>.</p>

<p>Payments are delivered as an ABSTUDY boarding instalment with the first instalment usually delivered to the school or boarding institution on the designated default pay date in the fourth week of the school term in each state or territory, providing the school or boarding institution has confirmed that the student has commenced. The second instalment is delivered automatically to the boarding institution near the end of the school term without a requirement for confirmation from the school of student attendance.</p>

<p><a href="../students-and-trainees/010-02060050-01.html">Payment on Advice</a> is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the term used for the process that requires schools and boarding institutions to advise Services Australia of term commencement dates for ABSTUDY away from home students to receive the first ABSTUDY boarding instalment</li>
		<li>
unavailable for students who are not paid via boarding instalment</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>OTAC Release Dates</strong></p>

<p>A Payment on Advice request is sent to the school or boarding institution (based on where the student resides) in the second week of each school term. The request contains a One Time Access Code (<strong>OTAC</strong>) for schools/boarding institutions to log into the Education Institution eService and provide term commencement dates for ABSTUDY students. In the eService, schools/boarding institutions can view their estimated ABSTUDY boarding instalment payments for students and the delivery date for these entitlements.</p>

<p>A student processed as eligible for the away from home rate after the SAS extraction date for the Payment on Advice request for the term, will need to have their commencement status checked manually with the school or hostel. See <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-02060050-05.html">Payment on Advice for ABSTUDY away from home rate</a> for the SAS extraction dates.</p>

<p><strong>Third Friday</strong></p>

<p>ABSTUDY secondary school students are entitled to the away from home rate from the first day of the term entitlement period in which the student is eligible if they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
are boarding at a school, in an approved ABSTUDY Homestay arrangement, or </li>
		<li>
are boarding at a hostel that is a signatory to the <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-02060040-01.html">ABSTUDY Standard Hostels Agreement</a> <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
have commenced study at the school or hostel by the third Friday of the term</li>
		</ul>
<p>If a student does not commence by the third Friday of term&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the school or hostel is only eligible for payment from the date the student commenced at the boarding school or hostel</li>
		<li>
and it was due to circumstances beyond their control, they are treated the same as those who did commence by the third Friday. See <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-02060010-01.html">Calculating the commencement date of away from home rate for ABSTUDY</a></li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Calculating the student start date on the EDC screen</strong></p>

<p>The OTAC release dates can be found in the resources tab of <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-02060050-01.html">Payment on Advice for ABSTUDY away from home rate</a>. Within this document is the SAS extraction date for each term and state. This date is very important when choosing which date to code in the student start date field on the <strong>EDC</strong> screen. The SAS extraction date is the date used to compile the payment on advice list that is sent to schools and hostels. If a claim is granted for the current term entitlement period after the SAS extraction date, then that student will not appear on the Payment on Advice list.</p>

<p>If a claim is being assessed <strong>before the SAS extraction date in the current term</strong>, the student start date should be coded as the first day of the term entitlement period.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Term 1 will need to be coded as the course start date because it is not possible to code <strong>1 Jan</strong>.</p>

<p>If a claim is being assessed <strong>after the SAS extraction date in the current term</strong> and no first day of attendance has been provided from the school or hostel for the terms then the student start date should be coded as the first day of the next term entitlement period. Once the first day of attendance has been provided, the <strong>EDC</strong> can be updated with the date the student commenced so that the correct payments are issued. The school may need to be contacted or a manual request sent to collect this information.</p>

<p>Coding for Term 4 differs slightly when processing after the SAS extraction date. The coding will depend on if ABSTUDY is going to continue in the next calendar year. If the student is continuing study in the next calendar year, study will need to be coded for both calendar years. Term 4 should be coded from the start of the term 4 entitlement period. The <strong>EPDC</strong> should be coded from 1 January to avoid payments being issued. If the student is not continuing in the next calendar year, the claim cannot be granted until the term 4 first day of attendance is confirmed with the school.</p>

<p>When assessing previous terms, or having been provided with the first day of attendance to pay arrears in the current term, the student start date on <strong>EDC</strong> will need to be calculated using the third Friday rule.</p>

<p>In some cases multiple <strong>EDC</strong> screens may be needed if there has been a gap in entitlement.</p>

<p>If there is a gap in entitlement and the student was previously attending the same school in the same calendar year then a new <strong>EDC</strong> screen will need to be inserted under the same course ID. This can be done by selecting the existing course, adjusting the <strong>participation status event date</strong> field to the first day after the gap in entitlement and coding '<strong>I</strong>' in the <strong>Action</strong> field. The student start and end dates within each <strong>EDC</strong> screen will need to be adjusted to ensure that it reflects the gap of entitlement.</p>

<p>Payment of Living Allowance and School Fees Allowance (SFA) for some <strong>secondary</strong> school students is determined by details coded on the <strong>EYSB</strong> screen. This screen is used to pay Living Allowance and SFA for students whose living arrangements are as follows&#58;</p>

Boarding at a school</li>
		<li>
Approved ABSTUDY Homestay arrangement</li>
		<li>
Boarding at a hostel which is a signatory to the ABSTUDY Hostel Agreement</li>

<p>It is also used to pay Living Allowance <strong>only</strong>, for students who are boarding privately with payments of Living Allowance to be delivered to the board provider, or at a hostel that is not a signatory to the ABSTUDY Hostel Agreement.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> SFA for students in private board arrangements, or in a hostel that is not a signatory to the <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-02060040-01.html">ABSTUDY Hostel Agreement</a>, is <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-02060030-03.html#bp03_tbl_Coding_the_rele_Payment_">paid via the EPSP screen</a>.</p>

<p>This screen needs the board charge and school fee charge (where applicable) to be obtained prior to processing, otherwise the <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-02060030-03.html#bp03_tbl_Coding_the_rele_Coding_o">transfer of excess School Fees Allowance to assist with boarding shortfall</a> does not occur correctly. If fees are unknown, contact the school to obtain the amount charged for that student.</p>

<p>It will be necessary to request board and school fee charges each year for hostels and boarding schools who accept ABSTUDY boarders.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> some students may be in receipt of a scholarship that contributes to all or some of the Board and/or Fees, therefore, ensure the amount coded on the <strong>EYSB</strong> screen is the net amount of the school charges after the scholarship have been deducted. For example, if the school charge is normally $10,000 per year for Board and a scholarship contributes $4,000 per year to the Boarding fees, the correct amount to code in regards to Board is the net amount of $6,000.</p>

<p>This ensures that the correct amount is paid to the Boarding School/Hostel, and any excess Living Allowance is paid back to the parent/guardian/student.</p>

<p>Secondary school students boarding at a school, an approved ABSTUDY Homestay arrangement, or at a hostel that is a signatory to the ABSTUDY Hostel Agreement, can qualify for any excess SFA to be transferred to assist with any shortfall in Living Allowance. This is known as 'top-up' and is not available to students in any other living arrangement.</p>

<p>Where a student's total annual entitlement of combined Living Allowance, Rent Assistance and Remote Area Allowance is insufficient to meet the board charge of the school or hostel, any excess SFA, up to the maximum available, is transferred across to top-up the shortfall in board.</p>

<p>The system automatically determines top-up eligibility and amount, based on the coding on the <strong>EYSB</strong> screen.</p>

<p>Mandatory coding of the actual board and school fee charges is needed to allow top-up to occur where applicable.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> both board and school fee charges <strong>must</strong> be obtained prior to the first ABSTUDY boarding instalment being paid. If the school fee charge is not coded, the system will assume that no school fees are charged and therefore the full amount of SFA will be available as a top-up towards boarding fees. This may mean that insufficient SFA is available to pay the school fees.</p>

<p>See the <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-02060030-05.html">Resources</a> page for examples of how the system automatically calculates top-up based on the coding of board and school fee charges on <strong>EYSB</strong> screen.</p>

<p>Strict rules determine the appropriate payee and frequency of payment of away from home rate of ABSTUDY. See <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-02060020-01.html">payment of away from home rate</a> to determine the correct payment method dependent on the customer's living arrangements and age. Correct coding of the customer's record facilitates the correct payment delivery.</p>

<p>An ABSTUDY customer can choose to direct payment of allowances to a third party. A third party payee can be either a <strong>person</strong> or an <strong>organisation</strong>.</p>

<p>Allowances coded on either of the following screens need the third party payee details to be linked to the payment&#58;</p>

<p>To facilitate correct payment of away from home entitlements for ABSTUDY, the following key coding is required for this screen&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Ensure individual allowances are linked to the correct payee. A different payee may exist for each allowance</li>
		<li>
Ensure any payments to an organisation are linked to the organisation record, rather than create a manual payment direction. See <a href="../payment-delivery/103-04010060-01.html">creating and updating organisation records</a></li>		</ul>
