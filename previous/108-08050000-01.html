<p>EdEP is payable to customers getting various income support payments who undertake approved study.</p>

<p>Eligibility for the EdEP differs between payments.</p>

<p>Customers paid any of the following payments may qualify for an EdEP&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Carer Payment (CP)</li>
		<li>
Disability Support Pension (DSP)</li>
		<li>
JobSeeker Payment (JSP)</li>

Parenting Payment single (PPS)</li>

<p>Austudy, Youth Allowance (YA) and ABSTUDY customers are not qualified for EdEP. However, if a customer was on an income support payment (which may not be their current payment) for at least 12 months before getting a student payment, they may be eligible for EdEP.</p>

<p>EdEP may still be paid during an <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010160-01.html">employment income nil rate period</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Widow Allowance and Partner Allowance attracted EdEP until 1 January 2022 when both payments ceased.</p>

<p>JSP and PPP customers may qualify for EdEP if they meet <strong>all</strong> of the following criteria&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
They start or intend to start an approved course, or are a continuing student</li>
		<li>
Before starting the course of education they&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
were in receipt of their current payment - JSP or PPP</li>
			<li>
were in receipt of an income support payment (which may not be their current payment) continuously for 12 months or more</li>		</ul>
		<li>
JSP customers&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
no longer qualify for JSP due to starting the course and get a student payment, or</li>
			<li>
have the course declared in their Points Based Activation System (<strong>PBAS</strong>) Dashboard</li>		</ul>
		<li>
PPP customers are doing a full-time or part-time course</li>
		<li>
They have not received EdEP in the last 12 months</li>
		</ul>
<p>From 01 July 2022 the New Employment Services Model (NESM) will no longer hold detailed activity information in Job Plans for JSP, PPP and SpB customers. Any self-declared study completed as part of their requirements may be found on the <strong>PBAS</strong> Dashboard in Process Direct. Proof of Enrolment (POE) may be required if further confirmation of study information is required to pay EdEP</p>

<p>Customers may also be eligible for EdEP if they have&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
received an income support payment for the last 12 months, or</li>
		<li>
transferred to a student payment to start an approved course of study</li>
		</ul>
<p>JSP customers who transfer to a student payment to start an approved course of study and who are eligible for EdEP do not need to supply POE. Instead, the claim for Austudy, YA or ABSTUDY can be accepted as a claim for EdEP.</p>

<p>For PPP customers, EdEP can be paid</p>
		<ul>		<li>
before the customer starts the course, or</li>
		<li>
while they are participating in the course</li>
		</ul>
<p>Customers who received an EdEP before 20 March 2020 because they were on JobSeeker Payment (formerly Newstart Allowance) or Wife Pension remain eligible for EdEP while studying the same course.</p>

<p>A separate claim for EdEP is <strong>not</strong> needed. Proof of enrolment (POE) in a course, inclusion of study in a Participation Plan, approved study recorded on the Activity and Exemption Summary (<strong>AEX</strong>) screen or a claim for a student payment can be taken as a claim for EdEP depending on the customer's circumstances.</p>

<p>POE is not needed from income support customers undertaking study as an approved requirement to meet their mutual obligation requirements. <a href="../job-seekers/001-09070020-01.html">Part-time or full-time study</a>, included in the customer's Participation Plan or <strong>PBAS</strong> declarations may provide enough information to grant EdEP. They must provide sufficient details to verify the person intends to enrol, or is enrolled in an approved course. These customers need payments issued manually.</p>

<p>If appropriate study details are not available, the customer must provide POE to Services Australia and request EdEP be paid.</p>

<p>Requests for payment of EdEP can be accepted up to 13 weeks before the course starts. However, details of the course cannot be entered into the system with a future start date, so coding cannot occur until the course start date.</p>

<p>If a claim for YA (student), Austudy, ABSTUDY or PES is submitted, this can be accepted as a claim for EdEP. In most circumstances, EdEP is paid when the claim is assessed. POE is not needed in these circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58; customers must not be paid EdEP until on or after the start date of the course and POE relevant to their circumstances is received where needed.</strong></p>

<p><strong>EdEP cannot be claimed once the customer has completed the course of study.</strong></p>

they enrol in a course late in 2020, and </li>
		<li>
continue in the same course in January 2021 and beyond </li>
		</ul>
<p>When this occurs, the grant letter shows both payments added together. This gives the impression the customer is granted $416 instead of $208. The actual payment is made as 2 separate payments&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
one payment in 2020, and </li>
		<li>
the other in 2021 </li>

<p>The customer is not entitled to get another EdEP payment until 2022, if the correct criteria are met. Given the extremely low number of reported cases, there are no plans to amend the grant letter in the near future.</p>

a period of employment, resulting in payments cancelling because income is too high</li>
