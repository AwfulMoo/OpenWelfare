<DIV class=showcont>
<P>When a serious failure is applied the CDP job seeker should be given the option of having the serious failure period waived by re-engaging with their provider. This option should also be offered when a CDP job seeker contacts during a serious failure period.</P>
<P>Messaging used by staff to discuss serious failure waiver provisions is an important part of implementing the compliance framework and reinforcing the intent of serious failures within the Job Seeker Compliance Model. Messaging must have a strong focus on ensuring the CDP job seeker is aware they have incurred a serious failure due to persistently not meeting their requirements and, in return for access to waiver provisions, they are committing to meeting their mutual obligation requirements and engaging with their provider.</P>
<P>If the CDP job seeker is seeking an Authorised Review Officer (ARO) or Administrative Appeal Tribunal (AAT) review of the serious failure decision, access to waiver provisions is not assessed until the outcome of the review is known. This is because applying a serious failure waiver will prevent or limit access to Payment Pending Review (PPR) provisions.</P>

<P>PST-skilled Service Officers (WNPPD) are responsible for deciding if a CDP job seeker has capacity to attend a waiver re-engagement appointment.</P>
<P>As a general rule, a CDP job seeker has capacity to if they do not have an exemption from mutual obligation requirements. If an exemption appears to be appropriate but it is yet to be granted, the CDP job seeker is assumed to have some capacity to attend a waiver re-engagement appointment until the exemption is granted.</P>

<P>Before a conditional waiver is recorded, confirm the CDP job seeker understands they are required to attend a re-engagement appointment.

<P>Generally, a serious failure period waiver applies from the later of the start of the serious failure period or the date the CDP job seeker contacted to request a waiver.</P>
<P>A waiver is only applied from an earlier date when:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the balance of the serious failure period has been reinstated due to non-attendance at the re-engagement appointment</LI>
<LI>the CDP job seeker was unable to attend the appointment or make prior contact due to an extreme event, and</LI>
<LI>the CDP job seeker contacted Services Australia as soon as possible after the event (generally within 2 working days of the CDP job seeker having capacity to contact)</LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>Definition of an extreme event</STRONG></P>
<P>An extreme event is an event which:</P>
<UL>
<LI>prevented the CDP job seeker from attending, for example, unexpected hospitalisation, or</LI>
<LI>is significant enough that it would be unreasonable for the CDP job seeker to attend, for example, the unexpected death of an immediate family member</LI></UL>

<P>Granting a serious failure waiver is a 2 part process where the CDP job seeker is required to:</P>

<LI>advise Services Australia they are willing to attend a waiver re-engagement appointment so the waiver can be recorded, and</LI>
<LI>attend the appointment with their provider</LI></UL>
<P>In most cases, when the CDP job seeker agrees to attend the appointment, their serious failure period should be conditionally waived pending their attendance.</P>
<P>However, if the CDP job seeker's provider confirms the job seeker has attended a re-engagement appointment for the relevant serious failure period/s, the serious failure period can be permanently waived. A re-engagement appointment must not be booked.</P>
<P>When a CDP job seeker has transferred to a jobactive or Disability Employment Services (DES) provider and they have requested a waiver, <STRONG>an appointment must not be booked</STRONG> and the serious failure must be permanently waived.</P>
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> it may take a number of hours for a change in address to trigger a transfer to a new provider. The transfer can be delayed if the record is locked by staff or customers.</P></DIV>

<P>When a conditional waiver is recorded, a re-engagement appointment must be booked. No more than 1 re-engagement appointment should ever be booked per waiver. This ensures the system takes the appropriate action to permanently waive the serious failure period if the CDP job seeker attends the appointment, or allows the serious failure period to be reinstated if the CDP job seeker does not attend the appointment.</P>
<P>To book the appointment select the <STRONG>Online Diary</STRONG> button on the <STRONG>Re-engagement</STRONG> page.</P>

<UL>
<LI>The Online Diary will automatically search for and display any available provider appointments within the next 2 working days</LI>
<LI>If a CDP job seeker is unable to attend an appointment within 2 working days, search for and book an appointment up to 28 days in the future using the '<STRONG>More appointments</STRONG>' button</LI>
