<p>For periods of entitlement before 1 January 2022, DFISA will be automatically recalculated when there is a change in certain circumstances affecting the rate of the customer's pension or benefit. This rate recalculation occurs on the Services Australia system.</p>

<p>When there is a DFISA rate change, the new amount(s) will be transmitted to DVA, where the customer's DFISA payments are adjusted and paid by DVA accordingly. DFISA is generally paid by DVA fortnightly on the DVA payday. DFISA adjustments can result in a debt or an arrears payment with DVA.</p>

<p>DFISA may still have been payable even if a customer's new income support rate was nil. If their DFISA rate was greater than zero, the customer would have been regarded as being current on their income support payment (CZR - Current Zero Rate) for the adjusted period.</p>

<p>Check the customer's record for a change of circumstances which has led to the rate change.</p>

<p>Screens to check initially are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>DFISA Summary (DFS)</strong></li>
			<ul>			<li>
The customer's rate of DFISA can be viewed on the <strong>DFS</strong> screen, and is shown as a daily rate</li>
			<li>
Multiple entries for the same date of effect may be present, with outdated entries deleted by new information</li>
			<li>
the <strong>DFS</strong> screen in Customer First allows Service Officers to identify which activity management reference number (AMR) caused the change to the DFISA rate for a particular date of effect</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Event Summary (ES)</strong></li>
			<ul>			<li>
Search for the relevant AMR on the <strong>ES</strong> screen, select and press <strong>Enter</strong></li>
			<li>
Type '<strong>Y</strong>' in the 'View all screens' box to view what changes were made within the activity that caused the DFISA rate change</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Document List (DL)</strong></li>
			<ul>			<li>
On the <strong>DL</strong> screen, check any relevant <strong>DOC</strong>s relating to the activity to find additional information regarding the cause of the DFISA rate change</li>

<p>If a customer was receiving a pension under the criteria for blindness that is income and assets test free, they were not eligible for DFISA, however their <strong>Adjusted Disability Pension (ADP)</strong> from DVA could still affect their partner's entitlement.</p>

<p>If the blind customer elected to receive Rent Assistance they then became income tested and DFISA may be payable. The amount of DFISA they were entitled to was affected by the DVA disability income rent test.</p>

<p>A retrospective grant of ADP may be received following the death of a Veteran. As the Centrelink system unlinks couples from date of death, ADP details will not be visible on the surviving partner. If the surviving partner’s rate of income support payment is reduced due to the retrospective grant of ADP, it is necessary to transmit new rates of DFISA to DVA for the surviving partner. The <strong>DFD</strong> screen allows coding of manual DFISA rates prior to 1 January 2022 when there is no ADP on the customer’s record as the ADP belongs to a previous partner. </p>

<p>For coding DFISA Manual Rate <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-03060000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Manual_calculat01_Step07">go to Step 7</a>.</p>

<p>To work out the DFISA rate, first calculate the maximum <a href="https&#58;//guides.dss.gov.au/social-security-guide/5/2">rate</a> payable to the customer, including Rent Assistance (RA), for the past entitlement period.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Check the Grandfathering Summary (<strong>GFS</strong>) screen to see whether the customer has moved from transitional rules to the current means test (new rate) for the past entitlement period. </li>
		<li>
pre-Income and Assets Tests direct deductions, such as New Enterprise Incentive Scheme (NEIS)/Self-Employment Allowance and most International Social Security Agreement payments</li>
		<li>
the ordinary income test. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> the taper is 40 cents in the dollar for pensions paid under transitional rules</li>
		<li>
the assets test (for pensions)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Pension customers will be paid under whichever test results in the lowest payment rate. </p>

<p>For <strong>pension customers paid under the Assets Test</strong>, DFISA was not payable as the Adjusted Disability Pension from DVA did not reduce the amount of income support payable. Procedure ends here.</p>

<p>For <strong>allowance customers or pensions customers paid under the Income Test</strong>, continue the calculation. Apply&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
any compensation direct deductions</li>
		<li>
proportional rate calculation if applicable</li>
		<li>
any New Zealand pension direct deduction</li>
		</ul>
<p>Add any additional payments the customer was qualified for and entitled to receive for example, Remote Area Allowance (RAA).</p>

<p>The notional rate is the rate which would be payable if the Adjusted Disability Pension from DVA was not included in the income test.</p>

<p>Calculate the maximum rate payable to the customer.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the customer receives Rent Assistance (RA), apply the DVA disability income rent test to the RA entitlement. This gives the notional RA amount. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-03060000-05.html">Resources</a> for an example of a notional RA calculation</li>
		<li>
Add the notional RA amount (if any) to the maximum rate</li>
		<li>
Apply any pre-Income and Assets Tests direct deductions, such as New Enterprise Incentive Scheme (NEIS)/Self-Employment Allowance and most International Social Security Agreement payments</li>
		<li>
Apply the ordinary income test with the Adjusted Disability Pension from DVA excluded. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> the taper is 40 cents in the dollar for pensions paid under transitional rules. This taper also applies if calculating notional rent assistance under transitional rules</li>
		<li>
Apply the assets test (for pensions)</li>
		</ul>
<p>The notional pension rate will be paid under whichever test results in the lowest payment rate. <strong>A</strong>lthough DFISA is not payable if the customer’s actual pension rate is paid under the Assets Test, it can be payable when the notional pension rate is paid under the Assets Test</p>

<p>Continue the notional rate calculation by applying&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
any compensation direct deductions</li>
		<li>
proportional rate calculation if applicable</li>

any New Zealand pension direct deduction</li>
		</ul>
<p>Add any additional payments the customer was qualified for and entitled to receive, for example Remote Area Allowance (RAA).</p>

<p>Where the customer was paid under transitional rules, repeat steps using the new rate to obtain two notional amounts for comparison.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when a customer's income precludes entitlement, their pension or benefit is normally rejected or cancelled. Before 1 January 2022, customers who are paid an Adjusted Disability Pension from DVA had a DFISA calculation done before this occurred. If the DFISA amount was greater than zero, the customer’s pension or benefit status was held as Current Zero Rate (CZR - DFISA). These customers were regarded as receiving the pension or benefit for which they qualify, and were entitled to the associated benefits and concessions relevant to their payment.</p>

<p>For the calculation of DFISA, all steps in the calculation of a customer’s rate must be mirrored in the notional rate calculation.</p>

<p>The exceptions to this are the notional partner excess income and notional Rent Assistance (RA) calculations.</p>

<p><strong>Notional partner excess income</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
If a customer’s fortnightly allowance is reduced by deductions of their partner’s excess income, and the partner also receives an Adjusted Disability Pension from DVA, the notional partner excess income must be included in the customer’s DFISA calculation</li>
		<li>
To obtain the notional partner excess income amount, the partner’s Adjusted Disability Pension from DVA is simply excluded from the calculation of partner excess income</li>
		<li>
This calculation does not include the partner’s Rent Assistance or the DVA disability income rent test</li>
		<li>
The notional partner excess income amount is included in the notional rate calculation for the customer, where it is applied as a direct deduction after the customer’s notional income test has been applied</li>
		<li>
If the customer receives RA, see below as a further step is required to obtain the customer’s notional rate</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Notional RA calculation for partner with excess income</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
The partner’s Adjusted Disability Pension from DVA excess income must be included in the calculation of notional RA for the customer</li>
		<li>
Partner Adjusted Disability Pension from DVA excess income is obtained by subtracting notional partner excess income from the actual partner excess income</li>
		<li>
The resulting amount is subtracted from the customer’s notional RA as a final step in the DVA disability income rent test</li>
		</ul>
<p>Once the final notional Rent Assistance amount has been calculated, the full notional calculation can be done for the customer.</p>

<p><strong>The full notional calculation for cases involving partner excess income is&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
add the partner’s notional RA to the customer’s maximum basic rate</li>
		<li>
apply the notional income test (by excluding the DVA Adjusted Disability Pension income)</li>
		<li>
deduct the notional partner excess income amount</li>
		</ul>
<p>The result will be the final notional entitlement.</p>

<p>The amount of DFISA payable will be Notional rate <strong>minus</strong> Actual rate.</p>

<p>Customers can receive loan payments each fortnight, up to the equivalent of 150% of the maximum pension rate.</p>

<p><strong>Impact of DFISA on fortnightly loan payments</strong></p>

<p>If a customer received DFISA before 1 January 2022, the maximum fortnightly loan rate payable through the Scheme was reduced by the amount of DFISA, as follows&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
(maximum pension rate x 1.5) minus DFISA = maximum loan rate per fortnight</li>
		</ul>
<p>The actual loan amount payable was the difference between the maximum loan rate and the total amount of actual pension and DFISA received.</p>

<p>For example, if a couple received&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
$20 DFISA per fortnight, and</li>
		<li>
the maximum Age Pension rate of $926.30 per fortnight</li>
		</ul>
<p>The maximum loan amount available to each member of the couple was $1,369.45 per fortnight based on&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
($926.30 x 1.5) - $20 = $1,369.45 per fortnight (maximum loan rate)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; these figures are an example only, and may not reflect the current maximum pension rate.</p>

<p>Once the Home Equity Access Scheme National team determined the potential loan rate payable, customers chose to get that amount or a lower loan amount.</p>

<p>Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment payments did not involve add-ons such as Rent Assistance (RA).

<p>In these instances, the primary payment of Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment was placed on a manual rate, requiring the calculation of a manual rate of DFISA-like payment. An MFU (keyword DFIDAF) was produced for the DVA Clearance Team to follow up.</p>

<p>The steps involved in calculating the primary payment are mirrored in the notional calculation.</p>

<p>When the claim was lodged, the partner on an income support payment (ISP) was offered the choice of&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
cancelling their ISP and allowing the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment customer to receive the full member of a couple rate for both partners, or</li>
		<li>
remaining on the ISP</li>
		</ul>
<p>Farmers whose partner was on an ISP were paid the member of a couple rate of JobSeeker Payment (JSP) and the difference between the Partner Allowance rate and ISP the partner was receiving. The farmer's Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment rate was increased by any shortfall the partner was experiencing due to remaining on the ISP.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the ISP partner received add-ons such as Rent Assistance (RA), these were not included in the rate calculation.</p>

<p>To calculate the actual rate&#58;</p>

<p><strong>Actual rate = partnered JSP plus (Partner Allowance (PA) - ISP)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the value of (PA - ISP) cannot be a negative.</p>

<p>After the actual rate was reached, this amount was coded on the Other Income Summary (<strong>OINS</strong>) screen for the partner.</p>

<p>To calculate the notional rate&#58;</p>

<p><strong>Notional rate = notional JSP plus (notional Partner Allowance - notional ISP)</strong></p>

<p>This notional ISP is not the same as the notional rate the system has already calculated for DFISA. The automatically calculated notional rate for ISP includes the add-ons and the DVA disability income rent test. This second notional ISP calculation is the rate that would be received if there was no RA and no rent test.</p>
