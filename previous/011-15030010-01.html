<p>The agency will accept payment of a recently expired notice of past benefits provided it&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
only expired within 28 days from the date the amount of compensation was fixed under a judgment or settlement, and</li>
		<li>
would otherwise have been valid (for example, relates to the date of injury and nature of illness/injury for which the compensation was paid)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where the agency has accepted such a payment, the s24(4) timeframe is not applied as the recently expired notice of past benefit is treated as a notice given during the preceding 6 months. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Where no valid <strong>notice of past benefits</strong> or completed <strong>section 23A statement</strong> has been received at the time of judgment or settlement, a <strong>notice to claimant</strong> is sent to the injured person or claimant. Do not send a notice to claimant if the agency accepted payment of a recently expired notice of past benefits. </p>

<p>When accepting a <strong>section 23A statement</strong>, the amount from any expired notice of past benefits relating to the claim, becomes the amount payable in the <strong>notice of charge</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Calculation of s33D due date for notice of charge- with no extension to return statement</strong></p>

<p>Under section 33D of HOSC Act, if an advance payment has been made, the date to issue a notice is 3 months from receiving the later of either&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
A complete and valid notice of judgment or settlement from the compensation payer, or</li>
		<li>
The advance payment</li>
		</ul>
<p>Under section 33D of HOSC Act, there are no amounts recoverable by the agency where&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
more than 3 months has passed since a complete <strong>notice of judgment or settlement</strong> or advance payment was received </li>
		<li>
no extension was granted, and </li>
		<li>
a <strong>notice of charge</strong> has not been issued</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the Section 33D date has passed, do not issue a Medicare history statement to the claimant/injured person, or notice of change to the compensation payer. Process within the system to issue a nil CP055M (z1931) to the claimant/injured person when the case is finalised.</p>

<p><strong>Calculation of s33D due date for notice of charge after an extension</strong></p>

<p>If an extension was granted to return a statement by claimant, the new 33D date is 28 days after the new statement return date <strong>if</strong>&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the new statement return date is <strong>after</strong> the original section 33D(1) date (3 months after the date of receipt of notice of judgment or settlement or advance payment, whichever is later)</li>
		</ul>
<p>For example, if the section 33D (1) date was 2 April 2020, but the extension to return the statement was granted until 10 April 2020, a notice of charge must be issued by 8 May 2020. That is, 28 days after the new statement return date.</p>

<p><strong>Calculation of s24 (4) due date for notice of charge</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Under section 24(4) of HOSC Act, where there has been no advance payment made&#58; </li>
			<ul>			<li>
the agency has a maximum of 3 months to issue a notice of charge to the compensation payer from the date a completed notice of judgment or settlement was received </li>		</ul>
		<li>
If the s24(4) date has passed and a notice of charge has not been issued&#58; </li>
			<ul>			<li>
there are no amounts recoverable by the agency</li>
			<li>

		<div class="block">

<p><strong>Percentage of apportionment</strong></p>

<p>Where the injured person contributed to their injury or illness (contributory negligence), a percentage of liability is set at judgment or settlement. This is known as an apportionment and it reduces the judgment or settlement amount.</p>

<p>The <strong>notice of charge</strong> is reduced by the percentage of apportionment attributed to the injured person. For example, if the injured person was apportioned 20% liability, the notice of charge amount would be reduced by 20%.</p>

<p><strong>Judgment fixes the amount to be paid and is less than the notice of charge</strong></p>

<p>Where the 'amount of past medical expenses' and/or the 'amount of past care costs' is fixed by a court at the time of judgment, this fixed amount becomes the amount payable to the agency. The agency cannot recover more than the total fixed compensation amount.</p>
