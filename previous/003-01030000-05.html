<p><strong>Employment income details</strong></p>

<p>This section only applies to customers who earn wages or salary from an employer. Make sure the customer gives details  for&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
employers they may have been working for at the time of the disaster and no longer work for (whether due to the disaster or other reasons), and</li>
		<li>
an employer they work for now but did not work for at the time of the disaster</li>
		</ul>
<p>Some questions below will not present, depending on the customer’s responses (for example, regular income, not expecting income).</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Employer’s details</strong></li>
			<ul>			<li>
name, address, ABN, telephone</li>
			<li>
type of work (seasonal, part-time, casual, full-time)</li>
			<li>
if income was impacted</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Gross fortnightly income</strong></li>
		<li>
<strong>Returned to work<br></strong>This refers to the customer returning to work after any period of not working as a direct result of the disaster</li>
		<li>
<strong>Planned leave<br></strong>This relates to the employer for which updates are being made, <strong>not </strong>‘any’ employer.<br>The 13 weeks referred to in this question is taken from the date the customer advised their income reduced</li>
		<li>
<strong>Gross fortnightly income<br></strong>Fortnightly (when prompted based on the customer’s responses)</li>
		<li>
<strong>Gross income before the event<br></strong>This refers to the 8 weeks just before the disaster event.<br>If the customer advised regular fortnightly income in the previous question, they will need to halve that amount and provide a weekly amount to record in each of the 8 weeks</li>
		<li>
<strong>Expected to earn during this period<br></strong>Thi<strong>s</strong> refers to the expected income for the 13 weeks from the date the customer’s income reduced<br>For example, if the customer earns the same amount each week, it would be weekly income x 13, or if the same amount each fortnight, fortnightly income x 6.5</li>
		<li>
<strong>Expected income if the disaster didn’t happen<br></strong>If the customer indicated they would not have expected to continue earning the same amount had the disaster not occurred (this could be due to an expected wage increase or reduction), the expected income to be used is for the <strong>13 weeks</strong> from the date their income reduced. They will also need to explain why their income would have differed and provide evidence. For example, expecting a promotion or an existing plan to reduce to part-time hours</li>		</ul>

<p><strong>Income as an employee of a Trust or Company</strong></p>

<p>This question refers to customers who are a shareholder or beneficiary of a company or trust, and are paid wages for remunerative work as an employee of that company or trust.</p>

<p>If the customer only receives directors fees or dividends from a trust or company, select <strong>Next</strong> to go to the next question.</p>

<p>Some questions below will not present, depending on the customer’s responses&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Company or Trust details</strong><br>Name, ABN, telephone, ownership percentage, date business</li>
		<li>
<strong>Paid as an employee?</strong></li>
			<ul>			<li>
If <strong>yes</strong>, they will need to confirm if they declare the income paid in the tax return and if the company will declare their income as an employee in their tax return</li>
			<li>
If <strong>no</strong>, the ACC will go to the <strong>Continue and save</strong> section of the question set</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Gross fortnightly income</strong><br>Ask the customer to state their usual fortnightly gross income. Tell them they will need to provide a history of income if income has reduced</li>
		<li>
<strong>Gross income pre-disaster</strong><br>The gross income in the <strong>4 weeks</strong> just before the disaster (note it only asks for 4 weeks, not 8 weeks). Clarify with the customer if their wage was the same for the 8 weeks and allow only 4 weeks to be provided if it was the same for the 8 weeks<br>If a customer advised regular fortnightly income in the previous question, this can be halved and recorded in each of the 4 weeks. Customers can provide income for a period other than the 4 weeks. This may be helpful to show a history of income if they work seasonally for the company/trust</li>
		<li>
<strong>Expected income post-disaster<br></strong>This is the expected income for the <strong>13 weeks</strong> from the date the customer's income reduced</li>
		<li>
<strong>Expected income if the disaster didn’t happen</strong><br>If the customer indicated they would not have expected to continue earning the same amount had the disaster not occurred (this could be due to an expected increase or reduction), the expected income to be used is for the <strong>13 weeks</strong> from the date their income reduced.

<p><strong>Income Protection Insurance</strong></p>

Payments have started, or</li>
		<li>
Payments have not started</li>
		</ul>
<p>Ask the customer to provide details of the start date, period of payments and payment amounts.

<p><strong>Interest in real estate (in or outside Australia)</strong></p>

<p>Tell the customer they need to advise whether they own or partly own any property inside or outside Australia.</p>

<p>Then ask the customer if they receive any income from&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
those properties. Income includes rental income, non-rental income (for example, from horse agistment fees, hobby farming), or</li>
		<li>
the property they live in if they own or partly own it (for example, Airbnb, renting a granny flat to a non-family member)</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer does not receive income, the claim will go to the next question.</p>

<p>If the customer does receive income from properties they own or partly own, they will need to provide relevant details.</p>

<p>Although the following details are requested, tell the customer the information they provide will not be used for any purpose other than this claim. Pending system enhancements, details requested (but not relevant) include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Type of property</li>
		<li>
Property value</li>
		<li>
Building summary</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Property ownership</strong></p>

<p>Although it asks for property ownership, the only drop down option is ‘you’. This is because only the customer’s interest can affect eligibility.</p>

<p><strong>Property financials</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Rental income<br>Amount and frequency. If only rented on holidays the number of weeks rented will be prompted</li>
		<li>
Non-rental income<br>Source (for example, horse agistment, hobby farming, animal boarding); amount and frequency of income</li>
		<li>
Issues that affect the property<br>The response should be ‘no’, unless the property was within a declared disaster area and income has reduced as a direct result of the disaster</li>
		</ul>
<p>Ask the customer if their rental/non-rental income reduced as a direct result of the disaster.</p>

<p>If the income has reduced as a result of the disaster&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Ask the customer for their income</li>

in the 8 weeks before the disaster, and</li>

for the 13 weeks from the date of the disaster/date income reduced</li>		</ul>

<p><strong>Other income circumstance</strong></p>

<p>As all income (except for excluded income) is used to compare the customer’s income to the AWOTE, they will need to provide details of all their investments and other income.</p>

<p>They only need to advise income in which they have a share. If investments are in their partner’s name only, they do not need to provide details</p>

<p><strong>Investments </strong>include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
share details</li>
		<li>
Managed Investments</li>
		<li>
Income Stream products in Australia</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Other income</strong> includes&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Overseas income</li>
		<li>
Any other income - a list displays to prompt the customer</li>
		</ul>
<p>Ask the customer if there has been a change in their investment or other income as a direct result of the disaster. In most cases, there would be no change. For example, if there was a reduction in share value as result of the disaster, this would be an indirect impact and therefore not counted as a loss of income.</p>

<p>If the income has reduced as a result of the disaster&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Ask the customer for their rental income</li>
			<ul>			<li>
in the 8 weeks before the disaster, and</li>
			<li>
for the 13 weeks from the date of the disaster/date income reduced</li>		</ul>
