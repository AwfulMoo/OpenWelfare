<p><strong>Date of birth (DOB)</strong></p>

<p>A recipient's/claimant's DOB must be supplied.</p>

<p><strong>Identity Confirmation</strong></p>

<p>ABSTUDY claimants are subject to <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-09010000-01.html">Identity Confirmation</a>. A claimant may need to confirm their identity when the Service Officer is accepting the Additional Information Form (SY023).</p>

<p><strong>Aboriginality</strong></p>

<p>For ABSTUDY, an Australian Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander is someone who&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
is of Australian Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent, and</li>
		<li>
identifies themselves as an Australian Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, and</li>
		<li>
is accepted as such by the community in which they live</li>
		</ul>
<p>Normally, the declaration on the claim form will suffice, however where doubt exists, the claimant will need to provide evidence of their Aboriginality or Torres Strait Islander status. See <a target="_blank" href="../students-and-trainees/010-02030030-01.html">Aboriginality or Torres Strait Islander status for ABSTUDY purposes</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Born overseas</strong></p>

<p>Claimants born overseas may still qualify for ABSTUDY if they are an Australian citizen.</p>

<p>Proof of citizenship is required for claims by new claimants if such proof has not previously been provided to Services Australia. Acceptable proof may be provided by way of&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
original birth certificate or extract</li>
		<li>
passport, or</li>
		<li>
citizenship certificate</li>
		</ul>
<p>The Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Period (NARWP) does not apply to ABSTUDY.</p>

<p><strong>Other Commonwealth government assistance</strong></p>

<p>ABSTUDY is generally not payable to claimants who are already in receipt of other <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-02030040-01.html">Commonwealth government assistance</a> such as a Commonwealth government education scheme or Department of Social Services Living Away from Home Allowance.</p>

<p>Youth Allowance and JobSeeker Payment (JSP) customers studying part-time can receive ABSTUDY part-time entitlements providing that this study does not make up part or all of their Mutual Obligation Requirements for their income support payment.</p>

<p><strong>Payment of ABSTUDY</strong></p>

<p>ABSTUDY payments are made via direct credit into the claimant's account held at a bank, credit union or building society. Exemptions may be granted under certain circumstances.</p>

<p>The payee can vary. If the claimant&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>

<p><strong>Claimant income</strong></p>

<p>All assessable ABSTUDY customer income is taken into account for applicants claiming ABSTUDY.</p>

<p>Claimants may subtract any maintenance expenditure from their estimated income.</p>

<p><strong>Scholarship or education assistance</strong></p>

<p>All income received from a scholarship, bursary or education assistance is to be included.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> specific processing requirements exist for recipients of a Commonwealth Scholarship including Commonwealth Education Cost Scholarship (CECS), Commonwealth Accommodation Scholarship (CAS) and Indigenous Access Scholarship (IAS). For more information, see <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-07030070-01.html">Assessing scholarship income</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Assets</strong></p>

<p>All assessable ABSTUDY customer assets are taken into account for applicants claiming ABSTUDY.</p>

<p>Claimants should not include their principal family home and any surrounding land of two hectares or less.</p>

<p>The current market value of the asset is used to determine its value. Replacement or insured values cannot be used to determine the market value of an asset.</p>

<p><strong>Additional income or assets</strong></p>

<p>If the claimant earns any income from other sources or owns assets not covered in the Assets section of the form, issue an Additional Income and Assets module (Mod IA).</p>

<p><strong>Proof of enrolment for students</strong></p>

<p>Students wishing to claim ABSTUDY must provide acceptable proof of enrolment within 14 days of commencing study. School students, or a student undertaking a Higher Education course at university, are not required to provide proof of enrolment.</p>

<p><strong>Studying by distance education or correspondence</strong></p>

<p>Students participating in a full-time course that does not have an attendance requirement, such as distance education, mixed mode or competency based training must provide proof of their study load.</p>

<p>Proof of study load may be evidenced by a timetable that outlines the due dates of assignments and modules that must be completed.</p>

<p>Full-time courses that attract a Student Contribution do not need to be evidenced by a timetable.</p>

<p><strong>Study load concessions</strong></p>

<p>For ABSTUDY, a student is considered to be a full-time student if they are enrolled in and undertaking at least 75% of the accredited full-time study load for the tertiary or secondary not at school students (e.g. studying year 11 at a TAFE college). A secondary or college student is considered full-time provided they are studying what the school considers a full-time study load.</p>

<p>A student may also be considered full-time for ABSTUDY purposes if they qualify for a study load concession. For more information on study load concessions, see <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-02080000-01.html">Study requirements - ABSTUDY</a>.</p>

<p>If the student is unable to identify their study load, they will need to provide a full list of their subjects.</p>

<p><strong>Limits on assistance for certificate courses</strong></p>

<p>ABSTUDY is payable for a total of 4 years study in any combination of Statement of Attainment, certificate Level 1 or certificate Level 2 courses.</p>

<p>This is a retrospective assessment; therefore, study at either of these levels during the previous 10 years is taken into account.</p>

<p><strong>Limits on assistance for undergraduate Bachelor Degrees</strong></p>

<p>ABSTUDY is usually payable for one undergraduate Bachelor degree (including Honours, Masters qualifying year/s, combined degrees and/or prerequisite studies).</p>

<p><strong>Reasonable time to complete a course</strong></p>

<p>Where a student is undertaking a course of study, students are allowed a reasonable time to complete their course.</p>

<p>Students may be approved for ABSTUDY for up to one extra year if they have been impeded by physical, psychiatric or intellectual disability or other circumstances beyond their control, and the education institution recommends that the student continues the course, and indicates that the student is expected to complete the course in this year.</p>

<p><strong>Australian Apprenticeship details</strong></p>

<p>The claimant needs to advise details of their Australian Apprenticeship (apprentice or trainee), including&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
date Australian Apprenticeship started</li>
		<li>
expected End date of Australian Apprenticeship</li>
		<li>
full time or part time</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Services Australia will obtain the Australian Apprenticeship details from the Department of Education, Skills and Employment.</p>

<p>This means it is not essential for the claimant to advise this information on the claim.</p>

<p><strong>Living away from home to study</strong></p>

<p>For ABSTUDY, living away from home means that the claimant is not living at the permanent family home. This can include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
boarding in another person's home</li>
		<li>
boarding at a hostel or residential college</li>
		<li>

<p><strong>Students receiving a social security pension or benefit</strong></p>

<p>Students who are studying a full-time course, which is less than 12 months in duration, may choose to remain on JobSeeker Payment, Youth Allowance or Austudy or transfer to ABSTUDY.</p>

<p>Students in receipt of a social security pension or benefit, or full DVA pension, may qualify for a study load concession.</p>

<p><strong>Determining independence</strong></p>

<p>The criteria listed with regard to independent status are used to determine the claimant's eligibility for <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-02040000-01.html">independence for ABSTUDY claimants</a>.</p>

<p>Where a claimant does not meet any of these criteria, the parental means test is to be applied, regardless of receiving parental support or not.</p>

<p>Claimants who are under 18, have reached minimum school leaving age, and are applying under the Unreasonable to Live at Home (UTLAH) criteria, will also require an appointment with a Services Australia social worker.</p>

<p><strong>Relocation Scholarship</strong></p>

<p>Tertiary students claiming independence as they are disadvantaged by personal circumstances will be required to provide their address 6 months prior to commencing their course. This information is required to calculate their entitlement for Relocation Scholarship. See <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-07030020-01.html">Relocation Scholarship (RS) eligibility</a>.</p>
