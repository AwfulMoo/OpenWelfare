<p>The penalty is 10% of the difference between the liability that has applied for the period, and the amount that should have applied, based on the reconciliation amount.</p>

<p>Child Support has the discretion to remit estimate penalties under certain circumstances. This includes where the penalties have been paid.</p>

<p>Check the estimate penalty amount. If it appears there is an error with the estimate penalty calculation escalate to a Service Support Officer.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the customer may request Child Support remit their estimate penalties. This request does not need to be in writing. It may also be determined that it is appropriate to remit estimate penalties without a customer request.</p>

<p>Child Support will consider remitting estimate penalties if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the difference between the customer's adjusted taxable income and the estimated income was due to an amendment of the tax legislation, or a change to a ruling or determination under the tax legislation. For more information, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-04290000-04.html#bp04_L2LL_Policy">References</a> for link to The Child Support Guide 2.5.1&#58; Income estimates for a year of income</li>

		<ul>		<li>
satisfied that it would be <strong>fair and reasonable</strong> to do so</li>
		</ul>
<p>The decision-making process for remitting penalties is the same for all cases, including penalties that have been paid.</p>

<p>Before starting any process to remit estimate penalties, check&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
any previous remission or re-imposition notepads</li>
		<li>
if the penalty has already been remitted in part or in full</li>
		<li>
if any part of the penalty has been remitted and then re-imposed</li>
		</ul>
<p>Penalties remitted in error, can be re-imposed in full or in part. </p>

<p>Contact the customer to tell them of the change and the reason for the change. <br>See <a href="../separated-parents/277-01010000-01.html">Contact with Child Support customers</a> and <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-30010470-01.html">Penalties Cuba Process Help</a> for more information.</p>

<p><strong>Fair and reasonable</strong></p>

<p>Whether it is fair and reasonable to remit estimate penalties is determined on a case by case basis. Determine if the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
intended to provide an inaccurate estimate</li>
		<li>
can provide a reasonable explanation as to why the estimate was inaccurate</li>
		<li>
can provide a reasonable explanation for failing to notify of any changes to their income</li>

was aware of all the conditions and implications of an estimate</li>

Cuba limitations have caused the accidental collection of penalties (where it is likely that LPP would have been remitted). For example, where an employer withholding with arrears (EWA) agreement has been ongoing and the last of the overdue child support payments is about to be paid.

<p>Paid LPP can only be remitted in a limited number of circumstances.</p>

<p>When making a decision to remit paid late payment penalty amounts&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
consider the circumstances that lead to the inadvertent payment/collection of LPP </li>
		<li>
be guided by the examples below, and</li>
		<li>
<strong>make sure</strong>&#58; </li>
			<ul>			<li>
the paying parent agreed to (and complied with) an arrangement to pay and</li>
			<li>
there was a commitment to remit late payment penalties made by Services Australia</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>For further information, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-04290000-04.html#bp04_L2LL_Policy">References</a> for a link to the Child Support Guide 5.1.6&#58; Late payment penalties.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>

<p>Collection activity occurred in 2013, which recovered the payer's overdue child support and LPPs in full. LPPs again accrued following several missed payments in 2016. The payer entered into a payment arrangement and cleared the arrears in 3 instalments. The Service Officer decides to remit the balance of LPPs. It <strong>would not</strong> be appropriate to remit the LPPs paid in 2013 because at the time these were paid, the payer's circumstances did not satisfy the criteria to remit.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>

<p>A commitment was made to remit LPPs as part of a payment arrangement. A reduction in liability resulted in the next instalment amount paying the LPPs. As a commitment to remit the penalties was in place, it <strong>would</strong> be appropriate to remit the portion of LPPs recovered by the instalment paid.</p>

<p><strong>Example 3</strong></p>

<p>A commitment was made to remit LPPs as part of a payment arrangement. The customer lodged their tax return which paid all of their outstanding arrears as well as some of the LPPs. Although the arrears were paid via TRIP, it <strong>would </strong>be appropriate to remit the paid LPPs as the customer has fulfilled their commitment to pay by lodging their tax return.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> remitting paid penalties draws funds from consolidated revenue. The requirements for remitting must be met otherwise this will not be an authorised use of consolidated revenue.</p>

<p>Remitting any paid LPP will create excess cash credits on the account. Seek technical advice before taking any action if this is not the appropriate outcome. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-09140000-01.html">Technical support in Child Support</a>.</p>

<p>Cancelling penalties is a manual process to correct LPP that have been applied to a maintenance balance that has subsequently reduced. This may be due to a retrospective variation, resulting in a reduction of the liability.</p>

<p>Cuba does not automatically reduce LPP when child support liabilities are reduced. If LPP has accrued against a child support liability that is no longer payable (for example, if a variation reduces the overdue child support) then the penalties are to be cancelled (not remitted).</p>

<p>It may be appropriate to combine the cancellation of some LPP with the remission of other LPP.</p>

<p>This excludes LPP that have accrued on the debt that is <strong>still payable</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> do not cancel LPP if the payee discharges the arrears on a case. If the LPP have been applied correctly, these can be considered for <a href="../separated-parents/277-04290000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Remitting_Late_Step01">remission</a>.</p>

<p>Investigate the customers account summary to determine if any retrospective variations have reduced the maintenance arrears.</p>

<p>In the <strong>Payer Account Balances</strong> section in the Collection Summary window&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
search for any periods that have a <strong>LIA - Reduce Maintenance</strong> posting with a Credit applying to the account</li>
		<li>
expand the posting and note the periods the reduction has applied</li>
		<li>
note the amount of the reduction for the period</li>
		<li>
determine the amounts of the maintenance debt and the LPP amount on the date prior to the variation. This can be found in the Find Client Postings (Payer Maintenance Liability) window</li>
		<li>
note the current maintenance debt and LPP</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if multiple reductions have occurred to the maintenance debt over a period of time, start with the earliest reduction period. Take note of the maintenance debt and LPP balances on the date prior to the next period of variation. This will assist in calculation (if required) for these periods.</p>

<p><strong>Debt no longer due and payable</strong></p>

<p>If the total debt is no longer due and payable (due to a retrospective variation) all penalties should be cancelled.</p>

<p><strong>LPP applied to the debt</strong></p>

<p>LPP is calculated on child support debts over $1,000 in the month following the due date of liability. If a variation or full payment of the debt occurred prior to the LPP accrual date, then no LPP have accrued on the variation and therefore do not need to be cancelled.</p>

<p>Check for payments made after the LPP have applied (including payments to Child Support or directly to the receiving parent, which has been applied as NAPs). If some LPP have been paid, it still may be appropriate to cancel them in full.</p>

<p><strong>Prior cancellation/remission</strong></p>

<p>Investigate the case to establish whether any or all of the penalties that have accrued during the variation period(s) have already been remitted or cancelled. Check the&#58;</p>

<p>Manually calculate the amount of LPP to cancel using the information identified in <a href="../separated-parents/277-04290000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Cancelling_late_Step02">Step 2</a>.</p>

<p>Use the LPP cancellation calculator within the <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/elements/macros/RemittingPenalties.html">Remitting and cancelling penalties</a> macro to calculate the amount to be cancelled.</p>

<p>This calculation may consist of 2 components&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the calculation of the actual amount of LPP to cancel based on the variation, and</li>
		<li>
the potential for a further reduction of LPP, based on how long the account was incorrect</li>
		</ul>
<p>For a time factor cancellation, we need to consider the amount of time the debt has been on the case. An additional 5% - 20% of LPPs may be further cancelled as LPPs accrue on a compound basis.</p>

<p>There is no defined rule on which percentage to apply for which time period, but as a guide you may apply&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Short term under 1 year on case – 5%</li>
		<li>
Mid-term  1-2 years -10%</li>
		<li>
Longer term 2-5 year 15%</li>
		<li>
Over 5 years – 20%</li>
		</ul>
<p>The exact amount to cancel is a matter for careful judgement, this must always be done in consultation with your Service Support Officer.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a time factor amount is to be considered for multiple periods of reduction, the time period will be from the date the variation occurred to the day prior to the next period of variation.</p>

<p><strong>Example&#58;</strong> the payer has LPP of $3,000. The Service Officer is an SO3 and is authorised to cancel LPPs of amounts up to $2,000. SO3 has made the decision to cancel $880 of the LPPs after a variation to the assessment reduces the payer’s child support arrears by 30%. SO3 may cancel $880 of the LPP as this amount is within the SO3's authorisation level.</p>
