<p>ParentsNext is a pre-employment program for Parenting Payment (PP) (single and partnered) customers with children under 6 years of age. This may include grandparents or foster parents receiving PP. The program focuses on offering individual support and referrals to services that can help customers to plan and prepare for work or connect to the workforce when their youngest child turns 6.</p>

<p>ParentsNext participants are not required to look for or take up work. The aim is to encourage customers to think about their future work and study related goals and to support them in achieving these goals by connecting them with appropriate services in their local community. The program offers individualised support that can include assistance to access secure housing, financial advice, parenting courses, childcare, transport, further study, training or volunteering.</p>

<p>Customers selected for ParentsNext must attend an initial appointment with Services Australia and will be referred to a ParentsNext provider if they are eligible. Customers selected for ParentsNext will be automatically placed on 2 weekly (fortnightly) reporting from their date of selection.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_ParentsNext_his">ParentsNext history</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>ParentsNext has operated since April 2016 with the first model limited to 10 Local Government Areas (LGA).</p>

<p>From July 2018 ParentsNext operated nationally, in all non-remote areas of Australia in two streams. The Intensive stream was delivered in 30 locations (67 LGAs) and the Targeted stream encompassed all other non-remote Employment Regions nationally. There was different eligibility criteria between the two streams resulting in customer's being required to participate at different stages depending on their circumstances and the age of their youngest PP child.</p>

<p>From July 2021, the ParentsNext program was enhanced so that eligibility criteria is applied consistently across Australia removing the need for the Targeted and Intensive streams. This ensures customers are selected for ParentsNext and receive assistance based on their vulnerabilities and not their location.</p>

<div class="twisty">
	
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Eligibility_and"></a>
<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Eligibility_and">Eligibility and selection</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Selection for ParentsNext is automatically determined by the system based on the information contained on the customer's record at the time of the eligibility assessment. A customer's reason for selection into ParentsNext is displayed on the ParentsNext Summary page within Customer First.</p>

<p><strong>Base selection eligibility criteria</strong></p>

<p>Customers meet the base selection eligibility criteria if they meet the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
They have been receiving Parenting Payment (PP) (Partnered or Single) for 6 months continuously</li>
		<li>
They are aged between 15 and under 54 years and 6 months of age, and</li>
		<li>
They have a youngest PP child aged 9 months to 5 years and 6 months</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> The selection rules differ to the exit rules. A customer will only be selected for ParentsNext if their youngest PP child is aged under 5 years 6 months old. Once a customer is selected for ParentsNext they are required to participate until they turn 55 years of age and/or their youngest PP child turns 6 years of age.</p>

<p><strong>Additional selection criteria</strong></p>

<p>Customer's must meet <strong>one</strong> of the following additional selection criteria to be selected for the program and booked an appointment with the agency&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Early School Leaver</strong> - they are under 22 and haven't completed Year 12 or an equivalent qualification or higher</li>
		<li>
<strong>2 Years on ISP</strong> - they are 22 or over, haven't completed Year 12 or an equivalent qualification or higher and have been getting income support continuously for between 2 and 4 years</li>
		<li>
<strong>4 Years on ISP</strong> - they are 22 or over and have been getting income support continuously for more than 4 years</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> The system calculates if the customer has been in receipt of payment continuously for two or four years based on the <a href="https&#58;//guides.dss.gov.au/social-security-guide/1/1/n/130">Notional continuous period of receipt of income support payments</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Ongoing eligibility for ParentsNext</strong></p>

<p>Once a customer has been selected as a compulsory ParentsNext participant they may remain eligible for the program even where a change of circumstances means they no longer meet the initial selection criteria. For example, if after selection they commence declaring income or commence study, they will not necessarily be exited.</p>

<p>For further information, see <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-18041800-01.html">ParentsNext exits and exemptions</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Exclusion criteria</strong></p>

<p>A customer may meet the base selection eligibility criteria however they won't be selected for ParentsNext if any of the following apply&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
They live in a Community Development Program (CDP) region or Norfolk Island</li>
		<li>
They are in receipt of Pensioner Education Supplement (PES)</li>
		<li>
They have reported employment income or hours in the last six months</li>
		<li>
They are taking part in Disability Employment Services (DES)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Customers may be selected for ParentsNext but they won't need to participate if they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Are currently studying and the study meets the minimum ParentsNext study requirements</li>
		<li>
Have completed Year 12 or an equivalent qualification or higher and have been getting income support for less than 4 years</li>
		<li>
Are on maternity/paternity leave</li>
		<li>
Are on leave and have a job to return to</li>
		</ul>
<p>Customers will need to provide evidence that these events commenced or occurred before selection into ParentsNext, in order to be exited from the program. For further information, see <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-03160000-01.html">ParentsNext appointments and Processing</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Child 5 years and 6 months</strong></p>

<p>If a customer's youngest PP child is 5 years and 6 months or older <strong>at the time</strong> of the initial ParentsNext system eligibility assessment, they <strong>will not</strong> be selected for ParentsNext due to their impending mutual obligation requirements.</p>

<p>Where a customer is selected for ParentsNext <strong>before</strong> their youngest child turns 5 years and 6 months of age but their ParentsNext appointment with the agency is <strong>after</strong> the child turns 5 years and 6 months they must still be referred to a provider, if they meet the other selection criteria.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Impact_of_retro">Impact of retrospective updates on eligibility</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>ParentsNext eligibility is based on information on the customer's record at the time of the eligibility assessment. For example, the age of the youngest PP child, whether the customer is currently studying, or whether the customer has completed Year 12 or an equivalent qualification. Incorrect or out of date information may affect this assessment, resulting in the customer being selected as eligible, when they otherwise would not be or they may have been selected for a different reason.</p>

<p>In these cases, the customer's record must be updated with the correct information to trigger a reassessment of eligibility. Depending on the customer's circumstances they may be either automatically exited or selected for a different reason.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p><strong>Employment income</strong></p>

<p>If a compulsory ParentsNext participant commences employment or first declares income <strong>after </strong>their selection date for ParentsNext or first advises of employment details at their Services Australia appointment, Service Officers must still refer them to a ParentsNext provider where they otherwise remain eligible. This is because the customer met the compulsory participation criteria at the time of their selection, and the agency does not have the delegation to exit a ParentsNext participant due to earnings. The ParentsNext provider will discuss the customer's circumstances and determine whether it is appropriate to exit them due to 'stabilised and ongoing' earnings or whether it will be included as an activity in their participation plan.</p>

<p><strong>Self-employment</strong></p>

<p>Where a ParentsNext participant is self-employed, the business must be profitable for the income to be taken into account in the ParentsNext eligibility assessment process. If the business is running at a loss, it is not considered to be making income and the customer may be selected for ParentsNext.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p><strong>Transient address</strong></p>

<p>Eligibility assessments for ParentsNext are based on the address that is recorded as the customer 's current home address at the time the assessment occurs, including the suburb where the address is recorded as 'no fixed address' due to transient accommodation.</p>

<p>Where a ParentsNext participant advises they have no fixed address due to transient accommodation they must be advised they are still required to participate in the program. They will be referred to a ParentsNext provider based on their current address at that time and it will be their responsibility to contact their provider to discuss their circumstances to determine how best their provider appointments can be managed.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> this does not include where a customer advises they are homeless. In this scenario the Service Officer must determine if it is appropriate to grant an exemption. For further information, see <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-18041800-01.html">ParentsNext exits and exemptions</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Temporary address</strong></p>

<p>Where a customer has a temporary address recorded, and the address is recorded for&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
13 weeks or more, the system will determine ParentsNext eligibility based on the temporary address and present ParentsNext providers within the online diary based on the temporary address</li>
		<li>
Less than 13 weeks, the system will determine ParentsNext eligibility based on the home address (not the temporary address) and will present providers within the online diary based on the home address</li>
		</ul>
<p>The Services Australia initial ParentsNext appointment must still be conducted if a customer is residing in a temporary location and a referral (where appropriate) to a ParentsNext provider for an initial appointment made. The customer can contact the provider to discuss whether the appointment can be conducted via phone. At the initial provider appointment the customer can discuss circumstances and options for receiving ParentsNext servicing whilst they reside in the temporary location.</p>

<p>Eligibility and selection assessments for ParentsNext are based only on the children recorded in care of the Parenting Payment (PP) customer. Where a family unit has separate care arrangements for different children, that is, younger children are recorded as being in the care of the PP customer's partner, those children will not be taken into account for ParentsNext eligibility purposes. In this scenario, unless the customer advises they wish to change care arrangements they are required to participate in ParentsNext.</p>

<p>Customers selected for ParentsNext must&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
attend an initial appointment with the agency to confirm their eligibility and, where eligible, be referred to a ParentsNext provider</li>
		</ul>
<p>Compulsory ParentsNext participants must then&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
attend all scheduled appointments with their ParentsNext provider and behave in an appropriate manner at these appointments</li>
		<li>
sign a ParentsNext Participation Plan containing at least 1 compulsory activity tailored to the individual to address any vocational and non-vocational barriers</li>
		<li>
participate in and report to their provider on the compulsory ParentsNext activity/activities as detailed in their Participation Plan, and</li>

report to the agency every 2 weeks, unless they are on 12 weekly reporting due to a long term <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-18041800-01.html">exemption</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>Customers who do not attend their ParentsNext appointment with the agency may have their <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-03160010-01.html">Parenting Payment (PP) suspended</a>. If a customer does not agree to attend an appointment within 13 weeks of payment suspension, their payment will be automatically cancelled. The customer must lodge a new claim if they still require income support assistance. See <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-03160010-01.html">ParentsNext suspension and restoration</a>.</p>

<p>A compulsory ParentsNext participant who does not attend an appointment with their ParentsNext provider or comply with their participation requirements may be subject to compliance action under the <a href="../job-seekers/001-18030202-01.html">Targeted Compliance Framework</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; any enquiries relating to the Targeted Compliance Framework for ParentsNext participants must be directed to the Level 2 Compliance and Participation Helpdesk.

<p><strong>Two weekly (fortnightly) reporting</strong></p>

<p>Customers selected for ParentsNext will be automatically placed on mandatory two weekly (fortnightly) reporting from their date of selection.</p>

<p>Where ParentsNext participants are profiled as two weekly reporters they must report fortnightly regardless of nil income, stabilised income or a current exemption.</p>

<p>Where a customer's Parenting Payment (PP) is cancelled for failing to report (FRP) they will exit from ParentsNext as they no longer meet the base eligibility criteria. If their PP is subsequently restored, they will be reassessed for ParentsNext at that time and if eligible, they will be reselected.</p>

<p><strong>Twelve weekly reporting</strong></p>

<p>Where a ParentsNext participant is granted a long term exemption, they will be automatically assessed for eligibility for variable, 12 weekly reporting. If the customer or their partner (where partnered) are declaring income when the long term exemption is granted or commence declaring income during the exemption period or have a current debt, they will remain on or reverted to two weekly (fortnightly) reporting.</p>

<p><strong>ParentsNext appointments with Services Australia</strong></p>

<p>Parenting Payment (PP) customers who are selected for ParentsNext are required to undertake an appointment with the agency. Where the customer has a phone contact number recorded, the appointment will be undertaken by phone. If there is no contact phone number on the customer's record, the appointment is undertaken at the customer's local service centre.</p>

<p><strong>Rescheduling ParentsNext appointments with Services Australia</strong></p>

<p><img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> Customers are able, and should be advised where appropriate, to reschedule any appointment type via their online account. Customers are able to reschedule via their online account if they are requesting a new appointment within 2 days of their original appointment. If the customer is unable to attend another appointment within 2 days, they will need to contact the agency to have their appointment rescheduled.</p>

<p>Service Officers are only able to reschedule ParentsNext appointments up to a maximum of two times, this is inclusive of where a customer has already rescheduled their appointment online. Once a customer has already rescheduled on two previous occasions, they must be advised they are required to attend their next appointment or their PP will be suspended.</p>

<p>Care must be taken when rescheduling ParentsNext appointments to avoid customers from continually rescheduling without eventually being seen by Services Australia. See <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-03160010-01.html">ParentsNext suspension and restoration</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; appointments can only be rescheduled up to the scheduled date and time of the original appointment. After that point, the original appointment must be recorded as 'did not attend' and a new appointment booked.</p>

<p>Eligible customers can choose to participate voluntarily in ParentsNext if they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
do not meet the criteria for compulsory participation</li>
		<li>
do not live in a CDP region or Norfolk Island</li>
		<li>
are in receipt of Parenting Payment, and</li>
		<li>
have a child aged under 6 years (there is no minimum child age for voluntary participation)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where a customer is eligible for voluntary participation, the <strong>Volunteer</strong> guided procedure will be enabled on the ParentsNext Summary page. If the <strong>Volunteer </strong>guided procedure is not enabled, the customer is not eligible to voluntarily participate.</p>

<p>As a customer can choose to voluntarily participate before their youngest child is 9 months of age, there may be instances where the Customer Summary page displays the message 'Never been a ParentsNext participant' and the ParentsNext Summary page will be blank. As the customer has not yet been automatically assessed for ParentsNext this display is correct.</p>

<p>ParentsNext providers can direct register customers as a voluntary participant. Once commenced, voluntary participants can continue in ParentsNext for an unlimited period of time whilst they remain eligible.</p>

<p>A voluntary participant re-assessed as a compulsory participant will be notified that they are required to attend a ParentsNext appointment with Services Australia to discuss compulsory participation.</p>

<p>Compliance action cannot be undertaken for voluntary participants. If they are not satisfactorily engaging with their ParentsNext provider, they may be exited from the program by the provider.</p>

<p>Where a voluntary participant advises they no longer wish to participate, they can only be exited by the agency/department that registered them as voluntary i.e. if registered by Services Australia, only Services Australia may apply the exit or if they were direct registered by the provider, only the provider can apply the exit.</p>

<p><strong>Participation in the previous model of ParentsNext</strong></p>

<p>Where the customer was a compulsory ParentsNext participant in the previous model of ParentsNext as at 30 June 2021 but they no longer meet the compulsory participation requirements, they can elect to register as a voluntary participant and they will be reconnected to their previous provider. They may also have received a notification to contact after 1 July 2021 to register as a voluntary participant.</p>

<p>From 1 July 2021 onwards, if any customer elects to volunteer in ParentsNext and they were a compulsory ParentsNext participant within the previous 6 months they will also be reconnected to their previous provider when the Volunteer Guided Procedure is run.</p>

<p>ParentsNext participants that have been granted a long term exemption will be sent a notification to inform them if their exemption has ended (where the exemption is ended early) or is due to end.
