<p>This procedure outlines how Farm Household Case Officers (FHCO) negotiate Financial Improvement Agreements (FIA) with customers following the grant of Farm Household Allowance (FHA) and update existing FIAs.</p>
<div class="twisty">
	
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Purpose_of_FIA"></a>
<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Purpose_of_FIA">Purpose of FIA</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The FIA is a measurable, incremental planning tool for each FHA customer (farmers or their partners) to work towards improving their capacity for financial self-reliance and long-term financial security.</p>

<p>The FIA is negotiated between the FHA customer and the FHCO. If a customer is engaged with a Rural Financial Counsellor who has Permission to Enquire, the Rural Financial Counsellor (RFC) may also attend FIA negotiations. The FIA considers the customer's needs, goals, resources and any barriers that limit the customer's ability to take action to improve their circumstances. Regular compliance reviews or 'activity testing' make sure the customer is undertaking their obligations as outlined in the FIA.</p>

<p>The FIA is based on the customer's long term goal and sets out objectives and activities designed to help them achieve their objectives and make progress towards their goal.</p>

<p>Objectives are based around one of the following prescribed goals&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
increasing capacity to generate income on-farm</li>
		<li>
increasing capacity to generate income off-farm</li>
		<li>
increasing capacity to generate income from a mixture of on-farm and off-farm activities, or</li>
		<li>
preparing to exit farming</li>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The FIA forms part of the customer's mutual obligations. To be eligible for FHA, customers must enter into an FIA. </p>

<p>Payment of FHA is available for a cumulative period of 1,460 days. Customers can choose to preserve their entitlement by claiming the payment several times over this period. They can claim FHA when they need it and cancel it when their financial position improves. The FHCO will re-negotiate the FIA with the customer each time they claim.</p>

<p>Customers granted an exemption from the activity test are still required to enter into an FIA. Compliance with these activities will be considered met for the length of the exemption period. See <a href="../rural-and-remote-australians/002-02070040-01.html#bp01_L2GT_Activity_testin">Activity testing</a>.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Customers must enter into an FIA within 28 days of being advised. This period may be extended once by no more than 28 days if the circumstances support this.</p>

<p>Customers negotiate the FIA with their FHCO. The FIA is based on the&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
assessment and recommendations in the Farm Financial Assessment (FFA)</li>
		<li>
customer's capacity to comply with the requirements</li>
		<li>
customer's needs, and</li>
		<li>
other relevant information provided by the customer and, if <strong>Permission to Enquire</strong> exists, by the Rural Financial Counsellor that the customer is engaged with</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> although a request to enter into an FIA is issued following the return of the FFA, where an FFA cannot be completed for an extended period of time (for example, more than 2 months), FHCOs manually initiate the FIA.</p>

<p>The goals, objectives and activities should take into account&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a realistic assessment of the customer's current financial position, and</li>
		<li>
achievable strategies that can be measured to help the customer improve their circumstances within their 4 year entitlement to FHA</li>
		</ul>
<p>Agreed milestones and due dates are specified in the FIA and are used to determine whether the customer has met the requirements of the activity test.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> from 27 April 2020 customers can make a verbal declaration to agree to the FIA. This means they do not need to sign and return their negotiated FIA. The customer will be sent a copy of their new FIA. If an existing FIA has been updated, a copy of the updated FIA will be sent. Customers can view their FIA activities, activity due date and activity supplement balance via their Centrelink online account.</p>

<p>Each member of a couple is required to enter into and comply with their own FIA. Their goals and activities may complement each other. They may also be different. Both members of a couple can participate in a joint review, but one recipient cannot complete the review for both.</p>

<p>When a partner of a farmer has little or no involvement in the farming operation, the objectives and activities in the FIA will reflect the circumstances and aspirations of the individual. For example, if the partner of a farmer works off-farm and wants to gain new skills for employment, the FIA should include activities that support this outcome.</p>

<p>If a person does not enter into an FIA they will not be eligible to receive FHA.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
the FHCO reviews the FFA and notes the SWOT analysis and assessment of the farm business by the Financial Assessor. This is done before meeting with the customer</li>
		<li>
the FHCO completes the Questionnaire on the customer's record as they gather information about the customer to help them negotiate the FIA</li>

the customer(s), FHCO, and the RFCS if requested, meet to negotiate and agree on goals, objectives and activities in the FIA</li>

a phone interview</li>

a face-to-face interview in a service centre or another site</li>

at least once during the first 2 years of receiving FHA, and</li>
		<li>
at least once in the final year</li>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Types_of_activi">Types of activities to be included in the FIA</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The FIA must contain at least one measurable activity that is due within the next 90 days, and subject to the activity test. The activity is assessed at the next review (unless an exemption applies). Activities align with the SMARTA principles, providing customers with clear directions giving them a realistic opportunity to achieve their goals. The customer must undertake an activity from one of the following categories&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
undertaking training</li>
		<li>
obtaining professional advice</li>
		<li>
undertaking study</li>
		<li>
actively seeking, or being willing to undertake paid work in Australia (other than paid work that is unsuitable for the person)</li>
		<li>
any other activity approved by the FHCO that focuses on a direct improvement to the customers circumstances</li>
		</ul>
<p>FHA customers are not required to undertake activities for a minimum number of hours to satisfy the activity test. This recognises the substantial workload of running a farm which may vary over time, and between different types of farms.</p>

<p>The FIA must not require the customer to undertake unlawful activities, activities outside Australia, or an activity that would aggravate a disability, illness or medical condition.</p>

<p>Activities not subject to the activity test may also be included in the FIA, recognising additional efforts a customer wants to undertake to improve their situation. FHCOs should indicate in the <strong>Activity to be completed </strong>free text field if an activity is being undertaken for the purposes of the activity test or as an additional voluntary activity.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> counselling services can only be added for a person who has exhausted funding received through the Better Access Initiative Commonwealth Government mental health program, or to cover the gap payment for the Better Access Initiative. The FHCO can verbally confirm with the customer they have accessed and exhausted this funding or if they will be liable for a gap payment.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Activity_supple">Activity supplement</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>While receiving FHA, customers can claim an activity supplement to help pay for activities agreed in their FIA.</p>

<p>From 11 June 2020, the total amount to support FIA activities increased from $4,000 to $10,000 (including GST). The increased amount of $10,000 is the total available over the customer's lifetime. The supplement can be used to cover reasonable travel and accommodation associated with the improvement activity.</p>

<p>Before 11 June 2020&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The <a href="../rural-and-remote-australians/002-02070050-01.html">activity supplement</a> was&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
limited up to $3,000 </li>
			<li>
available on entering the FIA, and</li>
			<li>
for activities undertaken over the cumulative 4 years of FHA</li>		</ul>
		<li>
An additional activity supplement of $1,000 was available to do high value activities from the third year of payment. This was in addition to the $3,000 activity supplement the customer may have already accessed in full or part</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> not all activities included in the FIA are eligible for the activity supplement.  Activities considered a part of normal farm operations, or expenses incurred implementing any advice or training will not be eligible. For more information about eligible activities, how to claim the activity supplement and the maximum amount payable, see <a href="../rural-and-remote-australians/002-02070050-01.html">Activity supplement and voucher for Farm Household Allowance (FHA).</a></p>

<p>Customers should advise their FHCO when they have completed an activity from their FIA.</p>

<p>Customers must contact their FHCO if they are unable to comply with their FIA. The FHCO can check if an exemption from the activity test can be granted. The FIA must be updated to take into account the customer's change in circumstances.</p>

<p>Unless an exemption has been granted or the customer has a reasonable excuse, failure to enter into an FIA and undertake activities agreed in the FIA may result in FHA payments being stopped. Customers granted an exemption from the activity test are still required to enter into an FIA.

		<div class="block">

<p>Regular reviews of the FIA and associated activities will be conducted by the FHCO once every 12 weeks or more often if appropriate.</p>

<p>With the customer’s consent, their RFC can be invited to attend the review.</p>

<p>The customer's compliance with their mandatory activities will be checked and discussed at the review. It is important FHCOs discuss the customer's progress towards financial self-reliance, and evaluate the effectiveness of the current strategy in achieving this.</p>

<p>If the customer is not on track to improve their financial circumstances by the end of their 4-year FHA entitlement, it may be necessary to reassess the goals and objectives in the FIA.</p>

<p>The FIA can be varied or replaced in consultation with the customer. If the circumstances of the customer or the farm enterprise have changed significantly, it may be appropriate to negotiate a new FIA incorporating the customer's changed goals and objectives. If there is a significant change to the farm business structure or operations, a new Farm Financial Assessment (FFA) may be required to support the development of the new FIA.</p>

<p>At the final quarter FIA review, the FHCO should check if the customer has a current farm business income in place and provide the customer with the options to update their estimate. <a href="../rural-and-remote-australians/002-20102102-01.html">Farm business losses</a> can reduce the assessable amount of non-farm income.</p>
