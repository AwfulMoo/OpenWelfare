<p>Customers may claim Parental Leave Pay (PPL), PPL and Family Tax Benefit (FTB), or just FTB. FTB claimants will have their entitlement to Newborn Supplement (NBS) and Newborn Upfront Payment (NBU) assessed with their FTB claim.</p>

<p>PPL and NBS/NBU <strong>cannot</strong> be paid for the same child. For a multiple birth/entry into care, the claimant may elect PPL to be paid for 1 child and NBS/NBU for the other child, or both children to be paid NBS/NBU.</p>

<p>When claiming FTB for a newborn child, claimants are required to indicate whether they (or their partner) intend to claim PPL. They will be automatically assessed for NBS/NBU if they do not intend to claim for PPL or if they have not lodged a claim for PPL within 26 weeks of the FTB claim date of receipt.</p>

<p>If a customer claims PPL and their claim is withdrawn, not effective or rejected, NBS/NBU entitlement is automatically assessed with FTB for the child when FTB has been claimed.</p>

<p>PPL and DAP claims can be lodged up to 52 weeks after a child's date of birth or entry into care.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> secondary claimants can claim PPL up to 104 weeks after a child's birth or adoption.</p>

<p>However, to receive the full 18 weeks (90 payable days) of PPL, customers need to claim within 40 weeks of the child’s birth/adoption</p>

<p>The PPL period can start from the child's date of birth or adoption if claim requirements are met within 28 days of that date. Otherwise, the earliest PPL period start date is the date of claim.</p>

<p>Customers can change their initial claim choice, and can choose to claim PPL even after NBS/NBU have been paid with FTB. If this happens the NBS/NBU will be raised as an overpayment. See <a href="../families/007-02010030-01.html">Claim choice for a newborn or adopted child</a>.</p>

<p>If PPL entitlement is transferred, 1 customer can receive both Dad and Partner Pay (DAP) and PPL for the same child. However, PPL and DAP periods must be taken at different times and the individual can only receive a maximum of 18 weeks of combined PPL and DAP.</p>

<p>A family can receive a maximum of 20 weeks DAP and PPL combined for the same child.</p>

<p>DAP can be paid before, after, or at the same time as other family assistance payments.</p>

<p>If a customer claims PPL or DAP for a newborn or adopted child and they are FTB current (FTB/CUR or FTB/CZR) for other children, their entitlement to FTB for the newborn or adopted child <strong>must</strong> also be assessed.</p>

<p>FTB, PPL and DAP claims can be lodged up to 97 days before a child's expected date of birth or entrustment to care as part of an adoption process. Secondary PPL claimants can also claim in this period if the primary claimant is transferring some or all of their entitlement to them.</p>

<p>An early claim assesses the customer's eligibility, and establishes the employer registration and acceptance process for PPL claims.</p>

Record details from the paper claim form onto the customer's record using the ACC workflow. ACC cannot be utilised to process claims for persons granted a Humanitarian/Refugee visa (SS415). Service Officers can action these claims <a href="../families/007-17092600-01.html">manually</a></li>

When a paper claim (FA100 for PPL only, or FA080) is scanned to the customer's record, a Social Application (SOA) shell Work Item is generated. This new claim activity contains no claim information apart from the CRN, personal details and the receipt date (date of claim)</li>
			<li>
Claim information will need to be manually updated within the Work Item using information from the scanned claim and associated documentation</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> claims must always be coded and processed using the <strong>correct date of receipt</strong>. This date can sometimes differ from the 'capture date' used to confirm the date of a claim which has been scanned. Service Officers <strong>must</strong> confirm the correct date in <strong>Document Tools</strong> in <strong>Customer First</strong>, or the <strong>Documents</strong> icon in <strong>Process Direct</strong>. These screens display both the 'date of receipt' and the 'capture date'. The correct <strong>DOR</strong> is the <strong>first </strong>date the customer's claim was received, if prior to the date it was scanned (capture date).</p>

<p>A workaround for PPL secondary claimants may be required in full transfer cases if the claimants' records are not linked or are in different environments.</p>

<p>In full transfer cases only, where the birth mother has returned to work before submitting the PPL claim, it is essential the secondary claimant submits their PPL at the same time, before the primary claimant's claim is assessed.</p>

<p>PPL is treated as ordinary income for calculating the rate of income support payments. This will automatically reduce the impacted customer’s (and/or their partner’s) rate of income support payment while they are receiving PPL payments. No additional coding is required.</p>

<p>If the rate of their or their partner’s income support payment is reduced to nil as a result of PPL income, the income support payment (and any associated concession cards etc.) will cancel (CAN-INC). The customer (and/or their partner) will need to lodge a new claim for income support after the PPL payment has ended. <strong>Note</strong>&#58; if the customer has chosen not to connect their Flexible PPL days to the end of their PPL period, the customer (and/or their partner) may be eligible for an income support payment before all of their Parental Leave Pay (PPL) payments have been paid.</p>

<p>Customers (and/or their partners) may also incur an income support overpayment if they are paid PPL for a period for which they have already received an income support payment. Customers can minimise the amount of the overpayment by choosing a nominated start date (NSD) in the future.</p>

<p>If any of these errors are presented, Service Officers need to check the serial number that has been loaded/entered (on <strong>CCH</strong> screen) matches the serial number on the FA081 or FA008 form.</p>

<p>When a Service Officer is processing a FA081 or FA008 form manually, the serial number on the <strong>CCH</strong> screen for that child should be entered.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the serial number field is not mandatory, such as when a birth certificate is provided.</p>

<p>If the serial number has not been correctly entered when cross checked between the <strong>CCH</strong> screen and the FA081 or FA008 form, the Service Officer should re-enter the correct number (on <strong>CCH</strong> screen). If this number does not return any error message, they can continue to action the outstanding staff workflows or processing.</p>

<p>If it is confirmed that the serial number has been correctly entered and the error is still displayed (on <strong>CCH</strong> screen), Service Officers are not continue to process the claim, but refer the Customer Reference Number (CRN) to Families and Child Care - Business Process Branch marked 'URGENT'.</p>
