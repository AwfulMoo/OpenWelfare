		<ul>		<li>
Not all factors need to be present and a customer’s holistic circumstances need to be considered after assessing the five factors</li>
		<li>
In determining that customer is a MoC, assessors must be satisfied that indicators of a relationship outweigh the indicators that no relationship exists</li>
		<li>
It is also important to remember that the presence of family and domestic violence may indicate a customer is not a MoC</li>
		<li>
An interview may be required to give the customer and the other person/ex-partner to provide additional information, their perspective on the relationship and any other supporting information they may have. For example, where&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the customer and other person/ex-partner have provided conflicting information in forms, or</li>

there is doubt about the validity of information received if the same handwriting has been used on both forms</li>

<p><strong>Financial aspects of the relationship</strong></p>

<p>Financial aspects relate to the degree of financial interdependence. A degree of financial interdependence may be indicative of one person providing financial support for the other.</p>

<p><strong>SS284/SS293 form(s)</strong> - review responses to the set of questions asked in the ‘Financial arrangements’ section. </p>

<p><strong>Points to consider</strong></p>

<p><strong>Joint ownership of real estate or other major assets and any joint liabilities&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the customer and other person/ex-partner jointly own real estate or other major assets, are there plans to separate these? If not, is the continuation reasonable, or indicative of a MoC relationship</li>
		<li>
For SUOR assessments, consider if property settlement proceedings have begun. This may demonstrate the customer is taking steps to sever the relationship </li>
		<li>
If the customer has joint accounts with the other person/ex-partner, what is the purpose of the joint account and are there plans to separate this account.<br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> a joint account for the sole purposes of paying rent and utilities is reasonable and does not necessarily indicate a MoC relationship exists</li>
		<li>
Is there any outstanding joint debts. If yes, consider the arrangement(s) for repayment and/or separating the debt</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Financial support for each other&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Does the customer pay rent or board and/or lodgings where they currently live? If not, why not - are they being supported by the other person/ex-partner. If so, how are the accommodation expenses split</li>
		<li>
Does the other person have access to the account into which the Centrelink payment is paid</li>
		<li>
Check how loans are repaid. Whose money is used. Bank statements may be helpful here if direct debit from an account is used and may demonstrate transfer of funds between two people; if funds are being transferred, why is this occurring</li>
		<li>
Is there evidence of sharing or splitting bills. For example, mortgage repayments, rent, utility bills, food. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> if it’s indicated one person owns the home, it would be reasonable to expect the other person is paying for board and/or lodgings; if it’s a joint mortgage, it’s reasonable to expect the repayments are equally split. If not, consideration on why would be required to assist in forming an opinion about the relationship.  </li>
		<li>
If joint assets were purchased, why did this occur. Is this a reasonable expectation or is the purchase indicative of a MoC relationship.</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Legal obligations owed by one person for the other&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
If joint insurance policies exist, why does the customer share the insurance policies. Are there plans to cancel or alter them. This may demonstrate the customer is taking steps to severe the relationship (for SUOR circumstances)  </li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Sharing day to day expenses&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Are the household bills split equally</li>
		<li>
Who pays for food expenses</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>

<p>Financial aspects can be important, but financial independence does not rule out a MoC relationship. There is an increasing trend for couples to maintain separate finances. However, most couples are likely to share finances in some way.</p>

<p><strong>Nature of the household</strong></p>

<p>Nature of the household includes the physical set-up of the household e.g. shared quarters, arrangements for domestic tasks, arrangements for joint care of children.</p>

<p><strong>SS284/SS293 form(s)</strong> - review responses to the set of questions asked in the ‘Nature of the household’ section.</p>

<p><strong>Points to consider</strong></p>

<p><strong>Joint responsibility for providing care and support for children&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
If there are children regularly living or staying at the address, do both parties look after the children? For SUOR assessments, is there a child support arrangement in place? If not, consider the customer’s response as to why they haven’t made any child support arrangements</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Living arrangements&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the parties share a bedroom, consider the customer’s explanation on why</li>
		<li>
Responsibility for household task&#58; How are the household chores arranged. Does one person do all the cleaning or washing for the other person</li>
		<li>
Who does the general home maintenance and gardening</li>
		<li>
Are the household chores rostered? People who are not in a relationship will often have a roster or formal agreement for sharing tasks</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>For responses on the forms, it is reasonable to expect the following&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
I do = customer does it all</li>
		<li>
Other person = the sharer/ex-partner does it all</li>
		<li>
We both do = split equally</li>
		<li>
Third party = neither do it and a third party does it all</li>		</ul>

<p><strong>Social aspects of the relationship</strong></p>

<p>These details take into account how the parties present themselves to society, how others in society view their relationship.</p>

<p><strong>SS284/SS293 form(s)</strong> - review responses to the set of questions asked in the ‘Social Aspects’ section.</p>

<p><strong>Points to consider</strong></p>

<p><strong>Presenting themselves as a couple&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Has one or both of them described themselves as a partner or de facto to the other person when completing any application forms (loans, insurance, employment etc.)</li>
		<li>
Do they present themselves to the community as a couple or friends</li>
		<li>
Have they presented themselves as being in a relationship to third parties such as landlords or business owners/other agencies</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Assessment of friends and regular associates about the nature of the relationship&#58;</strong></p>

<p>If the customer indicates relatives, friends or regular associates consider them to be partnered, consider why. There may be cultural or religious factors to consider, for example, it is shameful for the customer to be considered separated. They may not want their children to know about the separation.</p>

<p><strong>Joint social activities&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Do they share social and leisure activities. If yes, how often</li>
		<li>
If <strong>interviewing the customer</strong>, ask why they share these activities. Are they simply on the same sporting team, or is it because they take both attend their children’s sporting activities. This is to help obtain as much objective information as possible</li>		</ul>

<p><strong>Any sexual relationship</strong></p>

<p>The presence of a sexual relationship does not prove or disprove a MoC relationship. This aspect of the relationship must be taken into account with the degree of emotional support and other forms of interdependence and commitment as demonstrated with the other 4 factors.</p>

<p><strong>SS284/SS293 form(s)</strong> - review response to the question asked in the ‘Sexual relationship’ section</p>

<p><strong>Points to consider</strong></p>

<p><strong>Admission of a sexual relationship</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Is there an admission of a sexual relationship between the parties to the relationship</li>
		<li>
Check the record for known information which may indicate the presence of a sexual relationship, such as if the customer has had any children with the other person whilst claiming they are not a member of a couple</li>		</ul>

<p><strong>Nature of the commitment</strong></p>

<p><strong>SS284/SS293 form(s) - </strong>review responses to the questions asked in the ‘Nature of commitment’ section.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Determine if there is an emotional attachment that differs to the commitment of either party to anyone else at that time. Or, that differs to relationships with close relatives, friends or co-tenants&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The SS284 or SS293 may provide details of the nature of the commitment, but the customer's responses may need verifying</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Points to consider</strong></p>

<p>Each person's perception of the relationship</p>
		<ul>		<li>
How does each person describe their relationship. This can be checked by their response to the question in the form</li>
		<li>
How does each person think their relationship differs with that of a married, registered or de facto couple</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Length of the relationship&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Consider how long the parties intend to share accommodation with the other person</li>
		<li>
Is there a history of sharing accommodation (check historical Accommodation Details, Sharer Details and Living Arrangements pages)? If so, is any explanation reasonable. For example, affordability or is there indications there may be a MoC relationship</li>
		<li>
Consider if the length they intend to share is ‘reasonable’. For example, if the customer indicates intent to share accommodation until the end of lease however the lease term is less than the length noted, this may need to investigation. Or it may be reasonable to continue sharing because they can’t afford to move out; they may continue to share for extended periods due to affordability issues</li>
		<li>
If <strong>interviewing the customer</strong>, ask how long the parties have known each other</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Companionship and emotional support&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Is one of the parties listed as an emergency contact person for employment. If so, is the explanation reasonable. For example, there may be no one else available locally</li>
		<li>
Do the parties have a mutual commitment to the relationship? What is the strength of emotional ties</li>
		<li>
Is there evidence of companionship and emotional support for each other? This includes caring for the other person when they are ill or in a personal crisis. Note that people in share households and those caring for a person with a disability may provide different levels of companionship and emotional support which may not be indicative of a MoC relationship.</li>
		<li>
In <strong>Fraud cases only</strong>&#58; if interviewing third parties such as family and friends, obtain their views</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Stability of the relationship&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Is there any evidence of family and domestic violence. For example, court documents, social worker <strong>DOC</strong>s which may indicate the absence of commitment or emotional support</li>
		<li>
Is there evidence that either party exerts influence over the other person's long term plans or decisions</li>
		<li>
For SUOR assessments, has either party indicated they may get back together? If so, this may need further investigation to determine there’s been a genuine separation</li>
		<li>
If interviewing the customer, ask how long do they intend to continue the relationship? Have they shared addresses or separated in the past? Check their records for evidence</li>		</ul>

<p>Details should be as brief as possible. Outline key details that explain the basis of the decision.</p>

<p>Details of any conversation held with a person (including a third party) must be a true reflection of the discussion.</p>

<p>The MoC decision <strong>DOC</strong> must include the following details&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
outcome of the decision, e.g. 'A decision has been made that (Person 1) and (Person 2) are Separated Under One Roof/are in a Member of a Couple relationship'</li>

<p><strong>What must not be included?</strong></p>

<p>MoC decisions are based on details provided by a customer (and other parties) on the SS293/SS284 forms and supporting information.</p>

<p>So it is important not to repeat at length details available on the record.</p>

<p>If details on the record are relevant to the decision, it is enough to include a key statement referring to them. For example&#58; 'The claimant and other person do not have any joint financial commitments as per details in SS293 forms from both parties and the SIS screen on both records.'</p>

<p>The MoC decision <strong>DOC</strong> does not need to include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
repeated (word for word) details that can be viewed on the record via Document Tools. This includes scanned SS284/SS293 forms</li>
		<li>
sensitive or personal details not related to the enquiry</li>
		<li>
personal bias</li>

<p>Jenny is a single Parenting Payment (PP) customer, separated from partner Rodney and has with 2 dependent children.</p>

<p>Rodney does not pay Jenny any child support and gets JobSeeker Payment (JSP). Rodney gets occasional work and has just lodged an Application for Payment (SU19) with the same address on it as Jenny's.</p>

<p>At the interview, Jenny states that Rodney stays over most nights to see the kids. Rodney's name is still on the lease because it is too hard to change it with the real-estate agents. Rodney also takes the children to school and watches them play sport on the weekends. When staying over, Rodney sleeps in Jenny's bed as it is only a 2 bedroom house.</p>

<p>Jenny does not consider they are living as a member of a couple as they have no joint bank accounts and Jenny pays all the bills. Rodney gives Jenny some money occasionally towards the bills.</p>

<p>They do not go out much, but when they do it is usually down to the local club with some friends. Jenny does not think that they are back together and does not want to pressure Rodney too much.</p>

<p>Considering the information relevant to the customer's relationship, it would appear that a member of a couple relationship does exist. There is a joint lease, the couple have a joint social life and both take responsibility for the custody and control of the children.</p></td>
