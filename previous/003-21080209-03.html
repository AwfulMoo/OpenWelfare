<p><strong>For DVA customers only (as all Centrelink income support customers will have a record).</strong></p>

		<ul>		<li>
For a person born in Australia (or migrated to Australia) after approximately</li>
			<ul>			<li>
<strong>1959</strong>, Historical Family Allowance (HFA) records may exist. For help, see&#58;<br><a target="_blank" href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-11030010-03.html">Gathering information from internal sources</a><br><a target="_blank" href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-06030000-03.html">Online Search (OLS) facility</a><br>If they do not have access to OLS, Service Officers should speak with their Team Leader</li>
			<li>
<strong>1988</strong>, links to a parent should exist, for example, family assistance, child care payments, maternity payments</li>		</ul>
		<li>
The person could have been linked as a partner or nominee to a person who previously received a payment from Services Australia</li>
		<li>
Complete a <strong>SMS/Email (SMEM)</strong> search.</li>
			<ul>			<li>
A SMEM search can help to identify an existing record or if a customer has multiple records<br>-Enter <strong>SMEM</strong> in the <strong>Next</strong> field<br>-Enter the customer’s mobile phone number in the <strong>SMS number</strong> field<br>-Press <strong>Enter</strong> and the results will show</li>
			<li>
If, after completing a SMEM search, there are concerns about a customer’s identity, see <a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-09110100-03.html">Identity Fraud</a></li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>If extensive checks and searches return no existing customer record, staff must make sure they are satisfied the caller is who they say they are and the information is genuine before adding a customer to the system.</p>

<p>Create the record in the correct environment. This avoids the need to complete an <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-03020000-01.html">Inter-environment change of address (ICoA)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the record is created in the incorrect environment and a claim is granted, the customer will not receive a payment. Where this has occurred, contact Technical Peer Support who must contact the Level 2 Helpdesk using the <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-21080209-05.html#bp05_L2LL_Template">payment query template</a>.  </p>
		<ul>		<li>
The Inter-Environment Change of Address Log Information (<strong>ITLG</strong>) screen shows when environment transfers were done. </li>
		<li>
The Payment Summary (PS) screen will not show a payment has released. </li>
		<li>
Running the workflow again will not fix the error.</li>

<p>Check the customer's identity by <a target="_blank" href="../initial-contact-general/106-06020030-03.html">completing an Immigration Enquiry (RSIMME) update</a>.

		<ul>		<li>
if the customer meets all other eligibility criteria, and</li>

<p>For example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
for a Tasmania (Southern Tasmania) claim, where the whole state is <strong>not</strong> considered a COVID-19 hotspot, a customer lives in an LGA not included in Southern Tasmania and has 2 employers - one located in an LGA included in Southern Tasmania (7 hours per week) and one not included in those LGAs (10 hours per week). Only the employer with 7 hours per week can be considered, as the customer does not live in Southern Tasmania</li>
		<li>
for an Australian Capital Territory (ACT) claim, where the whole territory is considered a COVID-19 hotspot, a customer lives in an LGA not included in the ACT and has 2 employers - one located in an LGA in the ACT (7 hours per week) and one not included in those LGAs (10 hours per week). Only the employer with 7 hours per week can be considered as the customer does not live in the ACT</li>

Simply forgetting to lodge a claim would not be a sufficient reason. However, if there are unusual circumstances that led to a customer forgetting to lodge a claim, these can be considered.</p>

<p>Special circumstances must also be considered where, for any state or territory event where <strong><a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-21072337-01.html#bp01_L2GT_Automatic_payme">automatic payments apply</strong></a>&#58;</p>

for an Australian Capital Territory (ACT) claim, where the whole territory is considered a COVID-19 hotspot, a customer lives in an LGA not included in the ACT and has 2 employers - one located in an LGA in the ACT (7 hours per week) and one not included in those LGAs (10 hours per week).

calculate the total number of all hours lost that can be included in assessing the customer's claim noting that the customer must have lost at least 8 hours or 1 full day of work</li>

if the customer has lost less than 8 hours or has not lost 1 full day of work the customer is not eligible to receive a COVID-19 Disaster Payment</li>		</ul>

<strong>Note&#58;</strong> if there are no hours lost or employer details under this sub-heading, this means the customer is not eligible to receive a payment.
