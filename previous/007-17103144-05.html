<p><strong>Short term crisis</strong></p>

<p>Juliet leaves the family home with 2 children to move into crisis accommodation due to family and domestic violence.</p>

<p>Juliet is not able to undertake any recognised activities but requires access to subsidised child care to ensure the children are safely cared for, and give continuity for the children during this period, while giving time to set up a life away from the former partner.</p>

<p>Juliet requests an exceptional circumstances activity test result on this basis, explaining both the children will require placement in long day care each day until secure accommodation is found.</p>

<p>Level 2 Helpdesk considers Juliet's situation and makes an exceptional circumstances activity test determination of 120 hours per fortnight for 2 CCS fortnights.</p>

<p><strong>Responding to emergency</strong></p>

<p>James is a single parent with an activity test result of 72 hours per fortnight who volunteers with the SES. A fire is threatening the local area and James is asked to participate in fighting fires and be on call for the next week.</p>

<p>James makes an exceptional circumstances application outlining the requirement for constant care for 5 year old child Alice for the week so James can fulfil the SES duties and be on call. As a single parent, James has no one else who can care for Alice who is not old enough to be left alone.</p>

<p>Level 2 Helpdesk considers James' situation and makes a decision to increase James' activity test result to 336 hours for the fortnight (a result cannot be increased for a single week) to ensure James can be available to carry out the duties as an SES volunteer and access 24 hour child care for Alice.</p>

<p>Four-year-old Alex attends child care 3 days a week. Alex has been deemed to be at risk and Alex's parent, Jean, has been granted ACCS (Child Wellbeing).</p>

<p>While attending a rehabilitation program for 4 weeks, Jean leaves Alex in the care of a relative. Before going into rehab Jean makes an exceptional circumstances application requesting 120 hours of care for Alex so Alex can attend each 12 hour session for the 5 days of the week, because Alex's relative works full-time and has to commute an hour each way to the child care service.</p>

<p>The Service Officer record the details of Jean's circumstances, and scans the letter from the rehabilitation centre onto her Centrelink record. It is then referred to the ACCS Processing Team for assessment.</p>

<p>Level 2 Helpdesk considers the application and increases the ACCS (Child Wellbeing) result to 120 hours per fortnight while Jean is in rehabilitation.</p>

<p><strong>Request for more than 100 hours subsidised care</strong></p>

<p><strong>Example 1&#58;</strong></p>

<p>Marlene and Ian each work 5 days a week and are entitled to 100 hours of subsidised care per fortnight. However, their child care service charges 12-hour sessions meaning Marlene's child Anne uses 120 hours of care per fortnight.</p>

<p>If Marlene made an exceptional circumstance submission for additional hours of subsidised care, the activity test result must not be increased because this is a routine occurrence resulting from the business practice of the child care service.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2&#58;</strong></p>

<p>Evan and Jamie both work 90 hours per fortnight in a family business, with travel of 2 hours per day = 110 hours work/travel per fortnight. As this is their normal work routine, there is no entitlement to more than 100 hours of subsidised child care, and they would be responsible for fees above 100 hours.</p>

<p><strong>Example 3&#58;</strong></p>

<p>Rebecca and Allan both work 110 hours per fortnight (including travel time) running their own business. Due to one of the other family members involved in running their business falling ill, they need to work an extra 20 hours (2 days) per fortnight work each. This means they are now working and travelling 134 hours/fortnight.</p>

<p>After evidence is provided, both Rebecca and Allan are assessed as eligible for an additional 24 hours per fortnight (2 x 12 (work/travel)) is granted to each of them, giving them access to 124 hours per fortnight of subsidised care.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the additional hours granted is for the extra hours they are required to work due to exceptional circumstances, not the total work/travel (134) they are undertaking. This exceptional circumstance Activity Test result would be limited to the time it takes for new staffing arrangements to be made to replace the ill family member.</p>

<p><strong>Example 4&#58;</strong></p>

<p>Sue works 90 hours per fortnight in a family business. Sue's child, Andrew, attends a local day care centre near the family home. It takes 75 minutes to travel from the day care centre to the family business. Although this means Sue is undertaking work and travel for a total of 115 hours per fortnight, this does not warrant an increase in subsidised hours as it is not due to exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>Example 5&#58;</strong></p>

<p>Rodney is a single parent who works 80 hours per fortnight, travelling 2 hours per day from the child care service to work. Rodney is entitled to 100 hours subsidised child care per fortnight.</p>

<p>Rodney's house is damaged in a storm making it inhabitable, requiring Rodney to move in temporarily with relatives until repairs are completed (estimated to be 3 months). This temporary relocation means Rodney now has to travel 90 minutes each way from the child care service to work.</p>

<p>In this situation, after evidence has been provided, Rodney is granted an additional 10 hours subsidised care (110 hours per fortnight) for 3 months, when repairs are expected to be completed. These additional hours cover the additional travel hours only due to the exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p>If the repairs are completed earlier than expected and Rodney moves back home before the 3-month period, Rodney should notify Services Australia and the exceptional circumstances Activity Test result will be ended.</p>

<p>Customer separated on 5 March 2020.</p>

<p>Reconciliation occurs and customer's actual income was $60,000 and partner's income was $110,000 (as the ex-partner received a large payout after 5 March 2020), resulting in a combined income of $170,000.</p>
