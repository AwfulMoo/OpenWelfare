<p>This code is recorded automatically or manually for a child where it is within the 13 weeks (91 days) timeframe to take initial child support action - See <a href="../separated-parents/277-51070000-01.html">Maintenance Action Test (MAT) for Family Tax Benefit (FTB) customers</a>.</p>

<p>An initial Maintenance Action Requirement Notification letter will be automatically produced when a relevant activity is finalised and the customer or their partner's child is within a DMA period.</p>

<p>For assessments finalised <strong>prior to 18 June 2012</strong>, a mandatory Manual Follow-up (MFU) (A017MN) will mature on day 56. This gives the customer 5 weeks to take <a href="../separated-parents/277-51070000-01.html">child support action</a>. This MFU will only present once before the Maintenance Action Test (MAT) code goes to <strong>NMA</strong> (no maintenance action) at day 92.</p>

<p>The Service Officer must contact the customer as part of this MFU. For details, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-51160010-01.html">Completing child support Manual Follow Ups MFUs</a>.</p>

<p>If no updates are made by the end of the 13 week (91 day) period, the system will automatically update the maintenance action code to <strong>NMA</strong> at day 92 to limit Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A for the child/ren to base rate.</p>

<p>From 18 June 2012, the DMA review process has been automated. A reminder Maintenance Action Requirement Notification letter may be automatically sent to the customer 21 days after the initial letter has been sent if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the child remains in their DMA period</li>
		<li>
no child support assessment information has been reported, and</li>

<p>If the customer is within a 28 day Child Bereavement period. For example, A child in the customer's care has passed away within the last 28 days) the Maintenance Action Requirement Notification letter (initial and reminder) will not be generated. A Manual Follow Up (MFU) review (I013MN) will be created.</p>

<p>An MFU (<strong>I013MN</strong>) will be created when either the initial or reminder Maintenance Action Requirement Notification letter cannot be sent because the customer is within a Child Bereavement period.

<p>The Service Officer must contact the customer as part of this MFU.</p>

<p>Due to the sensitive nature of the customer's circumstances, contact the customer by phone. Discuss the requirements around taking child support for surviving DMA children in the care of the customer. The MFU ensures that manual contact is made in place of the automated letter.</p>

On the Assessment Results (<strong>AR</strong>) screen, ensure you zero out the arrears corresponding with the debt that was zeroed in the case end activity. These are not arrears owed to the customer, they are arrears to offset the zeroed debt at reconciliation</li>

To check the period of the debt that was zeroed, go to the Event Summary (<strong>ES</strong>) screen and '<strong>S</strong>'elect the AMR of the case end activity. Take the activity to the <strong>AR</strong> screen</li>

The arrears period may be greater than the debt period if the customer received a payment since the case end load. In this case, the customer may be entitled to arrears for the period outside the debt period. For help zeroing out arrears, send a request via mySupport. <a href="../separated-parents/277-51160000-05.html">Resources</a> has a link to mySupport</li>

		<ul>		<li>
On the Override Maintenance Income (<strong>MNOI</strong>) screen, record the annual maintenance income that was used in the FTB reconciliation result prior to the incorrect Child Support case end load. This will correct the reconciliation outcome.

<p>When claiming FTB as a lump sum up to and including 2010-2011, customers can indicate that they would like their child support information obtained directly from Child Support, or they can choose to self-assess.</p>

<p>When claiming FTB as a lump sum from 2011/2012 onwards, customers no longer have the option to self-assess. This means if the customer indicated that they did not take action to obtain child support and they do not record a reason that indicated that an exemption may be applicable, the customer will fail the maintenance action test for the relevant child/ren for the relevant financial year.</p>

<p>The customer's choice to use data from Child Support is recorded on the Maintenance Details Selection (<strong>FMPYS</strong>) screen when their claim is processed.</p>

<p>From 2011/2012 onwards, this will automatically default to 'Y' and should not be changed, even if the customer indicates they did not take action to obtain child support.</p>

<p>The claim remains pending until data is received or until&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>For 2010/2011 and earlier</strong>, the matching choice on FMPYS is changed from 'Y' to 'N' and details are recorded manually</li>
		<li>
<strong>For 2011/2012 and later</strong>, details are manually coded on the Maintenance Action (<strong>MNMA</strong>) screen</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the matching choice on the <strong>FMPYS</strong> screen is to remain unchanged.</p>

<p>A Manual Follow-up (MFU) is created when the lump sum claim activity is finalised but the claim status is pending, awaiting child support details&#58;</p>

<p><strong>Action</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Check that <a href="../separated-parents/277-51150000-01.html">mutual customer matching with Child Support</a> has been successful and take appropriate action if there has been a mismatch at the customer, payer or child level</li>
		</ul>
<p>If there are no mismatches, contact Child Support to confirm if the customer did in fact have a child support case for the relevant financial year. If it is confirmed that the customer&#58;</p>

<p><strong>Did have a child support case during the financial year</strong>, close the MFU and providing all other reconciliation conditions are met, reconciliation will occur once the data is received. Procedure ends here.</p>

<p>If the customer was <strong>part of a child support case however there are no details to be received electronically</strong> (that is, the customer was a payer and is impacted by the 'one case issue'), the customer's maintenance details will need to be recorded manually.</p>

<p><strong>For years up to and including 2010/2011&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
The customer's option of matching with Child Support will need to be changed from a '<strong>Y</strong>' to an '<strong>N</strong>' on the Maintenance Details Selection (<strong>FMPYS</strong>) screen</li>
		<li>
The maintenance action for the relevant child/ren needs to be recorded as '<strong>LMP</strong>' on the Maint LSC Maint Action (<strong>MLMA</strong>) screen from the relevant date as advised by Child Support</li>
		<li>
Maintenance income for the relevant child/ren needs to be recorded on the Maint LSC Income Details (<strong>MLID</strong>) screen in order for the claim to finalise. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> an amount has to be recorded, even if it is zero as the claim cannot finalise without this information</li>
		<li>
Ensure that the <strong>DOC</strong> clearly states why the customer's option of matching with Child Support has been changed and includes the details obtained from Child Support. That is, because the customer was a payer for the relevant income year and Child Support has confirmed that the customer was included in a child support case however due to the 'one case' limitations, no information will be received electronically for children. Procedure ends here</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>For years 2011/2012 ongoing&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
The customer's option of matching with Child Support is not to be changed on the Maintenance Details Selection (<strong>FMPYS</strong>) screen</li>
		<li>
The maintenance action for the relevant child/ren needs to be recorded as 'MWP' on the Maintenance Action Input (<strong>MNMA</strong>) screen from the relevant date as advised by Child Support</li>
		<li>
Any maintenance income for the relevant child/ren needs to be recorded as voluntary on the Actual Maintenance Collected - Group (<strong>MNAG</strong>) screen</li>
		<li>
<strong>Note&#58;</strong> an amount has to be recorded, even if it is zero as the claim cannot finalise without this information. If the system will not accept a type of 'voluntary', code the type as 'actual'. The amount needs to be ended from the end of the claim period</li>
		<li>
Ensure the <strong>DOC</strong> includes the details obtained from Child Support. That is, customer was a payer for the relevant income year and Child Support has confirmed that the customer was included in a child support case however due to the 'one case' limitations, no information will be received electronically for the children. Procedure ends here</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>If the customer did not have a current child support case during the financial year</strong>, send a <strong>Fast Note to FCC</strong> &gt; <strong>Auto text</strong> &gt; <strong>Families</strong> &gt; <strong>Claims</strong> &gt; <strong>FTB LSC pending child support data</strong>. Procedure ends here.</p>

<p><strong>For years up to and including 2010/2011&#58;</strong></p>

		<li>
ensure the <strong>DOC</strong> contains all information obtained from the customer</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>For years 2011/2012 ongoing&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Check if the customer may be entitled to more than the base rate of FTB due to income</li>
		<li>
If the customer may be entitled to more than the base rate due to income, contact the customer to advise that Child Support has confirmed they did not have a child support case, therefore they can only be assessed for FTB at the base rate (due to failing the maintenance action test)</li>
		<li>
If the customer is adamant they have taken action, advise the customer they need to supply evidence of this (child support case number). Once this information is provided, it should be forwarded to the Child Support Unit for investigation</li>
		<li>
If the customer confirms they did not take action, explore if there was any reason that prevented the customer from doing so. That is exemptions for family and domestic violence, other parent overseas, parentage unknown. Where an exemption may be applicable, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-51070090-01.html">Exemptions from seeking child support for Family Tax Benefit (FTB) customers</a></li>
		<li>
Where the customer did not take action and an exemption is not applicable or the customer is not entitled to more than the base rate of FTB due to income, the customer will fail the maintenance action test for the relevant child/ren for the relevant financial year. Update as follows&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the customer's option of matching with Child Support on the <strong>FMPYS</strong> screen is not to be changed</li>
			<li>
record the maintenance action for the relevant child/ren on the <strong>MNMA</strong> screen</li>
			<li>
code 'AXB' for the relevant child/ren from the start of the financial year or the start of the claim period if this is later than 1 July, <strong>then</strong></li>
			<li>
code 'NMA' for the relevant child/ren from the start of the following financial year. This ensures the child/ren do not remain as 'AXB' children, which could affect future claims</li>
			<li>
repeat for all relevant children</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Ensure the <strong>DOC</strong> contains all information obtained from the customer</li>		</ul>
