<p>This document outlines the process when a customer experiencing a vulnerable circumstance contacts Services Australia intending to claim a payment or concession card. A claim for a concession card includes Commonwealth Seniors Health Card (CSHC), Health Care Card (HCC), Low Income Health Care Card (LIC), or Ex-Carer Allowance (child) Health Care Card (EHC). <strong>Note&#58;</strong> different start day rules apply to claims for family assistance, including claims for Family Tax Benefit, Parental Leave Pay and Child Care Subsidy (CCS).</p>

<p>If a customer experiences pre-claim vulnerable circumstances in the eight weeks prior to contacting the agency regarding their intent to claim, they can have their start date back dated to the date of contact as long as they submitted their completed claim within 14 days of this contact.</p>

<p>The intent to claim will capture information on a customer's pre-claim vulnerable circumstances and uses this information to automatically calculate, where possible, the correct payment start date once the claim is granted. When this hasn't occurred, a manual check may be required, that is, third party.</p>

<p>All contacts from a customer or their representative in relation to a new claim for a Social Security payment, ABSTUDY payment, Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) Scheme or concession card <strong>as a customer experiencing a vulnerable circumstance</strong> must be recorded on the customer's record until the claim is submitted.</p>

<p>The contact can occur via <img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="A self service option is available for customers" title="A self service option is available" /> online, telephone, in person, in writing or via an agent (who will have to notify Services Australia to have the details recorded).</p>

<p>The customer then has 14 days from the initial contact date to submit a claim for the contact date to be assessed as the start date for payment.</p>

<p>If the claim is submitted later than 14 days, the contact date will not be used to assess the start date, unless&#58;</p>

<p>When a customer or third party contacts about an intent to claim a payment, Service Officers must identify any vulnerable circumstances which may impact a customer's ability to submit a claim. All vulnerable circumstances and claim contacts must be recorded. A customer may not be qualified on their first contact, however, they may qualify for payment on subsequent contacts or be eligible to submit an early claim.</p>

<p>When a customer or third party advises Services Australia of the intent to claim a payment, the customer must be advised to submit the claim within 14 days from contact. If the customer contacts Services Australia before they are qualified, they should be advised to lodge a claim before qualification under the <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-03040020-01.html">early claim</a> provisions, or to contact Services Australia when they become qualified.</p>

<p>Service Officers dealing with <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-06010030-01.html">customers who initially contact because of a crisis</a> may also need to consider the customer's other potential needs and where appropriate decide if an internal <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-12010000-01.html">referral to a social worker</a> is needed.</p>

<p>If the customer has a pre-claim circumstance displayed on <strong>PRECLM</strong> with a start date that is more than 8 weeks ago, consider if that pre-claim vulnerable circumstance still exists using available information. Some circumstances can remain current on a customer's record indefinitely, such as an exemption from seeking child support due to family and domestic violence. Manually update the claim start date to the date of submission if evidence supports this, that is, a DOC from a Corrections Officer or third party.</p>

<p>To be paid from the date of contact, a customer must be qualified for the payment or concession card on the intent to claim contact date and considered to be a customer experiencing a vulnerable circumstance.</p>

<p>The claim must be submitted no later than 14 days from the date of contact, unless a further extension of up to 13 weeks has been granted for a medical condition or due to special circumstances.</p>

<p>The customer experiencing a vulnerable circumstance must be qualified for a payment when an intent to claim contact date is used to assess the start date.</p>

<p>If the customer was not qualified on the contact date and they are experiencing a vulnerable circumstance, then they must be advised, where possible, to contact Services Australia again once they do meet the qualification provisions for the payment.

<p>Customers who are identified as experiencing a vulnerable circumstance and want to extend the time period beyond 14 days up to 13 weeks (after the initial contact) because of a medical condition must satisfy both of the following conditions&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Between the contact date and the day the claim was submitted, the customer, their partner or the person they are caring for, was continuously suffering from a medical condition, and</li>
		<li>
The medical condition, or circumstances relating to it, had a significant adverse effect that stopped the customer from lodging the claim between the contact date and the day the claim was submitted</li>
		</ul>
<p>Decisions allowing customers more than 14 days but up to 13 weeks to submit a claim after the relevant contact must be investigated and decided on a case by case basis.</p>

<p>A <strong>medical certificate must be provided as evidence</strong> showing that the medical condition of the customer or partner, or person for whom they provide care had a significant adverse effect on the ability to submit the claim within 14 days after the contact date.</p>

<p>Evidence of the medical condition does not have to be provided when considering a request to extend the time to submit a claim. However, when the claim is processed, the decision to apply the extended submission must be supported by evidence that the medical condition was continuous between the date of contact and the date the claim was submitted. A medical report provided for a Carer Payment (CP) and/or Carer's Allowance (CA) claim may fulfil the evidence requirement.</p>

<p>Special circumstances can include, but are not limited to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
A customer having practical difficulties in meeting the 14 day time frame as a result of living in a remote area, or</li>
		<li>
A customer residing in a country that Australia has a social security agreement with, and there are reasons why the customer could not submit within the 14 day period, or</li>
		<li>
An emergency interfering with a customer's plans to submit within the 14 day period, such as a natural disaster</li>

<p>Where the customer has pre-claim vulnerable circumstances recorded within the eight weeks prior to their intent to claim contact date the system will automatically calculate the start date.</p>

<p>Where pre-claim vulnerable circumstances are not able to be automatically determined by the system they can be manually added on the Pre-Claim Vulnerable Circumstance (<strong>PRECLM</strong>) screen in Process Direct.</p>

<p>If the customer has a pre-claim circumstance displayed on <strong>PRECLM</strong> with a start date that is more than 8 weeks ago and no end date, consider if that pre-claim vulnerable circumstance still exists using available information. Where the vulnerable circumstance is no longer active, consider end dating the vulnerable circumstance from the associated circumstance page and regenerate the claim. Some circumstances can remain current on a customer's record indefinitely, such as an exemption from seeking child support due to family and domestic violence. In these cases, do not end date the exemption. Manually update the claim start date to the date of submission if required.</p>
