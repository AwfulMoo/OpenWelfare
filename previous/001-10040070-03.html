<p>Participation Solutions Team (PST)-skilled Service Officers should consider all other relevant factors presented to them when assessing if a job seeker has a reasonable excuse for non-compliance with a compulsory requirement. For example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
What reason/s has the job seeker given for failing to comply with the mutual obligation requirement?</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Have they discussed these reasons with their provider?</li>
			<li>
If not, would it have been safe and reasonable for them to?</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Did the reason/s directly prevent them from meeting the requirement?</li>
		<li>
Was the reason considered foreseeable or within the job seeker's control?</li>
			<ul>			<li>
When did they find out they would not be able to meet the requirement?</li>
			<li>
Did they try to still meet the requirement?</li>
			<li>
Would they have had enough time to call the relevant person to inform them of their inability to comply?</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Would the reason/s be considered acceptable by the general public?</li>
		<li>
Would an employer accept the reason from an employee?</li>
		<li>
Did the job seeker make prior contact to advise they could not meet the requirement?</li>
			<ul>			<li>
If not, what prevented prior contact?</li>
			<li>
Check the job seeker's attempts to make prior contact</li>
			<li>
Was it unreasonable to expect the job seeker to make prior contact?</li>		</ul>
		<li>
When drug and/or alcohol misuse or dependency issues directly impacted non-compliance, more information is needed. See <a href="../job-seekers/001-10040070-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Targeted_Compli">Table 2</a></li>		</ul>

<p>Job seekers must contact their provider beforehand if they are unable to attend or comply with a term in their Job Plan, including attending an appointment.</p>

<p>Prior contact is met when the job seeker contacts&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
their employment service provider, or</li>
		<li>
another person or organisation identified in their Job Plan, for example the Job Plan may require a job seeker to contact their Work For the Dole (WFD) co-ordinator if they can't attend WFD</li>

<p>All compliance investigations focus on the job seeker's reason/s for not complying with a compulsory requirement. This is the reported non-compliance event and is able to be reviewed in the Participation Report sent by the Provider.</p>

<p>During the investigation, the job seeker must be given a chance to explain why they did not meet the requirement.</p>

<p>If the job seeker indicates their circumstances prevented them from complying, PST-skilled Service Officers need to question further to ensure they have a clear understanding of&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
how the circumstance directly affected their ability to comply</li>
		<li>
if the circumstance had been mentioned by the job seeker before and is recorded in their Circumstances Impacting Compliance</li>
			<ul>			<li>
is it an exacerbation to a previously recorded circumstance?</li>
			<li>
had the job seeker advised how an exacerbation of that circumstance might impinge or impede their ability to meet their requirements?</li>		</ul>
		<li>
if prior contact was not made, did the circumstance prevent prior contact from occurring. </li>
			<ul>			<li>
If yes how so?</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>PST-skilled Service Officers must consider updating the job seekers <strong>Circumstances impacting Compliance</strong> to provide additional information to their provider.</p>

<p>For assistance assessing impacts of a circumstance it may be appropriate to consult with&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a PST Senior Service Officer (SO5)</li>
		<li>
a PST-skilled social worker, or</li>

<p>Under no circumstances should a compliance investigation be delayed pending the outcome of an external process. Compliance investigations are a point in time determination, based on available facts and evidence.</p>

<p>A <a href="../job-seekers/001-10050000-01.html">circumstance impacting compliance</a> may be recorded for caring responsibilities as a result of a previous compliance discussion. Whilst this does not automatically provide a reasonable excuse for the circumstances of a specific failure. It can provide helpful guidance around limitations the job seeker may have in meeting requirements (including, but not limited to, days and/or times that may be difficult for the job seeker to attend appointments or activities, and details of alternate care arrangements are able to be utilised by the job seeker to assist them in meeting their requirements).</p>

<p>If a job seeker advises their family and/or caring responsibilities affected their ability to comply, consider&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Does the job seeker have regular caring requirements?</li>
		<li>
Did the job seekers pre-arranged, alternate caring arrangements break down?</li>
		<li>
Was the change to the caring requirements unforeseen?</li>

What impact did the caring responsibilities have on the job seeker's capacity to make prior contact?</li>

<p>Verification using a medical certificate is preferred where caring responsibilities relate to an illness of a child. However, in circumstances where the child is expected to quickly recover, the job seekers word can be accepted.

<p>When a job seeker advises they have confused their requirements, the following should be considered&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
How recently, and in what manner (that is written appointment cared, electronic notification, etc) were they notified?</li>
		<li>
How similar are the requirements they confused?</li>
		<li>
Did the job seeker attend either requirement? For example, it is not an excuse to say you thought the appointment was at the time of another appointment if they did not attend either appointment.</li>
		<li>
Whether the job seeker has recently moved to the area/changed provider?</li>
		<li>
How long has the job seeker been attending their various requirements?</li>
		</ul>
<p>If a job seeker advises they have forgotten their requirement, the following should be considered&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
How recently the notification occurred</li>
		<li>
How often and for how long has the job seeker been required to meet the requirement?</li>
		<li>
Is there an underlying reason (that is medical condition or side effect of medication take for management of a medical condition) for forgetfulness?</li>
			<ul>			<li>
If yes, what does the job seeker do to help them manage their day-to-day requirements, like remembering the time and date of a doctor’s appointment?</li>		</ul>
		<li>
How often has the job seeker offered this excuse?</li>
		<li>
Did the job seeker contact to reschedule as soon as they became aware of the missed requirement?</li>		</ul>

<p>As a general rule, job seekers must accept any suitable job offer. This includes circumstances where the job seeker is able to start the job on offer but will likely leave the job within a short period of time, for example, the job seeker is a principle carer and their childcare arrangements are temporary.</p>

<p>If a job seeker advises they have a firm job offer starting in the future, the reasons why the job seeker has refused suitable work must be assessed on a case by case basis. This may include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a requirement to contact with the prospective employer to confirm the planned start date of employment for the job seeker,</li>
		<li>
evidence (signed and accepted contract) to confirm the details of future employment</li>
		</ul>
<p>Job seekers who are declaring either hours worked or employment income received must continue to look for and accept suitable work, unless all of the following apply&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the job seeker is not able to undertake both jobs, due to overlapping work hours</li>
		<li>
the job on offer hourly rate is lower</li>
		<li>
the hours on offer mean the employment income is less than their current job</li>		</ul>
