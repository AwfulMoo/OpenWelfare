<P>Participation Solutions Team (PST)-skilled Service Officers should consider all other relevant factors when assessing a reasonable excuse, for example:</P>

<UL>

<UL>
<LI>When did the job seeker become aware they could not comply?</LI>
<LI>What did the job seeker do to try to comply?</LI></UL>
<LI>Would the reason/s provided for non-compliance be considered acceptable by the general public? For example, would an employer accept the reason from an employee?</LI>
<LI>Did the job seeker make prior contact to advise they could not meet the requirement?</LI>
<UL>
<LI>If not, what prevented prior contact?</LI>
<LI>Check the job seeker's attempts to make prior contact</LI>
<LI>Was it unreasonable to expect the job seeker to make prior contact?</LI></UL>
