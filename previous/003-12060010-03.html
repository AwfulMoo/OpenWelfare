<p>Customer claiming Crisis Payment (CrP) for <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-07030010-01.html">extreme circumstances family and domestic violence</a> (EXV) has been referred to the social worker.</p>

<p>If possible, the Service Officer who referred the customer should check&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the common criteria for CrP are met</li>
		<li>
the customer is in severe financial hardship</li>
		<li>
the customer was in Australia at the time of the extreme circumstance</li>
		<li>
no more than four CrP EXV/EXO have been paid to them within the previous 12 month period</li>
		<li>
they have not intentionally brought about the extreme circumstance to obtain a CrP</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer has attended a service centre, the service officer should warm hand off the customer to the social worker.</p>

<p>For online or Assisted Customer Claim (ACC) CrP claims or if the customer has completed the SU510, the Service Officer should tell the customer to upload all available verification to their record immediately if it is safe to do so. If the customer is unable to upload verification, the social worker can obtain verbal verification of the customer's circumstances from third parties, using verbal declarations and/or make a professional assessment based on the information available.</p>

<p>For all claims for CrP relating to family and domestic violence, the social worker needs to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
review the details within the claim and, if possible discuss what has happened to determine if it meets the definition of family and domestic violence</li>
		<li>
determine if the customer made contact <a target="_blank" href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-22061604-01.html">within seven days after the extreme circumstance occurred</a></li>
		<li>
check that everyone is now safe, and</li>
		<li>
provide immediate support and counselling to the customer, and refer for appropriate community support and services, depending on the person's circumstances</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the customer requests no social work contact, a social work referral and social work contact is still needed for the purposes of the assessment. When contacting the customer, the social worker must confirm if it is safe for the customer to discuss their circumstances.</p>

Check if verification of severe financial hardship has been provided or uploaded to the record.

<p>If the social worker is unable to establish contact with the customer and there is sufficient information to grant the customer's claim, the social worker can undertake the assessment as a file assessment and recommend a grant without making contact with the customer. When the claim is finalised, the customer will be sent a letter advising of the outcome of the CrP claim, if it is safe to do so. Consideration of the customer's specific circumstances is essential including (not limited to) PPE and relationship status, address and bank account details.</p>

<p><strong>Insufficient information to make a determination</strong></p>

<p>When a social worker has made 2 unsuccessful contact attempts to the customer over more than one day, the claim is to be rejected due to insufficient information. The social worker must complete a rejection SWIS report. Copy and paste the following approved text in the body of the report&#58;</p>

<p>'Claim for crisis payment is rejected.
