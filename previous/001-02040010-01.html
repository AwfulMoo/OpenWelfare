<P>This document outlines information on how to register a job seeker as an FEP for job seekers in Workforce Australia. The job seeker may be eligible to access the full range of employment services from an Employment Services Provider according to their assessed needs and skills.</P>
<P></P>
<DIV class=twisty><A name=bp01_L2GT_JSP_and_YA_job_ class=anchor></A>
<H2 id=_Toc344898764>JSP and YA job seekers</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>JobSeeker Payment (JSP) and Youth Allowance (YA) job seekers must register as FEP. This registration must be completed as part of the <A href="../job-seekers/001-03020100-01.html" target=_blank>Participation Interview</A>.</P>
<P>JSP/YA job seekers are subject to <A href="../job-seekers/001-02030000-01.html">RapidConnect</A> and are required to be referred to a Workforce Australia Online for Individuals or a Workforce Australia Employment Services Provider.</P>
<P>Most job seekers are automatically referred to <A href="../job-seekers/001-02000000-01.html">Workforce Australia Online</A> during their Participation Interview and are not required to be referred to an Employment Services Provider or attend a RapidConnect appointment. Instead, they will meet their RapidConnect obligation by agreeing to their Job Plan online.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P></P>
<DIV class=twisty><A name=bp01_L2GT_Registration_pr01 class=anchor></A>
<H2 id=_Toc344898764>Registration process for FEP jobseekers</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>During the Participation Interview or <STRONG>Job seeker registration</STRONG> workflow, the agency will register a customer as an FEP job seeker.</P>
<P>This process includes:</P>
<UL>
<LI>registering the customer as a job seeker with the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations</LI>
<LI>providing them with their Job Seeker Identification (JSID) number, and</LI>
<LI>conducting the <A href="../job-seekers/001-02050000-01.html" target=_blank>Job Seeker Snapshot</A> to determine the appropriate referral type required</LI></UL>
<P>Where the Job Seeker Snapshot determined that a referral to Workforce Australia Services is required, the job seeker will usually be automatically referred to Workforce Australia Online and a message will be displayed to explain this to the job seeker. If the job seeker required a provider appointment to be booked instead, the interview will proceed to booking an appointment with an Employment Services Provider.</P>
<P>Where the Job Seeker Snapshot determined that an <A href="../people-with-disability/008-06000000-01.html" target=_blank>Employment Services Assessment (ESAt)</A> is required to identify a more appropriate referral option for the job seeker:</P>
<UL>
<LI>an ESAt referral will be made, and</LI>
<LI>the Job Seeker Snapshot will remain pending until the Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) report has been completed</LI></UL>
<P>All job seekers claiming or receiving an income support payment with mutual obligation requirements will have their job seeker registration and Job Seeker Snapshot interview completed by the agency. However, providers are able to register job seekers without mutual obligation requirements and apply the Job Seeker Snapshot if necessary. Where a Job Seeker Snapshot initiated ESAt is flagged, providers are able to make the referral directly to an Assessor.</P>
<P>If the Participation Interview is being conducted, it will also be determined if the job seeker is subject to <A href="../job-seekers/001-02030000-01.html" target=_blank>RapidConnect</A>. If the job seeker is subject to the <A href="../job-seekers/001-02030000-01.html" target=_blank>RapidConnect provision</A>, and a provider appointment is required, an appointment needs to be made within 2 working days or up to a maximum of 14 days. Non-attendance at this appointment can affect the job seeker's payment.</P>
<P>In some circumstances, referral to the provider may be deferred.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P></P>
<DIV class=twisty><A name=bp01_L2GT_Principal_carer class=anchor></A>
<H2 id=_Toc344898764>Principal carer customers</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Principal carers <STRONG>with mutual obligation requirements</STRONG> must register as FEP. Staff must complete this registration as part of the <A href="../job-seekers/001-03020100-01.html" target=_blank>Participation Interview</A>. Parenting Payment (PP) job seekers with mutual obligation requirements are not subject to RapidConnect but are still required to be connected with an Employment Services Provider, unless exempt from doing so. Make an appointment within 2 working days of Participation Interview being run and the job seeker being advised of their obligation to attend a RapidConnect appointment.</P>
<P>New job seekers claiming for payments who are principal carers <STRONG>already meeting part-time mutual obligation requirements</STRONG> by undertaking suitable paid work/self-employment, of at least 15 hours per week or studying full-time, will be registered as FEP if they wish to volunteer for employment services. They will need to be connected to a provider and have the initial appointment booked. However, if they do not wish to volunteer for employment services, they will be registered as Job Seeker Registration Only (JSRO) job seekers.</P>
<P>PP job seekers not subject to compulsory mutual obligation requirements may volunteer to be referred to a provider.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
