<p><a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-04110000-01.html">Confirm the participant's or authorised payment nominee's identification</a> before proceeding with any card activation workflows. It is essential that this step is carried out thoroughly and carefully to reduce the risk of issuing funds to third parties in error.</p>

<p>If issuing a temporary card to the participant’s payment nominee, request the nominee provide the recorded password stored on the Nominee Relationship Summary screen (<strong>NORS</strong>) to confirm their relationship in addition to confirming their identity.</p>

<p>Issuing a temporary card to a third party in error can result in hardship for the participant and financial loss to Services Australia.</p>

<p>If in any doubt it is not the participant and/or they are being taken advantage of, do not issue the temporary card and consult a social worker, or the Welfare Quarantining Programme Management team for further assistance.</p>

<p><strong>Extra checks to ensure a temporary card should be issued to a CDC participant</strong></p>

<p>Check&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the person’s ID</li>
		<li>
any other supporting ID checks</li>
		<li>
any Display on Access (DOA)<strong> DOC</strong>s or other <strong>DOC</strong>s, which indicate that there are financial vulnerabilities or potential fraud occurrences against the participant and ensure the temporary card is being issued to the correct participant</li>
		<li>
if necessary make contact with someone in the local community to confirm that the participant has travelled into town</li>
		<li>
where the card was last used</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58; </strong>issuing a card to a third party will provide access to the participant's quarantined fund. This could result in hardship. If a service officer has concerns someone is fraudulently trying to access another participant’s account they should refer to the department’s fraud processes. See <a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-09110000-01.html">Report Suspected Fraud and Corruption</a>.</p>

<p>A participant is eligible for a temporary card if they are on the CDC or in their initial waiting period. </p>

<p>To confirm if the participant is on the CDC, check the Debit Card Trial Summary screen (<strong>Q2SU</strong>) in Customer First or the Cashless Debit Card Summary screen (<strong>CDCS</strong>) in Process Direct&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the status is <strong>On DCT</strong> the participant is currently on the CDC </li>

This screen will also confirm their quarantining percentage and their CDC account details</li>
		</ul>
<p>To confirm that the participant is in their initial waiting period check the Q2AS in Customer First&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The screen will display an information message stating the date the customer is due to commence on the program  </li>

On the front of each envelope will be identifying numbers that match a card with the accompanying PIN Mailer. When issuing a temporary card that requires a PIN mailer, Service Officers must issue the card with the associated PIN mailer by matching the series of numbers on the front of the card envelope and the PIN mailer envelope.
