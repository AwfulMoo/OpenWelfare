<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Payment_calcula">Payment calculations</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Most of the incentive payments are calculated based on the size of the practice. This is known as the Standardised Whole Patient Equivalent (SWPE).</p>

<p>The SWPE is based on the Medicare and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA) services a practitioner gives to patients at the practice. Twelve months of historical billing is used to capture the SWPE. This is known as the 12-month historical reference period. This starts 16 months before the payment quarter.</p>

<p>To work out the SWPE, the fraction of care provided to each patient per practice is calculated. This is known as the Whole Patient Equivalent (WPE). This WPE is weighted for age and gender of each patient.</p>

<p>It will take around 6 payments (18 months) for a practice to calculate a full SWPE value.</p>

<p>The Services Australia website has more information on calculating a payment.</p>

<p>See the <a href="../health-professionals/012-10010090-05.html">Resources</a> page for a link to the website or for more information on the 12-month historical reference period.</p>

<p><strong>WIP - Practice Stream SWPE</strong></p>

<p>For the WIP - Practice Stream, practices will be given a default SWPE value of 1,000 until the practice&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
receives 6 payments. After the 6 payments, the practice’s true SWPE value is used. Even if it is not greater than 1,000, or</li>
		<li>
true SWPE value is greater than 1,000</li>
		</ul>
<p>Practice payments are based on the information available on PIP Online and WIP - Practice Stream Online at the point-in-time date.</p>

<p>A practice must <a href="../health-professionals/012-10010060-01.html">add all of the practitioners working at the practice</a> to their practice profile. This will capture all the Medicare and the DVA services and calculate payments correctly. Incentive payments may be miscalculated if an incorrect provider number is used to bill the Medicare and the DVA services.</p>

<p>The program guidelines has more information on the SWPE. The <a href="../health-professionals/012-10010090-05.html">Resources</a> page has a link.</p>

<p>A Payee Provider Number is a provider number of a health professional who gets paid for a service.</p>

<p>All services assigned to a Payee Provider Number are processed and paid by Medicare against the Payee Provider Number rather than the individual health professional. In some cases, a practice may assign majority of services to a single Payee Provider Number.</p>

<p>A practice Standardised Whole Patient Equivalent (SWPE) is calculated using the services captured by Medicare.</p>

<p>A practice must register their Payee Provider Number in PIP and/or WIP - Practice Stream to get an accurate payment calculation.</p>

<p>If the Payee Provider Number is not registered on the practice profile, or is registered incorrectly, the practice SWPE and payments will decrease.</p>
