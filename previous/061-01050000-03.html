			<ul>			<li>
hospitalisation of the customer (or the customer's family member) or a serious medical condition that prevented the patient returning to Australia. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> a condition that simply requires treatment and does not prevent travel is not enough to justify an extension of portability</li>

<p>In the case of a customer or child receiving financial assistance under the <strong>Medical Treatment Overseas Program (MTOP)</strong>, either because they are receiving treatment or are accompanying such a person, documentary evidence is required from the Department of Health and Aged Care.

<p>In the case of a severely disabled <strong>Disability Support Pension (DSP) customer who is substantially dependent on a family member who has been posted outside Australia temporarily for work</strong>, documentary evidence is required confirming the family member is continuing to work for the same employer outside Australia and the period of the posting.</p>

<p>Customers who are a member of the <strong>Defence Forces being deployed overseas</strong> will need to provide verifying documents from their commanding officer including the expected date of return to Australia.</p>

<p>Customers who are an <strong>Australian Federal Police officer travelling overseas for peacekeeping or capacity building purposes</strong> will need to provide documents from the Australian Federal Police confirming their travel overseas including the reason for the travel and the expected date of return to Australia.</p>

<p>It may be necessary for the Service Officer to directly contact the doctor or the hospital involved (in a medical case).</p>

<p>Check if the Age Pension or Disability Support Pension (DSP) (excluding DSP New Zealand Agreement) customer unable to return because of a reason specified under section 1216(3) of the Social Security Act 1991.</p>

<p>If the reason relates to <strong>a person who is not a family member but the customer wants the person to be treated as one</strong>, a submission to the delegate is required&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
A family member recommendation needs to be completed. The questions that need to be discussed and recorded with the customer are contained within a <strong>Fast Note</strong>. Provide as much information as possible so the delegate is well informed when considering the relationship</li>
		<li>
Create a <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-05050020-01.html">Fast Note</a> <strong>- </strong>select <strong>Auto text</strong>, use <strong>Centrelink International Services</strong> &gt; <strong>Portability</strong> &gt; <strong>Family Member Recommendation – Child/Parent or Sibling</strong>. Make the recommendation very clear. The person should be considered to be <strong>like</strong> a family member or <strong>not like</strong> a family member</li>
		<li>
Before finalising, include comprehensive information because the <strong>Fast Note</strong> will automatically complete a <strong>DOC</strong> on the customer record when 'confirm' is selected</li>
		<li>
Notify the Service Support Officer (SSO) that a recommendation is awaiting consideration by the delegate by emailing CIS.HELPDESK. The SSO team will send your recommendation to the delegate</li>
		<li>
When the delegate has finalised the recommendation, they will annotate the <strong>DOC</strong> with their determination. Check the record for the return from the delegate. When the determination has been returned, continue with the process</li>

<p>Many requests are based on the customer or family member being too ill to return to Australia. Inability to return to Australia <strong>is not</strong> the same as being treated by a doctor outside Australia for a medical condition.</p>

<p>In order for assessment to be made, the customer must provide evidence to support their request for a portability extension. Examples of acceptable verification include (but are not limited to)&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Written confirmation from the treating doctor verifying&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
hospitalisation of the customer (or the customer's family member) or a serious medical condition that prevented the patient returning to Australia. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> a condition that simply requires treatment and does not prevent travel is not enough to justify an extension of portability</li>
			<li>
the date the event occurred to prove that it was unexpected and occurred before the end of the portability period, and</li>
			<li>
the date that it is expected the customer/family member will be able to travel</li>		</ul>
		<li>
A death certificate for a family member of the customer</li>
		<li>
Legal documents verifying&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
custody proceedings</li>
			<li>
a requirement for the customer to attend criminal proceedings as a witness</li>
			<li>
that a serious crime has occurred against the customer or a family member</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>It may be necessary for the Service Officer to directly contact the doctor or the hospital involved (in a medical case).</p>

<p>However, with a natural disaster in the country, such documentation may not be required, as it may have been reported in the Australian media or on the internet.</p>

<p>In some cases, evidence may be provided by officers in overseas consulates who are assisting customers.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Does the customer have evidence?</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>, and it has <strong>already been provided</strong> to Centrelink. Advise the customer their request for portability extension will be assessed by a specialist officer and they will be contacted in due time</li>
		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>, but it has <strong>not been provided</strong> to Centrelink. <img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> Advise them that if they are registered for online services they can use <a href="../self-service/133-04060000-01.html">Upload documents</a> to provide the evidence.

<p>An end date is required for the discretionary portability extension. For example, in the case of illness the delegate needs to know when the doctor expects the patient to be physically able to return to Australia, or if that is not known, when the case will be reviewed. The delegate would use the date the doctor is intending to review the case as an end-date.</p>

<p>The end date must be coded by the delegate. A review is therefore unnecessary as, if the customer or child has not returned to Australia by this date, the customer's payment will automatically suspend or cancel in the case of Family Tax Benefit (FTB). Child Care Subsidy (CCS) will decrease to a zero rate.</p>

<p>In the case of an Age Pension or Disability Support Pension (DSP) recipient who has indefinite portability, their pension will proportionalise from the portability extension end-date based on their Australian Working Life Residence (WLR) and/or will lose entitlement to other add-on payments.</p>

<p><strong>Suggested advice to customer&#58;</strong></p>

<p>'Under normal circumstances, your rate of payment outside Australia after 26 weeks absence, reduces to a proportional rate based on the length of time you were an Australian resident between the age of 16 and Age Pension age. With the portability of your payment extended, it will continue at the non-proportionalised rate until the end of the extension. You will also continue to be paid Rent Assistance, Incentive Allowance and/or Pharmaceutical Allowance if applicable.'</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Determine the date customer is able to return to Australia. Apply domestic rate extension until then</li>
		<li>
Determine the Date of Event (DOV) for use on the <strong>RSCD</strong> screen. If rate change has already occurred and a decision has been made to apply the discretion available in section 114A of the SSAA to pay arrears back to the date of the rate reduction, use the date of proportionalisation / date add-on payments ceased, as the DOV. This date is found on the Rate Calculation (<strong>PRC</strong>) screen. If the rate change has not occurred, use date of contact as DOV on <strong>RSCD</strong></li>
		</ul>

			<li>
Code the travel destination country in the <strong>Country</strong> field</li>		</ul>
		<li>
On <strong>RSCD</strong> code a new entry for the extension. Code the <strong>Date</strong> field as follows&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
If customer's payment has not yet suspended/reduced, use the date that payment would otherwise suspend/reduce from</li>

<p>Check the <strong>RSS</strong> screen to ensure that the correct Long Term Country Code is currently recorded for the customer. A customer will ordinarily be paid using the same rate calculation method after leaving Australia or New Zealand temporarily, for up to 26 weeks. After this time, the Long Term Country Code is automatically updated by the system, changing the rate calculation method used to determine the customer’s rate.</p>

<p>If an extension is granted, this would enable the customer to continue to be paid the same rate calculation method for a period beyond 26 weeks, to an agreed extension end date. </p>

<p>If the Long Term Country Code has already been changed/corrected prior to the extension being granted, the system will not automatically change it back to the correct Long Term Country Code. As such, this will need to be manually updated by the user after coding the extension and prior to finalising the activity.</p>

<p>In addition, as the PGR/AAG review that would review the Long Term Country Code at the end of the portability period has already matured, a manual review is required to prompt a check of the customer’s location. The review should be set up as follows&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>RVR</strong> screen<br><strong>ServRsn</strong>&#58; AGE</li>
		<li>
<strong>RevRsn</strong>&#58; OSR<br><strong>Due Date&#58;</strong> extension end date<br><strong>Keyword</strong>&#58; NZEXT<br><strong>Text&#58;</strong> Customer's portability extension expires. Check if customer has returned to their country of residence. If not, update the Long Term Country Code on <strong>RSS</strong></li>

For a payment with limited portability, ensure the customer is aware if they remain outside Australia after their payment has ceased to be portable, their payment may be restored if they return to Australia within 13 weeks of their payment ceasing, provided they remain payable and qualified. However, if the person was receiving a transitional rate of pension they will lose entitlement to this rate and will be paid under the new rules upon restoration</li>
		<li>
For a payment with unlimited portability, ensure the customer is aware if they remain outside Australia after the end of the portability extension, their payment may reduce based on their AWLR or SUS-PTC if on Age Pension paid by virtue of the New Zealand Agreement</li>
		<li>
For Disability Support Pension (DSP) customers in an Agreement country that covers DSP, consider if there is enough available medical evidence to assess if the customer is severely disabled and payment can therefore continue under the agreement</li>		</ul>
