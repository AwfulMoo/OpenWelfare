<p>This document outlines information about Schoolkids Bonus. This is a payment that helped families and students with education related costs of primary and secondary school studies. It was automatically paid to people who were eligible on 1 January and 30 June during the 2013 to 2016 calendar years inclusive.</p>

<p>Schoolkids Bonus was abolished from 31 December 2016.</p>

<p>The final instalment of Schoolkids Bonus was for the 30 June 2016 bonus test day.</p>

<p>The final payment of the <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-03080100-01.html">Schoolkids Bonus Leaver Payment</a> was for the 30 June 2016 bonus test day and covered the 1 January - 30 June 2016 education period. It was payable if a student completed secondary school during that education period. It is not payable if a student completed secondary school on or after 1 July 2016.</p>

<p><strong>Notification period</strong></p>

<p>Updating child education details online will no longer generate Schoolkids Bonus payments&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the notification period to receive the 2016 Schoolkids Bonus payments and School Leaver Payments for Family Tax Benefit (FTB) customers expired on 30 June 2017</li>
		<li>
the notification period to receive the 2016 Schoolkids Bonus payments for income support payment customers expired on 31 December 2016</li>

<p>Schoolkids Bonus payments (arrears) and adjustments (overpayments) will continue to be assessed for the period Schoolkids Bonus was payable - from the 1 January 2013 bonus test day through to the 30 June 2016 bonus test day. Arrears will be assessed on a case-by-case basis and would be payable in limited circumstances.</p>
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L3GT_Family_Tax_Bene"></a>
<h3>Family Tax Benefit (FTB)</h3>


<p>Reconciliation or re-reconciliation of FTB Part A for the 2012-13, 2013-14, 2014-15 or 2015-16 financial years may result in a Schoolkids Bonus arrears payment or overpayment.</p>

<p>FTB lump sum claim grants or recalculations for the same financial years as above may also result in a Schoolkids Bonus payment or overpayment.</p>

<p>After the end of the financial year, if all other eligibility requirements are met, a top-up payment of Schoolkids Bonus may be paid as part of the FTB reconciliation process to FTB Part A customers who&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
during the FTB instalment period did not receive Schoolkids Bonus due to their income estimate being above $100,000 and confirmed study level for the relevant child/ren before the end of the lodgement year, and</li>
		<li>
at FTB reconciliation had an actual adjusted taxable income of $100,000 or less for bonus test days in 2015 and 2016</li>
		</ul>
<p>or</p>
		<ul>		<li>
during the FTB instalment period did not receive Schoolkids Bonus due to Prohibition of FTB instalments (PIP) and confirmed study level for the relevant child/ren before the end of the lodgement year, and</li>
		<li>
at FTB reconciliation were entitled to FTB Part A and had an actual adjusted taxable income of $100,000 or less for bonus test days in 2015 and 2016</li>
		</ul>
<p>A <a href="../families/007-07030010-01.html">special circumstances extension</a> could apply to notify study details for Schoolkids Bonus in FTB lump sum claims. In this case, a customer claiming FTB for 2015-16 for example had until 30 June 2018 to meet FTB claim requirements and to notify study details to be paid Schoolkids Bonus for the 2016 bonus test days.</p>

<h3>Income support payments</h3>


<p>Automatic payments are no longer made.</p>

<p>If Schoolkids Bonus eligibility is identified by the system during the assessment of a qualifying payment, a Manual Follow-up (MFU) activity is created with keyword <strong>SKBISP</strong>. The Schoolkids Bonus payment will need to be manually assessed and recorded.</p>

<h3>Qualifying payments</h3>


<p>To be eligible for Schoolkids Bonus, a person must have been in receipt of one of the following qualifying payments on the bonus test day.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
ABSTUDY (Living Allowance)</li>
		<li>
Carer Payment (CP)</li>
		<li>
Disability Support Pension (DSP)</li>
		<li>
Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A</li>
		<li>
Parenting Payment (PP)</li>
		<li>
Special Benefit (SpB)</li>
		<li>
Youth Allowance (YA)</li>
		</ul>
<p>The Department of Veterans' Affairs paid Schoolkids Bonus to eligible customers of payments for a child under the Veterans' Children Education Scheme (VCES) or Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act Education and Training Scheme (MRCAETS).</p>

<p><strong>The person eligible</strong> for Schoolkids Bonus was the customer of the qualifying payment (for example, a parent or guardian receiving YA for a 17 year old dependant, a payment nominee, or a student receiving YA in their own right.</p>
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L3GT_Study_requireme"></a>
<h3>Study requirements</h3>


<p>The child or student had to be&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
undertaking primary or secondary education or an eligible activity, and</li>
		<li>
aged under 19 or turned 19 in the calendar year in which the bonus test day occurred</li>
		</ul><a class="anchor" name="bp01_L3GT_Income_test_fro"></a>
<h3>Income test from 1 January 2015</h3>


<p>To be eligible for Schoolkids Bonus for a bonus test day in 2015 or 2016, the adjusted taxable income of the family or young person must have been $100,000 or less for the relevant financial year.</p>

<p>An exemption applied to certain students being paid in their own right.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>If eligibility and notification provisions were met, one of the following Schoolkids Bonus payments was paid following the relevant 1 January or 30 June bonus test day from 2013 to 2016 inclusive.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
start up payment if a child started or was due to start primary or secondary level education or an eligible activity in the 6 months following the bonus test day</li>
		<li>
regular Schoolkids Bonus payment</li>
		<li>
<a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-03080100-01.html">School Leaver Payment</a> if the student completed secondary school in the 6 months before the bonus test day and had undertaken primary or secondary education on at least 1 day in 2012</li>

<p>The Schoolkids Bonus amount depended on whether the primary or secondary rate applied. The rate was subject to indexation.</p>

<p>Only one Schoolkids Bonus payment is paid per child unless an FTB Part A child was subject to a shared care or blended family assessment on the bonus test day. In these cases Schoolkids Bonus is apportioned accordingly and the total amount for the eligible child would not exceed 100%.</p>

<p>If Schoolkids Bonus is paid to an FTB customer for a child for a bonus test day, no Schoolkids Bonus payment can be made directly to the child for the bonus test day.</p>

<p>If Schoolkids Bonus is paid directly to a student receiving an income support payment in their own right for a bonus test day, no Schoolkids Bonus payment can be made to another person (e.g. their parent or guardian) for the student for the bonus test day.</p>

<p>If a duplicate payment has been made, for example, a payment made by both Services Australia and the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA), a debt should be raised by Services Australia due to delegations under the legislation.</p>

<p>A Schoolkids Bonus debt could arise if the customer was not entitled to the payment for any reason, including loss of entitlement to the qualifying payment (for example, FTB Part A or Youth Allowance) or income being above the $100,000 limit for the relevant financial year.</p>

<p>At the end of the 2014-15 or 2015-16 financial years, if the customer's actual adjusted taxable income for the relevant financial year was more than $100,000, their entitlement to Schoolkids Bonus was reassessed.</p>
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L3GT_Family_Tax_Bene01"></a>
<h3>Family Tax Benefit (FTB)</h3>


<p>Schoolkids Bonus is reassessed during FTB reconciliation. If actual adjusted taxable income is more than $100,000 an automatic SKB debt is created and an automatic account payable issued. Debts are raised as Schoolkids Bonus debts, not as a component of FTB.</p>

<p>If a Schoolkids Bonus was paid to an FTB customer and the student is then granted an income support payment, consider who received the Schoolkids Bonus payment in determining whether or not a debt is to be raised.</p>

<p>Schoolkids Bonus debts can be recovered from an FTB top up or through withholding of ongoing FTB fortnightly payments. Schoolkids Bonus entitlement may be used to offset family assistance debts.</p>
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L3GT_Income_support_01"></a>
<h3>Income support payments (ISP)</h3>


<p>Schoolkids Bonus was reassessed when information about the customer's income was received or identified. In these cases, a manual override was recorded to preclude payment of Schoolkids Bonus to income support payment customers for the relevant financial year.</p>

<p>A Manual Follow-up (MFU) activity is now created if the system identifies an increase in Schoolkids Bonus entitlement as a result of ISP reassessment.</p>
