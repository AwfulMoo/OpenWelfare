the costs of borrowing to invest in the financial investment</li>

<p>It is important to note that all deductions allowed by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) for the purpose of Net investment losses are allowed as deductions for the purpose of the Carer Allowance income test. The reason these losses are separately identified is so they can be added back to the carer's or their partner's taxable income.</p>

<p>Partnership or trust losses declared on an individual's income tax return are not added back for the Carer Allowance income test. Carers should not include these as Net investment losses.</p></td>

<p>Tom bought an investment unit for $400 000. The property was negatively-geared. That is, the interest on the mortgage Tom took out to buy the property ($20 000 per annum) exceeded the rental income ($15 600 per annum). In addition to the mortgage payments, Tom also had to pay $4000 per annum in other expenses (rates, management fees and body corporate).</p>
