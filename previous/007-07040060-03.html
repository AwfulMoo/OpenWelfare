<p>The requirement is for the child to be enrolled in study that will assist or allow them to obtain the year 12 equivalent in that country. Some countries call the end of secondary school different things, for example year 10, International Baccalaureate, Senior Year, etc., but the key issue is whether the child is completing secondary schooling.</p>

<p>Customers with children intending to study outside Australia should contact before the child leaves Australia and provide information so that a determination can be made by processing staff.</p>

<p>Normal <a href="../families/007-02080000-01.html">Family Tax Benefit (FTB) portability rules</a> will apply for eligible children studying overseas.</p>

<p>Customers should be referred to the Australian Qualifications Framework website. See <a href="../families/007-07040060-05.html">Resources</a> page for a link.</p>

<p>Information required includes&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
name of institution the child is studying</li>
		<li>
subjects being studied</li>
		<li>
name of course</li>
		<li>
the qualification (if any) the student will receive upon completion of the course</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the child will be studying outside Australia for <strong>less than 6 weeks</strong>, they will remain on their parent/guardian's Health Care Card.</p>

<p>If the customer has indicated that their child is/was studying outside Australia, this must be referred to appropriately trained Smart Centre staff<strong>&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Refer to FCC Smart Centre Processing staff using <strong>Fast Note </strong>&gt; Auto Text &gt; <strong>Families </strong>&gt; <strong>Updates </strong>&gt;<strong>  Child Overseas Study Details</strong></li>

<p>The <a href="../families/007-07040060-05.html">Resources</a> page contains a task card.</p>

<p>If the course is not on the task card, the customer will need to answer some questions about the study their child is undertaking. Currently a letter (QSS32) must be issued to the customer so that their responses can be obtained and recorded in a <strong>DOC</strong>.</p>

<p>If an adjusted study load assessment is needed because the customer advises that the child is studying less than full-time, run the <strong>Callback/Actdoc</strong> Guided Procedure and transfer to Smart Centre Processing.

<p>A child may have an adjusted study load (reduced hours compared to what would normally be considered a full-time load), and still satisfy the education/study requirements if the reason for less than full-time secondary study is beyond the child's control.</p>

<p>This does not include lifestyle choices (e.g. part-time study to allow for part-time work). This recognises that the child has some capacity to undertake study.</p>

<p>The following circumstances indicate acceptable reasons for a child to have an adjusted study load&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Near completion of an approved course - a child may have a reduced study load as remaining subject/block/class to complete a year 12 or equivalent qualification is the equivalent of part-time study, for example child has 1 subject remaining in year 12</li>
		<li>
Qualification - not qualified to undertake course</li>
		<li>
Disability - a permanent physical, psychiatric, intellectual or learning disability, for example child has autism and studies part-time</li>
		<li>
Medical - accident, illness or injury</li>
		<li>
Personal - substance abuse, behavioural problems, extreme bullying</li>
		<li>
Family - death of an immediate family member, family and domestic violence, family eviction, caring responsibilities</li>
		</ul>
<p>Adjusted study loads are reviewed, however, if the adjusted study load is due to disability, no further review will be conducted.</p>

<p>If the adjustment is less than 13 weeks, the child is to be regarded as a full-time secondary student.</p>

<p>There is no limit on the period of an adjusted study load.</p>

<p>This is either the date the child enrolled in the course or their first day of the course, whichever is <strong>earlier</strong>.</p>

<p>The policy states that eligibility begins from the time a child <strong>intends</strong> to study. <strong>Intention to study</strong> can be measured by enrolment. Generally, enrolment happens before the student actually starts education/study, so the earliest day FTB can be paid is the day of enrolment.</p>

<p><strong>Holiday periods</strong></p>

<p>If a child is enrolled in a course, FTB eligibility continues through holiday periods (Christmas, Easter, mid-semester, etc.). FTB eligibility during these periods would only cease if the child decides not to continue their study, they then would cease to be a student for FTB purposes from the date they decided not to continue study.</p>

<p><strong>Change of study/training providers</strong></p>

<p>In some states a child will have to change schools at the end of year 10 to complete their year 12 qualification. In these circumstances the child is considered to be undertaking continuing study and continues to be FTB eligible.</p>

<p>For students in continuing study, FTB eligibility is ongoing (no gaps/breaks).</p>

<p>If a child decides to repeat year 12 at a secondary school they may be considered to be in full-time secondary study.</p>

<p>If a child has completed an equivalent qualification (for example, they have completed a certificate II) and they decide to complete year 12, they cannot be considered to be in full-time secondary study. See the <a href="../families/007-07040060-05.html">Resources</a> page for further information.</p>

<p>The rate of FTB payable depends on when the child returns to full-time secondary study. If the child returns to year 12&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Before the last day of the first term following the end of their study period, the customer may be paid <strong>up to</strong> the maximum rate of FTB continuously with no gap</li>
		<li>
After the last day of the first term following the end of their study period, there <strong>will</strong> be a gap in entitlement to FTB. The customer may be paid <strong>up to</strong> the maximum rate from the day they return to full-time secondary study</li>
		</ul>
<p>Use the term dates for the relevant state/territory. See <a href="../families/007-07040060-05.html">Resources</a> page for details.</p>

<p><strong>Allowable break exemptions</strong></p>

<p>If they intended to return to school in the first term following the end of their last study period but were unable to (e.g. injury, illness), consider an exemption from the FTB activity test. This is a discretionary decision. See <a href="../families/007-07040060-05.html">Resources</a> page for an example.</p>

<p>If an exemption is granted, they would remain a full-time secondary student.</p>

<p>Children aged 16 years and over may be home schooled but it must be in an approved course leading towards a year 12 or equivalent qualification. Where the State or Territory Government education authority has given specific approval for the child to undertake home schooling, the Authority must confirm that the study is full-time and will be credited towards the secondary qualification accredited by that authority.</p>

<p>If the child is in home schooling that is not registered with the relevant State or Territory Education authority and there is no satisfactory exemption reason, the parent/carer would not be eligible to receive FTB.</p>

<p>However, it is important to look at why parents/carers choose to home school their children. There may be an appropriate exemption reason, depending on the circumstances. See <a href="../families/007-07040060-03.html#bp03_tbl_Exemptions_rep_3">Item 3</a> for further information or examples on the <a href="../families/007-07040060-05.html">Resources</a> page.</p>

<p>If an exemption assessment is needed because the customer states why the child is not in full-time secondary study, run the <strong>Callback/Actdoc</strong> guided procedure using&#58;</p>

<p>A child may not have the capacity to study and so may be exempt from the full-time study requirement in any of the following circumstances&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Education Institution - no locally accessible course or there is no place in the course. This circumstance would be unlikely given home schooling and online learning options</li>
		<li>
Qualification - the child is not qualified to undertake an approved course. Note that study has to <strong>lead</strong> to an approved year 12 or equivalent qualification. This circumstance would be unlikely given the vast range of courses available via different channels (self-paced, home schooling and online). A child aged 16-19 studying at the primary or pre-primary level could be considered for this exemption</li>
		<li>
Disability - the child has a permanent physical, psychiatric, intellectual or learning disability. The customer should be invited to claim Carer Payment and/or Carer Allowance and advised that the young person may claim Disability Support Pension.</li>
		<li>
<strong>Special Circumstances&#58; circumstances that make it unreasonable to require the child to undertake an approved course of study for any of the following reasons&#58;</strong></li>
			<ul>			<li>
<strong>Medical Circumstances</strong> such as an accident, illness or injury. In this category the medical circumstance is not permanent but would last longer than 13 weeks</li>
			<li>
<strong>Personal Circumstances</strong> such as substance abuse, behavioural problems, or extreme bullying (a child may experience such extreme bullying that they do not have the capacity to study via home schooling, online or external channels – this may be an appropriate circumstance to seek verification, the evidence needs to support that the child does not have the capacity for any form of full-time secondary study)</li>
			<li>
<strong>Family Circumstances</strong> such as the death of an immediate family member, family and domestic violence, family eviction or caring responsibilities</li>
			<li>
<strong>Other Circumstances</strong> as considered appropriate. For example, a child aged 16 years or over who has migrated to Australia as a refugee may not be enrolled in full-time secondary study. If it is intended that the child is to be enrolled, an exemption from the study requirements may be granted for an initial 13 weeks. The start date is the date of arrival or date the child became an FTB child. Consider each case on its merit as there could be barriers preventing the child from enrolling or settlement issues where a permanent exemption may be applicable</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>Generally, a child can be exempt for up to 12 months. If circumstances change and the child can return to study, a review will be conducted at this time.</p>

<p>Children with a permanent disability will not be subject to a review.</p>

<p>Verification of circumstances for an adjusted study or exemption is discretionary.</p>

<p>If the request is for medical reasons, the child's status as Carer Allowance current is used as evidence.</p>

<p>If the customer can provide detail concerning the reason for the exemption, i.e. verbal statement of intervention being sought to assist the child towards overcoming the circumstance, then it would be reasonable to accept this without seeking evidence, for a first request for an exemption.</p>

<p>It is reasonable to seek verification if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
A child is not completing year 12 or equivalent qualification</li>
		<li>
A second or subsequent temporary exemption is requested</li>
		<li>
FTB for the child has cancelled because the customer did not give a reason why the child was not in full-time study, and the customer subsequently re-claims and requests an exemption or states that the child intends to enrol</li>
		</ul>
<p>The customer is responsible for verifying that the course is considered to be a Certificate Level II course under the Australian Qualifications Framework if it is unclear whether the course is an approved course.</p>

<p>Evidence to verify an adjusted study load or an exemption could include, but is not limited to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
details from educational institutions</li>

state welfare and housing agencies</li>
