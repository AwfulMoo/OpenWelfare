<p>After initial reconciliation of FTB has completed, re-reconciliation will be automatically triggered if the details used to calculate FTB entitlement for the relevant financial year are updated.</p>

<p>Re-reconciliation automatically compares the customer's entitlement based on the new information with the earlier reconciliation result.</p>

<p>Re-reconciliation will occur if, for example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Centrelink receives new actual adjusted taxable income details from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). <strong>The ATO link ends after three years </strong>unless the customer has an outstanding FTB non-lodger debt. If actual income details are required for a year for which the link has ended, for example, after 30 June 2015 for 2011-12, the customer will need to provide their Notice of Assessment (NOA) and tax return (if available). See <a href="../families/007-13020010-01.html">Mutual Customer Identification (MCI) process for family assistance customers</a></li>
		<li>
The customer <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-05030040-01.html">revises their estimate of taxable income</a> for the relevant financial year</li>
		<li>
The customer advises their <a href="../families/007-07060040-01.html">FTB deferred child's income</a> was below/ not below the child income limit and this is updated on the Child Student/Income Circumstances (<strong>CHSI</strong>) screen</li>
		<li>
The customer advises of a return to work after caring for a child during the relevant financial year. See <a href="../families/007-11010060-01.html">Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part B quarantine and the reconciliation process</a></li>
		<li>
A non-lodger exemption reason is coded for the current partner or ex-partner by the end of the lodgement year</li>
		<li>
A customer and/or their partner lodges a tax return having previously advised they were not required to lodge a tax return, or having been treated as exempt from lodging</li>
		<li>
A circumstance change with a date of effect in the relevant financial year is recorded (for example, child left care)</li>
		<li>
A retrospective change (increase or decrease) to a child support assessment for a private collect customer is received from Child Support</li>
		<li>
There is a retrospective change (increase or decrease) to a child support assessment for a child support collect customer and the Maintenance Income Credit (MIC) offset amount changes</li>
		<li>
There is a retrospective change in a child's immunisation or health check status which results in a reassessment of the FTB Part A rate reduction</li>
		<li>
For periods after 1 July 2018, there is a retrospective change to a customer's Income Support Payment status, this could include removal of ISP eligibility or retrospective calculation of a nil rate period due to employment income. Both scenarios would result in the customer being subject to FTB Part A income test</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Customer disagrees with actual ATO income?</strong> A customer may advise that their taxation Notice of Assessment (NOA) shows a different amount from that transferred by the ATO and shown on their customer record. This could be because the NOA only shows the customer's taxable income component.</p>

<p>Assessable income for Centrelink is the customer's adjusted taxable income (ATI), which includes other components such as exempt reportable fringe benefits, other reportable fringe benefits, reportable superannuation contributions and total net investment losses (for example) which are not displayed on a customer's tax NOA from the ATO.</p>

<p><strong>Wrong actual income?</strong> If the taxable income on a customer's NOA shows a different taxable income amount from that transferred by the ATO and shown on the customer's record (for example, no link with the ATO, wrong Tax File Number recorded), there may be a mismatch with the Mutual Customer Identification (MCI) link. See <a href="../families/007-13020010-01.html">Mutual Customer Identification (MCI) process for family assistance customers</a>.</p>

<p>The amounts could also differ as a result of the customer accessing superannuation funds under the First Home Super Saver (FHSS) Scheme. For these customers, income details transferred by the ATO will automatically have amounts released under the FHSS Scheme excluded, as these do not form part of a customer's adjusted taxable income (ATI). However, the taxable income amount on their NOA maybe higher than the amount reported by the ATO via the data link on our system as the ATO does regard a portion of the released funds as taxable.</p>

<p><strong>Zero entitlement?</strong> If the re-reconciliation result is that the customer had nil entitlement to FTB Part A and/or FTB Part B as actual income precluded entitlement <strong>and</strong> it is the second of two consecutive zero entitlement years from the 2009-10 financial year, the customer may be subject to the <a href="../families/007-11010150-01.html">non-payment of FTB by instalments</a>.</p>

Re-reconciliation can result in a top-up, overpayment or nil adjustment. An automatic letter will be sent if there is an adjustment to the previous reconciliation result</li>
		<li>
For customers to receive their full annual FTB entitlement, income lodgement requirements, must be met within the allowable period.</li>

For the 2012-13 financial year onwards, see <a href="../families/007-07030010-01.html">Assessing special circumstances extensions for families unable to meet lodgement and other specific requirements for Family Tax Benefit (FTB) and Single Income Family Supplement (SIFS)</a></li>

<a href="../families/007-11060000-01.html">Debt offsetting</a> will automatically apply from 10 June 2019. FTB top-ups, supplements, lump sum claim amounts and instalment arrears can be used to recover any family assistance, social security, student assistance and Paid Parental Leave scheme payment debts. This will occur even if the customer has a current payment arrangement. Previously, FTB amounts could only be used to recover FTB, Child Care Benefit (CCB) and Child Care Rebate (CCR) debts</li>
		</ul>
<p>In some cases, overpayment processing will need to be completed manually. For provisional 2016-17 re-reconciliation activities of single income support payment (ISP) customers who have now lodged a tax return, see the <a href="../families/007-11010180-03.html#bp03_L3TT_FTB_manual_rer">FTB manual re-reconciliation</a> table.</p>

<p>If the customer or their partner lodges a tax return having previously advised they were not required to lodge, or having been treated as exempt from lodging, FTB will be re-reconciled using information provided by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) including actual income and the tax return lodgement date.</p>

<p>If the taxation lodgement occurs after the end of the <strong>allowable period</strong>, the customer will be assessed as a late-lodger, which may result in previously paid supplements being raised as a debt.</p>

<p>The reason the customer or their partner has now a lodged tax return will need to be considered to determine if the late lodger rules apply.</p>

<p>Service Officers should discuss with the customer the reason for taxation lodgement and any income variations. The tax lodgement requirement may be due to non income events. The customer or their partner&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
having paid tax from income received during the relevant financial year (regardless of the amount), or </li>
		<li>
because they had a child support assessment for the relevant financial year</li>
		</ul>
<p>If a customer or their partner had a requirement to lodge a tax return for the financial year the requirement to lodge replaces any earlier non-lodgement notifications that have been made.</p>

<p><strong>What to do&#58;</strong></p>

<p><strong>If the customer or their partner had a requirement to lodge a tax return for the financial year&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
They cannot be assessed as exempt from tax lodgement for FTB. The customer will therefore be a late lodger for FTB reconciliation</li>
		<li>
Advise the customer supplements (including SIFS) are not payable and that any debt will need to be repaid</li>
		</ul>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> from the 2016-17 financial year onwards, FTB Part A supplement is not payable to families with an adjusted taxable income (ATI) of more than the Part A supplement income limit for the relevant income year. A supplement override to include the Part A supplement should <strong>not </strong>be coded for 2016-17 and later financial years where the family's ATI exceeds the income limit.</p>

<p>The FTB Part A supplement income limit also applies to income support payment customers.</p>
