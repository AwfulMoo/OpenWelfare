<p><strong>DSP customer's child has been critically injured overseas</strong></p>

<p>A DSP customer attends a service centre to advise their child was in a tuk-tuk accident in Thailand and is critically injured. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFaT) have contacted the customer advising the child is in a critical state.</p>

<p>The Service Officer runs the Portability Script - Departures and Returns, which identifies the DSP customer has already travelled overseas for 3 weeks in a rolling 12 month period. There is only 1 week of general portability remaining. The script will ask the user why the person is travelling, and the user can advise it is due to an 'acute family crisis'.</p>

<p>As a result, the script advises to refer the customer to CIS to make the decision on the customer's eligibility for ongoing payments while overseas. Only CIS have the delegation for approved reason portability decisions.</p>

<p>Upon receiving the referral, CIS Service Officer has heard about this situation on the news, or calls DFaT to confirm and approves portability for 2 weeks for the customer to travel to Thailand and visit the child. DSP will be paid for 2 weeks due to the Approved Temporary Absence, and may be paid for 1 more week due to accessing the remaining general portability period while outside Australia.</p></td>

<p><strong>DSP customer remains an Australian resident for DSP and is leaving Australia before 1 January 2013 for less than 13 weeks</strong></p>

<p>Peter arrived in Australia from South Africa in May 1976. Peter has lived in Australia continuously and after an accident at work in 1987, was granted DSP in 1989 (the DSP qualifying event). Peter is departing Australia on holiday for South Africa to spend time with family for 12 weeks.</p>

<p>Peter's DSP payment is portable during this temporary absence due to continuing to remain an Australian resident for DSP purposes. Peter will continue to be paid full rate of pension for the duration of absence from Australia. Peter is still paying rent in Australia; during this absence will continue to receive RA. The <a href="../australians-overseas/061-01070080-01.html">Pension Supplement</a> will also continue to be paid during the absence.</p></td>

<p><strong>DSP customer remains an Australian resident and is leaving Australia before 1 January 2013 for 12 months</strong></p>

<p>Suppose the same case as above, however, Peter is going to South Africa for 12 months. Peter will continue to remain an Australian resident for DSP purposes during this absence. Peter has been working 7 or 8 hours per week for the past 2 years.</p>

<p>As Peter is not terminally ill or paid under the <a href="../australians-overseas/061-01040000-01.html">pre 1 July 2004 portability rules</a>, the payment will cease after 13 weeks absence from Australia.</p>

<p>Peter's add-ons are portable for the first 13 weeks. If Peter returns to Australia within 13 weeks of the DSP suspension at the end of the 13 weeks portability, the payment can be restored from the date of returning to Australia. However, if Peter was receiving a transitional rate of pension, entitlement to this rate will be lost and Peter will be paid under the new rules upon restoration. Arrears are not paid for the period between the end of the maximum portability period (13 weeks) and the return to Australia.</p>

<p>If Peter returns to Australia more than 13 weeks after the end of the maximum portability period, Peter will have to reapply for DSP pension on returning to Australia. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> if Peter is a grandfathered case, the savings provision will be lost if the payment is cancelled. When considering the medical qualifications and Impairment Tables, it may mean Peter is no longer qualified for DSP and must claim another payment type.</p></td>

<p>Jarrod has been on DSP since 16 years of age due to a congenital birth defect considered a manifest condition, with reason <strong>INT</strong> under the manifest guidelines. On 14 August 2012, Jarrod decided to travel overseas with parents for an indefinite period.</p>

<p>Jarrod's DSP will be payable for the full absence due to satisfying the 'no future work capacity' portability provisions, and a medical assessment is not required.</p></td>

<p><strong>Severely disabled customer leaving Australia before 1 July 2004</strong></p>

<p>Elizabeth was born in Canada and arrived in Australia to live in 1987. Elizabeth was in a car accident and badly injures in 1992, while travelling home from work (the DSP qualifying event). Elizabeth was granted DSP in 1997 after the compensation preclusion period and is unable to work again. The medical review indicated Elizabeth is severely disabled. Elizabeth went to Canada to live (ceased Australian residence) in December 2003 and has not returned to Australia as a resident since. At that time, the DSP was portable indefinitely due to Elizabeth being considered severely disabled.</p>

<p>Elizabeth finally returned to Australia in 2007 for a short holiday. DSP continues to be portable indefinitely because Elizabeth was outside Australia on 1 July 2004 and is therefore paid under the <a href="../australians-overseas/061-01040000-01.html">pre 1 July 2004 portability rules</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if Elizabeth returned to Australia for residence, Elizabeth would lose the savings provision. If Elizabeth then left Australia to live in Canada, the pension would only be portable for a temporary absence up to the maximum portability period (from 1 January 2015, 28 days in a rolling 12 month period) unless the 'no future work capacity' portability provisions are satisfied. However, Elizabeth would be able to transfer to the Canadian Agreement if remaining severely disabled.</p></td>

<p><strong>Customer ceasing to reside in Australia and going to an agreement country</strong></p>

<p>Marco was born in Italy in 1950 and arrived in Australia in 1975. Marco lived and worked in Australia for 10 years then returned to Italy in 1985. Marco worked in Italy for 4 years before ceasing work because of an accident (the DSP qualifying event) and returned to live in Australia in 1989. In 1990, Marco was granted DSP with add-ons, Rent Assistance, Pharmaceutical Allowance and Telephone Allowance. In November 2012, Marco advised of the intention to return to live in Italy (ceased Australian residence).</p>

<p>Marco is neither terminally ill, nor satisfies the 'no future work capacity' portability provisions, so the pension will cease immediately on departing Australia.</p>

<p>Marco is returning to Italy and has been assessed as severely disabled. Therefore, Marco can be transferred to a pension under the Italian Agreement on the departure from Australia. Marco's pension will be paid the agreement rate according to the Australian working life residence.</p></td>

<p><strong>Approved portability and payability for later absences</strong></p>

<p>A DSP customer contacted the agency on 1 June 2016 to arrange portability for forthcoming overseas holidays. The customer will depart 2 June 2016 and return 23 June, using 21 days of portability. Later they plan to travel for another 7 day holiday from 3 October, returning 10 October.</p>

<p>The Service Officer ran the Portability Script - Departures and Returns for the first absence, which identified the customer could be paid for the whole of that absence.</p>

<p>The customer contacted on 23 July 2016 to say they had just returned from visiting their child for 10 days who was in a tuk-tuk accident in Thailand and critically injured. A CIS Service Officer approved portability for 10 days 13 - 22 July 2016 and the customer was back in Australia on 23 July 2016 without loss of payments.</p>

<p>The customer did not make further contact; on 3 and 10 October, the agency received advice via the immigration datalink that the customer had completed their October absence as originally planned. On 10 October the agency could see the customer was&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
payable 2 - 22 June 2016 using 21 days of the 4 weeks in a rolling 12 month period</li>
		<li>
payable 13 - 22 July 2016 using 10 days of an approved absence (these days are not counted towards the 28 days, as the absence was for an acute family crisis)</li>
		<li>
payable on 3 - 10 October 2016 using 7 days of the 4 weeks in a rolling 12 month period</li>
		</ul>
<p>Based on the above details on the 10 October 2016&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer has used all 4 weeks (28 days) payability outside Australia, and has actually been paid for 38 days in the previous 12 months, and</li>
		<li>
the first day they can depart Australia and remain payable is 2 June 2017; as at this date they has 27 days (while current DSP) outside Australia in the previous 12 months (3 June 2016 - 2 June 2017 being exactly 12 months).
