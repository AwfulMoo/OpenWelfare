<p>Parental Leave Pay (PPL) is a payment of up to 18 weeks (90 payable days). For children that are born or adopted <strong>on or after 1 July 2020</strong>, it is made up of&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a continuous PPL period of up to 12 weeks, plus</li>
		<li>
30 Flexible PPL days</li>
		</ul>
<p>Customers will be eligible for Flexible PPL if they have met the eligibility requirements to receive the PPL period. <a href="../families/007-09020010-01.html">Eligibility for Parental Leave Pay (PPL) as a primary claimant</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Exception&#58;</strong> Customers that are not eligible for payment of the PPL period for any of the following reasons will be eligible for up to 30 Flexible PPL days&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
primary claimants that are not eligible for the PPL period due to returning to work between the child’s date of birth/entry into care and the PPL period start date</li>
		<li>
primary claimants that are not eligible for the PPL period due to claiming PPL after they have returned to work</li>
		<li>
primary claimants that are not eligible for a PPL period due to transferring it to a secondary claimant</li>
		<li>
claimants that are not eligible for the PPL period due to losing their Newly Arrived Resident’s Waiting Period (NARWP) exemption between the child’s date of birth/entry into care and the PPL period start date</li>
		</ul>
<p>Once a customer’s eligibility is determined, they will have a balance of&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
up to 30 Flexible PPL days, if they are the primary claimant</li>
		<li>
up to the number of Flexible PPL days the primary claimant has given permission for another person to claim, if they are a secondary claimant</li>
		</ul>
<p>If a customer claims a Flexible PPL day and it is later rejected or withdrawn, it is returned to their unclaimed balance. It will be available for the customer to claim on an alternate day. </p>

<p>Customers are assessed for both components in their initial claim for PPL. They do not need to lodge a separate claim to be assessed for Flexible PPL.</p>

<p>However before a Flexible PPL day can be paid, the customer must tell Services Australia when they want to receive it. They can do this in the initial claim or at a later time.</p>

<p>If a customer does not claim all of their Flexible PPL days in their initial claim, they have up to 2 years after their child’s birth or adoption to claim the remaining days, they can also make changes to their claimed Flexible PPL days during this time.</p>

<p>Customers can do this <img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> online, by phone, or in person, and do not need to complete a new claim for PPL.</p>

<p>To be eligible to get Flexible PPL on a day nominated by the customer, the customer must, on the nominated date&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
be the primary carer of the PPL child</li>
		<li>
not be working (they can be on paid or unpaid leave). <strong>Note&#58;</strong> exemptions apply for work performed for permissible purpose and Keeping in Touch (KIT) days. See <a href="../families/007-05040040-01.html">Parental Leave Pay (PPL) customer returns to work</a></li>
		<li>
meet Australian residence requirements, and</li>
		<li>
have completed the Flexible PPL declaration</li>
		</ul>
<p>Additionally, customers <strong>cannot</strong> get Flexible PPL on a date that&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
they or another person are being paid PPL for the same child</li>
		<li>
they are receiving or have been paid Dad and Partner Pay (DAP) for the child</li>
		<li>
is before or during their or their partners PPL period (even if they are ineligible for the PPL period e.g. returned to work during the PPL period). The exception are customers who have a PPL period shortened due to a reason of C12 (12 months passed since DOB/DOC) as the PPL period end date is recognised</li>
		<li>
is before the child’s date of birth/adoption</li>
		<li>
is after the child’s second birthday/anniversary of adoption</li>
		</ul>
<p>In most cases, customers cannot nominate dates that are more than 42 days in the past. Exceptions apply for customers that&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
received a COVID-19 Disaster Payment (paid by Services Australia on or after 3 June 2021)</li>
		<li>
meet the <a href="../families/007-05020030-01.html">PPL extended work test</a>, or </li>
		<li>
in limited circumstances (such as to correct an unfavourable decision that has been reviewed)</li>
		</ul>
<p>When claiming a Flexible PPL day the customer must declare via the Flexible PPL Declaration that they met or will meet the eligibility requirements on the claimed date. The declaration is located in the PPL claim, <strong>PPL circumstances</strong> Guided Procedure and Paid Parental Leave Circumstances online service. The <a href="../families/007-20030334-05.html">Resources</a> page contains a link to the declaration text.</p>

<p>Before the payment is generated, the customer’s residence and primary care status is checked. If the customer has&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
asked to get Flexible PPL on a date they do not meet residency or care requirements, the day will be rejected</li>
		<li>
already been paid Flexible PPL for this day, it will be raised as an overpayment </li>
		</ul>
<p>When a day is rejected, it&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
is returned to the balance of unclaimed days, and </li>
		<li>
can be claimed for another day within 2 years of the child’s birth or adoption</li>

		<ul>		<li>
<strong>connected to the PPL period,</strong> as a block of up to 6 weeks (30 days). This will give them a continuous block of PPL of up to 18 weeks. The system will automatically allocate dates for these days based on the end of their PPL period</li>
		<li>
<strong>not connected to the PPL period</strong>, paid separately at any time after the PPL period and up to the PPL child’s second birthday / anniversary of adoption. The customer must select the dates they want to get these days</li>

claim,</li>
			<li>
meet eligibility criteria, and</li>

<p>Customers can choose to connect some or all of their Flexible PPL days to their 12 week PPL period. This will give them their PPL as a continuous block of up to 18 weeks).</p>

<p>Connected Flexible PPL days will be paid on the weekdays immediately following the last day of their PPL period. Customers&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
are not required to nominate specific dates for these days. They will be determined based on the customer’s PPL period end date</li>
		<li>
only need to nominate how many days they wish to connect to their PPL period</li>
		</ul>
<p>Connected Flexible PPL days will be delivered in the same way as their PPL period.</p>

<p><strong>Exception&#58;</strong> The PPL paymaster role automatically ceases 52 weeks after the child’s date of birth/adoption. If the number of connected Flexible PPL days results in the continuous block of PPL extending beyond this date, the Flexible PPL days payable after this date will be delivered by Services Australia. The <a href="../families/007-20030334-05.html">Resources</a> page contains an example.</p>

<p>Customers can change the number of connected Flexible PPL days connected to their PPL period up to the day before their PPL period start date. They can do this by&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
using the Paid Parental Leave Circumstances online service,</li>
		<li>
using the Flexible Paid Parental Leave Express Plus mobile application or</li>
		<li>
contacting Services Australia</li>
		</ul>
<p>Once the customer’s PPL period has commenced, they cannot increase the number of Flexible PPL days connected to their PPL period. However, they can decrease their number of connected days to the end of the PPL period to the date of notification. Any connected days prior to the date of notification cannot be withdrawn.</p>

<p>Connected Flexible PPL days will be paid after the PPL period as an unbroken continuous block.</p>

<p>The continuous block of PPL is broken if the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
loses eligibility for PPL (for example they return to work), or</li>
		<li>
claims a Flexible PPL day that is on a Saturday or Sunday between 2 connected Flexible PPL days. If this happens the continuous block of PPL will be broken.

<p><strong>Impact of return to work on connected Flexible PPL days</strong></p>

<p>If a customer returns to work before the end of the PPL period or connected Flexible PPL days, all connected Flexible PPL days after the return to work date will be reassessed. These days will be rejected or withdrawn and returned to the customer’s balance of unclaimed days.

		<div class="block">

<p>Customers (and/or their partners) who are receiving an income support payment or have been paid Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part B, may incur an overpayment if their PPL period or Flexible PPL day/s are paid for a period in the past. Customers can minimise the risk and amount of an overpayment by choosing future dates for their Flexible PPL days.</p>

<p><strong>Customer or partner receives an income support payment (ISP)</strong></p>

<p>PPL (including Flexible PPL days) is treated as ordinary income for determining eligibility and calculating the rate of ISP.</p>

<p><strong>Customer or partner receives family assistance</strong></p>

<p>FTB Part B is not payable on days that the customer or their partner receives PPL, including Flexible PPL days. Customers should include PPL as part of their estimated taxable income used for family assistance payments. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-05030010-01.html">Helping families provide a reasonable annual income estimate for family assistance payments</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Child Support deductions</strong></p>

<p>Child support deductions (for example, payments of child support to another person) can be made from PPL, including Flexible PPL days for future days. Flexible PPL days that are not connected to the PPL period or are paid in arrears are not subject to child support payer deductions. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-51020030-01.html">Child support deductions from income support payments</a>.</p>

<p><strong>JobKeeper Payment</strong></p>

<p>Customers cannot receive JobKeeper Payment for the same period they receive PPL. <strong>Note&#58; </strong>JobKeeper Payment does not preclude PPL entitlement. However, PPL does preclude entitlement to JobKeeper Payment for the same period.</p>

<p>It is the customer’s responsibility to advise their employer the dates they have claimed PPL, including their PPL period and Flexible PPL days. If a customer has queries or questions about JobKeeper payment tell them to discuss with their employer.</p>

<p><strong>COVID-19 Disaster Payment</strong></p>

<p>COVID-19 Disaster Payments (paid by Services Australia on or after 3 June 2021) cannot be paid to customers who have any PPL payments paid within the same period. Some customers who intend to claim COVID-19 Disaster Payments may choose to withdraw their future Flexible PPL days until they cease to be eligible for COVID-19 Disaster Payments.</p>

<p> <strong>Note&#58;</strong> even if a customer receives one Flexible PPL day in the COVID-19 Disaster Payment relevant period they, will not be eligible for the COVID-19 Disaster Payment.</p>

claim status will remain open (OPN) to allow them to notify a change in circumstances for their Flexible PPL days</li>

<p>The claim status will change to closed (CLO) 2 years after the child’s date of birth or adoption.</p>

<p>The PPL benefit status is on the benefit status line and the overall claim status is displayed on the PPL Calculation Summary (<strong>P1CS</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>If a customer has multiple OPN claims (for example, if they have a newborn or newly adopted child and have not finished receiving Flexible PPL for an older child), the benefit status line will reflect the most recent claim for PPL.
