<P>When it is established that a customer's address must be updated, then all current addresses (including postal address) and telephone details (including mobile phone numbers) <STRONG>must</STRONG> be checked and updated <IMG title="A self service option is available" alt="" src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png"> online or if required via the Change in Contact Details workflow.</P>
<P>If a customer has been selected for a Rent Assistance (RA) Profile Review, address updates must be done as part of the review. While a RA Profile Review is outstanding, customers and staff will be blocked from updating the address outside the review.</P>

<P>When the job seeker contacts Services Australia to update the details staff must:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Confirm the home address details</LI>
<LI>Access the relevant Customer First (CF) Action Issue</LI>
<LI>Check the Online Diary for scheduled appointments. If appointments need to be rescheduled due to the change of address, update the <A href="../job-seekers/001-02060020-01.html">Online Diary</A></LI>
<LI>Select the <STRONG>Change in Contact Details</STRONG> hyperlink</LI></UL>
<P>The Service Officer also needs to determine if there are any potential impacts on eligibility, mutual obligation requirements and/or ongoing entitlement. For further information on how updating a change of address can interact with a job seeker's jobactive organisation, see <A href="../job-seekers/001-02070010-01.html">Job seeker change of address</A>.
