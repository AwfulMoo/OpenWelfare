<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> all reallocations must be done using the Reallocate an ARO review webform. Arrangements should <strong>not</strong> be made to reallocate reviews without using this form.</p>

<p>The ARO will&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Check the APL system is correctly recorded. If the reallocation is because the review was incorrectly recorded in the APL system, amend the coding so the review is correctly allocated to another ARO</li>
		<li>
Annotate the ARO Progress <strong>DOC</strong> to say reallocation has been requested and the reason, include the text '<strong>Do not delete</strong>'</li>		</ul>

Add extra APL system records according to the ARO counting rules, using the Internal Review/Explanation script. Use the Reallocate an ARO review webform to request these system records.

<p>If the customer requests a face-to-face interview, the ARO contacts their Assistant Director to make arrangements. The Assistant Director will arrange for an ARO in a service centre close to where the customer lives to do the review. The review will be reallocated to that ARO.</p>

<p>Clarify the reason the customer requested a review, explain why the original decision was made and answer the customer’s questions.</p>

inform them the review request will be taken never to have been made. Explain the implications, for example, if they request a review of the same decision at a later time, and the decision is changed, full arrears may not be paid</li>
		<li>
annotate the ARO Progress <strong>DOC</strong> with the time of the discussion and that the customer withdrew their review request </li>

<p>If a customer requests a review of an unrelated decision, the Internal Review/Explanation script must be used to create a new APL record.

<p>The new APL will be referred to a Subject Matter Expert for quality check. If an ARO referral is required, it may not be allocated to the ARO who recorded the review.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> If the customer presents as suicidal or in a life-threatening situation during the phone call, refer them to an <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-12070000-01.html">Integrity and Information Group Social Worker</a>.

Add the keywords '<strong>URGENT</strong>', '!<strong>ARO</strong>' and '<strong>ACTxxx</strong>' (Where ACTxxx is the customer's most relevant payment). See <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-05050020-01.html">Creating Callback and ACTDOC work items</a></li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> do not ask SMEs to undertake assessments if the ARO can complete the review without an assessment being done. For more information, see the <a href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/expired/109-03020020-05-Cobalt.html#bp05_L2GT_Additional_cons">Additional considerations for AROs</a> table on the Resources page.</p>

<p>For requests to Families and Childcare Branch SME, refer the <strong>ACTDOC</strong> to <strong>Region Office Code FCC</strong>.</p>

<p>If recalculation of a debt is needed before a review can be completed&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
create an <strong>ACTDOC</strong> including specific information to be used to recalculate the debt. This may include&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the start and end dates of the debt period</li>
			<li>
any supplementary add on payments, for example Rent Assistance, including date range</li>
			<li>
specific details of any income/assets/other circumstances to be used for the recalculation</li>
			<li>
the keyword '!<strong>ARO</strong>'</li>
			<li>
action the debt officer is required to take when they re-allocate the <strong>ACTDOC</strong> back to the ARO</li>		</ul>
		<li>
transfer the <strong>ACTDOC</strong> to the Regional Office Code of the team responsible for the original debt decision. For requests that Debt Management Branch (DMB) are responsible for, transfer the <strong>ACTDOC</strong> to the following <strong>Region Office Codes (ROC)</strong>&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
'<strong>XWA</strong>' for debt raising decisions. Include the additional keyword ‘<strong>DQADC2</strong>’</li>
			<li>
'<strong>NS7</strong>' for debt recovery decisions</li>
			<li>
'<strong>CTN</strong>' for compensation recovery decisions</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>The DMB are not responsible for all Department of Human Services debts. The majority of DMB debt raising teams have a ROC code beginning with 'X'. HU1 and HU2 are also DMB debt raising teams. AROs should ensure they are referring recalculation requests to the correct team. </p>

<p>Use Work Optimiser to refer the work item representing the <strong>ACTDOC</strong> to the appropriate team. That is, enter the Customer Reference Number (CRN) and select the corresponding work item. If the work item type is incorrect, re-categorise the work item using the appropriate work item type.</p>

<p>Sometimes <strong>ACTDOC</strong>s cannot be actioned within 72 hours. Examples include complicated debt recalculations using MultiCal or additional information required from external parties. The SME is to advise the ARO within 72 hours if a delay is expected.</p>

<p><strong>Claim rejected based on Medical Assessment Team (MAT) recommendation</strong></p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the MAT process does not apply to DSP Medical Risk Based review cancellation decisions.</p>

<p><strong>Rejection or cancellation based on Job Capacity Assessment (JCA) </strong></p>

<p>A Service Officer has rejected the claim or decided to cancel DSP after a DSP Medical Risk Assessment and JCA. The ARO however, considers setting aside the rejection or cancellation decision. The ARO&#58;</p>

<p><strong>Rejection or cancellation based on Disability Medical Assessment (DMA)</strong></p>

<p>A Service Officer has rejected a claim or decided to cancel DSP (as a result of a DSP Medical Risk Assessment) based on a DMA. The ARO however, considers setting aside the decision. The ARO&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
must discuss the decision with their Assistant Director </li>

		</ul>
<p>Following the HPAU opinion/additional evidence, if the ARO decides to set aside the decision&#58;</p>

The ARO emails the Government Contracted Doctor Liaison Officer (GCDLO) advising the decision is to be set aside and includes feedback/reasons.

<p>It is a legal requirement that AROs advise the customer of the outcome of a review in writing. This is done using a decision statement. It is also a legal requirement that AROs advise any affected/added parties of the outcome of a review. See 'Multiple parties affected by a decision' in the <a href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/expired/109-03020020-05-Cobalt.html#bp05_L3TT_Additional_cons">Additional considerations for AROs</a> table on the Resources page.</p>

<p>Related decisions (that is, where more than 1 decision is incorporated in an APL system record) are covered in 1 decision statement. Unrelated decisions (that is, where there are separate APL system records) are covered in separate decision statements. Use the ARO Letter Template to create the decision statement. See 'ARO Letter' in the <a href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/expired/109-03020020-05-Cobalt.html#bp05_tbl_Requirements_fo_Type">Document requirements</a> table in Resources.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> </p>

<p>Separate decision statements are required for family assistance care percentage decisions and their associated debt decisions. See, 'Family assistance care decisions' in the <a href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/expired/109-03020020-05-Cobalt.html#bp05_L3TT_Additional_cons">Additional considerations for AROs</a> table on the Resources page.</p>

<p>AROs must have their decision statement proof read by a peer (another ARO) before finalising the review. This is to ensure the decision statement meets required standards. For information about peer proof reading of ARO letters, see the Quality page on the Appeals Branch SharePoint. AROs need to record the details of the peer check in the ARO Progress <strong>DOC</strong>. </p>
