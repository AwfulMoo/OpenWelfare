<p>All SpB claims for customers under 16 years are to be referred to a social worker for an Unreasonable to Live at Home (UTLAH) Special Benefit assessment. Customers who are referred for this assessment but assessed as not eligible and/or their claim is rejected may still be referred to a social worker for further support and/or referral to external agencies.</p>

<p>Social workers are to refer customer to a State or Territory Welfare Authority for a protective assessment if the customer is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
under 15 years and is homeless or unsupported</li>
		<li>
under 18 years and in in the guardianship, care or custody of a state/territory welfare department, or</li>
		<li>
aged 15 to 17 years (inclusive) and is considered to be at risk of abuse, serious harm or violence</li>
		</ul>
<p>Social workers are to seek the consent of the young person for this referral. Where consent is not provided, the social worker must seek the approval of the Services Australia delegate to release information to the State or Territory Welfare Authority in the public interest. This requirement will be discussed with the customer at the time of the appointment.</p>

<p>The <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-12060030-05.html">Resources</a> page contains a link to information about Youth Protective Assessments and the forms used to refer customers to State or Territory Welfare Authorities.</p>

<p>Customers can be paid Independent Youth Allowance (YA) from 15 years of age, unless they are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
under the minimum school leaving age for the State or Territory in which they reside, and</li>
		<li>
do not have a formal exemption from attending school</li>
		</ul>
<p>SpB may be paid to a young person aged 15 to 17 years (inclusive) who is considered to be at risk of abuse, serious harm or violence prior to the completion of a protective assessment by a state/territory welfare department.</p>

<p>Customers who are under 15 or under the school leaving age may be assessed for SpB.</p>

<p>For under 15 year olds who are at risk of homelessness or are unsupported, SpB should <strong>only</strong> be paid if, after completion of a protective assessment, the state/territory welfare department does <strong>not</strong> intend to provide support to the young person, or it is determined that the support provided by the state/territory welfare department is inadequate. The young person must still meet all eligibility requirements for SpB.</p>

<p>If SpB is granted to a young person under the school leaving age, their qualification for YA must be considered when they reach school leaving age.</p>

<p>Consideration should also be given to whether a parent or guardian, or Approved Care Organisation (ACO) is eligible to claim Family Tax Benefit (FTB) on behalf of the young person. An appropriate parent or guardian is one where there is an established relationship, where the adult/organisation are able to meet the young person's basic needs, and where the adult/organisation is seen to have the young person's best interests in mind.</p>

<p>For customers aged under 15 years, it is mandatory for social workers to consult with their Social Work Manager throughout the UTLAH assessment.</p>

<p>Social workers are to offer the young person a referral to <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-17072600-01.html">social casework</a>. To refer the customer see the Social casework referral table on the Process page in <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-12010000-01.html">Social work service referral</a>.</p>

<p>In certain circumstances, SpB may be paid to a child under 16 years who is an Australian citizen or an Australian permanent resident, but whose custodial parent(s) is not a permanent resident of Australia and is therefore precluded from receiving an income support payment.</p>

<p>SpB can only be paid if the family is in genuine hardship and it has been established that the parent(s) or guardian has no means of adequately supporting the child. Such cases should be considered on their merits and referred to a social worker. Where a social worker determines the child is at serious risk a referral to a state/territory welfare department for a protective assessment should be made.</p>

<p>Social workers are to seek the consent of the customer for this referral. Where consent is not provided, the social worker may seek the approval of a Services Australia delegate to release information to the state or territory welfare department in the public interest. This requirement will be discussed with the customer at the time of the appointment.</p>

<p>SpB is only payable to full-time students under 16 years (including Australian citizens or permanent resident children) if they are a SpB homeless person. An Australian citizen or permanent resident child in the custody of a non-permanent resident parent/s is a SpB homeless person if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the child cannot live at the home of their parent/s because the parent/s is unable to provide the child with a suitable home owing to a lack of accommodation, and</li>
		<li>
the child is not receiving continuous support, whether directly or indirectly and whether financial or otherwise, from a parent or from another person who is acting as the child's guardian on a long-term basis</li>
		</ul>
<p>SpB is not payable to a child who is a full-time student if the family is living in stable accommodation and/or a parent or long-term guardian is providing the child with continuous support.</p>

<p>A child can be regarded as not being able to live at the home of their parent/s owing to a lack of stable accommodation if the child, or their custodial parent/s, is judged to be homeless. The child or the custodial parent/s can be judged to be homeless if rejection or cancellation of SpB would place the child and their parent/s at severe risk of homelessness. Social workers should ensure that there is supporting evidence that the family is homeless or at severe risk of homelessness.</p>

<p>Where the custodial parent has no means of adequately supporting the child who is over school age, and the child is assessed not eligible for SpB, referral to a social worker is also strongly recommended.</p>

<p>The social worker can assist in determining if the child is in genuine hardship by&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
offering advice about help that may be available through external agencies and/or link the custodial parent to appropriate external agencies for assistance</li>
		<li>
assessing the domestic situation e.g. presence of family and domestic violence and whether the customer is eligible for an exemption from maintenance actions to receive the full rate of the Family Tax Benefit (FTB) instead</li>		</ul>

For any Special Benefit claim lodged on or after 1 January 2012, the exemption from the Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Period (NARWP) for family members of an Australian citizen or long term Australian resident will no longer apply to customer who are holders of a Partner Provisional Visa (Subclass 309, 310, 820, 826)</li>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> there is a group of young people who may arrive in Australia on a spouse visa via their parents. In this case, although they hold a partner provisional visa (because that is the visa their parent entered the country on) they are not a spouse or partner.
