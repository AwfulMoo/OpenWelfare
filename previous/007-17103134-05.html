<p>Paul’s child Alex attends Koala Bear Kids. A new child care service open closer to home and Paul decides to start sending Alex there. </p>

<p>On 4 September 2020 Paul gives Koala Bear Kids 2 weeks’ notice that Alex will be ceasing care.</p>

<p>Alex attends Koala Bear Kids for week starting 7 September. Paul gets a call from the new service asking if Alex would like to start attending care with them from the next week, 14 September. Paul agrees.</p>

<p>At this point, as Koala Bear Kids expect Alex to attend the service for another week CCS will not be payable. This is because Paul&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
chose not to send Alex to care, and</li>
		<li>
it was not due to an approved absence reason</li>

<p>A local emergency then occurs in the area and Koala Bear kids have to close for the week from 14 September. CCS will now be payable for the week as this is an approved reason to pay CCS for up to 7 days from Alex’s last attendance.</p>

<p>An enrolment notice is in place for Jimmy who attends Outside School Hours Care 2 days per week. The arrangement start date was 13 January, with no arrangement end date recorded.</p>

<p>The service has been submitting session reports for Jimmy who last attended on 5 February. After that date, the session reports indicated Jimmy was absent (due a combination of illness and on holidays). The service received payments for these absent days as reports were submitted.</p>

<p>On 17 May, the enrolment automatically ‘ceased’ as Jimmy had not attended for 14 consecutive weeks. As a result, all payments for absent days after 5 February to 17 May were recovered from the service. This is because absent days are not payable after the last day the child physically attended a service.</p>

<p>The service passed these costs onto Jimmy’s family.</p>

<p>An enrolment notice is in place for Amber who attends care 5 days per week. The arrangement start date was 13 July 2020, with an arrangement end date of 4 November. </p>

<p>Amber does not attend care for the week leading up to and including Amber's last day of 4 November due to a family tragedy.</p>

<p>Prior to 13 July, CCS would not have been payable for Amber's last week of care as Amber didn’t actually attend the service. However, as the absence policy has changed and Amber could not attend due to an approved reason, CCS will now be paid for the week.</p>
