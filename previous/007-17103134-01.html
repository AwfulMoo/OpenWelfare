<p>CCS and ACCS <strong>cannot</strong> be used for <strong>unapproved or disregarded</strong> absences.

<p>CCS and/or ACCS can be paid for up to 42 absence days without evidence for each child for any reason each financial year. This applies across all services the child attends, not for each service.</p>

<p>Public holidays are counted as an absence and are not considered as an additional absence over the 42 day limit if&#58;</p>

the child would normally have attended the service on that day (if it were not a public holiday), and </li>

<p>Evidence may be required for CCS and ACCS for absence days above the limit. Customers need to provide supporting documentation to the child care service to demonstrate an additional absence is required. The child care service will decide whether the absence is approved or not. The child must have used all of their 42 absence days before they can access additional absence days.</p>

<p>There is no limit to the number of approved additional absence days a child care service can approve, providing the absence is supported by evidence.</p>

<p>Reasons for additional absences can include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
illness (with a medical certificate), or another absence due to sickness of the child, a carer, carer's partner or sibling, supported by medical certificates</li>
		<li>
temporary closure of a school or pupil-free days</li>

the service is closed, or </li>
			<li>
the child is unable to travel to the service due to the emergency</li>		</ul>
		<li>
shared care arrangements due to a court order, parenting plan or parenting order, where a copy has been provided to the approved child care service</li>
		<li>
the child is not immunised, and </li>
			<ul>			<li>
the absence occurs during immunisation grace period, and </li>

<p>From 13 July 2020, CCS may be payable if a child is absent up to 7 days before or after the child physically attended the service (including the first/last day of care), for any of the following reasons that will be determined by the service&#58;</p>

<p>Customers were entitled to an extra 20 absences days for any reason up until 5 April 2020. This allowed customers to access 62 paid absence days without evidence being required. Child Care services were not required to submit session reports from 6 April 2020 to 12 July 2020.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>The government introduced changes to absences in response to coronavirus (COVID-19) for the 2020-21 year.</p>

<p>Children attending a Victorian child care service are entitled to 45 special purpose absences for the 2020-2021 financial year. This allows these children to access a total of 87 paid absence days for the 2020-21 year without evidence being required. The child only gets the benefit of the special purpose absences while attending a Victorian child care service.</p>

<p><strong>Notes&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
A $0 session fee was recorded on many current CCS enrolment for children in Victoria on 12 October 2020 with reason ‘COVID-19 system update’ to ensure enrolments did not cease</li>
		<li>
Some services are varying or withdrawing the $0 session of care submitted on 12 October 2020. This is causing the system to reassess and cease enrolments. A debt is being raised on the ceased enrolment for the absences between the child’s last physical attendance and the enrolment cease date. If the provider has incorrectly varied or withdrawn the $0 session of care for 12 October 2020, they must resubmit it. This will cause a reassessment of the customer's CCS entitlement</li>
		<li>
Families/customers may have had their enrolment ceased prior to the $0 session of care submitted on 12 October. Any absences between the child’s last physical attendance and the enrolment cease date is raised as a debt against the service. The service has a right to recover this debt from the customer although the decision to do so remains at the discretion of the service</li>
		<li>
Some services may also submit $0 sessions of care for other dates in October/November 2020 to prevent customers being charged for absences. These will have been already approved by Department of Education</li>

<p><strong>Special purpose absences</strong></p>

<p>Families living in or attending a child care service in a Commonwealth declared COVID-19 hotspot, are able to access special purpose absences. </p>

<p>To be eligible to access the special purpose absences, the COVID-19 hotspot must be&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
subject to a state or territory lockdown, and</li>
		<li>
declared as a Commonwealth COVID-19 hotspot by the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer for more than 7 successive days</li>
		</ul>
<p>Families can also access special purpose absences when a state or territory government order has limited access to child care.</p>

<p>During these periods, families will not have to use their regular 42 allowable absences.</p>

<p>Special purpose absences will be available from the date the area was declared a COVID-19 hotspot until the state or territory&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
lifts restrictions around access to child care (for Centre Based Day Care, Family Day Care and In Home Care services), or</li>
		<li>
allows all primary school-aged children to return to face-to-face learning (Outside School Hours Care services)</li>
		</ul>
<p>If eligible, special purpose absences are applied to the impacted families, they do not need to do anything. </p>

<p><strong>Absences before the first day of care</strong></p>

<p>Normally, CCS absences before the child’s first physical attendance at their child care service are not payable. </p>

<p>An exception now applies for enrolments that started during COVID 19 lockdown. If a customer commences their child’s enrolment with their child care service after 12 July 2021 CCS may be payable for absences before the first day the child attended care.</p>

<p>Customers may be eligible if the following apply&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they lived in, or their child’s service was in a declared COVID-19 hotspot for more than 7 days, and </li>
		<li>
absences before the first physical attendance are within the within 28 days of the lockdown ending, and </li>
		<li>
absences were recorded at the start of the child’s enrolment</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer is eligible and meets the above criteria, Services should record&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a $0 session with the start time of 6.00am and end time of 6&#58;15am, with </li>
		<li>
session description of ‘COVID-19 first day of care’ on the first day of the enrolment</li>
		</ul>
<p>This ensures CCS absences before the first physical attendance are paid.</p>

<p>Tell families to speak to their child care service to see if this applies to them. Child care services have been given instructions by Department of Education on how to record this exception.</p>

<p>Normally, CCS absences after the child’s last physical attendance at their child care service are not payable. However, changes have been made to pay for CCS absences after a child’s last physical attendance to families affected by COVID 19 lockdown period.</p>

<p>If a customer wants to end their child’s enrolment with their child care service after 12 July 2021 CCS may be paid for absences after the last day the child attended care.</p>

<p>Customers may be eligible if the following apply&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they have recorded a first attendance, and</li>
		<li>
they lived in, or their child’s service was in a declared COVID-19 hotspot for more than 7 days, and </li>
		<li>
they ended their enrolment within 28 days of the lockdown ending</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer is eligible and meets the above criteria, services should record&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a $0 session with the start time of 10&#58;00pm and end time of 10&#58;15pm, with </li>
		<li>
session description of ‘COVID-19 last day of care’ on the last day of the enrolment</li>
		</ul>
<p>This ensures CCS absences after last day of care are paid.</p>

<p>Families will need to speak to their child care service to see if this applies to them. Child care services have been given instructions by Department of Education on how to record this exception. </p>

<p><strong>For the 2021-22 year</strong></p>

<p>Child care services can waive the gap fee for families if a child is unable to attend care for any one of the below reasons&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
From the first day the restrictions are in force, if the state or territory has restricted access to child care in a region due to COVID-19, or</li>
		<li>
From 1 October 2021, if a Family Day Care or In-Home Care educator can’t provide their usual service because they, or a member of their immediate household must isolate due to COVID-19, or</li>
		<li>
From 1 October 2021, if an Outside School Hours Care service operating on a school campus closed as part of a direction to the school to close, or </li>
		<li>
From 9 November 2021, if the child, or a member of their immediate household, must isolate due to COVID-19, or</li>
		<li>
From 27 January 2022, if the child is at a higher risk of severe disease from COVID-19, or</li>
		<li>
From 27 January 2022, if the child care service, or a part of the service closed based on general guidance from a state or territory government agency, such as a health, education, or regulatory agency, due to a COVID-19 case, or</li>
		<li>
From 27 January 2022, if the child care service, or a part of the service, closed because educator to child ratios cannot be safely met due to the educator/s isolating</li>
		</ul>
<p>If one of the above reasons apply, families should talk to their child care service about getting the gap fee waived. In some circumstances, families will need to provide evidence to show their eligibility. </p>

<p>Where a child care service is approved to waive a gap fee, they can decide whether they will waive the gap fee or not. If they choose to waive the gap fee, it can be waived partially or in full.</p>

<p>Families may also want to change payment arrangements (for example, Centrepay deductions) if the service has decided to waive the gap fee for any period.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> families who get CCS must ordinarily make a co-contribution to their child care fees under Family Assistance Law. They do this by paying the difference between the provider’s fee and the CCS amount. This is known as the gap fee. The Department of Education are responsible for child care policy, including policy relating to waiver of gap fees. Services Australia does not have any role in applying or monitoring gap fee waivers.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>For the 2022-23 year</strong></p>

<p>Child care services can waive the gap fee for families and continue to receive CCS if a child is unable to attend care for one of the following reasons&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the child, or a member of their immediate household, must isolate due to COVID-19, or </li>
		<li>
the child is at a higher risk of developing severe disease as a result of COVID-19. This includes Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, or</li>
		<li>
the child care service, or a room at the service is closed due to COVID-19 because educator-to-child ratios cannot be safely met while educators are isolating. This includes Family Day care and In Home Care that cannot provide their usual service while they, or a member of the immediate household, are isolating</li>

<p>A period of emergency applies for an event which&#58;</p>

affects a widespread area</li>

has a severe impact on the lives of a significant number of people in that area, and</li>
		<li>

<p>The Department of Education will announce when a period of emergency is declared. Families can find out regions the period of emergency covers and the dates that it applies on the Department of Education website.</p>

<p>Families who reside or attend child care in declared regions, can now access extra allowable absences during a period of emergency, for example, bushfires, floods or a COVID-19 lockdown. More information is available on the Department of Education website.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Families&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
do not need to use their regular 52 allowable absences during a period of emergency</li>
		<li>
do not need to do anything to get these extra allowable absences. They will be automatically applied if they are eligible for them. </li>

<p>These extra allowable absences are displayed as special purpose absences in Process Direct and event absences via online services/Express Plus app.</p>

<p>Following the period of emergency, families may access additional absences if they have exhausted their annual allocation of allowable absences&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
for 28 days after the emergency, if a child is unable to attend</li>
		<li>
for 7 days after an emergency, if a family decides the child should not attend</li>

<p><strong>Gap fee waiver</strong></p>

<p>Child care services can choose to waive the gap fees for families residing or attending child care in a declared region for the duration of the period of emergency.</p>

<p>This applies where the child is unable to attend the child care or the service is closed as a direct result of the emergency.</p>

<p>If the above applies, families should talk to their child care service about getting the gap fee waived. In some circumstances, families will need to provide evidence to show their eligibility.</p>
