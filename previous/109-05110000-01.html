		<div class="block">

<p>When family assistance is received for a child who is also included in a child support assessment, both Centrelink and Child Support use the same care decision for their assessments.</p>

<p>Therefore, when Centrelink makes a care decision that affects a Child Support customer, the customer should be encouraged to contact Child Support to discuss any effects the care decision will have on their child support assessment.</p>

<p>If a customer <strong>does not understand</strong> the reason/s for a decision, they can request an explanation of the decision. A Subject Matter Expert (SME) will provide the explanation.</p>

<p>If a customer <strong>does not agree</strong> with a decision, they can apply for a formal review of the decision. An Authorised Review Officer (ARO) will complete the formal review, and only if the customer applies for a formal review.</p>

<p>A customer does not have to request an explanation before applying for a formal review of a decision. They can apply for a formal review at any time after a decision is made.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>If a customer requests an explanation of a care decision&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
made by Child Support, advise them that Child Support would be the most appropriate program to discuss the decision. These customers can be <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-05030010-01.html">transferred to Child Support with an introduction</a></li>
		<li>
made by Centrelink, or the impact of a care decision made by Child Support on their family assistance, Centrelink should provide the explanation</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer has already requested a review of the care decision by either Centrelink or Child Support&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
discuss the decision with the customer</li>
		<li>
do not record and refer to a SME a request for an explanation</li>
		<li>
advise the customer of the <a href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/109-02000000-01.html">review process including timeliness standards</a>, and that a detailed explanation of the decision will be provided as part of the review.</li>
		</ul>
<p>A SME may undertake a reassessment (Secretary initiated review) as a part of the explanation process. However, a Secretary initiated review of a decision <strong>cannot</strong> be undertaken if the customer has applied for a formal review of the decision.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Customer_reques01">Customer requests a review of a care decision</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Centrelink uses the term 'formal review' (apply for a formal review) and Child Support uses the term 'objection' (lodge an objection). Both mean that the customer wants to have a care decision reviewed.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> A SME cannot undertake a review requested by the customer.</p>

<p>A customer who has their family assistance or child support assessment affected by a care decision can request a review of the care decision. The customer can contact Centrelink or Child Support to request a review, even if they are not a customer of the program they requested the review from. When a care decision has no effect under family assistance law (none of the parties are claiming or receiving family assistance), only Child Support may review the care decision.</p>

<p>If a customer contacts Centrelink to request a review of a Child Support care decision, and Child Support has not already reviewed the decision, suggest to the customer that Child Support would be the most appropriate program to complete the review as they made the original decision. However, if there is an effect on family assistance for at least one party, and the customer wants the review to be completed by Centrelink, Centrelink will conduct the review.</p>

<p>If both Centrelink and Child Support are asked to review a care decision, the review request that was lodged first must be finalised first. It is important that any request for review is recorded straight away.</p>

<p>If a customer contacts Centrelink after Child Support finalises a review of a care decision, a Centrelink Authorised Review Officer (ARO) may review the care decision but cannot change the care percentage decided by the Child Support Objections Officer. See <a href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/109-05110000-01.html#bp01_L2GT_Jurisdiction">Jurisdiction</a> below.</p>

<p>The customer may request a review of the care decision at any time. This includes when they have requested an explanation that is not finalised.</p>

<p>If the customer requests an explanation of a care decision that has been reviewed by an Objections Officer, a SME can provide an explanation but <strong>cannot </strong>change the care percentage determined by the Objections Officer.</p>

<p>An ARO can undertake a formal review of a care decision that has already been reviewed by an Objections Officer. However, an ARO <strong>cannot</strong> change the care percentage determined by the Objections Officer.</p>

<p>Similarly, an Objections Officer can undertake a review of a care decision that has already been reviewed by an ARO. However, the Objections Officer <strong>cannot</strong> change the care percentage determined by the ARO, or the SME if the care percentage is changed as a result of a reassessment (Secretary initiated review) as part of a SME explanation.</p>

<p>For example, an Objections Officer has completed a review of a care decision and an ARO is also reviewing the decision. The ARO can review a change in the rate of family assistance, the date of effect and any debt, but they <strong>must </strong>apply the care percentage decided by the Objections Officer.</p>

<p>It is important to make sure&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer understands the difference between an explanation of the decision and a formal review of the decision. This is because the customer’s child support assessment, including their further right to review, may be impacted differently if the decision is changed by the SME or the ARO</li>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>An explanation of a care decision may result in a reassessment (Secretary initiated review). However, an explanation is not a formal review. A customer can apply for a formal review of the decision without requesting an explanation, or at any time after requesting an explanation of the decision.</p>

<p>If there is sufficient reason, a SME may undertake a reassessment to change the care decision (Secretary initiated review) as part of providing an explanation. For example, a SME may&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
correct an error in the recording of a care decision (the decision was made correctly but applied incorrectly), or</li>
		<li>
change the actual care decision (the decision was incorrect)</li>
		</ul>
<p>A change to the care decision following a Secretary initiated review will impact a child support assessment differently from a change following a formal review of the decision. Before undertaking a Secretary initiated review, ensure the customer is aware of the possible impact on their child support assessment.</p>

<p>If the customer <strong>does not agree</strong> with the original decision and <strong>would like new information considered</strong>, confirm if they actually want to apply for a formal review of the decision.</p>
