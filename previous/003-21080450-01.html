<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Unable_to_work_01">Unable to work and earn usual income</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>To receive a payment, customers must be ‘unable to attend work and therefore unable to earn their usual income due to a state public health order for restricted movement’.</p>

<p>This means the customer cannot earn their usual amount of income from any employer (existing or new).</p>

<p>That is, if a customer has lost income from an employer, but is able to regain the same lost income from a new employer, they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>can</strong> attend work and earn their usual income, <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
<strong>are not</strong> eligible to receive a payment</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Reasons a person may be unable to attend work and earn their usual income</strong></p>

<p>A person may be unable to attend work and earn their usual income for a number of reasons related to the restricted movement conditions. This includes where customers&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
are not permitted or unable to work from home </li>
		<li>
cannot attend work due to caring responsibilities</li>
		<li>
are not vaccinated against COVID-19 </li>
		<li>
have an exemption from wearing a mask, however, cannot work because of a state public health order mandating mask wearing (this must be because of a state public health order and not because of a condition an employer has placed on a person’s employment)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Unable to attend work and therefore unable to earn their usual income means the customer, in the relevant period, must have lost <strong>at least&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
8 hours of work, <strong>or</strong></li>
		<li>
1 full day of work</li>
		</ul>
<p>A full day of work <strong>does not</strong> need to be at least 8 hours.</p>

<p><strong>For example&#58;</strong> a customer normally works a 3 hour shift during the relevant period and cannot attend that shift because of the restricted movement (lockdown). The customer meets the 'unable to attend work and therefore unable to earn their usual income' criteria as they have lost 1 full day of work in the relevant period</p>

<p>If a customer does not lose 1 full day of work, they must lose at least 8 hours of work in the relevant period.</p>

<p><strong>For example&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
A customer normally works 1 x 10 hour shift during the relevant period. They work 5 hours of that shift. The customer <strong>does not </strong>meet the 'unable to attend work and therefore unable to earn their usual income' criteria as they have not lost at least 8 hours of work or 1 full day of work in the relevant period</li>
		<li>
A customer normally works 2 x 10 hours shifts during the relevant period. They work 5 hours each day of those 2 shifts. The customer <strong>does</strong> meet the 'unable to attend work and therefore unable to earn their usual income' criteria as they have lost 10 hours of work in the relevant period</li>
		</ul>
<p>The payment rate the customer receives is based on hours of work lost during the relevant period, <strong>not </strong>hours the customer would have worked if the restricted movement (lockdown) did not occur.</p>

<p>For the purposes of the COVID-19 Disaster Payment - Queensland, the eligibility criteria covers whether a customer lives, works or <strong>has been present in </strong>(visited) a relevant area.</p>

<p>The area must be&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
declared a COVID-19 hotspot, and</li>
		<li>
under period of restricted movement (lockdown)</li>
		</ul>
<p>A second public health order&#58;</p>

		<li>
includes stay at home orders, self-quarantine or mandatory (supervised) quarantine</li>
		<li>
can differ depending on the home state or territory</li>
		</ul>
<p>The address the customer was present in within the COVID-19 hotspot area will be checked using the <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-21080450-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Geospatial_tool01">Geospatial tool</a> to make sure the relevant area was 'declared a COVID-19 <strong>hotspot</strong>' and is under a period of <strong>restricted movement (lockdown).</strong></p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>To get the COVID-19 Disaster Payment, customers must not be receiving pandemic related paid leave entitlements or will exhaust those entitlements during the same relevant period.</p>

<p>Customers <strong>do not</strong> need to take&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
accrued leave entitlements such as&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
annual leave</li>
			<li>
long service leave</li>
			<li>
unpaid leave</li>		</ul>
		<li>
leave they are not entitled to access if they have been stood down without pay by their employer under the Fair Work Act, for example&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
paid sick leave</li>
			<li>
carer’s leave</li>
			<li>
compassionate leave</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>However,</strong> if a customer is receiving any of the above leave types, including pandemic related leave entitlements, during the <strong>entire </strong>relevant period, they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
have not lost income, and</li>
		<li>
are not eligible to receive the COVID-19 Disaster Payment</li>
		</ul>
<p>For <strong>unpaid leave</strong>, while the customer may have lost income, they would not meet the ‘would have worked’ criteria. That is, if a person is on unpaid leave, they would not have worked even if the restricted movement (lockdown) did not occur.</p>

<p>If these leave entitlements do not cover the entire <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-21080450-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Relevant_areas_">relevant period</a> the customer meets this eligibility requirement.</p>

<p>For example, if a customer has leave entitlements, including pandemic related leave entitlements, that cover 3 days of the relevant period, they meet this eligibility requirement. <strong>Note&#58; </strong>the customer must meet <strong>all </strong>eligibility requirements for at least 1 day in the remaining period.</p>
