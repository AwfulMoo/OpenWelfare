<p>Cindy flees a violent relationship from partner Rob, and decides to stay at a friend's house due to having only $30 and not being able to afford to stay anywhere else. Cindy is severely traumatised by the event and decides that it is not safe to leave the friend's house for a while, fearing being found by Rob.</p>

<p>After staying 2 weeks at a friend's house Cindy considers the situation and decides returning home is not an option. Cindy contacts Services Australia 3 days later and lodges a claim for Crisis Payment (CrP).</p>

<p>After being interviewed by the social worker at a local service centre, the claim for CrP is granted as the claim has been made within 7 days of the decision not to return home.</p></td>

<p><strong>Alleged perpetrator legally prevented from returning home</strong></p>

<p>Police are called to the family home of Joan and Michael after an incident of family and domestic violence. Police remove Michael, who is receiving JobSeeker Payment (JSP), from the home.</p>

<p>The next day, an Apprehended Violence Order (AVO) with an exclusion provision prohibiting Michael from living in the family home for 72 hours is issued.</p>

<p>Although Michael is legally allowed to return to the family home after the exclusion period expires, Michael decides not to, and sets out to find alternative accommodation. Joan decides to stay in the family home and claims a CrP to help her secure her home.</p>

<p>Michael lodges a claim for CrP 2 days later, and gives a copy of the AVO and proof of living with Joan in the family home before the incident, along with all required documentation for CrP.</p>

<p>After being interviewed individually by the social worker, both Joan and Michael's claim for CrP are granted.</p></td>

<p>Susan suffers family and domestic violence by an abusive partner and takes up accommodation in a refuge. On the third day at the refuge, Susan lodges an AVO against the partner. The partner is removed from the home on the fourth day and Susan returns to the family home that same day. This is the point at which the claiming period begins. Susan has 7 days to claim CrP from this day.</p>

<p>Susan only has $100 in a bank account and contacts Services Australia to claim for a CrP.</p>

<p>After being interviewed by the social worker at a local service centre, the CrP is granted. This is because Susan has contacted the agency 7 days after the responsible family member has been removed from the home and is in severe financial hardship.</p></td>

Over the past few months, Malika has become more and more controlling of their finances and Jamal no longer has access to his money. Jamal lodges a claim for CrP-EXV, but chooses to remain in the home.</p>

<p>Because Malika has not been legally prevented from living in the home, and Jamal has not established or does not intend to establish a new home, the claim is rejected.</p></td>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>

<p>After several days of torrential rain, Arnold has been told by the SES that the home must be evacuated. The nearby river has burst its banks and Arnold must leave immediately or risk being stranded.</p>

<p>When the flood waters subside, Arnold's house has been extensively damaged and is unsafe to live in. The State Government has not declared a natural emergency as there were only a few areas affected by the flooding.</p>

<p>The next day Arnold phones Services Australia and a Service Officer helps him claim CrP-EXO. Arnold lodges the claim immediately and uploads the evidence to his Centrelink Online account. The claim is granted as it was made within 7 days after finding out that the house was uninhabitable.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a natural disaster is declared and Arnold is eligible for a disaster relief payment such as an Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment (AGDRP) or other disaster relief payment from the local, State or Commonwealth Government, then CrP is not payable.</p></td>

<p>While Mary was out grocery shopping at the local shopping centre, someone broke into her home. Two weeks later, another incident occurred. Mary feels unsafe to remain in her property as the home invasion occurred twice in the past 2 weeks. Mary moved to a parent's house and terminated the lease. CrP is payable because Mary has left home and is intending to establish a new home because of an extreme circumstance.</p></td>

<p>Mitchel has an ongoing history of verbal abuse and violence from a neighbour. Windows have been broken and property has been damaged.</p>

<p>Mitchel flees the house and fears for his safety if he was to stay. Mitchel finds shelter with a friend. Mitchel is severely traumatised and will not leave the safety of the friend's house. After 8 days, Mitchel considers the situation and decides he cannot return home. Three days later Mitchel claims and is paid CrP, as the claim is made within the 7 days of the decision not to return home.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> as the history of verbal abuse and violence is from Mitchel's neighbour, who is not someone who is living with them, Mitchel qualifies for Other Extreme Circumstances and not Extreme Circumstances Family and Domestic Violence.</p></td>

<p>Ashley's house is affected by an earthquake and has fallen off its foundations, also destroying the plumbing. Ashley hopes to return home after the house has been repaired, but does not see this happening for several months. In the meantime, Ashley has established a new home elsewhere. Subject to all other requirements, CrP is payable.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the customer must show that they have established or intend to establish a new home, as well as give proof of the incident. They can do this by giving proof of a change of address such as a new lease and a damage report, for example.</p></td>

<p>Neena is renting her home, but was recently given notice from the property owner that the house is being sold and she needs to move out within 3 months. Neena submits a claim for CrP-EXO online, providing the ‘for sale’ ad as evidence that she has had to leave the home.</p>

<p>Neena's claim was rejected, as the extreme circumstance was foreseeable and avoidable due to the property owner giving her notice.</p></td>
