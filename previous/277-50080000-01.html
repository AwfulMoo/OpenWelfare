<p class="info-box warning">This is a Family and Domestic Violence Interaction Point. If the customer is with another person, on speakerphone or already identified with family and domestic violence concerns, continue with the current business conversation. Otherwise, see the <a target="_blank" href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-15000000-01.html">Family and domestic violence</a> procedure to conduct the risk identification and referral process.</p>

<p>This document outlines information and updates required when a customer currently in receipt of payments or services separates from their partner.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>There are specific procedures for customers who separate and are affected by family and domestic violence.</p>

<p><strong>Updating a customer's relationship status</strong></p>

<p>If a customer indicates they and/or their children are at risk of family and domestic violence and are concerned for their safety, their relationship status can be updated immediately and verification supplied within 14 days.</p>

<p>Before updating the customer's relationship status, tell them that if their partner is in receipt of payment and/or has an online account, their partner's marital status will automatically update to a non-partnered (for example, separated) relationship status. Their partner will be able to view the updated status in their Centrelink online account and Express Plus Centrelink App.</p>

<p>Updating the relationship may also flow on to impact the ex-partner's entitlements if they are receiving any Centrelink payments. Make sure the customer is aware of this.</p>

<p>Giving the customer this information allows them to make an informed decision of the risk and make any necessary safety preparations.</p>

<p><strong>Updating nominee arrangements</strong></p>

<p>When a customer who has their partner appointed as their nominee advises they have separated, <strong>ask them at the first point of contact</strong> if they wish to cancel the nominee arrangement. </p>

<p>Action the request for cancellation of the arrangement immediately. The request does not have to be in writing.</p>

<p><strong>Updating Person Permission to Enquire (PPE)</strong></p>

<p>If the partner has permission to enquire, the coding of the separation will automatically cease the PPE authority.</p>

<p><strong>Updating personal details</strong></p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when completing the 'unlinking' activity (via the Marital Status (<strong>MS</strong>) screen) to update the relationship status due to separation, <strong>take care </strong>when updating any personal details <strong>to ensure updates do not flow onto their ex-partner's record</strong>. The update to the <strong>MS</strong> screen will automatically navigate to the Customer Details Task (<strong>CDTS</strong>) screen in Customer First where Service Officers <strong>must</strong> change the default of updating both records to updating the customer's record only. This is done by changing the '<strong>B</strong>' to '<strong>S</strong>' at relevant fields such as the Address, Accommodation and Telephone fields.</p>

<p>A code of <strong>Unlink of two customers - ULK</strong> will display in the <strong>Rent Verification</strong>&#58; field. The code will ripple automatically to the ex-partner's record when the customer's MS screen is updated. The code must be updated on the <strong>customer's record only</strong> or Rent Assistance (RA) (if applicable) will stop. <strong>Do not</strong> update the ex-partner's record. If the ex-partner is in receipt of Rent Assistance, this payment will cease, as a direct result of the ULK code being auto applied, until Services Australia receive notification from this person about their change in circumstances. If the customer has advised of any family and domestic violence concerns, ensure they are aware their ex-partner may experience a change in rate if they are receiving any RA entitlements so they can make any necessary safety preparations.</p>

<p><strong>Recording a voiceprint</strong> - voice biometrics technology makes a customer's records more secure. See <a href="../self-service/133-04160050-01.html">Voiceprints for phone self-service</a></p>

<p><strong>Member of a couple definition</strong></p>

<p>A person is considered a member of a couple if they are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
legally married</li>
		<li>
in a registered relationship</li>
		<li>
in a de facto relationship and</li>
			<ul>			<li>
not in a prohibited relationship</li>
			<li>
both over the age of consent in the state or territory they live in</li>		</ul>
		<li>
not living separately and apart on a permanent or indefinite basis</li>
		</ul>
<p>If a marriage, registered relationship or a de facto relationship ceases to exist, the partners of that relationship are no longer members of a couple.</p>

<p><strong>Living separately and apart</strong></p>

<p>To be considered to be living separately and apart, it must be established that&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they are living apart either permanently or indefinitely, (physical separation) and</li>
		<li>
there has been an estrangement or breakdown in their relationship (emotional separation)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Living separately and apart does not require the customer to have physically moved out of shared accommodation. The customer must establish there is a genuine separation in the relationship and they are living separate lives.</p>

<p>Generally, living separately and apart should not be accepted if the couple are living apart because of ill health. Explore all other options before determining that a couple are living separately and apart.</p>

<p><strong>Customer and ex-partner not in receipt of payments or services</strong></p>

<p>Updating relationship details for customers wishing to claim, but not currently receiving Centrelink payments or services is not required. If a new claim for income support or another payment/concession card is being lodged, updates will be done as part of the new claim.</p>

<p>If a non-current customer notifies of a separation (via a MOD S) their record must still be updated. If they contact by phone to advise they are separated, the same procedures apply as if they were receiving payments or service. Tell them to lodge a completed MOD S. This makes sure the agency holds information about the customer that is accurate, up-to-date and complete, as required under the Australian Privacy Principles. There is no need to obtain verification of separation for non-current customers.</p>

<p>If a customer who is <strong>currently assessed</strong> as separated under one roof advises they or their ex-partner have now moved out of the shared residence, this is not a separation. They are already considered separated, so an assessment of their relationship status is not required. The customer's record <strong>must</strong> be updated and the 'Separated Under One Roof' Relationship Qualifier Code removed on the Marital Status (<strong>MS</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>When a customer separates, the separation must be verified.</p>

<p>However, in certain circumstances the verification of separation may not be able to be completed before the relationship status is updated. This applies to customers experiencing family and domestic violence where an immediate update of the relationship status to single will allow an immediate transfer to a higher single rate of payment. In these cases, verification of separation will still be required after the granting of the single rate.</p>

<p>Verification of separation is not required for customers who advise of separation within a claim.</p>

<p>Separation may be verified by documentation already supplied and stored on the customer's record. See Sufficient written documentation to verify that a bona fide separation has occurred.</p>

<p>The customer must provide objective evidence they have separated on a permanent or indefinite basis. When making the assessment, greater weight is to be given to independent indicators of separation. Statements made about the separation are to be based on independent observations of the relationship, rather than a restatement of what the person has been told by the customer.</p>

<p>Proof of divorce is not required but can be used to verify separation. If a customer has been separated for 12 months or longer and they advise they are now divorced, verification should not be requested unless there is doubt about the customer's relationship status.</p>

<p>When a customer advises of a separation, several updates to their record may be required.</p>

<p><strong>Address and accommodation details, where no family and domestic violence is present</strong></p>

<p>If a customer separates from their partner, the customer remains linked until they provide separation details and their separation is verified. A Tmp Sep/Left Home qualifier code <strong>must</strong> be recorded on the <strong>MS</strong> screen when advising of a change of address due to separation. This ensures the address and accommodation details for the customer can be updated independently.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58; </strong>the 'Tmp Sep/Both Left Home' and 'Tmp Sep/Ptnr Left Home' <strong>must not</strong> be used as updates to the partner's address as updates cannot be made based on the customer advising separation.</p>

<p><strong>Nominee</strong></p>

<p>When a customer who has their partner appointed as their nominee advises they have separated, they must be asked at <strong>first point of contact</strong> if they wish to <a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-04090030-01.html">cancel the nominee arrangement</a>. A request for cancellation of the arrangement must be actioned immediately. The request does not have to be in writing.</p>

<p><strong>Person Permission to enquire (PPE)</strong></p>

<p>If the ex-partner has permission to enquire, the customer must be asked at <strong>first point of contact</strong> if they wish to end this arrangement. The coding of the separation will automatically cease the PPE authority.</p>

changes to bank account details (noting that customers may have had a joint account previously and the ex-partner may still have access)</li>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>When updating a customer's relationship status, additional cultural considerations may need to be taken into account to make an accurate determination. If a customer discloses more than 1 partner - a multiple relationship - Service Officers must establish with the customer exactly who they are in a relationship with to determine the central couple.</p>

<p>A multiple relationship is where a person has more than one concurrent member of a couple relationship. Multiple relationships are not recognised under social security law, therefore all parties to the relationship, outside the central couple, must be assessed for entitlements under Section 24 provisions. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07120080-01.html">Treatment of a partnered person as single under Section 24 new determinations</a> for more information.</p>

<p>If a customer in a multiple relationship advises of a separation from one of their partners, care must be taken when undertaking updates to ensure the correct partner's details are updated. This may include changing partner links to another member of the multiple relationship if the customer is currently linked in the system to the partner from whom they have now separated.</p>
