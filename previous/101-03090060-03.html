<p>From 20 March 2017, only grandfathered Energy Supplement recipients will receive the payment.</p>

<p>A person's Energy Supplement Part A and Part B entitlement is based on their income and other circumstances used to calculate their FTB rate. See <a>Item 13</a>, FTB Energy Supplement rate.</p>

<p>From 20 March 2017, only grandfathered Approved Care Organisations (ACO) are eligible for the base rate Energy Supplement for Part A for all FTB children in their care. Any children entering the care of a grandfathered ACO from 20 March 2017 will be included in the calculation of Energy Supplement.</p>

<p>Organisations that become ACOs and are granted FTB Part A with a date of effect after 19 September 2016 will not be eligible for Energy Supplement from 20 March 2017.</p>

<p>Recipients will continue to be paid Energy Supplement as long as they remain continuously eligible for FTB Part A and/or FTB Part B at a legislative rate greater than $0 and they met the Energy Supplement grandfathering provisions in respect of 19 September 2016.</p>

<p>The recipient will no longer be grandfathered for Energy Supplement on the first day their legislative rate of FTB Part A and Part B is $0. This applies to FTB instalment and FTB lump sum claim recipients.</p>

<p>If Family Tax Benefit is cancelled the recipient will no longer be grandfathered for Energy Supplement.</p>

<p>If a grandfathered Family Tax Benefit recipient for Energy Supplement purposes is found at FTB reconciliation to have no entitlement to FTB Part A or FTB Part B on any given day on or after 19 September 2016, then they have lost continuous eligibility and grandfathering is lost from that date.</p>

<p>Recipients can continue to receive Energy Supplement payments for up to 6 weeks only while temporarily absent from Australia, even if an extension of portability is granted beyond 6 weeks.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
If temporarily overseas, after 6 weeks Energy Supplements cease to be paid to the recipient (or for the child if only the child is overseas)</li>

They will not receive Energy Supplement FTB Part A or FTB Part B if they reapply for FTB when they return to Australia, or if their FTB is restored from the date of their return where there is a gap in entitlement.</p>

<p><strong>Portability Extensions and Energy Supplement grandfathering</strong></p>

<p>Energy Supplement grandfathering is dependent on entitlement to the qualifying payment itself, not to the payment of Energy Supplement. A grandfathered recipient will continue to be grandfathered while their FTB is current, even if Energy Supplement itself is not payable. That is, if a grandfathered recipient of Family Tax Benefit&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
loses eligibility for Energy Supplement (because of portability restrictions), and</li>
		<li>
subsequently regains eligibility for Energy Supplement at a later date (for example, returns to Australia), and</li>
		<li>
has maintained continuous eligibility for their Family Tax Benefit during the entire period,</li>
		</ul>
<p>the recipient is considered grandfathered for the entire period and is to be paid Energy Supplement from the date they became eligible for Energy Supplement again.</p>

<p>For an example of this see <a>Resources</a>.</p>

<p><strong>During FTB instalment period</strong></p>

<p>Where Energy Supplement grandfathering is lost retrospectively before FTB reconciliation, it is excluded from the recipient’s ongoing FTB entitlement only from the start of the current entitlement period. This is to avoid the creation of debts due to loss of Energy Supplement grandfathering status prior to reconciliation. The Energy Supplement grandfathering cease date will be stored and applied when reconciliation occurs.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> FTB overpayments, including Energy Supplement, can still be raised prior to reconciliation in other circumstances - for example, if the recipient retrospectively loses eligibility to FTB, the Energy Supplement component will be raised as part of the FTB qualification debt.</p>

<p><strong>Re-reconciliation </strong></p>

<p>When re-reconciliation for the relevant year occurs the Energy Supplement grandfathering cease date may be revised. Changes in recipient circumstances that trigger a re-reconciliation may result in the Energy Supplement cease date changing once again. It is possible to have the Energy Supplement grandfathering cease date recorded and revised several times. Service Officers may need to review the recipient record for circumstance changes that have triggered the change.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Where an FTB Energy Supplement Grandfathered override has been coded it will take precedence over any automatic reconciliation or non-reconciliation Energy Supplement grandfathering decisions and will be applied immediately and will not be deferred to the start of the current entitlement period (date paid +1).</p>

<p>An Energy Supplement debt may occur if a recipient's FTB entitlement for a past period is reassessed.</p>

<p>When the reassessment occurs impacts on when and how the debt is created. Retrospective loss of Energy Supplement grandfathering can result in the creation of an Energy Supplement entitlement debt. To reduce the impact of the debt raised prior to reconciliation for the relevant year, Energy Supplement is excluded from the start of the current entitlement period (date paid to +1). When reconciliation occurs for the relevant year the true grandfathering cease date will be applied and the debt raised if necessary.</p>

<p>Refer to <a>Item 15 in the Energy Supplement eligibility, payment options and rate calculation process table</a>.</p>

<p>If an FTB debt is raised, it may include a portion of the Energy Supplement paid for the debt period. The Energy Supplement is not a payment type on its own. It is a component of FTB and is raised as an FTB debt. Energy Supplement debts are shown as a CES Part A or Part B debt via the component field on the Overpayment Calculation (<strong>OPCA</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>If FTB entitlement ceases, Energy Supplement entitlement also ceases. If an FTB debt is raised because the recipient had no entitlement for a period, they would also have no entitlement to Energy Supplement for the same period. They would also lose their Energy Supplement grandfathering status and would not be entitled to Energy Supplement with their FTB payment if they reapply for FTB in the future. </p>

<p>If FTB reconciliation results in a recipient having lower or nil FTB entitlement, Energy Supplement entitlement is also adjusted and the Energy Supplement grandfathering status adjusted accordingly.</p>

<p>If FTB Part A was calculated under Method 1 using estimated income (maximum standard rates of FTB and supplements were used to calculate Energy Supplement) but actual income meant it should have been calculated under Method 2 (base standard rates of FTB and supplements should have been used to calculate Energy Supplement), any FTB debt raised would include the difference between the two Energy Supplement Part A rates for the period.</p>

<p>Normal FTB debt offsetting provisions apply to Energy Supplement debts as they are to be raised as FTB debts.</p>

<p>Debt waiver rules that apply for family assistance payments also apply to the Energy Supplement debt components.</p>

<p>If they are already an FTB recipient who has been grandfathered for Energy Supplement Part A or Part B then they will be entitled to Energy Supplement for the new child in their care.</p>

<p>If they are not an FTB recipient who has been grandfathered for Energy Supplement Part A or Part B then it is a new claim and they will not be entitled to Energy Supplement for the new child in their care.</p>

<p>If an <a href="../families/007-04050010-01.html">FTB child dies</a>, the 14 week FTB bereavement payment will include an Energy Supplement entitlement for that period. If the bereavement payment is paid as&#58;</p>

Instalments, Energy Supplement can continue to be paid quarterly if chosen by the recipient (if they revoke their quarterly Energy Supplement choice, any Energy Supplement accrued for the quarter will be paid immediately). If the recipient has no other FTB child, any accrued Energy Supplement entitlement for the quarter will be paid immediately when FTB cancels at the end of the bereavement period</li>
		<li>
A lump sum and the recipient had chosen to receive quarterly Energy Supplement payments, the quarterly option would need to be ended. A new quarterly choice cannot start until the bereavement period ends</li>
