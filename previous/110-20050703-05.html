<p><strong>The class action has been settled. What does this mean?</strong></p>

<p>The hearing for the Income Compliance class action settlement was held on 6 and 7 May 2021.</p>

<p>The court approved the Income Compliance class action settlement on 11 June 2021. </p>

<p>The agency is working with the court, Gordon Legal and the settlement implementation plan to deliver settlement payments to registered eligible group members as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Letters were issued between 29 October 2021 - 19 November 2021 about&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
eligibility for a settlement payment based on the debt categorisation</li>
		<li>
how a group member can update payment details</li>
		<li>
how to lodge a query or dispute</li>
		</ul>
<p>Letters will be issued by mid-2022 to eligible registered group members on how payments are calculated and the settlement amount to be received.</p>

<p>The scheme is a requirement of the settlement agreement. It explains how the Commonwealth will&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
work out who is eligible for a settlement payment</li>
		<li>
find and notify group members of the settlement outcome and their eligibility</li>

<p><strong>What does the $112 million consist of? Is this interest, compensation or both?</strong></p>

<p>The settlement payment is not compensation like WorkCover. In the settlement of the class action it was agreed that the amount of $112 million (minus Gordon Legal's court approved costs) would be paid to eligible group members in addition to the refund amounts, to settle all claims. </p>

<p>Under the terms of settlement, we’ll make payments similar to interest to eligible group members.</p>

<p>The agency sent a letter to all group members with more information about the proposed settlement. This included information on how to lodge an objection.</p>

<p>Section 26 to 31 of the notice provided details about the objection process, including the objections closing date of 4&#58;00 pm Friday 5 March 2021.</p>

<p>The final opt-out process closed at 4&#58;00 pm on Friday 17 September 2021. After this date group members are bound by the terms of the settlement. <strong>No further opt-out requests can be lodged</strong>.</p>

<p>Not every group member will be eligible under the settlement.</p>

<p>Group members will fall into separate categories, see <a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-20050703-05.html#bp05_L3TT_Categorisation_">Table 5 Categorisation of Group members’ debts</a>.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
the nature of the claim is in the same nature as the claims made in the proceeding, or</li>
		<li>
arise out of the same subject matter</li>

<p>This comes under the Scheme for Compensation for Detriment caused by Defective Administration (CDDA scheme).</p>

<p><strong>Group members who opted out</strong></p>

<p>These customers are able to make a claim for compensation through the CDDA Scheme. They are not bound by the settlement. </p>

<p><strong>If I am eligible how much will I receive?</strong></p>

<p>Settlement payments will be made to registered group members. People who paid back more and were without this money longer will get larger payments.</p>

<p>Payments will be calculated in a similar way to an interest payment. The agency will use interest rates set by the court to calculate each group member's portion.</p>

<p>Payments are not the same as a refund. Most of the refunds referred to in the settlement have already been paid to eligible people.</p>

<p>The amount received depends on when you paid money on the eligible debts, how much you paid and when you were refunded.</p>

<p>Once all other steps in the Implementation plan have been completed, payments will be sent to group members' bank accounts. Payments needing manual processing or tailored servicing may take longer.</p>

<p><strong>How will you make sure that the settlement distribution is fair?</strong></p>

<p>The Commonwealth has appointed an independent Scheme Assurer to make sure the settlement distribution is equitable and completed in line with the settlement agreement.</p>

<p>The Scheme Assurer and Gordon Legal will review the assessment of the debts to make sure debts are in the right category.</p>

<p>The Scheme Assurer and Gordon Legal will also confirm key steps of the Implementation Plan are complete before it can progress to the next step.</p>
