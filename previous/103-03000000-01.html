<p>This document outlines how Services Australia delivers a variety of payments on behalf of a range of government agencies.</p>
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GI_Government_inte"></a>
<h2 id="bp01_L2GI_Government_inte">Government intent</h2>


<p>The agency delivers these payments to customers on either a weekly or fortnightly basis (depending on the customer's circumstances). All payments are passed to the Reserve Bank of Australia, who then transfers the payments to the customer's financial institution (for example bank, building society, credit union).</p>

<p></p>
<div class="twisty">
	
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Payment_deliver"></a>
<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Payment_deliver">Payment delivery</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Payment delivery refers to the mechanisms the agency used to deliver payments to customers.</p>

<p>Customers are able to nominate the way in which their payment is delivered. Payments are delivered by two methods; direct credit to a bank account owned and operated by them, or to the bank account of an appointed payment nominee. The majority of customers are paid on a fortnightly basis but weekly payments are available to eligible customers who need assistance with budgeting. See <a href="../payment-delivery/103-05010000-01.html">Weekly payments</a>.</p>

<p>In some instances, payments may not be received by the customer or they are returned by the bank and require a replacement payment to be issued. See <a href="../payment-delivery/103-04040020-01.html">Reissue a payment returned from a financial institution</a>.</p>

<p>There is also legislative protection for government payments that restricts the amount of payments able to be used to repay an overdrawn account or to repay a third party organisation.</p>

<p>When actioning work relating to the issuing of payments, staff should always ensure they are processing the activity within the system that applies to the payment (NSS for Jobseeker Payment, FAO for Family Tax Benefit (FTB), PEN for Age Pension).</p>

<p>Each payment system has limits on the amount of arrears that can automatically be issued in any one payment. If the amount is higher than this, the payment will reject, and will need to be reissued. </p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>For Direct Credit, a payment delivery stripping process applies each week (working) day from 6 pm local time, which collects (strips) the customer payment data, updates the customer record, and then sends the information to the RBA. </p>

<p>To pay an eligible customer or nominee, all relevant processing must be completed by the strip time. </p>

<p>Payments stripped and sent via the NSS system are delivered the next working day, while all other systems (FAO, PEN, PGA) are delivered in 2 working days. </p>

<p>Holiday Processing allows for payments that are due to delivered on or around a national public holiday to be stripped and paid to customers earlier, to avoid financial hardship. </p>

		<div class="block">

<p>All Customers have an EPED, which is the last day of the customer's entitlement period.</p>

<p>The EPED is not the delivery date of the payment. NSS system payments (Jobseeker Payment) are delivered to customer's 1 working day after their EPED (EPED+1), while other system payments (PEN) will deliver 2 working days after the EPED (EPED+2).</p>

<p>What pay cycle a customer is on is identified via a code, corresponding to each working day in a fortnight period (A, B, C, D, E, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). These can be found in the Centrelink Payments Calendar to determine the delivery day of a payment.</p>

<p>Payments may be marked rejected (REJ) where&#58;</p>

<p>Delivery was via a priority direct credit method (NPP/RTGS) and it has been rejected by the RBA or financial institution (because the service is not available). Direct Credit payments may reject in rare cases. In the case of a rejected NPP payment, the system will automatically reissue the payment via RTGS or Direct Credit if RTGS is not available. If a payment does not reissue automatically it will need to be manually reissued via Direct Credit first, then reissued again via NPP, RTGS, or EBT card. </p>

<p>Centrelink system rejected payments can occur where the payment has been calculated but prevented from issue due to a system limitation or error. For example, due to the amount reaching the arrears limit</p>

<p>A Request for Refund (RFR) can only be made to a financial institution if the payment was sent to an incorrect account that the customer does not have legal access to. This is sometimes referred to as a recall request.</p>

<p>When an RFR is processed, a letter is issued to the financial institution requesting they refund the full amount to Centrelink. If they cannot refund the full amount, they should refund any portion that remains in the account and also provide the name and address of the account holder. This information is used to raise a debt on the incorrect recipient of the funds. The RFR also initiates debt processes to ensure the customer is not overpaid following replacement of the payment, if the money is later returned. </p>

<p>Customers who go overseas permanently have additional payment options depending on the country in which the customer is living. These customers are paid&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
into an Australian bank account</li>
		<li>
into an overseas bank account (for some countries)</li>
		<li>
by cheque (from some countries where overseas bank account payments are not possible), or</li>
		<li>
by overseas payment voucher (OVP) (in exceptional circumstances only)</li>

36 hour delivery for Pension (PEN), Parenting Payment (PP), family assistance payments, ABSTUDY and Mobility (MOB) payments</li>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Payment_reconci">Payment reconciliation</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Payment reconciliation is an automatic process performed daily to check that the payments calculated for customers, match the actual payments issued by the Payments System. If a discrepancy is identified between calculated entitlement and actual payment delivered, a work item will be created on the customer’s record to ensure the customer has not been under or over paid. </p>

<p>Common reasons for a payment reconciliation discrepancy are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Customers reporting late</li>
		<li>
Advance, Arrears or Urgent payments</li>
		<li>
Weekly payments</li>
		<li>
Holiday Processing</li>
		</ul>
