<p>This document outlines how eligible income support customers of Age Pension age can transfer to Age Pension. It explains when a claim or other documentation is required and factors to consider. It also contains information on the automatic transfer to Age Pension for some Identified Indigenous customers.</p>

<p></p>
<div class="twisty">
	
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Transfer_proces"></a>
<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Transfer_proces">Transfer process for eligible customers</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p><img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> Customers eligible to complete the online transfer to Age Pension can access the online transfer from 13 weeks before reaching Age Pension age. A correspondence nominee (individual or organisation) can submit a Transfer to Aged Pension on behalf of their principal.</p>

<p>The Aged Pension transfer will be available if the customer is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
subscribed to online services, they will be sent an online letter to their myGov inbox to complete the transfer to Age Pension. The letter will include a hyperlink to the Services Australia website and direct link to their online transfer task</li>
		<li>
not subscribed to online letters or Electronic Messaging, they will be sent a letter and a Transfer to Age Pension (SA383) form by mail, with the option to complete the transfer online rather than return the form</li>
		</ul>
<p>A customer’s payment may be suspended or cancelled from the date they turn Age Pension age, if the customer does not&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
submit the Transfer to Age Pension online, via Assisted Customer Claim (ACC), or</li>
		<li>
return the completed SA383</li>
		</ul>
<p>If their current payment does suspend or cancels, the Transfer to Age Pension task will remain available on the Centrelink online account landing page for up to 13 weeks after the suspension or cancellation date.</p>

<p>Payment should only be restored once the customer has submitted the transfer online via the ACC workflow or lodged a SA383 including required documentation.</p>

<p>Customers who are in receipt of Carer Payment or Disability Support Pension who do not want to transfer to Age Pension still need to complete the Transfer to Age Pension process. This will allow the customer to decline the transfer but will ask for their superannuation details which become assessable at Age Pension age.</p>

<p>When a customer has identified as an Indigenous customer they may be automatically transferred to Age Pension without the need to complete an online transfer or SA383.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Some online transfers do not need Service Officer intervention and will automatically complete once submitted by the customer. Straight through processing may occur where the transfer is straightforward, for example, there are no updates required, no documentation to be provided, and no adverse impacts on the entitlements of the customer (or their partner).</p>

<p>Where transfers to Age Pension cannot auto complete, the status of the activity will change to 'In Process' and the activity will be assigned to a Service Officer for manual processing.</p>

<p>If an income support customer contacts about transferring to Age Pension because they have not received an invitation to transfer and they are within 13 weeks of Age Pension age, offer an online transfer first. Explain the benefits of using the transfer online, including&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
early warnings if claimants may not be eligible, for example, not residentially qualified</li>
		<li>
there will be less information to provide, as information from Centrelink records will be pre-populated into the online transfer</li>
		<li>
for Carer Payment and Disability Support Pension customers, detailed messaging will populate within the online transfer process. This outlines the customer's circumstances including the advantages and disadvantages of transferring from their respective payment to help them make an informed decision about whether to transfer to Age Pension or remain on their current payment</li>
		<li>
the ability to monitor the progress of a transfer through Centrelink online account or the Express Plus Centrelink mobile app</li>
		</ul>
<p>If customers decline or are unable to use the online transfer, offer the Aged Pension via the Assisted Customer Claim (ACC) process. </p>

<p>If a correspondence nominee enquires about transferring to Age Pension on behalf of a customer, Service Officers can run the ACC workflow. ACC allows for the Verbal Declaration to be made by the customer (or their correspondence nominee).</p>

<p>A declaration is required prior to submitting the transfer. When a Service Officer reads the Verbal Declaration to the customer (or correspondence nominee), they must tick the Declaration box on the <strong>Review your claim</strong> page. This confirms that the Service Officer has read the declaration script and the customer (or correspondence nominee) accepts it. Once the Verbal Declaration is accepted and ACC submitted a <strong>DOC</strong> containing this information displays in&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Process Direct notes</li>
		<li>
Customer First super case</li>
		<li>
the Customer Claim Summary</li>
		</ul>
<p>Service Officers must not submit the transfer without the customer accepting the Verbal Declaration. Advise the customer of any outstanding documents, or action required to submit the transfer.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> identified Indigenous customers may be eligible for an automatic transfer without the need to complete an online transfer or SA383. Remind customers of their notification requirements, including advice that any money invested in superannuation is assessable as a financial investment from Age Pension age.
