<p>Compulsory ParentsNext participants are eligible for an exemption from participation requirements for up to 16 weeks from the date of their partner's or immediate family member's death. The Bereavement exemption must be coded to ensure the customer is able to be exempt for up to 16 weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> this exemption differs from the Bereavement mutual obligation exemption which is limited to 14 weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Death of a partner</strong></p>

<p>Where the Miscellaneous Update Details (<strong>NMIS</strong>) screen is coded in relation to the partner's death, a mutual obligation exemption will be automatically granted for a maximum of 14 weeks or if the customer is pregnant, to the end of the pregnancy (whichever is longer) where evidence is provided. A manual Bereavement exemption must still be coded to ensure the customer can access the maximum 16 weeks available.</p>

<p>Where the customer is still a compulsory ParentsNext participant when the expected date of confinement is reached, the system will automatically apply a ParentsNext temporary period of confinement exemption until the child is 9 months of age.</p>
