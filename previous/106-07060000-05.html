<p>For Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) Scheme claims, proof of age is required before benefits can commence for students who have not qualified for AIC in a previous year.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if Family Tax Benefit (FTB) is/has been paid for the student, then no proof of age is required.</p>

<p><strong>Bank accounts and balances</strong></p>

<p>Customers submitting new claims for income support payments or services may need to supply supporting documents of all income and assets held&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
by them</li>
		<li>
by their partner</li>
		<li>
jointly</li>
		</ul>
<p>If supporting documents from a financial institution (bank, building society or credit union) are required as part of the claim, they must show&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
account holder names</li>
		<li>
account number</li>
		<li>
BSB or name of financial institution</li>
		<li>
the current account balance</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Supporting documents that do not include some of the information may be acceptable, as long as the delegate is satisfied that the information is true and correct.</p>

<p><strong>Exceptions for customers reclaiming</strong></p>

<p>Some exceptions may apply to former customers who are reclaiming a payment or concession. These can include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
when they are close to the asset limit</li>
		<li>
they have previously been rejected because they were over the asset limit</li>
		<li>
if there is a significant change in circumstances</li>
		</ul>
<p>In cases such as these, they may be exempt from verifying their income and assets if they acknowledge in their claim that the information is still true and correct. </p>

<p>Service Officers can process these claims without asking for further bank account verification, unless there is doubt about the validity of the information provided in the claim. When in doubt, make a request for information to the customer.</p>

<p>See&#58;</p>

<p><strong>Claims subject to Liquid Assets Waiting Period (LAWP)</strong></p>

<p>JobSeeker payment, Youth Allowance, and Austudy are all subject to a LAWP. If they are claiming one of these payments, see <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-05020040-01.html">Liquid Assets Waiting Period (LAWP)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Claims not subject to LAWP</strong></p>

<p>In new claims for payments that are not subject to LAWP, the documentation does not have to include the exact balance declared within the claim. However, the delegate must be satisfied that the supporting documents show the overall financial position the customer has declared in their claim.</p>

<p>If the delegate conducts verification then the delegate has three courses of action&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they accept the customer declaration, no further action is required</li>
		<li>
the account balance differs from the declared financial position in the claim, the account balance can be corrected as long as the supporting documentation is either dated before or on the date of the claim</li>
		<li>
they are not satisfied the declaration reflects the customers financial position at time of claim, an updated statement or transaction record must be requested</li>
		</ul>
<p>If undertaking verification, staff should also check if any withdrawals do not appear to be for usual living expenses.</p>

<p><strong>Term deposits</strong></p>

<p>The supporting documents required for term deposits differ to other bank accounts and must include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
current balance of the term deposit</li>
		<li>
customer’s name</li>
		</ul>
<p>The latest statement should confirm the current balance. A reinvestment or rollover statement is acceptable, if an automatic reinvestment has occurred.</p>

<p>For <strong>overseas financial institutions</strong> supporting documentation is required that shows the applicable foreign currency value, current account balance and the account holder details, i.e. account name, account number and financial institution.</p>

<p><strong>Direct Investments</strong></p>

<p>For any Debentures or Bonds the latest statement or internet printout showing the current balance and ownership of the investment.</p></td>

<p><strong>Employment income</strong></p>

<p><strong>Ceased work</strong></p>

<p>Customers applying for a <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07060050-01.html">payment that requires verification they have ceased work</a> need to verify that they are unemployed through one of the following ways&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Employer Separation Certificate (SU1)</li>
		<li>
Letter from employer including - date last worked, reason for ceasing work and leave entitlements paid, the amount of the person's final payment, the amount of any money still owed by the employer to the person, any personal compensation details</li>
		<li>
Phone call to employer to obtain date last worked, reason for ceasing work and leave entitlements paid, the amount of the person's final payment, the amount of any monies still owed by the employer to the person, any personal compensation details</li>
		<li>
<strong>Note&#58;</strong> Service Officers should let the employer know that information obtained over the phone will be confirmed in writing. Follow up contact by sending a letter to the employer. Use a Q999 (free text) letter&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
restate the relevant details provided by the employer</li>
			<li>
advise employer to contact if any material information is incorrect</li>		</ul>
		<li>
If the customer was self-employed, a letter from their accountant or solicitor detailing that the business has ceased operating should be provided</li>
		</ul>
<p>There may be situations where this verification may not be required, see <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07060050-03.html">Employment Separation Certificate (SU1).</a></p>

<p><strong>Overseas work</strong>&#58; for a customer who ceased work overseas, a letter or statement from their employer providing details of their income, cessation date, reasons etc. and any holiday or other entitlements is suitable. If the customer is not able to provide such a letter, then a declaration statement should be done instead.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> verification of unemployment may also allow the correct application of non-payment and other waiting periods that may be applicable.</p>

<p><strong>Still working</strong></p>

<p>If a customer and/or their partner is still employed full-time, part-time or casual then request the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
two most recent payslips; or</li>
		<li>
letter from employer stating number of hours worked and gross amount paid for the two most recent pay periods; or</li>
		<li>
employment letter of offer or contract stating number of hours worked and gross amount paid</li>
		</ul>
<p>The Income and Asset form (Mod IA) and some online claims only requests the two most recent payslips. Subsequent and ongoing employment periods do not need verification, and details of the employment income can be reported verbally. If the customer is unable to be contacted by phone, or if there is doubt over the employment details or income amount, then formal verification may still be requested where necessary.</p>

<p>This applies to new claims where additional employment periods have elapsed between claim lodgement and finalisation.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> evidence of employment income is not required for job seeker claims as these customers are automatically profiled to report their employment income, any change of circumstances and mutual obligation activities before any payment is released.</p>

<p>For sales commission a document giving details, including the amount and date of receipt, is required.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> where a customer and/or partner are currently receiving an income support payment, documentation may be requested to assist in coding of the income, even though it may <strong>not</strong> be required for <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-04020030-01.html">verification</a> purposes.</p>

<p><strong>Overseas work</strong> for foreign employment income, the documents should&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
show the income amount received in foreign currency, rather than Australian dollars, and</li>
		<li>
be issued by the overseas person, organisation or authority making the payment</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Salary sacrificing/salary packaging</strong></p>

<p>For salary sacrificing into superannuation, a statement from the employer, on the employer's letterhead, advising the amount of the contributions which have been salary sacrificed and the name of the superannuation fund and member to which the payments are made.</p>

<p>For salary sacrificing or salary packaging for benefits other than superannuation&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
payslips are acceptable evidence as long as they show the total gross income, that is, the amount before any salary sacrifice deductions</li>
		<li>
if the payslips do not show this or, if it is unclear whether the payslip shows the non-grossed-up amount, the customer should provide&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
a copy of the salary sacrificing agreement, or</li>
			<li>
a statement from their employer on the employer's letterhead advising the type and amount of benefit received and whether or not the amount is grossed up or non-grossed up</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010050-01.html">Assessing salary sacrificing/salary packaging arrangements for employment income</a></p>

<p>For employer provided fringe benefits paid in addition to a wage or salary, the customer should provide verification in the form of&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a letter from their employer, on the employer's letterhead, stating&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the type and amount of the benefit received, and</li>
			<li>
whether or not the amount is grossed-up or non-grossed-up</li>		</ul>
		<li>
a recent payment summary that reflects the current financial year arrangement</li>

<p><strong>Identity documents, Commencement of Identity and Proof of Arrival (POA)</strong></p>

<p>Customers are required to provide acceptable identity documents when claiming a Centrelink payment or service that require Identity Confirmation. In some circumstances, the customer's partner will also need to confirm their identity. See <a target="_blank" href="../initial-contact-general/106-09010000-01.html">Identity Confirmation</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Identity Status</strong> is located in the <strong>Identity Confirmation Dashboard</strong> or the <strong>Snapshot</strong> icon in Process Direct (PD).<br>For a list of Identity documents, see <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07080000-03.html">Identity documents A to Z</a>.</p>

<p>Where a customer is experiencing genuine difficulty in providing all identity documents required to achieve an <strong>Identity</strong> <strong>Status</strong> of <strong>Confirmed</strong>, complete the Alternative Identity in the <strong>Identity</strong> <strong>Confirmation</strong> <strong>Dashboard</strong> in PD. See <a target="_blank" href="../initial-contact-general/106-07040050-01.html#bp01_L2GT_Alternative_ide">Alternative Identity</a>.</p>

<p>Where a customer is experiencing genuine difficulty in providing an Australian Birth Certificate as a <a target="_blank" href="../initial-contact-general/106-07040070-05.html">Commencement of Identity</a> document, birth verification from the Registry of Birth, Deaths and Marriages (BDM) can be collected by Services Australia via the Request for Verification workflow in the PD <strong>Identity Confirmation Dashboard</strong>. BDM provide verification of birth only, not a birth certificate.</p>

<p>If a customer needs help to apply for a birth certificate, download the application form from the relevant <a target="_blank" href="../initial-contact-general/106-07040070-05.html#bp05_L3LT_Australian_Stat01">BDM website</a>. Photocopy and certify the required documentation and remind the customer to include payment with the application for the certificate.<br>For more information, see <a target="_blank" href="../initial-contact-general/106-07040070-05.html">Commencement of Identity</a>.</p>

<p>Where a customer is experiencing genuine difficulty or inability in providing documents to satisfy Proof of arrival (POA) requirements, see <a target="_blank" href="../initial-contact-general/106-07040100-01.html">Verifying and recording Proof of Arrival (POA)</a>.</p>

<p>When International Services (CIS) return POA information it is proof of arrival. It cannot be used for identity outside Services Australia. It <strong>may</strong> be used, but not always, to satisfy residence requirements. It <strong>cannot</strong> be coded in the <strong>Identity Confirmation Dashboard</strong> in PD, but can contribute to an <a target="_blank" href="../initial-contact-general/106-07040050-01.html#bp01_L2GT_Alternative_ide">Alternative Identity</a> assessment.</p></td>

<p><strong>Parental Income</strong></p>

<p>For customers claiming Youth Allowance (YA) and ABSTUDY proof of parental income is required. For AIC, proof of income is only required for customers applying for the Additional Boarding Allowance. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-02010000-01.html">Parental Income Test (PIT)</a>.</p>

<p>Check for existing data in the parent(s) and sibling(s) records to update base tax year.</p>

<p>If the parent(s)/guardian(s) is/are currently receiving a payment through the Family Assistance Office (FAO)&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
check the FAO income for the previous year (<strong>FIPY</strong>) screen in the parent(s)/guardian(s) record</li>
		<li>
If actual income is available, this is evidence for the purposes of the PIT</li>
		<li>
It is important that the information from the Family Assistance record has been verified by the Australian Taxation Office (<strong>ATO</strong>)</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer has a sibling receiving YA or ABSTUDY, check the sibling's record for verified parental income details from their Household Income and Assets Details (<strong>NHI</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>If information is not available in existing records, request the following for both parents&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Income Tax Notice of Assessment for the Base Tax Year</li>
		<li>
if this is not available, the following may be used as verification&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
a letter from the customer's accountant/tax agent stating that 'Income received by you (and/or your partner), is not expected to exceed $xxxxx', <strong>or</strong></li>
			<li>
if the parents received a taxable pension, benefit, payment or allowance from Services Australia or Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) for the full base tax year, a statement of benefit from that department or agency, <strong>or</strong></li>
			<li>
PAYG payment summaries and/or statements of benefits must be supported by a statutory declaration (or accountant certification) confirming that these show the full amount of taxable income received by the parent(s)/guardians(s) during the base tax year, <strong>or</strong></li>
			<li>
where the parents received overseas employment income, then similar proof of income is required</li>
			<li>
copy of personal income tax return</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>If the parent(s)/guardian(s) is/are not required to lodge an income tax return, a non-lodgement advice recorded on the FAO non-lodgement enquiry (FNLE) screen for the purpose of Family Assistance, is not sufficient evidence for PIT purposes.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> an income tax return is only accepted as an estimate of parental taxable income. An income tax return may be used to confirm reportable superannuation contributions and net investment/business losses.</p>

<p>Customers who claim between September and December must supply both the Base Tax Year and the following financial tax year at the time of claim. Attempt to obtain both financial years at the time of claim when assessing and coding parent's taxable income.</p>

<p>Use the Annual Parental Income review (SY012 (A)) for following financial year. See <a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-07060060-01.html">Assessing Youth Allowance (YA) and ABSTUDY annual Parental Income Test (PIT) reviews</a>.</p>

<p>If the SY012 (A) collection data tax year information is not available, allow the claim to finalise on base tax year information and the Annual Parental Income review (SY012 (A)) will issue after the claim is granted.</p>

<p>Where the customer is applying for a Current or Reverse Current Income Assessment, similar proof of income for the Base Tax Year + 1 is required. However, customers can supply an estimate of income while waiting for proof to become available.</p></td>

<p>A Centrelink Evidentiary Certificate or Pension Bonus Scheme work record for the customer’s employment to verify they have worked a minimum of 960 hours for each 12 month accrual period or suitable similar documents from the employer. For example, payslips, timesheets or letter from employer.</p>

<p>If the customer is self-employed, verification must show that the work was gainful. For example, individual income tax returns, partnership tax returns (if necessary) and a letter from the customer stating the dates and nature of the work performed.</p>
