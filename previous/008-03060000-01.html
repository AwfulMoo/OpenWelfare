<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_DSP_not_payable">DSP not payable</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>DSP is not payable to a customer who is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
in prison </li>
		<li>
undergoing psychiatric confinement because they have been charged with an offence, and is not undertaking a course of rehabilitation, or</li>
		<li>
currently serving a term of imprisonment for any crime, regardless of whether this is the basis for psychiatric confinement</li>
		</ul>
<p>If a person in these circumstances&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
lodges a DSP new claim, reject their claim</li>
		<li>
is currently receiving DSP, suspend their payment (and cancel after a maximum of 2 years). See <a target="_blank" href="../ongoing-contact/102-12000000-01.html">Prison admission process and claims during incarceration</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>For example, a person who is serving a custodial sentence for an offence is relocated to psychiatric confinement because they have been charged with (but not convicted of) another offence, and are now undertaking a course of rehabilitation. This person <strong>cannot be paid DSP</strong> as they are still serving a custodial sentence for conviction of an offence, and are regarded as being in prison.</p>

<p>If DSP is suspended due to a person being in prison or psychiatric confinement, DSP is cancelled after 2 years if payment is not restored in that time. The person must be notified in writing of the decision to suspend or cancel payment. If DSP has been cancelled, the customer must lodge a new claim if they wish to reapply for DSP upon their release from prison or psychiatric confinement.</p>

<p>The date of effect of suspension or cancellation for a customer who is imprisoned or in psychiatric confinement will be the <strong>day after the customer entered custody</strong>.

<p>DSP may be restored from the date of their release from prison or psychiatric confinement. On the day of the customer's release, they may apply for an early payment (of up to 7 days) of their first pension instalment. Customers may also qualify for a <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-07010000-01.html">Crisis Payment</a>.</p>

<p>DSP is payable in very limited circumstances for people in psychiatric confinement who&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
have been charged with, but not convicted, of an offence, and</li>
		<li>
are undertaking a course of rehabilitation</li>
		</ul>
<p>This includes people in psychiatric confinement who&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
are undergoing a period of custody pending trial or sentencing for an offence (mental fitness for trial being assessed)</li>
		<li>
have been found unfit for trial by reason of mental impairment, or</li>
		<li>
have been found not guilty with no conviction recorded due to their mental impairment</li>
		<li>
have been found guilty but not been convicted as their mental fitness to be sentenced is being assessed</li>
		</ul>
<p>DSP may also be payable to people participating in&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
an early release program, or</li>
		<li>
a program of Community Service Order nature</li>
		</ul>
<p>DSP is also payable to people who are confined to a psychiatric institution but <strong>not</strong> in connection with a criminal charge (even if they are not undertaking a course of rehabilitation). For example, a person who is a danger to themselves and/or others, but who has not been charged with committing an offence.</p>

<p>Eligibility for DSP must be reviewed regularly, and immediately reassessed if there is any change in their circumstances.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Determining_new">Determining new claims for customers in psychiatric confinement</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>When determining DSP new claims for any customer in psychiatric confinement because they have been charged with a criminal offence, the Smart Centre Critical Response Team (SCCRT) must be satisfied the customer is not currently serving a custodial sentence for conviction of an offence, regardless of the reasons they are in psychiatric confinement.</p>

<p>The SA379 form will assist the SCCRT in determining the reasons a customer is currently in psychiatric confinement. This form must be completed by an authorised representative of the relevant correctional authority/facility.</p>

<p>The SA379 form includes questions to identify customers who cannot be paid DSP as they are currently serving a term of imprisonment for a crime. The form requests details about&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the reasons the customer is confined, and</li>
		<li>
if the customer is serving a term of imprisonment for a crime, regardless of why the customer is in psychiatric confinement (this information must be checked in all cases)</li>
		</ul>
<p>If an old version of the form is provided to support an application for payment for a customer in psychiatric confinement related to a criminal offence, the correctional authority/facility must be asked to <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-07030060-01.html">confirm if the customer is serving a term of imprisonment</a> for <strong>any</strong> crime. </p>

<p>Service Officers must ensure the relevant facility is provided with the current form version for future claims.</p>

<p>A Job Capacity Assessment (JCA) must not be requested if it is not clear whether DSP is payable because of the circumstances of the customer's lawful detention. The claim must be manifestly rejected without a JCA if DSP is not payable because the customer is currently serving a custodial sentence for conviction of an offence.</p>

<p>The effect of section 23(9) of the Social Security Act 1991 is that section 1158(b) of the Act does not apply to a person who is in psychiatric confinement because they have been charged, but not convicted of an offence during a period when the person is undertaking a course of rehabilitation.</p>

<p>For a customer to be undertaking a 'course of rehabilitation' for the purposes of sub-section 23(9) of the Act, they must be undertaking a planned series of activities that may include medical and other treatments directed towards improving the person's physical, mental and/or social functioning.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> people charged with an offence (but not convicted because of their mental impairment) who are placed under mental health orders in psychiatric institutions (for example, secure psychiatric hospitals/wards or in the 'mainstream' prison while awaiting transfer to a psychiatric institution) generally undertake a course of rehabilitation as a rule, rather than the exception.</p>

		<li>
alternative equivalent evidence about the customer's participation in a course of rehabilitation may also be accepted, such as a letter from the correctional authority</li>

<p>The SA379 should be completed by, or verified with, a Health or Allied Health Professional such as a Medical Practitioner, Registered Nurse or social worker.
