<p>A deferral can be granted before or after PIP has started, allowing FTB instalments to continue or restart. The extension of time is to allow the customer or their partner to lodge outstanding income tax return(s).</p>

<p>If appropriate, customers should always be encouraged to contact the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) prior to considering a deferral option. Tell the customer to visit the ATO website for more details.</p>

<p>The ATO can grant extensions to lodge and help the customer and their partner to meet PIP requirements. The <a href="../families/007-11010130-05.html">Resources</a> page contains a link to ATO contact details. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> an extension to lodge does not apply for customers subject to <a href="../families/007-11010140-01.html">PIP Sunset Clause</a>.</p>

<p>A deferral may be granted only in the following cases&#58;</p>

<p>FTB reconciliation occurs when all actual income/not required to lodge details (customer and partner) are received. Arrears payments will automatically issue and any non-lodger debt will be reassessed. To receive full annual FTB entitlement, customers must meet their income lodgement requirements  by 30 June of the lodgement year (extended lodgement year for 2011-12 or earlier years).</p>

<p>A bereavement deferral is not required after the death of a partner because they are then treated as a former partner. PIP does not apply because of a former partner's outstanding income.

<p>A Severe Illness deferral for the same person cannot overlap, but there can be multiple deferrals or exemptions for different types or a Severe Illness deferral for their partner. The deferral period can also be reduced if another deferral has already been granted.</p>

<p>A deferral may be granted for up to 6 months (subsequent deferrals will need to be assessed by Centrelink before the current end date, otherwise PIP will be reapplied).</p>

<p>A permanent deferral can be applied if a customer and partner have separate consecutive Severe Illness deferrals (or extensions) totalling 6 years for the same deferral reason. A permanent exemption will be granted and PIP will no longer be assessable. In this case the system will automatically trigger the permanent exemption.</p>

<p>A customer can be assessed for a social worker deferral if family and domestic violence exists within the current partner relationship and&#58;</p>

the customer and/or family may experience harm by requesting the partner to lodge their income tax return/s, or</li>
		<li>
family and domestic violence indicators are present</li>
		<li>
a customer cannot lodge their tax return because of the actions of their partner or ex-partner, it is possible to grant a deferral for a specified period</li>
		</ul>
<p>Social worker deferrals can include where the violence was threatened or carried out against a child, or another member of the family who resides in the household, and this has meant the customer has been unable to lodge their tax return</p>

<p>If the customer is distressed (due to domestic violence) refer them directly to a social worker for a full assessment and support.</p>

<p>Service Officers should assess the referral with care and sensitivity due to the nature of the issue by&#58;</p>

investigating customer and partner <strong>DOCs</strong> for information relating to existing family and domestic violence in the relationship</li>

discussing the circumstances with the customer to help consider the need for a referral</li>

<p>PIP is applied to <strong>both</strong> members of the blended family but deferrals can be applied to customers individually. If 1 member of the couple has not lodged their income tax return, PIP is applied to FTB for both customers.</p>

<p>In these cases, the customer is legally entitled to 99% of the total amount of the household FTB, leaving only 1% that has the PIP applied. Lift the PIP on the customer's record (only in this situation).</p>

<p>Be aware that the partner will get minimal amount paid if they eventually lodge which may possibly generate more family and domestic violence on the customer and/or family.</p>
