	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The purpose of carer reviews for CP and/or CA is to establish that the care receiver’s care needs continue to qualify the carer for payment, and that the carer continues to provide care and attention on a daily basis to the person they provide care for. Carers selected for review can be through Service Profiling, Age Milestones and by the Host system. Depending upon a carer’s circumstances, carers may be required to complete a medical, non-medical, CA taxable income or manual review. Manual Reviews may be necessary to ensure carers continue to meet qualifications for CP and/or CA.</p>

<p>CA adjustable taxable income reviews may be required to check that the carer's and their partner's combined adjusted taxable income is under the CA income limit.</p>

<p>Carer reviews include the following.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>Where a care receiver does not qualify for an income support payment, a non-customer Care Receiver Income and Assets (CRIA) review may be applied to determine a carer’s entitlement to CP. The review process will only be applied to adult and child care receivers when the recorded income is within $5,000 of the applicable income threshold and/or assets are recorded in the medium or high assets value range on the <strong>CRIA</strong> screen. The review activity matures on 1 November each year. See <a href="../carers/009-08060050-01.html">Non-customer care receiver Income and Assets (CRIA) test reviews for Carer Payment (CP)</a>.</p>

<p>For the purposes of CA and CP (adult) a terminal condition is where a person aged 16 years or over is in the final phase of a terminal illness and is not expected to live more than 3 months.

<p>For the purposes of CP (child), a terminal condition is where a child under 16 years has a terminal condition and is not expected to live more than 24 months. Child care receivers with a terminal illness will have a review generated 24 months after grant, and every 12 months thereafter. A Social Worker assesses initial reviews generated 24 months after grant. The Carer Processing Team conducts all reviews thereafter.

		<div class="block">

<p>Child Medical Reviews apply to carers in receipt of CA child only. The review process coincides with patterns of childhood development and detects changes in care arrangements. Carers are exempt from the medical review if CA was granted less than 12 months before the scheduled review date, or if they have been medically reviewed in the last 12 months. A Child Medical Review CA only will automatically commence when the child reaches the following development milestones&#58;</p>

4 years and 8 months</li>
		<li>
10 years, and</li>
		<li>
13 years</li>

<p>Development milestones are the ages at which a child should display the functional abilities listed for the age range (in addition to all of the functional abilities in lower age ranges). Similar to the CA only Child Medical Reviews, the review process coincides with patterns of childhood development and detects changes in care arrangements.

<p>From 20 September 2018, a $250,000 a year adjusted taxable income test applies to CA and CA Health Care Card Only recipients.</p>

<p>Carers are not subject to a CA income review while they are <a href="../carers/009-18091105-01.html">exempt from providing their income details for the CA income test</a>. An exception applies if the carer is only exempt because they or their partner receive Family Tax Benefit - in this case they may be required to complete a CA income review triggered from the data matching process with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).</p>

<p>Following the initial mailout, subsequent CA income reviews may be triggered. These will generally be triggered automatically but may also be manually triggered, see <a href="../carers/009-08060000-01.html#bp01_L2GT_Manual_reviews">Manual reviews</a>. <img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> Carers should complete their <a href="../carers/009-18090456-01.html">income review online</a>.</p>

<p>Automatic CA income reviews may be triggered in the following situations&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
ATO data matching will automatically trigger a review where the Adjusted Taxable Income (ATI) for the carer (and their partner if they have one) is $250,000 or more for the previous financial year. The rules to trigger a review take into account deemed income and expected ATI if one partner has not been matched with the ATO</li>
		<li>
The carer was not exempt from proving their income details for the CA income test as at 20 September 2018 (initial mailout)</li>
		<li>
The CA new claim was lodged before 20 September 2018 and the carer was not exempt from providing their income details when the claim was processed after that date</li>
		<li>
Changes of circumstances will trigger a CA income review in the following situations if the carer is not exempt from providing their income details for the CA income test and ATI details for the carer and their current partner were not provided in the same financial year&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the carer is linked to a new partner</li>
			<li>
the carer is no longer <a href="../carers/009-18091105-01.html">exempt from providing their income details for the CA income test</a> </li>
			<li>
a new account-based income stream has been added for the carer or their partner and the account holder is aged 60 or older</li>

<p>A manual review may be required when information is received that indicates entitlement to CP and/or CA has been lost. There are no time restrictions on when a manual review may be conducted, a manual review can be started whenever it is deemed appropriate. A Manual Review would be initiated for the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Services Australia receives notification a care receiver has returned to full time work</li>
		<li>
a carer or care receiver advises the agency the care receiver's medical condition has improved significantly</li>
		<li>
the agency has been advised by a third party the carer is no longer providing care for the care receiver</li>
		<li>
the Service Officer initiates a CA income review manually because the carer notifies one of the following and is <a href="../carers/009-18091105-01.html">not exempt from providing their income details for the CA income test</a>&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
