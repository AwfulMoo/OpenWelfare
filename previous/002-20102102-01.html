<p>The income test for FHA is linked to the allowance income test for Social Security payments such as JobSeeker Payment (JSP). However, from 11 June 2020 the rate of FHA is set under the Farm Household Support Act. <a href="../rural-and-remote-australians/002-20102102-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Services_Austra">Resources</a> contains a link to information about the income and assets test for FHA on the Services Australia website.</p>

<p>Ordinary income for FHA is assessed under Social Security Law. Key differences apply for FHA customers&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
From <strong>11 June 2020</strong> after the income and assets test is run and the customer's rate of FHA is payable at a rate more than zero (0) dollars, the customer must receive the maximum rate of Basic FHA for their circumstances</li>
		<li>
A Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) Disability Pension is excluded from the assessment of income for FHA purposes</li>

		<li>
For any FHA payments received up to 30 June 2020 (end of the 2019/20 financial year), actual farm business income is reconciled against the estimate after the end of each financial year.

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A farm business loss occurs when the amount of income from the farm enterprise and directly related farm businesses, is below zero for the financial year. From 16 December 2019, farm business losses can reduce the assessable amount of non-farm income up to the amount of $100,000. 'Allowable reduction' is the amount of farm business losses that can reduce the assessable amount of non-farm income.</p>

<p>Any customer that has a farm business loss recorded will automatically have the farm business losses rules applied. Customers do not need to apply for an allowable reduction. If a farm business loss is recorded, the customer's allowable reduction will exclude a <strong>daily </strong>amount of non-farm income from the rate calculation. This is up to the customer's maximum amount in the financial year.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Maximum_allowab">Maximum allowable reduction</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The maximum allowable reduction for a financial year is the <strong>lower</strong> of the&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
threshold of $100,000</li>
		<li>
farm business loss for the financial year, or</li>
		<li>
non-farm income amount earned for the financial year</li>
		</ul>
<p>For partnered customers the $100,000 reduction threshold applied to both the customer and their partner combined (that is, the threshold for a couple is $100,000 between them, <strong>not</strong> $100,000 each).</p>

<p>If the farm and their partner are both in receipt of FHA, they can both claim a portion of the reduction, but the total reduction cannot exceed the maximum allowable. Customers can request to change the apportionment at any time. There is no limit on the number of times the apportionment can be changed.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; a person's allowable reduction is applied across the entire financial year.</p>

<p>During the financial year, the farm business income estimate can be used to determine the allowable reduction for that year. If the customer advises of a change of circumstances, the farm business income estimate must be updated.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>Customers who operate more than one farm business and have a combined net farm business loss will be able to reduce their non-farm income.</p>

<p>An allowance reduction can only be applied where the total net farm businesses are running at a loss.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; there is a difference between the terms 'farm enterprise' and farm business'. The Farm Household Support Act, 2014 defines a 'farm enterprise' to mean an enterprise carried on within any of the agricultural, horticultural, pastoral, apicultural or aquacultural industries. The term farm business refers to a business that is operating in one of the industries mentioned above.</p>

<p>There may be more than one farm business in a farm enterprise. For example, a person may have 3 businesses (farms), located next to each other that share equipment. Together they are a farm enterprise, but separately, they are 3 farm businesses. Two or more farm businesses, depending on how related they are, may be the same farm enterprise or multiple, separate farm enterprises. Farm business includes related farm businesses such as agistment or contracting.</p>

<p>All losses for farm businesses are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
combined to get a single total loss figure that can be offset, and</li>
		<li>
up to a maximum of $100,000 per single or couple as per the maximum allowable reduction</li>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>At the end of each financial year, the customer will provide an updated income estimate for the new financial year for all farm and non-farm businesses. The new estimate can be based on income from the previous financial year and their estimated circumstances for the new financial year. For example, they may be expecting a loss, even though they profited last year based on environmental circumstances such as drought.</p>

		<li>
changes their business income estimate. This may indicate the farm business is now making a loss for the financial year, or is no longer making a loss </li>

<p>Farm enterprises and/or businesses may include trust or company structures.  These may run independently or in conjunction with other business structures. Trust and company cases are referred to a Complex Assessment Officer (CAO) for assessment.</p>

<p>Controllers of trusts and companies will be assessed based on their income and assets, including those held by the trust or company. Controllers can provide an estimate of their business income for FHA.</p>

<p>Non-controllers may qualify for FHA but will not be able to estimate the trust or company business income. Non-controllers are assessed on distribution income, see <a target="_blank" href="../business-and-employers/043-04050030-01.html">Assessing and recording distribution income</a>. </p>

<p>Money received on or after 1 July 2019 from the forced disposal of livestock is not considered income for FHA if the money has, or will be deposited into a Farm Management Deposit (FMD). This exemption does not apply to other income support payments.</p>

<p>The amount deposited or intending to be deposited will not be assessed as income. This lets customers choose the amount they want to deposit. However, only this amount is exempt. Any money from the sale deposited in another kind of account or kept as cash is assessed as farm business income for FHA.</p>

<p>The gross or net amount can be exempted if the customer is deducting business expenses.</p>

<p>The amount deposited or to be deposited in the FMD is an assessable asset and deeming rules apply.</p>

<p>The exemption applies to money received in the relevant financial year and only for that year.</p>

<p>Customers will need to have or open an FMD account in their name, not held jointly with their business partner.

Services Australia will not actively seek confirmation from customers about the deposit into the FMD</li>
		<li>
Customers are not required to provide evidence of the amount received or the deposit being made into the FMD</li>
		<li>
If a customer has not told the agency about the forced sale of livestock at the time of the sale, and the agency finds the money during farm business income reconciliation, an exemption will still be provided for the relevant financial year if all other conditions are met</li>
		</ul>
<p>After a forced disposal of livestock, each business partner can choose to deposit their share of the sale into their own FMD. If one of them deposits 100% of the money received into their own FMD, only that person will have the funds exempt from the income test. Whereas, if each business partner deposits 50% of the funds into their own FMD the amount each person deposits or intends to deposit will be exempt from the income test.</p>

<p>If the customer voluntarily advises the amount was not deposited into the FMD, the exemption is removed for the entire financial year. Update the farm business income estimate. The customer may have a debt when the farm business income reconciliation is completed.</p>

<p>The customer's farm business income estimate is updated to ensure it does not include the money going to the FMD. Customers can update their estimate at any time when they become aware their farm business income is going to change.</p>

<p>If a customer withdraws the money from the FMD in the financial year received, the exemption does not stop. This is because the exemption is not determined by the length of time the money is in the FMD. The amount held on withdrawal in other accounts or in cash, is included in the assessment of assets and deemed.</p>

<p>Income from deeming of the amount in the FMD is non-farm income and therefore can be included in the FHA farm business losses.</p>
