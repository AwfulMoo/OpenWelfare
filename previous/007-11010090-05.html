<p>During 2013-2014, Cassy received FTB for 2 children and was partnered to John until they separated on 20 April 2014.</p>

<p>At 1 July 2014, Cassy's estimated adjusted taxable income (ATI) was $15,000 for Cassy and $65,000 for John.</p>

<p>From 1 January 2014, estimated ATI was $15,000 for Cassy, and $50,000 for John.</p>

<p>From 20 April 2014, estimated ATI was $30,000 for Cassy (separated period).</p>

<p>During July 2014, Cassy advised Services Australia of not being required to lodge an income tax return.</p>

<p>John is required to lodge a tax return, but has not yet lodged.</p>

<p>$65,000 for 1 July - 31 December</p>

<p>$50,000 for 1 January - 19 April</p>

<p>FTB Part A and Part B supplements are included in the calculation, resulting in a top-up.</p>

<p><strong>Interim Reconciliation</strong> occurs on 1 July 2014 as John has not lodged a tax return.</p>

<p><strong>John's ATI</strong></p>

<p>The customer's entitlement is calculated using the most recent adequate income (Most Recent Estimate (MRE) for both).</p>

<p>This is compared to the Partial Reconciliation result (using estimates as provided) and the more favourable income is used.</p>

<p>In this case, the more favourable income is the most recent estimate. The customer receives a top-up.</p>

<p>This is compared to the previous reconciliation result (using MRE for both) and the more favourable income is used.</p>

<p>In this case the more favourable result is the final reconciliation result and so the favourable income is changed (it is described on the FAO Calculation Period Income Summary (<strong>FICS</strong>) screen as new favourable income).</p>

<p>During 2006-2007, Cathy received FTB for 2 children and was partnered to Robert until they separated on 1 January 2007.</p>

<p>At 1 July 2006, estimated adjusted taxable income (ATI) was nil for Cathy, and $50,000 for Robert.</p>

<p>From 1 October 2006, estimated ATI was nil for Cathy, and $40,000 for Robert.</p>

<p>Cathy claimed Parenting Payment Single (PPS) which was granted from 1 January 2007. Cathy lodged a revised estimate of $6,000, although this was not used to work out the ongoing FTB rate.</p>

<p>$50,000 for 1 July - 30 September</p>

<p>$40,000 for 1 October - 31 December</p>

<p>For the single period, 1 January - 30 June 2007, income reconciliation does not apply as PPS was paid, but maintenance income reduces FTB Part A.</p>

<p>FTB Part A and Part B supplements are included in the calculation, resulting in a top-up of $1,464.70.</p>

<p><strong>Interim reconciliation</strong> occurs on 1 July 2008 as Robert has not lodged a tax return.</p>

<p>The result for the single period does not change.</p>

<p>Cathy's ATI = $6,000 (most recent estimate)</p>

<p>Robert's ATI = $40,000 (most recent estimate)</p>

<p>FTB Part A increases due to lower combined income being used for this period compared to partial reconciliation.</p>

<p>FTB Part B reduces due to higher income of lower earner.</p>

<p>Interim reconciliation result = <strong>top-up</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Final reconciliation</strong> occurs once actual income details are received for Robert on 2 September 2008.</p>

<p>The result for the single period does not change.</p>

<p>Cathy's ATI = $6,000 (most recent estimate)</p>

<p>Robert's ATI = $40,000 (most recent estimate)</p>

<p>Therefore the FAO system calculates an overpayment of FTB Part A. This is not correct, as the customer should not incur an income related overpayment in an ex-partner period.</p>

<p>FTB Part B does not change.</p>

<p>The reconciliation result must be <strong>manually adjusted</strong> so that the final reconciliation result is the entitlement calculated at interim reconciliation using&#58;</p>
