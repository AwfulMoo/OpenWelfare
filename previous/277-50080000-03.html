<p>If a customer advises their relationship status will change at a future date, <strong>do not</strong> code the change.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
Advise the customer that if they believe their ex-partner knows their Self Service PIN or Password they should access the Self Service Channel to change these details as soon as possible</li>

		<li>
Advise the customer the <strong>Person Permitted to Enquire authority</strong> will automatically cease once the separation has been coded.

<p>To protect vulnerable customers, those considered to be at risk of family and domestic violence may have their relationship status updated immediately. When speaking to a customer about their separation, tell them that if their partner is in receipt of a payment and/or has an online account, their partner's marital status will automatically update to a non-partnered (for example, separated) relationship status. Their partner will be able to view the status in their Centrelink online account and Express Plus Centrelink App and changes to their rate of payment. Giving the customer this information allows them to make an informed decision of the risk and make any necessary safety preparations.</p>

<p>As information will be taken verbally, the MOD S and online update <strong>will not</strong> be required. Verification of separation after the records have been unlinked may need to be followed up if there is insufficient written documentation to verify that a bona fide separation has occurred on the customer's record.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> The process of 'unlinking' records prior to obtaining verification of separation is only required for current customers, who are linked to their partner.</p>
