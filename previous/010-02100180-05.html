<p><strong>Supervisor travel appropriate due to change of flight</strong></p>

<p>Nine secondary school students are travelling from their isolated community to their boarding school in the city. The only <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-02100090-01.html">appropriate mode of transport</a> is to take the journey in 2 legs. The first leg is by chartered light aircraft from home to a regional airport and the second leg from there to the city on a regular commercial flight. The only light aircraft that can use the local airstrip can carry no more than 4 passengers.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
As the journey requires a change of flight, supervision of the students would be beneficial. Allowing one supervisor for each 6 students, there would normally be 2 supervisors allowed for 9 students. In this case, however, 3 supervisors would be required as there will be 3 aircraft needed for the initial leg of the journey</li>
		</ul>
<p>The local community can provide 2 supervisors and the school will provide one of their teachers to be the other one.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
FAA will cover return travel for the teacher to travel from the school to the community (to meet up with the children) and back again. The 2 community supervisors will have their return travel from the community to the school authorised</li>
		</ul>
<p>It is not possible to do the return journey in one day.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<a href="../students-and-trainees/010-02100230-01.html">Additional costs associated with travel</a> will be approved (to cover the supervisors' accommodation and meals)</li>		</ul>

<p><strong>Supervisor travel appropriate due to the age of the students</strong></p>

<p>In a remote community 300 kilometres out of Katherine, there are 3 children aged between 12 and 14 who undertake secondary schooling via the Katherine School of the Air. The students receive ABSTUDY Schooling A entitlements. Twice a year the students are required to attend week-long on-campus residential blocks in Katherine. They qualify for Away From Base assistance to meet the accommodation, meals and travel costs for this activity. Under the provisions of FAA, a charter flight is booked to transport these students to Katherine. ABSTUDY has been asked to approve FAA for a supervisor to accompany these young students on the charter flight.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Given the age of the students, it is desirable that they be supervised on the charter flight. FAA for a supervisor to accompany these students on the charter flight to Katherine would be approved. The supervisor may be a parent, a community representative or a representative from the Katherine School of the Air. The supervisor is entitled to a return journey</li>		</ul>

<p><strong>Supervisor travel appropriate due to student behaviour</strong></p>

<p>Wongutha Christian Aboriginal School is a boarding school near Esperance in rural WA. At the end of each term, many of the boarding students are entitled to FAA for a flight from Esperance to Perth. A supervisor would not normally be necessary on this flight, as the students are familiar with this journey. However, last term there were some problems with the students' behaviour on the flight. For this reason, Wongutha has requested that a supervisor from the school travel with the students.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Due to the students' recent behavioural problems while undertaking this travel, it is desirable that a supervisor accompany the students on the flight from Esperance to Perth. A return journey for a supervisor is approved</li>		</ul>

<p><strong>Supervisor mandatory due to missed travel</strong></p>

<p>Jody is attending Djarragun College in Cairns and has returned home to Aurukun for the vacation period. Jody has requested FAA to return to school at the commencement of term 4. Jody has been attending Djarragun College for the last 3 years and is familiar with the journey, so a supervisor would not normally be necessary. However, Jody has missed travel on 2 prior occasions this year without valid reason.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Due to Jody's frequently missed travel this year, a supervisor is mandatory to undertake further travel for the remainder of the academic year. FAA would not be authorised and booked in advance until a supervisor is nominated to travel with Jody</li>		</ul>

<p><strong>Dependant's travel</strong></p>

<p>Peta is partnered with 3 children aged less than 10 years old, and has been accepted to study a Bachelor of Nursing at Edith Cowan University in Perth. Peta is enrolled internally and qualifies for commencement and end of travel from the permanent home in Port Hedland. Peta's partner is working full-time but decides to quit work and move the whole family to Perth to support Peta's studies. Peta's partner has to give 2 weeks' notice at work and therefore Peta travels to Perth alone to commence the course and find suitable accommodation. Peta's partner and the children remain in Port Hedland for another 4 weeks and then seek FAA to assist them to move to Perth.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Peta's partner and the children qualify for dependant's travel because the family now qualify for a <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-06040000-01.html">Low Income Health Care Card (LIC)</a> and it is reasonable that they travel to join Peta 4 weeks later so that Peta's partner could finish work, and accommodation could be arranged in Perth</li>
		<li>
Peta, the dependent partner and children will not qualify for <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-02100120-01.html">vacation travel</a>. Even though Peta is undertaking a 3 year course, once dependent's travel has been used to unite the family at the study location the vacation travel entitlement for all members of the family (including Peta) is forfeited. This is because there is no need for the family to return home in order to reunite the family during the year</li>		</ul>

<p><strong>Dependant travelling with Away from Base (AFB) student</strong></p>

<p>Kari is a single parent with a 4 year old child and receives Parenting Payment Single and ABSTUDY Pensioner Education Supplement. Kari is currently studying a Bachelor of Arts with the University of Queensland (UQ) via online.</p>

<p>Kari must attend a 2 week compulsory residential school on campus and lives more than 4 hours away from the campus. The activity is an approved Away from Base (AFB) activity.</p>

<p>Kari has no alternative care for her 4 year old child at their home location. The university is able to provide child-minding services for enrolled students.</p>

<p>As Kari has no alternative care arrangements at the home location, Fares Allowance is approved for Kari and their 4 year old dependent child to attend the 2 week compulsory residential school on campus.</p>

<p><strong>Family member travel appropriate due to illness</strong></p>

<p>Theodore is in the first year of secondary school and is approved to live away from home and board at Clontarf College. Theodore has contracted tuberculosis and is bedridden at Sir Charles Gardiner Hospital. The medical staff are very worried about Theodore's health and morale and have recommended family contact to boost recovery. The medical staff have ruled out Theodore travelling home due to the health issues, as well as the potential for infection of other travellers, and recommend a visit from a parent</p>

<p>Theodore's parent is approved for FAA for a chartered aircraft and a Qantas flight to visit Theodore from the permanent home in Oombulgurri.</p>

Soon Rylan will be performing in the school production, and has asked Jim to attend. Rylan has not utilised any trips under orientation or special purpose visit travel this year.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Jim is a community member with significant ties to the student, as both a neighbour and a long time music instructor. As Rylan has not exhausted the limits of approval for orientation or special purpose visit travel, Jim is approved for FAA to visit Rylan at the term address for the purpose of attending the school production</li>		</ul>

Lateisha is from the Ernabella community in the Pit Lands in far north South Australia and is required to catch a chartered plane from Ernabella to Alice Springs then a Qantas flight to Adelaide. Lateisha is in the fourth year at Kulkinya.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Lateisha would be approved for a travelling companion to assist from Ernabella to Kulkinya School for the Blind in Adelaide. Even though Lateisha has made the journey each term for the previous 3 years, the fact that the travel starts from a remote community and involves changing from a chartered flight to a Qantas flight and negotiating around Alice Springs and Adelaide airport, makes it extremely difficult. A travelling companion would be approved to accompany Lateisha to Adelaide and the companion would qualify for a return journey</li>		</ul>

<p>Freddy is aged 23 years old and has completed an undergraduate degree at Melbourne University, and commenced study in a Masters course at Queensland University. Freddy's home is in Sydney and qualifies for commencement and end of study travel. Freddy is deaf. Freddy has requested a travelling companion to accompany him from Sydney to Brisbane.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Freddy would not be approved for FAA for a travelling companion as the deafness does not prevent successful travelling between destinations or easily managing around a domestic airport as evidenced by Freddy having travelled from Sydney to Melbourne each year without an ABSTUDY approved companion whilst undertaking an undergraduate degree. Unless Freddy provided an additional reason why a travelling companion was required, approval would not be given</li>		</ul>

<p><strong>Education institution representative travel approval</strong></p>

<p>The prestigious Burnely College in Brisbane has received an application from 6 Year 8 students from Aurukun to attend the college. Aurukun does not have a secondary school and the students will qualify for away from home entitlements to attend a secondary school away from their permanent home. Burnely requires all prospective students from remote communities to undertake a preliminary selection test and interview prior to acceptance into the college. This is clearly articulated in their school admittance rules. Burnely have requested FAA for a staff member to travel to Aurukun for the day to undertake the testing and interview in the student's home communities.</p>

<p>FAA for the education institution representative to attend Aurukun would be approved. Each student will qualify for ABSTUDY FAA to live away from home in order to access a secondary level of study, and because Burnely College require all students from remote communities to be tested prior to acceptance into the college, FAA for the students to undertake the test would be approved. However as it is more cost effective for Services Australia to pay for one education institution representative to travel to Aurukun for the approved testing exercise than it is for 6 students to travel to Brisbane, the education institution representative will be approved for FAA.</p>

<p><strong>Supervisor travel appropriate due to students ages</strong></p>

<p>A group of students from Elcho Island have been invited to attend auditions at NAISDA Dance College. NAISDA requires prospective students to attend these auditions to assess suitability prior to being offered a place into the following year's tertiary course. All the students are under 18 years of age. As the students have never left the community on their own before, and, based on their ages, a request for a supervisor has been submitted with the travel request for the students.</p>

<p>A supervisor can be approved in this scenario. As each student qualifies for FAA, and because of the student's ages, travel experience and the likelihood of the there being changes in travel types/terminals, we would encourage and therefore approve FAA for a supervisor.</p>

<p>Four students are returning to school for term 2 from Saibai Island to Cairns.</p>

<p>Three of the students are in year 7 and under the age of 12, hence a mandatory supervisor is required.</p>

<p>The remaining student is in year 12 and under 18 years of age.</p>

<p>The year 12 student has been requested, as a representative of the school, to supervise the 3 younger students.</p>

<p>Even though the year 12 student is under 18 years of age, as the student is an experienced traveller with no history of No Shows, it is acceptable for the student to be considered a supervisor for the younger students.</p>
