		<div class="block">

<p>Superannuation is an investment to provide financial resources during retirement. On retirement, the money can remain in the superannuation investment or it can be used to start an income stream.</p>

<p>Employers, employees and self-employed people contribute to superannuation funds. Sometimes the government will add to it through co-contributions.</p>

<p>Overseas superannuation-like investments do not meet the definition of a superannuation fund in Section 9(1) of the Social Security Act. This means overseas superannuation-like investments are treated as overseas managed investments for social security purposes, provided the person can access the funds.</p>

<p>If a person cannot access the funds for example, because they do not meet a condition of release such as reaching a certain age, the asset value is not assessed as a managed investment.</p>

<p>Customers can set up their own superannuation funds. They are known as Self-Managed Superannuation Funds (SMSF) or Small APRA (Australian Prudential Regulation Authority) Superannuation Funds (SAF). Most SMSFs and SAFs can be identified by their name.

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> a SMSF or a SAF must comply with the Superannuation Industry Supervision (SIS) Regulations.

<p>Generally, accrued superannuation benefits are not accessible until the fund member leaves the workforce and reaches preservation age.

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>SMSFs or SAFs may have reserves that are set aside within the fund. They are 'unallocated reserves', that is, they are not part of any individual member's superannuation interest in the fund.</p>

<p>The reserves have different names but the most common are investment reserve and miscellaneous or general reserve. These are to be attributed to each member based on the contribution each member has made towards the accumulated reserves. That is, those members with more assets in the fund are likely to have made a larger contribution to generating the unallocated reserves. This may change over time where members make contributions or withdrawals.</p>

<p>Where it is not possible to attribute the reserves on the basis of each member's interest in the fund, the unallocated reserves will be attributed equally to each member of the fund. They are treated as superannuation assets and the assessment will depend on whether the person is either under Age Pension age or of Age Pension age.</p>

		<li>
paid for up to 2 years or 5 years depending on the contract, or even until the person turns 65 years of age</li>
		<li>
subject to a waiting period before the payments commence</li>
		<li>
usually paid as regular ongoing payments, but may also be paid as a lump sum arrears for a specified period</li>
		<li>
usually offset against workers compensation payments, Centrelink payments and other disability insurance benefits received by the member</li>
		<li>
The payments may stop if the member's employment is terminated or if they are reclassified as being permanently disabled and are paid a TPD benefit</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Regular ongoing payments</strong>&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Payments are assessed as ordinary income</li>
		<li>
The assessable amount is the gross income less any adjustment for the offsets applied by the insurance company</li>
		<li>
The superannuation fund may also make a superannuation contribution to the member’s account at the same time as the regular ongoing payments. If needed under the Superannuation Guarantee for the customer, it is not assessed as income. It must not be included in the ongoing payment amount. If the contribution is voluntary, it is assessed as income and included in the ongoing payment amount</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Lump sum payment of arrears</strong></p>

<p><a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-05020020-03.html">Lump sum arrears</a> can be paid for the period prior to the commencement of regular payments.</p>

<p>The assessable income is the gross amount less any adjustment for offsets applied by the provider.</p>

<p>Treatment of the lump sum arrears depends on when the person has present legal entitlement to the arrears payment. This is the date that the person could reasonably expect to receive the payment.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If present legal entitlement exists for the period the arrears payment covers&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the lump sum payment is assessed as income over the period the arrears relates to, and</li>
			<li>
may result in a debt if the person or their partner has been in receipt of an income support payment.<br><strong>Example</strong>&#58; On 1 August 2017, Peter applies to his superannuation fund to start his income stream. Peter is eligible to receive his income stream from that date. The superannuation fund starts Peter's ongoing payments on 1 October 2017 and pays him lump sum arrears of $4000 for the period 1 August to 30 September. The $4,000 is assessed as income over the period from 1 August to 30 September</li>		</ul>
		<li>
If present legal entitlement only exists from the date the payment is made&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the lump sum is apportioned forward from the day the person receives the payment</li>
			<li>
the payment is apportioned evenly over a period equal to the period that the arrears represents, up to 52 weeks.<br><strong>Example</strong>&#58; On 1 August 2021, Dom is paid a lump sum arrears payment from his income stream provider after being underpaid for a period of 6 months due to administrative error. Dom could not have reasonably expected to receive the payment as Dom had no knowledge of the underpayment occurring. The lump sum payment is apportioned over 6 months from 1 August 2021 which means the lump sum is added to Dom's other assessable income for the next 6 months</li>
