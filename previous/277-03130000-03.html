		<li>
a determination to cease the CTP investigation and not take any action</li>
		</ul>
<p>Advise the customers that if both parents jointly elect to withdraw from the CTP process, the payee must not be in receipt of an income tested pension benefit or allowance and if the payee elects to end the assessment, there may be adverse consequences for their Family Tax Benefit. Offer to transfer the payee to Centrelink to discuss their individual circumstances. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-03150000-01.html">Ending a Child Support assessment</a> for more information.</p>

<p><strong>Objection rights</strong></p>

<p>There are no objection rights to a CTP review, as there has been no decision. Once COA accepts a recommendation, any resulting decisions do have objection rights. Any subsequent Part 6A objection decision also has objection rights and the matter may be reviewed by the AAT.</p>

<p><strong>Open exchange of information</strong></p>

<p>Explain how open exchange of information relates to the CTP process&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
once a case is referred for a change of assessment or the customers lodge an objection to a change of assessment decision, ‘open exchange of information’ procedures apply</li>
		<li>
open exchange of information does not apply to correspondence or information gathered prior to a case being referred to COA</li>
		<li>
if a Part 6A objection decision is reviewed by the AAT, <strong>all </strong>correspondence and information (even if these were received prior to a case being referred to Change of Assessment) are subject to open exchange of information</li>
		<li>
for more information, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-09190000-01.html">Open exchange of information for Child Support customers</a>.</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Required financial information</strong></p>

<p>Ask the customer to provide&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
relevant financial information (identified through the <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-03130000-05.html#bp05050000_Additional_Resources">customer discussion planner</a>), and</li>
		<li>
any other information that would give a clearer picture of their financial circumstances</li>
		</ul>
<p>Use the information gathered in the initial investigation phase to guide the conversation. Advise the customer it may be necessary to send section 161 notices to external parties to request the financial information, if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they do not provide the requested information, or </li>
		<li>
the information provided is not sufficient to make a recommendation</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p>In addition to the information that they have provided, ask the customer to complete the Statement of Financial Details (SFD) and attach evidence to support their claims.</p>

<p>If either customer requests that you speak to a representative (for example, tax agent or accountant)&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
ensure they are confident the representative can provide adequate information about their financial circumstances</li>
		<li>
ask them to contact their representative in advance to advise they will receive a call regarding the customer’s finances</li>
		<li>
ask that they inform their representative that Child Support may ask them to provide evidence regarding the customer’s financial circumstances (for example, balance sheets or profit and loss statements)</li>
		<li>
advise if the customer’s representative (for example, tax agent) charges the customer for information they provide, Child Support are not liable for these charges</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> send a section 161 notice if the customer’s representative asks for the request in writing. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-04210000-01.html">Child Support’s information gathering powers</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Change of assessment process</strong></p>

<p>Inform the customers about the change of assessment process&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
although the CTP process only relates to initiating applications under reason 8A, the Decision Maker (DM) may also consider other change of assessment reasons when making a decision</li>
		<li>
the customers may respond to the registrar’s application with, or without a cross application for change of assessment under any of the 10 reasons. The customer may also lodge their own change of assessment application at any time. It is not necessary to wait until the CTP investigation is finalised</li>
		<li>
for more information, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-03120000-01.html">Change of assessment in special circumstances (CS)</a>.</li>		</ul>

<p>Review all the gathered information (for example, ATO search results) to determine if the assessment reflects the customer’s true financial capacity to pay. Weigh all available information and evidence and consider if&#58;</p>

the customer’s financial resources are substantially different to their adjusted taxable income</li>
		<li>
the customer’s financial resources are fairly represented in the assessment</li>

		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> unlike COA, CTP cannot make a recommendation to change the assessment based on a customer’s capacity to earn. Therefore only analyse the information that relates to the customer’s <strong>actual</strong> financial resources. See&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>

<p>Make the CTP recommendation once all of the financial information has been gathered and analysed, and information has been clarified with the customers. The recommendation will form the basis for the CTP report.</p>

<p>The recommendation must aim to reflect the customers’ true financial circumstances as determined through analysis. If their financial resources are significantly different from what is reflected in the assessment, first consider if this can be addressed through an administrative remedies (for example, income correction or estimate review/reconciliation) <a href="../separated-parents/277-03130000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Recommendations_Step02">go to Step 2</a>. Otherwise, Financial Investigators would generally recommend setting the adjusted taxable income at a more reflective amount. Remember, the customer’s financial capacity is not just based on their adjusted taxable income alone - also consider the customer’s property and financial resources.</p>

<p>For information about issues to consider when determining a customer’s financial circumstances, see the Child Support Guide 2.6.14&#58; Reason 8 – a parent’s income, property, financial resources, or earning capacity. </p>

<p>A link is on the <a href="../separated-parents/277-03130000-04.html">References</a> page and <a href="../separated-parents/277-04060000-01.html">Calculating financial capacity for business owners</a>.</p>

<p>If both customers’ incomes, assets and financial resources are fairly represented in the assessment, Financial Investigators would usually make a recommendation to not take any further action.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> where for example, the customers have jointly elected to withdraw from the CTP process or an administrative remedy has corrected the assessment, Financial Investigators may be able to make a recommendation prior to gathering and analysing all of the financial information.</p>

<p>When recommending a COA, consider whether it is appropriate to make a change because of 1 or both customers’ financial details. Determine whether to recommend a change to the customers’&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
adjusted taxable income(s), or </li>
		<li>
annual rate of child support</li>
		</ul>
<p>This recommendation can only be made if the customers’ income, property or financial resources are not fairly reflected in the assessment.</p>

<p>If it is determined that the customer’s financial resources are higher than what is reflected in their adjusted taxable income, this will usually lead to a recommendation to set their adjusted taxable income (that is, not the annual rate) at an appropriate amount. When making this recommendation, carefully weigh the evidence to determine the customer’s true financial resources.</p>

<p>If the customer has high financial resources, Financial Investigators may also consider recommending setting an annual rate, however, this is rarely appropriate. For example, if the customers have made a child support agreement in principle but have not been able to formalise it, then it may be appropriate to recommend setting the annual rate at the ‘agreed’ rate.</p>

<p>Financial Investigators must also consider whether the child support assessment is ‘unfair’ because the customer’s financial resources are not reflected in the child support assessment. For example, if the customer’s financial resources are high, but setting the customer’s adjusted taxable income would not lead to a significant change to the annual rate, the assessment would not be considered ‘unfair’. This would generally lead to a ‘no further action’ recommendation. If this is the case, <a href="../separated-parents/277-03130000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Recommendations_Step05">go to Step 5</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; the process for joint election to cease the review is not always required in cases with identified family and domestic violence concerns. Discuss with CTP team leader to determine required action. </p>

<p>The customers may lodge a 'joint election' to cease the CTP process at any time if the payee is not receiving any income tested pensions, benefits or allowances. This is an administrative process and not legislative until after the S98M have been issued.

<p>With the exception of no further action outcomes, finalise the report by changing the status in the CAPACITY TO PAY – CTP Finalisation dialogue box in the Capacity to Pay window to <strong>Finalised</strong>.</p>

<p>If a joint election to cease the review has been accepted, paste the UQ2.03 - Withdraw from change of Assessment accepted - both letter (JER acceptance letter text)  into an MX0-1 - Unique letter for each customer to communicate the decision, see <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-30010400-01.html">Letters Cuba process help</a> and <a href="../separated-parents/277-01060000-01.html">Letters for Child Support customers</a>.</p>

<p>For all other outcomes, where the customers’ assessment needs to be amended, record the change in Cuba by following the relevant procedural instruction.</p>

<p>If the outcome is recorded as ‘no further action’, customers must be contacted before finalising the CTP report.</p>

<p><strong>Contact the customers</strong></p>

<p>Contact both customers and inform them of the outcome from the CTP investigation, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-01010000-01.html">Contact with Child Support customers</a>. Advise the customers&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
if the assessment liability rates have changed</li>
		<li>
what the ongoing liability rates are and when the next payment is due</li>
		<li>
if any arrears have been created</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the payee collects the child support privately and there are no outstanding child support payments, <a href="../separated-parents/277-03130000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Finalising_CTP_01_Step08">go to Step 8</a>.</p>

<p>If the case is registered for collection and the ongoing liability has changed, obtain a commitment from the payer to pay the new ongoing amount.</p>

<p>If the payer has outstanding child support, negotiate a payment arrangement. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-04120000-01.html">Debt repayment (CS)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the outcome is ‘no further action’ and the customers provide new information, determine if the CTP outcome should change. If there needs to be a change to the outcome, <a href="../separated-parents/277-03130000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Recommending_ou_Step01">make another recommendation</a>. Alternatively, if the customers have raised other change of assessment reasons throughout the review, advise they can apply for a change of assessment themselves to have these other reasons addressed.</p>
