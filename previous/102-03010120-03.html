<P>The nature of the return to the parental home should be investigated to determine if it is still unreasonable for the customer to live at home.</P>
<P>Short visits (i.e. generally less than 28 days) to the parental home would not preclude the customer from independent status. Such visits should be encouraged particularly if the customer is attempting mediation with their family. In this case, no further action is required.</P>
<P>If these visits are ongoing or extend for longer (e.g. more than about 28 days), it may be an indication the customer has reconciled with their family or the situation at home has changed and it is no longer unreasonable to live at home.</P>
<P>If the customer advises their family situation has changed, or is unsure how long they will remain at the parental home, their UTLAH independence must be reviewed.</P>
<P>If the customer is:</P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>18 years of age or older</STRONG>, the decision to cease UTLAH can be made by a Service Officer and it is not necessary to refer the customer to a social worker for this purpose. If a decision is made that the customer is no longer independent, end the independence reason on the customer's record, <A href="../ongoing-contact/102-03010120-03.html#bp03_tbl_Assessing_the_c_Step09">go to Step 9</A></LI>
<LI><STRONG>under 16 years of age</STRONG>, they should be referred to the social worker at their local service centre. Check local procedures in Office Locator. See the <A href="../ongoing-contact/102-03010120-05.html">Resources</A> page for a link to the Office Locator. If local procedures are not available, and contact with the office cannot be established via telephone, complete the <STRONG>Refer to Social Work</STRONG> guided procedure</LI>
<LI><STRONG>aged 16 or 17</STRONG>, book a Social Work Unreasonable to Live at Home (UTLAH) appointment</LI></UL>
<P>Tell the customer a social worker will need to discuss their current circumstance to determine if it is still deemed unreasonable to live at home. Procedure ends here.</P>
<P>For Social Work staff, see <A href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-07020010-01.html">Reviews of independence for Youth Allowance</A>, to determine if the customer should still be paid as an independent person.</P>
<P>If the person is in <STRONG>state care</STRONG>, one of the qualification requirements for independent status due to state care is that the customer is not living with a parent. A customer who commences living with a parent will not be qualified as independent under state care.</P>
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> if the customer is reviewed and is no longer independent, parental income details may need to be provided so that the <A href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-02010000-01.html" target=_blank>Parental Income Test (PIT)</A> can be applied.</P>

<P>The customer's independent status needs to be reassessed as the customer is now living in the parental home.</P>

<P>End the independence reason on the customer's record.</P>
<P>Is the customer under 16?</P>
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> do not manually cancel YA payments for customer's 16 years or over.</P>
