<p>During the Earnings and Reporting workflow in Process Direct, the following prompt will display on the <strong>Messages</strong> screen if the customer is currently receiving CP&#58;</p>

<p>‘Carer Payment customers can work, study, train or volunteer for 25 hours per week (including travel time). If the customer wishes to relinquish payment, do not continue in this workflow.’</p>

<p>This message is provided to ensure staff are aware of the special processing that will be involved with CP customers. It also flags that if the customer is starting work and has arranged ongoing alternate care that this should be dealt with as a cancellation of payment outside the Earnings and Reporting workflow.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
For customers who want to relinquish their Carer Payment, go to <a href="../carers/009-04150050-01.html">Cancellation of Carer Payment (CP)</a>. Procedure ends here</li>
		<li>
For customers who have ongoing employment, where the total of all carer activities will exceed 25 hours per week, on an ongoing basis, see <a href="../carers/009-06030030-01.html">Carer Payment (CP) and Carer Allowance (CA) carer undertakes paid employment, self-employment, voluntary work, education or training activities</a>. Procedure ends here</li>
		</ul>
<p>Staff cannot update self-employment or hours for carers using the Earnings and Reporting workflow. Advise CP customers who start or change their self-employment income to use the <a href="../self-service/133-04090000-01.html">Manage Income and Assets online service</a> or issue a Profit and Loss Statement (SU580). If their self-employment income is already recorded, staff can update their activity hours directly via the Carer Payment Activity Summary (<strong>CPAS</strong>) / Carer Payment Activity Details (<strong>CPAD</strong>) screens. For more information, see <a href="../carers/009-06030030-01.html">Carer Payment (CP) and Carer Allowance (CA) carer undertakes paid employment, self-employment, voluntary work, education or training activities</a>. Procedure ends here.</p>

<p>* Employment income paid in a <strong>foreign currency</strong> must be coded on the Foreign Income Paid Details (<strong>FEIP</strong>) screen outside the workflow. <strong>FEIP</strong> coding does not create a Paid employment activity and a workaround is required. Activity details for foreign employment income should be recorded using another activity type on <strong>CPAS</strong>, such as Voluntary work. Procedure ends here.</p>

<p>All CP recipients with employment income must have their income recorded as detailed in <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010010-01.html">Recording and correcting employment income details</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> for CP (XWP) customers, this message is not displayed as they are exempt from the 25 hour rule and CP activity reporting requirements There is no restriction on the number of hours CP (XWP) carers can be away from their care receiver. Activity hours are not collected for these customers in the workflow or via self service channels. Procedure ends here for CP (XWP) customers.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
cancel Carer Payment (CP) if the customer has exceeded 25 hours per week and respite has not been used; and customer has no remaining Working Credit balance</li>

<p>If a Service Officer indicates that respite was used, a link is provided to the Temporary Cessation of Care workflow.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> for CP (XWP) customers, this message is not displayed as they are exempt from the 25 hour rule and CP activity reporting requirements There is no restriction on the number of hours CP (XWP) carers can be away from their care receiver. Activity hours are not collected for these customers in the workflow or via self service channels.</p>

<p>Employment income received by all CP customers must still be recorded. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010010-01.html">Recording and correcting employment income details</a>.</p>

<p>Procedure ends here for CP (XWP) customers.</p>

<p>A mandatory Carer Payment Details question set will be displayed for each employer on the <strong>Employment Income Update</strong> screen in the Earnings and Reporting workflow when a new occurrence of employment income for a CP customer has been inserted. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> the Carer Payment Details question set is not displayed for CP (XWP) customers. Their activity hours are not assessed.</p>

<p><strong>Have the employment activity hours changed since 'DDMONYYYY' (currently 'hh/mins' per week)?</strong></p>

<p>This question is to determine if the carer's employment activity hours have changed since last reported. The answer is defaulted to 'Yes'. Changing to a 'No' response will inhibit the rest of the question set. Where a customer is continuing to work regular hours, there is no need to update the hours.</p>

<p>For customers <strong>reporting late</strong>, where there is a need to update the number of hours of their carer activity because of updated employment income, the system defaults the event date to the current Entitlement Period Start Day (EPSD). Ensure the event dates in the prompt are amended to the EPSD for the outstanding period.</p>

<p><strong>How many weeks do you need to record (if the hours worked each week are different during the fortnight, select 2 weeks)?</strong></p>

<p>This question allows a Service Officer to record more than one set of hours for each week that is worked. Where the hours worked are different for each week of the fortnight, the Service Officer should select '<strong>2</strong>' and two separate event dates and details can be recorded.</p>

<p><strong>How many hours were worked per week (include total travel time)?</strong></p>

<p>The details will be recorded as hours and minutes through the Carer Payment Details question set.</p>

<p>To display the Carer Payment Details question set when recording employment income&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
save the response for the IOP or LOP details </li>
		<li>
select <strong>Yes</strong> at ‘Are there more employment details to declare for this employer?’ </li>
		<li>
at Type of Employment Details Update, select <strong>Carer Activity (CPAD) only</strong></li>
		</ul>
<p>The Carer Payment Details question set will appear automatically for customers/partners receiving CP who are eligible for a continuous income frequency of MTE or where Service Officers specifically select the ‘Carer Activity (CPAD) only’ option.</p>

<p>If the carer has started working but has not yet been paid, after adding the new employer details, select <strong>Carer Activity (CPAD) only</strong> as the Type of Employment Details Update.</p>

<p><strong>What is the Event Date?</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Carer Payment Details (CPAS)&#58; </strong>only one event date is required if the carer is working regular hours, and should generally be the Entitlement Period Start Day (EPSD). A second event date can be recorded and will default to the start date of the next week in the entitlement period (EPSD+7). Date can also be up to 30 days in the future to cease the hours worked if not continuing their employment </li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer works different hours each week of the fortnight, record the hours separately for each week. </p>

<p><strong>The hours and minutes should include total travel time to and from work each week. Details of this may need to be recorded in the Notes facility if an adverse decision on eligibility for payment is to be made, i.e. when time spent in employment and travelling to and from work (by itself or in combination with other activities) exceeds 25 hours per week.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Was the carer still providing care while working? For example, working from home and still able to care, Yes/No/Uncertain?</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>, <strong>Care is met</strong>. This is where the care receiver is with the customer during employment and the care is still provided by the carer, consistent with the care receiver's care needs. <br>For example, a carer who is working from home. A mandatory question 'Please describe how care is continuing to be able to be undertaken.' will be displayed. It will contain a free text field up to 70 characters, to enable description of how care is still being met (for example, working from home), which will be included on the <strong>DOC</strong></li>
		<li>
<strong>No</strong>, <strong>Care is not met</strong>. This is where the care receiver is not with the customer during their working hours and travelling time or the care receiver is with the carer but insufficient care or supervision is provided</li>
		<li>
<strong>Uncertain</strong>, <strong>Care is unknown (CF/CR only)</strong>. This is where it is not known whether the care receiver is with the carer during this activity, or if so, whether sufficient care is being provided. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> it is best practice to immediately assess whether care was provided during the activity. Only answer 'uncertain' if it is not possible to clarify with the carer</li>		</ul>

<p>Based on the answers to the above questions and including any other activities recorded on <strong>CPAS</strong>, a range of outcomes will be advised. This will vary between advising the customer of information or urgent follow-up action.</p>

<p>A prompt will appear showing what activities exist on the record, with the hours for each of the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Employment income</li>
		<li>
Any additional employment income</li>
		<li>
Studying</li>
		<li>
Training</li>
		<li>
Voluntary work</li>

<p>The workflow will allow the hours for any of these activities to be changed or zeroed out and an event date to be entered. New activities can also be added in the workflow for any of the above activity types. However,&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
self-employment details cannot be added using the workflow but can be changed or zeroed. Self-employment details can only be added when self-employment income has been coded on the Business Detail (<strong>BUS</strong>) screen</li>
		<li>
employment income paid in a foreign currency must be coded on the Foreign Employment Income Paid Details (<strong>FEIP</strong>) screen outside the workflow. <strong>FEIP</strong> coding does not create a Paid employment activity and a workaround is required – activity details for foreign employment income should be recorded using another activity type such as Voluntary work.</li>

<p>The Families estimate will be displayed as an overall total, and will flag whether any components exist other than normal taxable income such as net rental income or non-taxable pension with a value greater than zero.
