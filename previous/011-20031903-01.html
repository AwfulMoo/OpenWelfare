<p>On 11 March 2020, the Prime Minister announced a health plan to fight COVID-19 to protect all Australians, including vulnerable groups such as the elderly, those with chronic conditions and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.</p>

<p>New temporary telehealth and telephone MBS items supported Australians with access to essential health services if they were unable to see a health professional face to face during the pandemic. </p>

<p>Temporary pathology testing, MRI and vaccine support services were introduced to support the pandemic response.</p>

<p>From 1 January 2022, most of these telehealth and telephone services transitioned to permanent arrangements under the MBS.</p>

<p><strong>Vaccine suitability assessments</strong></p>

<p>MBS items (93624-93661) are available for GPs and suitably qualified health professionals to assess a patient’s suitability to get a COVID-19 vaccine. </p>

<p>The service is free to patients and the MBS items <strong>must</strong> be bulk billed.</p>

<p>Patients are expected to have a face-to-face assessment before they get the vaccine. Benefits are still payable if the patient is assessed as not suitable or decides not to proceed with the vaccination.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The items are categorised by&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Practitioner (GP or OMP)</li>
		<li>
Location (Metropolitan MMM1 or non-metropolitan MMM2-7)</li>
		<li>
Time Period (business hours or after hours)</li>
		<li>
Dose </li>
		</ul>
<p>This service&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
must be bulk billed</li>
		<li>
must be provided face-to-face</li>
		<li>
can be provided by another suitably qualified health professional under the supervision of the practitioner</li>
		<li>
must not be rendered at, or arranged by a hospital</li>
		</ul>
<p>To provide a COVID-19 vaccine suitability assessment, the vaccine must be immediately available after the assessment at the same location.</p>

<p>Other relevant health professionals can provide the vaccine assessment items on behalf of a medical practitioner. In order to bill Medicare for a vaccine suitability assessment service provided by another health professional, it remains a prerequisite that a medical practitioner provide overall, on-site supervision to the health professional undertaking the service.</p>

<p>Health professionals who provide a COVID-19 vaccination to a patient must be appropriately qualified and trained to deliver COVID-19 vaccines.</p>

<p>Items 93660 and 93661 enable suitably qualified health professionals to provide vaccine suitability assessment services on behalf of a medical practitioner who is not at the location where the service is performed. These services are performed off-site and not at the medical practice.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The <a href="../your-health/011-20031903-05.html">Resources</a> page contains a list of the item numbers and useful links.</p>

<p><strong>Flag fall arrangements</strong></p>

<p>Practitioners can claim a flag fall service item (90005) to travel to perform a COVID-19 vaccine suitability assessment at a&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
residential aged care facility</li>
		<li>
residential disability setting facility</li>
		<li>
person’s place of residence</li>
		<li>
a place other than at the practice location, not including a hospital</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p>This service is to support patients who are unable to attend a medical practice due to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a medical condition</li>
		<li>
disability</li>
		<li>
dementia, or</li>
		<li>
frailty</li>
		</ul>
<p>Staff at these locations are also eligible for this service.</p>

<p>Billing requirements&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
only payable for the first patient treated at each location</li>
		<li>
must be co-claimed with a COVID-19 vaccine suitability assessment service</li>
		<li>
must be bulk billed, and</li>
		<li>
is not eligible for any bulk billing incentive</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> where an in-depth assessment is performed at the same time, the flag fall and bulk billing incentive are associated with the suitability assessment service and payable.</p>

<p>See <a href="../your-health/011-20031903-05.html">Resources</a> for a link to the factsheet on MBS Online.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>COVID-19 vaccine booster incentive</strong></p>

<p>Temporary item 93666 is available to support medical practitioners providing vaccine suitability assessment services to patients who require booster vaccinations.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 vaccine booster incentive item is payable when&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a patient receives a booster dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and</li>
		<li>
it is billed with existing items 93644, 93645, 93646, 93647, 93653, 93654, 93655 and 93656</li>
		</ul>
<p>The item is not payable for patients receiving a second dose and will be monitored in post-payment compliance.</p>

<p>A booster dose means a dose of a COVID-19 vaccine that is not a primary dose. This varies according to the patient. See <a href="../your-health/011-20031903-05.html">Resources</a> for a link to the ATAGI statement on defining 'up-to-date' status for COVID-19 vaccination.</p>

<p>Item 93666 is payable in conjunction with MBS item 90005 (flag fall service) if all the following are met&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the above requirements are met</li>
		<li>
the vaccine suitability assessment service is delivered to a patient at an eligible location outside consulting rooms</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p><strong>In-depth patient assessment</strong></p>

<p>GPs and medical practitioners claim items 10660 and 10661 when providing additional assessment and advice related to the patient’s risk and benefits for the COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

<p>Billing requirements&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
personal attendance by the GP or medical practitioner lasting more than 10 minutes</li>
		<li>
must be bulk-billed</li>
		<li>
provided with the relevant COVID-19 vaccine suitability assessment service (93624-93656)</li>
		<li>
can be claimed once per patient per lifetime</li>
		<li>
cannot be claimed with item 93660 and 93661</li>
		<li>
can be claimed with item 93666</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p>See <a href="../your-health/011-20031903-05.html">Resources</a> for a link to the factsheet on MBS Online.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Vaccination phases</strong></p>

<p>Patients will be eligible for vaccination in phases. The National Rollout Strategy details the priority populations and phases. See the Department of Health and Aged Care website for more information on the vaccination phases. See <a href="../your-health/011-20031903-05.html">Resources</a> for a link.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Age restrictions</strong></p>

<p>Age restrictions were applied to COVID-19 vaccine support services in the early vaccination phases. The age restrictions have been removed and all Medicare patients are eligible where the service is clinically relevant.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> people who are not eligible for Medicare may still receive a free COVID-19 vaccine. For further information, they can contact the health department in the state or territory where they are living.</p>

		<li>
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health practitioner immunisation item (10988)</li>
		</ul>
<p>COVID-19 vaccine assessment items may be co-claimed with normal attendance items (e.g. 23) where the patient attends for an unrelated condition. The relevant incentive item is still payable for the other attendance.</p>

<p>Patients presenting with multiple clinical matters requiring attention should be encouraged to book a separate consultation in addition to their vaccine assessment. In some cases, this may not be possible or in the patient’s best interest.</p>

<p>Co-claiming is <strong>only</strong> allowed where the additional services <strong>do not</strong> relate to the vaccine assessment item. </p>

<p>Normal MBS multiple same-day attendance rules apply. For example, MBS item 10997 for monitoring and support of a person with a chronic disease by a practice nurse. This item&#58;</p>

provided the COVID-19 vaccine</li>		</ul>
		<li>
is <strong>claimable</strong> if the practice nurse provided a service to manage the patient’s chronic medical condition</li>

time of each attendance</li>

<p><strong>Restriction with bulk bill incentives</strong></p>

<p>Health professionals can claim another eligible MBS item with a bulk bill incentive on the same day/claim.</p>

<p>Before rejecting the incentive item check the claim or the patient’s history for an eligible bulk-billed item. No text or notation is needed to support paying the incentive item.</p>

<p>Health professionals can use the approved assignment of benefit form for manual or online claiming. The patient or responsible person must <strong>not</strong> sign a blank or incomplete assignment of benefit form.</p>

<p>If the patient can’t assign their right to a Medicare benefit for manual and online claiming, Services Australia can accept a signature on the assignment form from a third party, for example, the patient's&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
parent</li>
		<li>
guardian</li>
		<li>
power of attorney</li>
		<li>
other responsible person</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the Department of Health and Aged Care have advised there are temporary options available for obtaining patient signatures during COVID-19, which are covered below.</p>

<p><strong>Obtaining a signature during COVID-19</strong></p>

<p>If the patient is unable to provide a signature assigning their benefit, the health professional's written record of the patient’s agreement is sufficient. Agreement can be obtained by one of the below options&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
writing</li>
		<li>
email agreement, or</li>
		<li>
verbally (through the technology used in the course of the attendance)</li>
		</ul>
<p>For manual bulk bill claims, the assignment of benefit must include either&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
a patient signature, or </li>
		<li>
the reason why the patient was unable to sign (for example, COVID-19, risk of exposure to COVID-19, verbal agreement, telehealth, phone consult) </li>
		</ul>
<p>If the assignment of benefit form is <strong>blank</strong> it should be returned to the practice/health professional.</p>

<p>This temporary measure will cease on 31 December 2022.</p>

<p><strong>Record keeping requirements</strong></p>

<p>The practitioner should keep their own record that </p>
		<ul>		<li>
the patient agreed or acknowledged that the service was provided, and </li>
		<li>
the Medicare benefit could be paid directly to the professional</li>
		</ul>
<p>The Department of Health and Aged Care may investigate potentially fraudulent claims by seeking to verify that the service was provided to a patient. However, the Department of Health and Aged Care is not intending to undertake compliance activity directly focused on whether the assignment of benefit process aligned with the usual requirements.</p>
