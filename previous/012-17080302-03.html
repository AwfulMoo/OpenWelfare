<p>The Assessment worksheet is broken down into the following <strong>Sections</strong> to correspond with the sections completed by the applicant in the MIOC application&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Claim Details</li>
		<li>
Incident Details</li>
		<li>
Insured Person’s Details</li>
		<li>
Policy Details</li>
		<li>
Settlement and Plaintiff Costs</li>
		<li>
Defence Costs (and MIOC Expense Reconciliation)</li>
		<li>
Application Finalisation</li>
		<li>
Total Application Costs</li>
		</ul>
<p>At the top of the assessment worksheet, complete the sections for <strong>ARN, Insured person’s name</strong> (taken from the <strong>Insured person’s details</strong> section in MIOC) and <strong>Claim ID</strong> (taken from the <strong>Claim details</strong> section in MIOC).</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> for a subsequent application lodged against a migrated application, Assessing Officers will need to check the Insured Person’s name in HPE Content Manager (TRIM).</p>

<p>Assessing Officers can copy and paste information from MIOC into the document.</p>

<p>Follow the instructions and prompts noted on the Assessment worksheet to complete the assessment process and determine an assessment outcome.</p>

<p>Complete all relevant questions of the assessment worksheet, selecting the <strong>Answer </strong>column checkbox that corresponds with the information provided in the MIOC application. Check that the evidence provided supports the information stated in the MIOC application. </p>

<p>MIOC determines what supporting evidence or documents are required based on the applicant’s answers to the questions.</p>

<p>All supporting documents are uploaded by the applicant in MIOC.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Select <strong>Supporting documents</strong> from the drop down menu at the top of the screen. This will take the user to the <strong>Supporting documents</strong> section in the application</li>
		<li>
Select <strong>Download</strong> beside the document to view and <strong>Open</strong></li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p>The applicant may have supplied more than 1 relevant document as evidence of the information provided, or the same document for different categories of evidence.</p>

<p>For each question on the worksheet, locate the supporting document in MIOC, note the pdf/word document details in the <strong>Supporting Evidence location </strong>column of the worksheet. Note any relevant comments<strong> </strong>and/or discrepancies in the <strong>Comments </strong>column of the worksheet, as guided by the prompts and instructions on the worksheet.</p>

<p><strong>Question 1&#58;</strong> Is this an Initial application?</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Answer the question by checking the ‘Yes’ checkbox for an initial application and move to question 3, or ‘No’ for a subsequent application and complete Question 2</li>
		<li>
Where the application is a subsequent application with no changes from the initial application (as indicated in MIOC under <strong>Claim Details</strong>), check the ‘No’ checkbox at question 2. Confirm all details against the previous applications for questions 3 to 17, noting any discrepancies, and go to question 18</li>
		<li>
For an initial application, or subsequent application where changes to the initial application have occurred, select the ‘Yes’ checkbox at question 2 and complete Questions 3 to 31 </li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p><strong>Questions 2 to 13&#58;</strong> For the <strong>Claim Details</strong>, <strong>Incident Details</strong> and <strong>Insured Person’s Details</strong> sections of the assessment worksheet, note the relevant information provided in the MIOC application on the Assessment worksheet.</p>

<p>For example&#58; at Question 7, note the Date of Notification (DoN) in the <strong>Comments</strong> column of the worksheet, open the relevant supporting document provided in MIOC and locate the specific details relating to notification of the claim to the insurer. Record the document <strong>Filename</strong> and <strong>Page number/s</strong> in the <strong>Supporting evidence location</strong> column on the worksheet. Determine if the information provided in the MIOC application is correct and supported by the evidence provided. Note any relevant findings or discrepancies in the <strong>Comments</strong> column on the worksheet.</p>

<p><strong>Supporting Evidence&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
The evidence of the insurer approving indemnity of the insured person, and any special conditions or exclusions, can be in the form of a Claims Verification Form (CVF), policy schedule or a letter or email from the insurer </li>
		<li>
The date of incident (DoI) can be identified from court documents, such as the Statement of Claim (SoC), Notice of Claim (NoC), or a letter from the member stating details of the claim. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the incident occurred on or after 1 July 2002, this is not an eligible IBNR claim</li>
		<li>
The evidence that the insured person was a practitioner of an eligible medical practice, confirming the member’s specialisation, may be identified from court documents, or other supporting documents, such as the CVF or policy schedule</li>
		<li>
The Australian state, territory or external territory in which the incident took place can be identified from court documents or a letter from the member stating details of the claim</li>
		<li>
The DoN must be on or after 1 July 2002 and can be evidenced by date stamped correspondence from the insured person to the insurer, or by a telephone activity log evidencing verbal notification. <strong>Note&#58; </strong>if the DoN is after 1 Jul 2004, and the insured person is eligible under the ROCS, this is not an eligible IBNR claim and must be submitted under the ROCS</li>
		<li>
The insured person must have had incident-occurring cover with an MDO, for the incident, on 30 June 2002. Evidence that the insured person was covered under an incident-occurring based cover can be identified from a Claims Verification Form (CVF) or letter or email from the insurer</li>
		<li>
The evidence that the insured person was financial at DoI can be in the form of a summary of premium payments by the insured person or a letter or email from the insurer</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p><strong>Questions 14 to 22&#58; </strong>Check the appropriate checkboxes in the <strong>Answer</strong> column of the worksheet and note the relevant <strong>Policy Details</strong> or <strong>Discretionary assistance</strong> taken from the MIOC application, in the <strong>Comments</strong> column of the worksheet. Open the supporting document/s provided in MIOC. Check that the details provided in MIOC are supported by the evidence provided. Record the location of the supporting evidence on the worksheet and note any comments or discrepancies.</p>

<p>If the insured person is covered under discretionary assistance (incident‑occurring based cover), check the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
incident-occurring based cover for an incident, was in place with an MDO on 30 June 2002</li>
		<li>
 there was an arrangement between the MDO and the insured, or between the MDO and someone else, on 30 June 2002 and under the arrangement, the MDO&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
would have been able to indemnify the person in relation to the incident if the person were to make a proper claim after 30 June 2002 in relation to the incident; and</li>
			<li>
would have been able, in the ordinary course of its business, to indemnify the person in relation to the incident even if the person had ceased to be a member of the MDO when the claim was made</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>The insured need not have been a member of the MDO on 30 June 2002 to have incident‑occurring based cover for the incident.</p>

<p>If the insured person is covered under a policy, check the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the limit of the insurance for the claim</li>
		<li>
there are no special conditions or sublimits applicable to the claim</li>
		<li>
any policy deductibles have been deducted from the claim</li>
		</ul>

<p><strong>Questions 23 to 25&#58; </strong>Answer <strong>Settlement and Plaintiff Costs </strong>questions. Note the total amount, amount claimed and any apportionment details, and record the relevant amounts and details on the worksheet for Settlement and Plaintiff Costs. Check that the details provided in MIOC are supported by the evidence provided. Record the location of the supporting evidence on the worksheet and note any comments and discrepancies.</p>

<p><strong>Questions 26 to 28&#58; </strong>If defence costs are being claimed, perform a reconciliation of the costs being claimed.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Open the ‘MIOC Expense Reconciliation template’ located in the shared drive at&#58;<br>G&#58;\med_indemn\Claims by ARN\Assessment\MIOC assessment</li>
		<li>
Save the document as ‘MIOC Expense Rec_ARN[Application number]-[Insurer identifier number and letter]-[Scheme identifier letter]’, for example ‘MIOC Expense Rec_ARN6000-1U-I’, in the relevant application folder</li>
		<li>
Copy and paste the invoice information listed under <strong>Defence Costs </strong>details (under invoice date, invoice number, amount claimed and cost shared) from MIOC into the spreadsheet</li>
		<li>
Check that each defence cost being claimed is supported by the invoice or evidence provided and that the agency’s calculation of the total defence costs reconciles with the total defence costs stated in the MIOC application</li>
		<li>
When all invoices have been checked, copy the expense reconciliation information from the template to the end of the assessment worksheet under <strong>MIOC Expense Reconciliation. </strong>Select the relevant checkbox to indicate the invoices have not been claimed in a previous application or if it is an initial application and doesn’t apply</li>
		<li>
Where a financial discrepancy is identified, provide relevant comments in ‘Additional Notes’ under <strong>Recommendation </strong>in the assessment worksheet. For example, if GST has been claimed in an invoice, the discrepancy may result in a letter under section 38 of the Medical Indemnity Act 2002 being sent to the applicant to clarify the discrepancy</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p><strong>Questions 29 to 30&#58;</strong> Answer the <strong>Application Finalisation </strong>questions. If there is no evidence to the contrary, select the ‘No’ checkbox and note ‘No evidence to contradict answer’ in the <strong>Comments </strong>column.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Question 31&#58;</strong> Check that the amount calculated at ‘Total amount claimed in this application’ in MIOC reconciles with the MIOC Expense Reconciliation spreadsheet. Note the total amount and claimed amount in the <strong>Comments </strong>column on the assessment worksheet under <strong>Total Application Costs</strong>. </p>

<p>Note any issues, discrepancies or comments in the <strong>Additional Notes </strong>section of the worksheet.</p>

<p>Create a case note in MIOC in the <strong>Notes</strong> section detailing any issues, discrepancies or comments from the assessment, particularly if it could result in the application being deemed not payable or where further information is required.</p>
