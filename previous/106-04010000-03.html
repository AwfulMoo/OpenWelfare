<p>Claims identified as needing assessment under an international agreement <strong>must</strong> have all residence and identity information coded before being referred to International Services (CIS).</p>

<p>Make sure&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
All residence information provided with the claim is coded (including residence in other countries on CRES). See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-06020020-03.html">Residence and Portability screens</a>, and</li>
		<li>
Identity is confirmed. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07040070-01.html">Confirmation of Identity</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>For Disability Support Pension (DSP) claims, part of the residence decision includes if <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03050010-01.html">the person was an Australian resident at the time they first met the Continuing Inability to Work (CITW) criteria</a> (if applicable). This decision should be coded in the <strong>CITW/Blind Residence</strong> field on the Pensions Disability Information (<strong>PDI</strong>) screen. If a Job Capacity Assessment (JCA) report is needed, get the JCA <strong>before</strong> referring the claim to International Services (CIS).</p>

<p>Based on the residence data recorded the system will decide if the payment type claimed is in scope for agreement assessment instead of autonomous assessment.</p>

<p>Claims lodged in Australia may&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
already be indexed and scanned to record, or</li>
		<li>
lodged online and found within Process Direct</li>
		</ul>
<p>Residence will generally be coded and identity confirmed for these claims.</p>

<p>Agreement claims lodged inside Australia cannot be processed in Process Direct and will need to be indexed in Customer Record (CR). Claims lodged from outside Australia will need to be indexed in Customer Record.</p>

<p><strong>Before</strong> indexing a claim&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Link or unlink customer and partner records if required</li>
		<li>
Update all contact details. For example, address, contact phone numbers including mobiles, email address</li>
		<li>
If customer has previously been subscribed to Electronic Messaging and staff are transferring them to Environment I, check Electronic Messaging and Online Letters (<strong>EMOL</strong>) screen in Customer First and unsubscribe customer if <a href="../self-service/133-05000000-03.html">necessary</a></li>
		<li>
Check the customer is in the correct Environment and transfer (ICOA) if necessary. See <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-03020020-01.html">Inter-environment change of address (ICoA) transfer of a customer record using Customer First or Customer Record</a>.</li>
		<li>
If current income and assets information is provided with the claim, update income and assets if the customer has a partner and the partner is receiving payment</li>
		<li>
Classify any debt shell generated by the income and assets update to International Services .ZALL_INTL_IA_DEBT work item</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Record the debt investigation details using the <strong>Fast Note</strong>, select <strong>Auto text </strong>option &gt; <strong>International Services </strong>&gt;<strong> Debt </strong>&gt; select from options&#58; <strong>Autocompleted SBO Debts, External Debt Referral (XWA) and Internal Debt Referral (UKD)</strong></li>		</ul>
		<li>
Make sure any person nominated as a Person Permitted to Enquire (PPE) in the claim form is coded on the customer record. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07090000-03.html">Person Permitted to Enquire (PPE) authority</a></li>
		<li>
Run the Nominee Action script or Nominee Action Guided Procedure if customer has provided nominee forms (AUS221/SS313). See <a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-04090010-01.html">Appointing nominees</a> for more details if needed</li>
		</ul>
<p>Index the claim (if required), ensuring to add the appropriate <strong>keywords</strong> below. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07030020-01.html">Indexing a customer's claim on the system</a>.</p>

<p>If a PD claim exists, this <strong>must be placed on hold</strong> while the claim is being processed in CR. This will make sure that the customer can still see the claim and its progress through their online account. Claims in PD are set to 'Completed' when the CR claim is finalised. See the <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04010000-05.html">Resources</a> page for Claim status per programme</p>

<p>All agreement claims must have the below keywords added in Customer First/Customer Record.</p>

<p><strong>Inside Australia keywords&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Choose payment type <strong>@AGE</strong> or <strong>@DSP</strong> or <strong>@CAR</strong></li>
		<li>
Two letter country code</li>
		<li>
<strong>CLMDOM</strong></li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Outside Australia Keywords</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Choose payment type <strong>@AGE</strong> or <strong>@DSP</strong> or <strong>@CAR</strong></li>
		<li>
Two letter country code</li>
		<li>
<strong>CLMINT</strong></li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when indexing claims lodged from outside Australia the Date of Receipt must be the date the claim was received in Australia.</p>

<p>The <strong>PAPO</strong> screen is used to record bank account details from outside Australia. Service Officers should always run the Payment Destination Update - Record Overseas Direct Deposit Details script to update this screen.</p>

<p>If the script is unavailable, <strong>PAPO</strong> may be coded manually after checking the country's banking requirements in <a href="../utils/CodesIndex/Overseas-Bank-Account-Details-OBAD.html">Overseas Bank Account Details (OBAD)</a>. For more details, see <a href="../payment-delivery/103-04020000-01.html">Delivery of payments to Centrelink customers outside Australia</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the claim is to be rejected, for any reason, code the <strong>PAPO</strong> screen with&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>'CHQ'</strong> in <strong>Method of Payment</strong> field</li>
		<li>
<strong>'NAC'</strong> in <strong>DCR Exempt Rsn</strong> field</li>
		</ul>
<p>This is to avoid customer payments being rejected if the claim is granted in the future with out-of-date overseas bank account details. Rejected payments will cause delays in payment delivery to the customer as well as cause potential financial hardship.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> there are <strong>mandatory</strong> coding requirements for US bank accounts. If the HOM address format is not correct, the payment <strong>will reject</strong>. See United States in the <a href="../utils/CodesIndex/Overseas-Bank-Account-Details-OBAD.html">Overseas Bank Account Details (OBAD)</a> table for mandatory coding and more action if needed.</p>

<p>Customers paid into a bank account in New Zealand have two options available to them and the Embargo (EMB) may need to be coded.</p>

<p>The NZ authorities offer customers two methods of payment&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the Special Banking Option (SBO), which is a bank account in the customer's name, managed by the NZ authorities, and</li>
		<li>
the Direct Payment Method (DPM), which is a regular account, owned and managed by the customer</li>
		</ul>
<p>If a customer elects to be paid by SBO, pension payments from other countries, including Australia, are deposited into the SBO account (BSB 031530). The NZ authorities then pay the customer their full NZ entitlement directly into their 'regular' bank account. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> 030595 is an old SBO BSB that is still valid for existing customers but should not be used for new customers. If this BSB is provided, MSD should be contacted for confirmation before proceeding.</p>

<p>SBO is coded using the Payment Destination Update - Record Overseas Direct Deposit Details script and can only be used if the SBO paperwork accompanies the claim. See&#58;</p>

<p>In most cases, identity is already confirmed for claims lodged in Australia. If this has not yet happened, domestic identity confirmation requirements and procedures apply to agreement claims. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-09010000-01.html">Identity Confirmation</a>.</p>

<div class="showcont">


<p><strong>Claims lodged with agreement partners</strong></p>

<p>Australian claims lodged outside Australia generally have identity confirmed by the liaison agency (agreement partner) in accordance with the Administrative Arrangements. Identity is regarded as confirmed if the liaison agency has stamped the claim form. Alternatively, confirmation of identity may be verified by the relevant liaison agency on a liaison form. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04020000-01.html">Agreement liaisons, NZ CICs and exchange of information</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a certificate of family registry (KOSEKI) and a certificate of residence (JUMIN-HYO) is provided with the liaison for claims lodged under the agreement with Japan, identity is confirmed and OS/IA can be used.</p>

<p><strong>Claims lodged directly with Services Australia</strong></p>

<p>Australian claims from customers outside Australia that have been sent directly to Centrelink by the customer will need to have identity verified using the legacy Proof of Birth/Proof of Arrival and 100 points of identity documents model. If original or certified copies of identity documents are required and they have not been provided with the claim, request them from the customer.</p>

<p>See Proof of Identity documents for overseas customers.</p>

<p><strong>Temporary Identity for customers overseas</strong></p>

<p>Temporary identity arrangements may be applicable to customers who&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
are outside of Australia</li>
		<li>
have lodged their claim directly with Services Australia, and</li>
		<li>
have not or cannot provide any certified copies of, or original, POI documents with their claim due to adverse COVID-19 conditions overseas</li>
		</ul>
<p>If an Australian <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07080000-03.html">identity document</a> has been provided, use the Identity Confirmation Dashboard in Process Direct (PD) to verify the document and then apply a temporary identity review period in the new claim.</p>

<p>To access the <strong>Identity Confirmation Dashboard</strong>&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Key '<strong>Start</strong>' into the <strong>Super Key</strong> field</li>
		<li>
Select <strong>Identity Confirmation Dashboard</strong> from the <strong>Task Selector</strong></li>
		</ul>
<p>Only one approved identity document is needed for claims lodged directly by customers overseas. 'YY' is coded for the other 2 categories in the Identity Confirmation Dashboard.</p>

<p><strong>Do not</strong> select Photo Identification in the linkage options.</p>

<p>When the document has been verified, exit the Identity Dashboard workflow by clicking on the <img src="../resources/images/process_direct_small/PDheader_Home_icon.PNG" alt="Home" title="Home" /> 'home' button in the top left corner.</p>

<p><strong>Do not</strong> continue through the Identity Dashboard workflow in PD.</p>

<p>Temporary identity can now be coded on the <strong>POI</strong> screen inside the new claim in Customer Record by coding GD/SS on the <strong>POI</strong> screen in the new claim activity.</p>

<p>Coding GD/SS on the <strong>POI</strong> screen will generate a review for 8 weeks. CIS staff only may extend this review twice if a customer is having difficulty providing documents due to COVID. If a customer still cannot supply an identity document after 24 weeks, email International Agreements team for escalation.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when the claim is finalised a keyword <strong>must</strong> be added to the 'ALT - POI Alt Review Period (PRELET)' review on the Future Activity List (<strong>FAL</strong>) screen&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
View the review using a '<strong>V</strong>' and press [<strong>Enter</strong>]</li>
		<li>
Add the keyword '<strong>ALTPOIIS</strong>' in one of the keyword fields. Staff may need to overtype an existing one. Press [<strong>Enter</strong>] to save the new keyword</li>
		</ul>
<p>If a customer cannot provide an approved identity document for temporary identity verification, email International Agreements team for escalation.</p>

<p><strong>Information requested from the agreement partner</strong></p>

<p>If information is needed directly from the agreement partner, for example, periods of coverage, complete a liaison requesting the information. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04020000-01.html">Agreement liaisons, NZ CICs and exchange of information</a>. If there is no response from the Agreement partner after two liaison requests, escalate by sending an email to International Agreements.</p>

<p>Claims <strong>cannot </strong>be rejected if the customer has provided all requested information in their control. If information has not been provided by the agreement country, claims should be put on hold.  See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-21041320-01.html">Agreement Liaison Details (ALD)</a> for liaison response times. </p>

<p>In all instances, including escalations to International Agreements&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Place the new claim on hold</li>
		<li>
Annotate the claim progress <strong>DOC</strong> with reason for liaison/ escalation and expected response time</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Escalating liaison requests to International Agreements does not guarantee a quicker response time. The escalation process is to relieve Service Delivery staff where the liaison process has broken down.</p>

<p>Claims for DSP under agreements made inside Australia follow the domestic DSP streaming and medical assessment process, i.e. MAT assessment, then referral to Job Capacity Assessment (JCA) and Disability Medical Assessment (DMA) if appropriate. Most agreement claims then need a severely disabled assessment.</p>

<p>Once lodged and indexed, DSP claims are assessed through a streaming process. The streaming process determines if the claim can be manifestly granted, manifestly rejected, or needs a referral for a Job Capacity Assessment (JCA). It also identifies if there is any more details are needed to process the claim.</p>

<p>In most cases, the JCA/DMA assessment has been done before the claim is assessed by CIS. If CIS need to refer for a JCA, make sure identity is confirmed and all non-medical information is received and coded, including&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
compensation clearances</li>
		<li>
Complex Assessment Officer (CAO) assessments, and</li>
		<li>
Member of a Couple assessment (MOCA)</li>
		</ul>
<p>JCA referrals for agreement claims must include the decision about where the CITW occurred. See <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03180010-01.html">Job Capacity Assessment (JCA) Referral</a>.</p>

<p>Refer for JCA as per the MAT notes on the record, i.e. file assessment, phone assessment or F2F assessment.</p>

<p>Agreement claims requiring a severely disabled assessment will need the following notes added to the JCA referral&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
'Severely Disabled' assessment is needed for DSP under New Zealand Agreement. A work capacity of 0-7 hpw is needed for DSP qualification under the agreement. Contact referring officer if more details are needed</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> text can be changed for other agreements if appropriate.</p>

<p>Generally, if qualified on that day, the date of lodgement in the agreement country or in Australia is usually the start day.</p>

<p>When the <strong>Overseas Lodgement Date</strong> (<strong>DOL</strong>) field is coded on the Additional Residence Details (<strong>ARD</strong>) screen, system processing will initially default the Start day on the Pensions Assessment (<strong>PNA</strong>) screen to this date and then use sequential assessment to move it forward if appropriate.</p>

<p>The residence qualification rules, including the totalisation rules for all agreement countries, are automated.</p>

<p>If totalisation is needed, the information used by the system for most countries is provided on the <strong>FICT</strong> screen. The values used by the system in the totalisation calculation are those shown in the <strong>Total Insurance</strong> and <strong>Useable Insurance for Totalisation</strong> fields, with the summary result being shown on the Totalisation Summary (<strong>TOS</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>If a customer fails to totalise, use the <strong>TOS</strong> screen to work out why.</p>

<strong>Date From&#58;/Date To&#58;</strong> record the Insurance Periods (IP) provided</li>
		<li>
<strong>Years/Months/Weeks/Days&#58;</strong> record the Insurance Values (IV) provided for the relevant IP. If only Days is provided by the agreement partner, convert to months by dividing by 30 and record it in the <strong>Months</strong> field</li>

New Zealand Agreement&#58; the system uses information from the Country of Residence (<strong>CRES</strong>) and Legal Residence Details (<strong>RSLEG</strong>) screens in the totalisation calculation.

There is no need to code any IP/IV, though if needed the <strong>Manual override</strong> field may be used</li>
		<li>
Indian Agreement&#58; AWLR for totalisation can be found on the New Zealand and India (<strong>NZI</strong>) screen instead of <strong>TOS</strong>. IP/IV will still need to be coded on the <strong>FICT</strong> screen for <strong>NZI</strong> to summarise correctly</li>

<p>Australian income support payments are directly deducted by NZ for mutual customers who are present long-term in NZ. Any Australian arrears period results in a debt being owed by the customer to NZ. To divert these arrears into a holding account to offset this debt, code the <strong>EMB</strong> screen.</p>

<p>If a claimant has requested their Australian payments be paid into their own account by the Direct Payment Method (DPM), the arrears from the Australian claim <strong>must</strong> <strong>be</strong> embargoed (within the new claim activity). There is no way to retrieve and embargo arrears if they are accidentally released to the customer. If this occurs, advise New Zealand in the Service Decision liaison that is sent when the claim is finalised. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04020000-01.html">Agreement liaisons, NZ CICs and exchange of information</a>.</p>

<p>The <strong>EMB</strong> screen is coded as follows&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Embargo country&#58;</strong> NZ</li>
		<li>
<strong>Apply Embargo Y/N&#58;</strong> Y (defaults to 'N') <strong>before</strong> finalising the claim</li>
		</ul>
<p>If a customer is paid by SBO, the Australian arrears do not need to be embargoed. The ODR <strong>DOC</strong> that is created by the Agreement Pension Qualification Script must be changed however to reflect that the arrears have been paid into a SBO account. Instead of 'all arrears released to the customer', change this sentence to read 'all arrears released to customer's SBO account'</p>

<p><strong>Notes&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Coding of income and assets is not needed if the claim is to be rejected - FRC, or agreement specific reason (AGS, AGL, AGT) and the partner, where one exists, is not receiving, or is not going to receive, income support</li>
		<li>
For customers who have arrived from New Zealand and are receiving a defined NZ benefit, code an Assumed Rate on <strong>FIPS</strong> if granting or if partner, where one exists, is in receipt of income support. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04024000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Social_Security_NZ_Agree">New Zealand Agreement and foreign pension information</a></li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>For customers and/or partners who are paid foreign employment income&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Foreign employment income is coded on the Foreign Employment Income Paid Details (<strong>FEIP</strong>) screen with the date of event as the date the employment income was paid by the employer</li>
			<ul>			<li>
To code a new instance of foreign employment income, key '<strong>FEIP</strong>' in <strong>Nxt</strong>&#58; and press [<strong>Enter</strong>]</li>
			<li>
To change an existing occurrence, key a ‘<strong>P</strong>’ next to the EAN entry on <strong>FIPS</strong> and press [<strong>Enter</strong>]</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Frequency can be DAY, 1WE, 2WE, MTE or LOP. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-05020050-01.html">Foreign income and assets</a></li>
		<li>
If there is foreign employment income to be coded before 7 December 2020 (including where the entitlement period commenced within the Changing the Income Assessment Model transition period from 24 November 2020), go to the Foreign Income/Assets Details (<strong>FID</strong>) screen</li>
		<li>
Code at least two entries for the first month&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
code a Date of Event (DOV) for the earnings start date (Date of Event)/Start day, and</li>
			<li>
an additional, earlier, page for the first currency revaluation date in that month.<br>For example, if a customer's start day is 14 September a page for the September revaluation date, (1 September) <strong>and </strong>a page for 14 September <strong>must</strong> be included. If this is not done, the income will be ignored until the following revaluation date</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>For customers and/or partners who are paid domestic (Australian) employment income&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Domestic employment income is coded on the Employment Income Paid Details (<strong>EAPP</strong>) screen with the date of event as the date the employment income was paid by the employer</li>
		<li>
<strong>1WE</strong> or <strong>2WE</strong> is to be coded if the customer is in <strong>Environment I</strong> with an overseas address and the customer and/or partner are paid the same amount weekly or fortnightly</li>
		<li>
<strong>MTE</strong> is to be coded for pension customers who meet the Pension Monthly Exception Rule</li>
		<li>
<strong>IOP</strong> or <strong>LOP</strong> is to be coded for all other domestic employment income. For coding assistance, including domestic employment income earned prior to 7 December 2020 See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010010-01.html">Recording and correcting employment income details</a></li>		</ul>

<p>Manual rate calculations will be required when customer and partner are paid under different agreements. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-08180010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Non_NSS_system_01_Step04">Non NSS systems coding for manual rate of payment</a>.</p>

<p>Valid reason codes for agreement claims are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
AGI – Agreement pensions income test</li>
		<li>
AGA – Agreement pensions asset test</li>
		</ul>
<p>The following steps may help by getting the system to work out the rate to code on the Manual Assessment (<strong>MAS</strong>) screen&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Ensure all income and assets are coded for each member of the couple,</li>
		<li>
Go to the <a target="_blank" class="modal-link" href="../initial-contact-general/106-06020010-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Coding_the_Addi">Additional Residence Details (ARD) screen</a> and put both members of the couple on the <strong>customer’s</strong> agreement,</li>
		<li>
Go to <strong>AR</strong> and take note of the customer’s rate,</li>
		<li>
Go to <a target="_blank" class="modal-link" href="../initial-contact-general/106-06020010-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Coding_the_Addi">ARD</a> and put both members of the couple on the <strong>partner’s</strong> agreement,</li>
		<li>
Go to <strong>AR</strong> and take note of the partner’s rate,</li>
		<li>
Return to <a target="_blank" class="modal-link" href="../initial-contact-general/106-06020010-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Coding_the_Addi">ARD</a> and put each member of the couple on the correct agreement,</li>
		<li>
Navigate to <strong>MAS</strong> and update using the rates from above.</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> check carefully that both members of the couple are on the correct agreement before finalising the claim.</p>

<p><strong>For example</strong></p>

<p>Partner is paid under the Italian Agreement and customer has claimed under the Spanish Agreement, meaning a manual rate will be required. Once all the income and assets have been coded/updated in the claim, put customer and partner on the Italian Agreement and navigate to the <strong>AR</strong> screen. Take note of the rate for partner. Return to the <a target="_blank" class="modal-link" href="../initial-contact-general/106-06020010-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Coding_the_Addi">ARD screen</a> and put customer and partner on the Greek Agreement and navigate to the <strong>AR</strong> screen.

<p>Go to the Assessment Results (<strong>AR</strong>) screen and make sure the correct claim decision is showing.</p>

<p>If the claim is to be rejected, make sure that the rejection reason is correct.</p>

<p>Agreement claim rules are generally automated based on information coded&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Agreement Scope (AGS) - where the customer does not meet the scope of the agreement. That is, the payment is not covered by the agreement or the customer does not meet a payment specific rule. For example, not severely disabled for DSP claims or not the carer partner of an Australian pensioner for Carer Payment</li>
		<li>
Agreement Lodgement (AGL) - where the customer does not meet the lodgement rules under the agreement</li>
		<li>
Agreement Totalisation (AGT) - where the customer cannot meet the residence rules under the agreement using totalisation</li>
		</ul>
<p>For help with rejections for non-agreement reasons, see <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07130000-01.html">Rejecting a Centrelink claim</a>.</p>

<p>Contact the customer to advise of the rejection and appeal rights. Two genuine attempts must be made. Contact is not needed for claims rejected 'Failed to respond to correspondence (FRC)' or 'Failed to supply documents (FSD)'. See <a href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/109-03010000-01.html">Advising verbally of an unfavourable decision (CLK)</a>.</p>

<p>If the claim is to be granted, check the Pension Rate Calculation (<strong>PRC</strong>) screen to make sure the correct arrears are being paid for the <strong>entire</strong> arrears period, noting any rate calculation changes due to absences/returns to Australia are correct.</p>

<p>Check the following before finalising the claim and issuing the arrears&#58;</p>

<p><strong>For all customers&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Check <strong>CRES</strong>, RSCD, <strong>ARD</strong>, RSIMME, <strong>RSLEG</strong></li>
			<ul>			<li>
NZ Residence Status (<strong>RSLEG</strong>) may be incorrect if customer has more than 80 movements returned by the immigration datalink. Correct the status if necessary. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-06010020-01.html">Australian Residence Rules for New Zealand citizens</a></li>
			<li>
If customer is travelling on a NZ passport and NZ citizenship is coded on <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-06020050-01.html">RSLEG</a> make sure the correct country of birth is coded on <a target="_blank" class="modal-link" href="../initial-contact-general/106-06020030-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Activating_the_">RSIMME</a> and <a target="_blank" class="modal-link" href="../initial-contact-general/106-06020010-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Coding_the_Coun">CRES</a>. Customers born in Cook Islands, Niue and Tokelau may be NZ citizens but are not automatically residents of NZ and this can affect qualification.</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>For overseas residents&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Check that the rate for entire arrears period is</li>
			<ul>			<li>
The correct <strong>AWLR</strong>/<strong>AWAR</strong></li>
			<li>
The correct denominator (for example, 300,420, 528, 540)</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>For Australian residents&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Check that the rate for entire arrears period is the Direct Deduction rate/Comparison rate</li>
		<li>
Check <strong>RSS</strong> to confirm the rate is correct where the customer has travelled to/from Australia within the claim period</li>
		<li>
Check <strong>PNA</strong> to confirm the arrears start from the correct date</li>
		<li>
If the system is paying a direct deduction rate (customer residing in AU) and it should be a proportional rate because the customer lives overseas&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Check that <a target="_blank" class="modal-link" href="../initial-contact-general/106-22011747-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Completing_the_">RSCD</a> has been coded with the last departure, no matter how long ago it was</li>
			<li>
Check Immigration limiting Date (ILD) and update to last departure before <strong>PNA</strong> date if needed</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>If the claimant has died after lodging the claim, arrears may need to be manually zeroed from the appropriate date and a specific manual grant letter sent to the surviving partner or to the customer's estate. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04010000-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Death_processin">Table 4</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Inhibiting auto advice</strong></p>

<p>In most cases, international specific letters must be manually issued and the automatic letter inhibited before the activity is completed. The only time automatic letters should be issued is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
for grants of all agreement claims <strong>inside</strong> Australia (except if the customer dies during the arrears period)</li>
		</ul>
<p>In all other cases, a manual letter will be needed. Navigate to the Assessment Consequences (<strong>ASC</strong>) screen and code the <strong>Let Act</strong> field with 'INH' to inhibit the automatic advice.</p>

<p><strong>Liaison</strong></p>

<p>Liaisons are usually generated by the Foreign Pension system by FGL with Australian residence periods and rate information (current and some historical) auto-populating. New Zealand uses Autonomy Process Automation (APA). However, FGL will still need to be coded manually to generate the ODR <strong>DOC</strong> for New Zealand liaisons.</p>

<p>A liaison must be sent to the agreement partner advising of the outcome of the claim in the following circumstances&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>All</strong> claims lodged <strong>outside</strong> Australia. This includes claims lodged direct,</li>
		<li>
Claims lodged <strong>inside</strong> Australia under the New Zealand Agreement that are <strong>rejected</strong> and the customer receives a defined NZ benefit (NZS, NZI, NZV)</li>
		<li>
If the claim has been rejected because the customer cannot totalise, but is in receipt of a defined NZ benefit, a dummy AU notional rate must be provided in the liaison to New Zealand</li>
		</ul>
<p>If a claim has been lodged direct and the agreement partner is not known, send the liaison to the default fund.</p>

<p>Australian historical rates are not provided to New Zealand when a customer is granted. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04024000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Social_Security_NZ_Agree">New Zealand Agreement and foreign pension information</a>.</p>

<p>All liaisons <strong>must</strong> be recorded on FGL to make sure an ODR <strong>DOC</strong> is created and they <strong>must</strong> also be uploaded to the customer's record by <strong>DOC</strong> Tools.</p>

<p>Lump Sum Bereavement Payment (LBP), which is the difference between the combined couple rate and the new single rate, is paid up to and including the next 7 EPEDs. If the combined couple rate has continued for the full bereavement period then no LBP is payable and the arrears from the new claim are zeroed from the Bereavement Period end date (BPED) +1.</p>
