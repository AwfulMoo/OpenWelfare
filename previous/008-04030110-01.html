<H2 id=_Toc344898764>DES programs</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>DES offers 2 programs to help people whose disability, injury or health condition is their primary barrier to finding and maintaining employment. The participant will be assisted through either a Disability Employment Services - Disability Management Service (DES-DMS) or a Disability Employment Services - Employment Support Service (DES-ESS), depending on their level of need and eligibility for Program Services:</P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>DES-DMS:</STRONG> provides services to job seekers with temporary or permanent disability, injury, or health conditions who require the assistance of a disability employment service and who may require flexible ongoing support but are not expected to need regular, long-term support in the workplace</LI>
<LI><STRONG>DES-ESS:</STRONG> provides services to job seekers with permanent disability and who are assessed as needing regular long-term ongoing support in the workplace</LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<H2 id=_Toc344898764>Eligibility for DES</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>A job seeker must first be assessed as eligible for DES before a referral is made. As a general rule, a referral cannot take place unless DES is recommended in the job seeker's most recent current and valid Job Capacity Assessment (JCA) or Employment Services Assessment (ESAt).</P>
<P>Some groups of job seekers are exempt from the requirement for a JCA or ESAt, including <A href="../people-with-disability/008-04030070-01.html">Work Assist</A> participants, eligible school students, special class clients and eligible school leavers. The DES provider determines whether an exemption applies, and in most cases these job seekers will directly register with a provider and do not need to be referred by Services Australia.</P>
<P>For more information, see <A href="../people-with-disability/008-04030020-01.html">Eligibility criteria for participation with Disability Employment Services (DES)</A>.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>A person must be registered as a job seeker to be referred to DES. From 1 July 2021, volunteers not in receipt of an income support payment are no longer eligible for DES unless they are required to satisfy Program of Support (POS) requirements for DSP purposes.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P></P>
<DIV class=twisty><A name=bp01_L2GT_Referral_pathwa class=anchor></A>
<H2 id=_Toc344898764>Referral pathways</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>A job seeker may be referred to DES by:</P>
<UL>
<LI>an assessor:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>When an Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) or Job Capacity Assessment (JCA) is being conducted, the assessor will directly refer the job seeker to the DES provider of the jobseekers choice if this is the recommended referral. Job seekers may decline a referral at this point if they have voluntary mutual obligation requirements</LI></UL>
<LI>a Service Officer after an ESAt or JCA is completed, when:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>the <A href="../people-with-disability/008-06070010-01.html">JCA</A> or <A href="../job-seekers/001-02320020-01.html">ESAt</A> is completed as a file assessment</LI>
<LI>a job seeker with mutual obligation requirements <A href="../job-seekers/001-02330030-01.html">referral is deferred because of their temporary reduced work capacity</A> or exemption from requirements</LI>
<LI>there is a current and valid JCA or ESAt recommending a DES referral and a voluntary participation job seeker either approaches Services Australia, seeking referral to employment assistance, or is offered a referral to DES by Services Australia</LI></UL>
<LI>a job seeker directly approaching a DES provider:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>This pathway is known as 'direct registration' and is only suitable for job seekers who are not receiving a payment with mutual obligation requirements</LI>
<LI>The direct registration pathway is normally appropriate for job seekers who are exempt from the requirement for a JCA or ESAt, including school leavers and those eligible for <A href="../people-with-disability/008-04030070-01.html">Work Assist</A></LI>
<LI>If the job seeker does not already have a record, the DES provider should contact Services Australia by telephone while the job seeker is present, and request to create a record. See <A href="../job-seekers/001-02230030-01.html">Direct registration with a provider for disability employment assistance services</A></LI>
<LI>If the provider finds the job seeker does not have a current and valid assessment of the customer's work capacity and is not exempt from this requirement, they can request an ESAt for the job seeker</LI>
<LI>A DES provider may contact Services Australia for assistance with determining whether a job seeker is eligible for DES, because of circumstances such as employment, study, or exemptions from mutual obligation requirements. Services Australia should provide relevant information to the provider on request. See <A href="../job-seekers/001-02070020-01.html" target=_blank>Release of information to Employment Services Providers</A></LI></UL></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<P></P>
<DIV class=twisty><A name=bp01_L2GT_Job_in_Jeopardy class=anchor></A>
<H2 id=_Toc344898764>Work Assist</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>DES providers manage <A href="../people-with-disability/008-04030070-01.html">Work Assist</A>. If this assistance is considered suitable, Services Australia can contact the DES provider directly to arrange for the job seeker to meet with the provider. If the DES provider confirms the job seeker is eligible for assistance under <A href="../people-with-disability/008-04030070-01.html">Work Assist</A> provisions, assistance from Services Australia will generally not be required to commence the job seeker in DES.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P></P>
<DIV class=twisty><A name=bp01_L2GT_Eligibility_req class=anchor></A>
<H2 id=_Toc344898764>Eligibility requirements for job seekers being re-referred to DES</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Job seekers that have previously exited DES for any of the following reasons cannot be re-referred to DES unless it is recommended by a current and valid Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) or Job Capacity Assessment (JCA) <STRONG>completed after the exit from DES</STRONG>:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the job seeker achieved a 26 week outcome</LI>
<LI>the program review did not recommend extended DES assistance (past 18 months)</LI>
<LI>the participant completed extended employment assistance but has not achieved an outcome (that is, exit following 24 months in employment assistance)</LI>
<LI>the exit occurred while the participant was receiving ongoing support</LI></UL>
<P>If a new ESAt is required to assess eligibility for DES or other suitable services (such as jobactive Stream C), a <A href="../job-seekers/001-02330010-01.html">referral for an ESAt must be made</A>.</P>
<P>As at 1 July 2021, job seekers who no longer meet the eligibility criteria for DES will be able to complete their program with DES but will not be able to be re-referred after exiting.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P></P>
<DIV class=twisty><A name=bp01_L2GT_Employment_Benc class=anchor></A>
<H2 id=_Toc344898764>Employment Benchmark and work capacity</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Job seekers who have been working at or above their Employment Benchmark for the last 6 fortnights should not be referred to DES as they are not eligible to commence in DES. <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> this restriction does not apply to <A href="../people-with-disability/008-04030070-01.html">Work Assist</A> participants who may be referred to DES even when they are working at or above their Employment Benchmark.</P>
<P>The Employment Benchmark hours are <STRONG>not</STRONG> the same as assessed Work Capacity with Intervention therefore a job seeker's record of employment should be checked prior to actioning a referral to DES.</P>
<P>Job seekers working at or above their Employment Benchmark hours are eligible for jobactive if they are looking to increase their work hours.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P></P>
<DIV class=twisty><A name=bp01_L2GT_NEIS_and_DES class=anchor></A>
<H2 id=_Toc344898764>NEIS and DES</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Job seekers with mutual obligation requirements are able to concurrently participate in both DES and <A href="../job-seekers/001-02100000-01.html">New Enterprise Incentive Scheme (NEIS)</A>. Eligible job seekers will benefit from specialist assistance from their DES as well as specialist small business services as delivered by the NEIS provider.</P>
<P>Job seekers who are engaged with DES can only be referred to NEIS by their DES provider and the referral will be included in their Job Plan. When referred, the Department of Education skills and Employment, Skills will notify Services Australia as appropriate.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P></P>
<DIV class=twisty><A name=bp01_L2GT_Eligible_school class=anchor></A>
<H2 id=_Toc344898764>Eligible school leavers and direct self-referral to DES</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>If an eligible school leaver directly registers with a DES provider and already has a current and valid Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) or Job Capacity Assessment (JCA) recommending referral to a specific service, they must be referred to the recommended service.</P>
<P>For example, if an eligible school leaver directly registers with a DES-DMS provider, and they have a current and valid ESAt which recommends referral to DES-ESS, they cannot be commenced in DES-DMS and must be referred to DES-ESS.</P>
<P>In this case the baseline and with intervention work capacity recommended in the current and valid ESAt or JCA will determine the job seeker's employment benchmark hours.</P>
<P>If an ESAt or JCA is completed for an eligible school leaver who has already commenced in DES, the baseline and with intervention work capacity in the assessment will not affect the benchmark hours. The job seeker will already be registered as an Eligible School Leaver in the Employment Services System and will retain their 8 hour benchmark.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P></P>
<DIV class=twisty><A name=bp01_L2GT_Deferred_referr class=anchor></A>
<H2 id=_Toc344898764>Deferred referral to DES</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>When an Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) or Job Capacity Assessment (JCA) report recommends referral to DES, the general rule is the job seeker is immediately connected to a DES provider by the assessor wherever possible. Where this is not possible a Service Officer will action the DES referral at a later time if the job seeker is receiving <A href="../job-seekers/001-19051551-01.html">JobSeeker Payment</A> or another payment with mutual obligation requirements.</P>
<P>This applies when the job seeker:</P>
<UL>
<LI>has mutual obligation requirements, and the report states the job seeker has temporary reduced work capacity of 0-7 hours per week</LI>
<LI>is exempt from mutual obligation requirements at the time the report is submitted, or</LI>
<LI>the job seeker is currently working at or above their Employment Benchmark</LI></UL>
<P>From 1 July 2021, job seekers with a previously assessed DES eligibility will need to satisfy new eligibility criteria before a deferred referral can be actioned.</P>
<P>For more information, see <A href="../job-seekers/001-02330030-01.html">Deferred referral to Employment Services Provider</A>.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Staff can make referrals to DES by using the <A href="../job-seekers/001-02060020-01.html">Online Diary</A>.</P>
<P>Job seekers are required to choose a suitable DES provider. A list of providers is displayed in the Online Diary based on proximity to the customer's location but a refined search can be done using a postcode or suburb. Services Australia can provide information on DES provider locations, DES specialist services and assistance provided. If the job seeker is unable or unwilling to choose a provider at the time of the initial contact:</P>
<UL>
<LI>a provider will be chosen using the random allocation function for job seekers with current mutual obligation requirements</LI>
<LI>job seekers with no mutual obligation requirements can complete the referral at a later date either by contacting Services Australia or directly registering with their preferred DES provider</LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<H2 id=_Toc344898764>Eligibility checks in the Online Diary</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>The Online Diary checks the job seeker's eligibility for DES when a staff member commences a DES referral. This eligibility check is conducted by the Department of Education, Skills and Employment system, and is generally based on information in the job seeker's most recent assessment.</P>
<UL>
<LI>if eligibility is confirmed, Services Australia can proceed with making an appointment with the job seeker's choice of DES provider</LI>
<LI>if eligibility is not confirmed, the Online Diary will present an error message</LI></UL>
<P>Eligibility checks in the Online Diary are the same for referrals made by assessors (when completing an Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) or Job Capacity Assessment (JCA)) and Service Officers.</P>
<P>From 1 July 2021, eligibility checks will also include new criteria restricting access to DES for those with a work capacity of 30+ hours per week or those not on a Services Australia payment. These job seekers can be referred to Stream Services.</P>
<P>For more information, see <A href="../people-with-disability/008-04030020-01.html">Eligibility criteria for participation with Disability Employment Services (DES)</A>.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<H2 id=_Toc344898764>Mutual obligation requirements/compulsory participation requirements</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>For job seekers with mutual obligation requirements, participation in DES is a requirement if referral to DES-ESS or DES-DMS is recommended by a Job Capacity Assessment (JCA) or Employment Services Assessment (ESAt). DSP recipients with participation requirements may also select to be referred to employment services as their compulsory activity.</P>
<P>The requirement to participate in DES does not apply if the job seeker is receiving a payment with mutual obligation requirements and has a partial capacity to work (baseline and with intervention work capacity), or temporary reduced work capacity of less than 15 hours per week. In this case, the job seeker should be encouraged to participate, but is not required to participate in DES. The job seeker may voluntarily exit from DES at any time, and is not subject to any penalty if they choose not to participate in DES. Note that job seekers with a partial capacity to work or temporary reduced work capacity of less than 8 hours per week or 30+ hours per week will generally not be eligible for DES.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<DIV class=twisty><A name=bp01_L2GT_Referral_disput class=anchor></A>
<H2 id=_Toc344898764>Referral disputed by the DES service provider</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>When an assessor or a Service Officer refers a job seeker to a DES provider, the DES provider has an opportunity to dispute the suitability of the referral. This means the provider may not agree that DES is the most suitable program or intervention for the job seeker. In this case the DES provider's actions depend on how the referral was made. In all cases, the DES provider should not exit the job seeker from the DES referral until an outcome of the dispute process has been reached.</P>
<P>If an assessor made the referral, the DES provider should immediately contact the assessor to discuss the suitability of the referral. If the DES provider contacts Services Australia through other channels, they should be asked to contact the assessor. The contact must take place within 28 days after the Job Capacity Assessment (JCA) or Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) report is submitted, and before the report status is finalised. This will allow the assessor to reconsider the suitability of the referral, and if appropriate, recommend an alternative referral or intervention for the job seeker, and amend the JCA or ESAt report. This procedure also applies if Services Australia made the referral immediately after the report was accepted, because the JCA or ESAt was completed as a 'file assessment'. Where a DES provider is disputing the suitability of the referral but does not discuss this with the assessor within 28 days before the report is finalised, they must accept the referral.</P>
<P>If the DES referral recommendation is affirmed following reconsideration by the assessor, the DES provider should accept the referral.</P>
<P>If the referral was made by Services Australia because of a referral recommendation in a current and valid JCA or ESAt and the report status is already finalised (for example, because the referral was deferred due to the job seeker's temporary reduced work capacity), the referral recommendation cannot be changed by the assessor. In this case the DES provider may refer the job seeker for a new assessment if they do not believe the referral recommendation is suitable.</P>
<P>Services Australia cannot override or vary a DES referral recommendation in an ESAt or JCA report, regardless of whether the report is finalised.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<P>The DES provider negotiates the job seeker's Job Plan in all cases when the job seeker commences and is participating in DES. Staff cannot add the DES activity to the job seeker's Job Plan, but may view the plan, and may also remove the DES activity from the Job Plan if the job seeker is no longer participating.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Acceptance or non-acceptance into a DES service is recorded by the provider and is automatically updated in the Centrelink system on the Referral Summary. This also applies if the job seeker is exited from DES. Once an initial appointment is booked for the job seeker using the Online Diary, referral details will be displayed in the job seeker's record.</P>
<P>If the job seeker has been placed by a DES provider, but the correct DES status is not displaying, the details may not have been sent to the system correctly. If the placement is confirmed by the DES provider, the Employment Systems Helpdesk should be contacted to request the TT155 transaction be resent. The <A href="../people-with-disability/008-04030110-05.html">Resources</A> page has a link to contact details.</P>
<P>Where a job seeker was referred to a DES provider but the referral did not result in a placement, an issue will flag on the job seeker's record for action.</P>
<P>If an outcome is received that indicates the job seeker is no longer receiving assistance, the referral is finalised. Payment eligibility should be checked if available information shows the job seeker has been exited because of an employment outcome. The record should also be checked to see that earnings are coded for the job seeker.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
