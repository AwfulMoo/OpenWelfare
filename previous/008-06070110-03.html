<p>Staff may access the entire contents of the completed Job Capacity Assessment (JCA) report and Disability Medical Assessment (DMA) electronically and may view and print the report as required.</p>

<p>After it is submitted to the decision maker by the Assessor, the JCA report will require manual checking and actioning. If the report has inconsistencies, the decision maker completes the Service Support Officer (SSO) Direct Referral webform and an SSO will follow up with Assessment Services. Inconsistencies may include, but are not limited to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Inconsistent work capacities (and rationale)</li>
		<li>
Incorrect application of impairment ratings (including incorrect table)</li>
		<li>
Incorrect or absent assessment of medical information (except where this has been supplied after the JCA appointment)</li>
		<li>
Incorrect or absent assessment of program of support requirements</li>
		<li>
Incomplete specialist assessment, including provision of specialist report</li>
		<li>
The customer's functional impairment is not congruent with medical information (the functional impairment should reasonably align with the medical condition)</li>

		<li>
Communicate to the Assistant Operations Support Manager for Disabilities the changes to be made, action taken and any progress made</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the SSO disagrees with the outcome,  Assessment Services Team will refer as appropriate to the HPAU for advice if appropriate.</p>

<p>When the HPAU and  Assessor have reach a single professional view, the outcome is provided to the SSO.</p>

<p>A Subject Matter Expert (SME) must review any new medical evidence provided to decide whether another new JCA is required.</p>

<p>Significant new medical evidence could include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
New medical evidence with information about a medical condition which significantly impacts the customer's ability to function, which was not assessed in the previous JCA, or</li>
		<li>
Information about the customer's employment (for example, they are working regular full-time hours) that was not evident to the Assessor</li>
		</ul>
<p>The decision maker or SME should first determine if an Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) appeal is in progress. If one is, the decision maker or SME will need to contact the PLRB advocate to advise of any new claim or information provided.</p>

<p>If clarification is required, the decision maker or SME is to complete the SSO Direct Referral webform. The SSO checks the information and refers the new evidence to Assessment Services for advice about whether a new JCA is required.</p>

<p> If a new JCA referral is made, once the new report is submitted, the decision maker or SME checks the report for inconsistencies. The decision maker or SME uses the report to make a decision about the EIR and will advises the customer of the outcome, including affirming the original decision or setting aside and implementing a new determination.</p>

<p>If the customer subsequently provides significant new medical evidence after the EIR process was completed and the decision is awaiting consideration by an ARO or a tribunal, the new evidence should be referred for Assessment Services advice via the HPAU. Assessment Services may advise that a 'DSP Appeal' JCA should be booked and will advise the ARO or PLRB advocate to suspend the appeal process pending the outcome of the assessment.</p>

<div class="showcont">


<p>The ARO considers whether or not they have sufficient information to make a decision on the customer's appeal, whether this is to affirm, set aside or vary the original decision.</p>

<p>If the ARO does not have sufficient information, further information may be sought from a variety of sources including the customer, the HPAU, the customer's treating doctor or specialist, and the Assessor.</p>

<p>If an ARO seeks assistance from the HPAU, HPAU ensures a single agency view is provided through consultation with the relevant Assessor. This occurs on a discretional basis by the HPAU based on the age of the case and significance of new medical information.</p>

<p>This information is useful in clarifying rationale or facilitating the process of taking into account new medical information or historical information that may not have previously been assessed. This can reduce the need for further JCA’s and indirectly provides valuable feedback to Assessors about changes in the customer's condition or treatment as well as those areas of their report used by staff for making decisions on payment eligibility.</p>

<p>At the review stage the ARO may determine there are inconsistencies within the report. These may include, but are not limited to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
inconsistent work capacities (and rationale)</li>
		<li>
incorrect application of impairment ratings (including incorrect table)</li>
		<li>
incorrect or absent assessment of medical information (except where this has been supplied after the JCA appointment)</li>
		<li>
incorrect or absent assessment of program of support requirements</li>
		<li>
incomplete specialist assessment, including provision of specialist report</li>
		<li>
the customer's functional impairment is not congruent with medical information (the functional impairment should reasonably align with the medical condition)</li>
		</ul>
<p>ARO’s are required to address reports with inconsistencies via the relevant appeals Assistant Director. The Assistant Director reviews the feedback and forwards the matter to the Assessment Services Quality Team mailbox for review.</p>

<p>Assessment Services&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
review the matter</li>
		<li>
escalate recommendations to the Team Manager and to the Business Manager</li>
		<li>
communicate to the Assistant Director of the relevant appeals team about changes that are required, the action taken and any progress made</li>
		<li>
if appropriate, refer the matter to the HPAU for opinion and advice</li>
		</ul>
<p>This ensures JCA content is consistent with DSP claim outcomes. The ARO retains the final authority to make a decision based on available evidence in accordance with legislation.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> a DSP claim cannot be granted unless the customer has undergone a Disability Medical Assessment (DMA) with a Government contracted doctor (GCD).</p>

<p>PLBR advocates may seek assistance from Assessment Services if a customer has had a decision set aside by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) AAT first review on the basis of significant new medical evidence, or a customer submits new medical evidence in the course of an AAT appeal. These cases will be referred to the JCA.BSU mailbox for action.</p>

<p>Advocates may request a file review JCA to consider such evidence. A '<strong>DSP Appeal</strong>' JCA will be booked as a file review. In all cases the Assessor must liaise with HPAU to ensure that the conclusions expressed in their report regarding functional impairment and work capacity accurately represent the view of Services Australia. Assessment Services is required to respond within agreed timeframes to facilitate the tribunal timeframes.</p>

<p>Advocates may be made aware of detrimental findings or at review identify inconsistencies within the report. These include but are not limited to&#58;</p>

<p>There may be differing opinion between the Assessor and the HPAU's consulting Health or Allied Health Professionals. This is a natural part of professionals working together and the collaboration process. The Assessor often has the benefit of having interviewed the customer, while the health professional often has experience and the capacity to research treatments of relevant conditions.</p>

<p>The view of Services Australia, supported by advice from the PLRB, is that one agency professional view is required for all opinions relevant to a JCA outcome.</p>

<p>This process  relates to any situation where&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
A JCA report has been questioned by way of a referral to the HPAU and the outcome of the referral is a potentially significant change to a report, for example, HPAU advice on the JCA report is being requested by a Review Officer or a legal representative within the PLRB</li>
		<li>
An Assessor has sought the opinion of the HPAU and the HPAU representative identifies  their opinion is likely to differ from the Assessor's</li>		</ul>

<p>If the Assessor is planning on seeking HPAU advice, especially if DSP may be cancelled, they should first consult with their Assistant Director to ensure  the decision-making up to that point is correct and fully justified.</p>

<p>Before providing any 'formal' written advice on the matter, discussion between the relevant parties <strong>must</strong> have occurred.</p>

<p><strong>Priority in this process is placed on an open non-defensive collegial discussion with a focus on the appropriate decision</strong>. Discussions begin at the level of Assessor and health professional before proceeding to any resolution process.</p>

<p>If consensus can be reached, the HPAU report should be completed which will then be reflected in the JCA. <strong>Any written advice from HPAU should not be scanned until a consensus view is obtained.</strong></p>

<p>If a consensus cannot be reached, a brief case conference is organised. This is a solution-focussed negotiation leading to an agreed resolution with membership consisting of the HPAU representative managing the referral, Assessor, and the Assessment Services National Team representing the National Manager (NM) and providing secretarial duties for the case conference.</p>

<p><strong>Parties in the case conference</strong></p>

<p>Discuss the sources of evidence relating to the case and the relative 'weight' attributed to each piece.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Review any inconsistencies between pieces of written evidences or with the customer's presentation</li>
		<li>
Explore the known treatments and progress of the combination of the customer's medical conditions</li>
		<li>
Discuss professional perspectives on the matter</li>
		<li>
Explore sources of difference of opinion and what could lead to consensus</li>		</ul>

<p>Parties may then agree on the matter at hand or decide to seek further medical information.</p>

<p>In some instances the matter may need to be escalated to senior or expert staff including staff from HPAU.</p>

<p>The outcome of the case conference is a written report indicating the consensus opinion.</p>

<p>The written report is copied to all parties to the case conference and to the Assessment Services Quality Team mailbox to be included in the Issues Management Register.</p>

<p>The written report from the HPAU is then finalised, provided to the referrer and scanned to the customer's record. The Assessor's report should reflect the agreed view on the matter and the rationale. The written report will not make reference to any disagreement, but record the parties' outcome and the consensus outcome.</p>

<p><strong>If a consensus view is not achieved</strong> after escalation to the Director HPAU and/or Assessment Services Director, the case <strong>must</strong> be referred to the National Team via the Assessment Services Quality Team mailbox.</p>

<p>The national team will review the matter, liaise with the Director of the HPAU and Director of Assessment Services and make a final recommendation regarding the outcome for the NM to sign off. This will result in a report being prepared indicating the Assessment Services one professional view for scanning to the customer's record. The written report will not make reference to any disagreement, but record the parties outcome and the consensus outcome.</p>
