<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Social_worker_a">Social worker assessment</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>If a customer has claimed online and they meet all the basic eligibility criteria, the system will usually refer the claim to a social worker for an assessment.</p>

<p>The social worker should record a <strong>DOC</strong> to indicate they are undertaking the assessment. Upon completion of the assessment, the social worker will add a grant, reject or withdrawn <strong>Fast Note</strong> on the record and finalise the referral.</p>

<p>The claim status then returns to <strong>In progress</strong> and allocates to a Service Officer to code any required updates and finalise the claim as per the social worker's instructions.</p>

<p>There are 2 scenarios when a customer who intends to claim or has claimed CrP - EXV must be referred to a social worker before the claim can be finalised by a Service Officer.</p>

<p><strong>When a customer contacts Services Australia and it is identified that they have experienced family and domestic violence&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
The Service Officer must check the customer's basic eligibility by running the Assisted Customer Claim (ACC) for CrP - EXV with the customer</li>
		<li>
If the ACC has successfully submitted, it will flow to a skill tagged Service Officer.</li>
		<li>
If the customer is in distress and needs immediate social work help/support, attempt to warm transfer the customer to a social worker who will complete the CrP - EXV assessment. If a social worker is not available, <strong>do not</strong> complete the <strong>Social Work Referral</strong> Guided Procedure for the assessment as a skill tagged Service Officer will decide this if required</li>
		<li>
If the ACC does not submit because the customer does not meet basic eligibility, decide if social work support is needed, see <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-12010000-01.html">Social work service referral</a></li>
		<li>
Once the ACC has been submitted, the claim will allocate for processing. The skill tagged Service Officer performing the processing will determine whether&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
there is social work referral pending on the customer's record</li>
			<li>
referral to a social worker is required (and complete this as needed), or</li>
			<li>
social worker assessment has already been completed for this event, so the claim can be finalised</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>When a customer has lodged a claim online</strong>, but the system determines they may not meet the eligibility criteria, the claim will drop through for checking and processing by a Service Officer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
During processing refer the claim to a social worker for assessment if it is determined&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the customer meets the eligibility criteria (for example, there is contact on the record that indicates intent to claim provisions are met),</li>
			<li>
there is no referral pending on the customer's record</li>
			<li>
if the customer is not current on an income support payment (ISP) but there is a pending ISP claim </li>		</ul>
		<li>
The referral must be created from the claim in Process Direct. This will place the claim <strong>on hold</strong></li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>When a customer has lodged a paper claim (SU510) or ACC was run and basic eligibility criteria seem to be met&#58;</strong></p>

<p>The Entitlements (<strong>ELD</strong>) screen will display a grant. Skill tagged Service Officers <strong>must not</strong> finalise the claim at this point&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
An assessment by a social worker is needed <strong>before</strong> the claim can be granted</li>
		<li>
If the outcome of the claim is rejecting <strong>NQP - Not receiving an ISP</strong>, and the customer has a pending ISP claim, a referral for Social Work assessment must be made</li>
		<li>
The referral to a social worker must be created from within the claim in Process Direct. This will place the claim <strong>on hold</strong></li>
		<li>
If a <strong>Social Work assessment in progress Fast Note</strong> is on the record, place the claim <strong>on hold</strong></li>
		<li>
The social worker will then perform an assessment, complete a grant, reject or withdrawn <strong>Fast Note</strong> and complete the referral. The claim will return to <strong>In progress</strong> for finalisation by a skill tagged Service Officer</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the customer may have complex circumstances or it may not be clear if they are eligible. Use discretion and consider if a referral to a social worker for CrP assessment is needed. A social work assessment may determine if the customer meets the eligibility criteria.</p>

been an immediate family member, and</li>

<p>Evidence of police involvement in the removal of the actual or alleged perpetrator of violence from the family home must be obtained before payment can be made. For example, an Apprehended Violence Order (AVO) with an exclusion provision that prevents the abusive family member from living in the family home.</p>

<p>However, the abusive family member may leave without police involvement and verification of the family and domestic violence will need to be sought from a third party. For example&#58;</p>

<p>A claimant may say they are partnered as part of a claim for Crisis Payment (CrP).

This is for instances where the claimant was in a relationship for more than 14 days before lodging the claim, regardless of the outcome of the CrP claim.</p>

<p>In these cases, the CrP claim can be assessed before a MoC assessment being completed. If a CrP is granted it will be paid at the rate of the income support payment the claimant is receiving on the day of the crisis event.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the presence of family and domestic violence may indicate the customer is not a member of a couple. However, a formal MoC assessment is required.</p>

		<li>
