<p>This procedure applies to <strong>customer requests</strong> for an advance payment of their FTB Part A. A partner or third party (who is not a correspondence nominee), although they might have permission to enquire, <strong>cannot</strong> claim an advance payment on behalf of the customer.</p>

<p><img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> Customers applying for an advance should be directed to their online account, <a href="../self-service/133-19061400-01.html">Express Plus Centrelink mobile app</a> or the phone self service to&#58;</p>

<p><strong>At Risk</strong> - FTB current customers under 18 are considered to be '<strong>at risk</strong>' and will not be able to apply for an advance payment via self service. They are required to have a discussion either over the phone or in person prior to applying for an advance payment to ensure consideration has been taken regarding the impacts/risks of an advance payment. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> a paper application is not required.</p>

<p>The <strong>Advance Payment Overview</strong> page displays information on the customer's current and historical advance payments (includes FTB and other advance payment types). A Ready Reckoner is available for use to advise the customer advance repayment amounts for specific advance amounts.</p>

<p>Select <strong>Family Tax Benefit Advance</strong> from the advance payment types.</p>

<p><strong>Customer not qualified&#58;</strong> a warning will display on this page if the workflow determines that the customer is not qualified for an advance payment. This may happen at any point during the assessment. The workflow will end and will automatically reject the application. If the warning displays that the person has a debt or outstanding balance, check the details on the Debt Management and Information System (<strong>DMIS</strong>) and the Document List (<strong>DL</strong>) screens to determine if a debt is still outstanding.</p>

<p>If the customer is identified <strong>'At Risk'</strong> (the customer is under 18 when they apply for the FTB advance), it is essential to check before the application is processed that the customer fully understands the consequences of taking an FTB advance, including that there will be a reduction in their fortnightly FTB rate for 13 fortnights after the advance is paid.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when an <strong>income managed</strong> customer applies for an advance payment, a message will display. Service Officers are to read and understand the information, and relay all relevant information to the customer, before proceeding with the workflow.</p>

			<li>
Once the advance payment period of 26 weeks has passed and the advance is paid in full another is automatically paid to the customer if they remain eligible</li>
			<li>

<p><strong>Terminology&#58;</strong> previously, automatic FTB advance payments were known as 'continuous' FTB advance payments; however since changes to legislation from 1 July 2011, these advances are retrospectively known as <strong>regular</strong> FTB advance payments.

not have an outstanding debt to the Commonwealth <strong>on the day they apply</strong> for the advance payment that can be recovered from their FTB payments (this can be checked on the Debt List (<strong>OPDL</strong>) screen)</li>

have repaid in full (or have a balance less than $0.05) any previous FTB advance payments received more than 12 months ago (the Advance Payments Summary (<strong>AVCS</strong>) screen will display if previous advance payment details exist)</li>
		<li>
have the minimum advance amount available</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> there is no limit to the number of FTB advance payments that can be in place at any time.</p>

<p>Approved Care Organisations are not eligible for an FTB advance payment.</p>

<p><strong>Assessment of affordability (HAR)</strong></p>

<p>The workflow will assess if the customer meets the advance eligibility based on affordability and the minimum advance amount.</p>

<p>The workflow will prompt the affordability question&#58;</p>

<p>'Thinking about your current fortnightly income and your expenses, how much money will you have left to repay your advance at the end of every fortnight?'</p>

<p>If a customer cannot afford the minimum advance amount the request for advance will be rejected for Hardship (<strong>HAR</strong>) and an indicator for Commonwealth Financial Counselling (CFC) referral will be displayed.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If a customer chooses <strong>Yes</strong> to a CFC referral&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
