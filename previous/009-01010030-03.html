See <a href="../self-service/133-02160000-01.html">Circumstance Change Monitor (CCM)</a> </li>
		<li>
If the <strong>claim status</strong> is showing as <strong>Draft,</strong> the customer has started the Online Claim but the claim has not been submitted. Tell the customer to return to their Centrelink online account and submit the claim. Do not change the claim status from <strong>Draft</strong><br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the <strong>Claim Submission Date</strong> reads 00&#58;00&#58;0000, the online claim has not yet been submitted</li>

		<li>
When more information is given verbally by the carer to support their claim, update <strong>Notes</strong> in Process Direct with the details provided</li>

When all required documents have been lodged, <img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> contact the carer and encourage them to submit their claim online</li>
		<li>
If the carer declines to submit an online claim, a Service Officer must use ACC to submit a claim on behalf of the carer. A verbal declaration is required to be accepted prior to the claim being submitted. The Service Officer must&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
read the verbal declaration to the carer, ensuring they accept the statement ‘by ticking the Declaration box on the Review your claim page, the Service Officer is confirming that the declaration script has been read to and accepted by the customer’ </li>

<p><strong>Tell customer of timeframes for claim outcome</strong></p>

<p>Use the following script&#58;</p>

<p>‘Thank you for lodging your xxxxxxxx claim. Please be assured we are processing claims as quickly as possible to manage the high demand across the business. We will let you know the outcome as soon as it is complete. If you have been requested to provide information, it is important that you do so as soon as possible so as not to delay your claim. Thank you for your patience.'</p>

<p>For claims that are outside <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-02010000-01.html">timeliness standards</a>, consider if escalation is required.</p>

<p>A claim (Social Application) is created in Process Direct when an online claim is submitted or when paper claim details are entered using ACC. A status of <strong>Completed</strong> means the claim has been processed and finalised.</p>

<p><strong>New paper claim scanned</strong> - no progress on record.</p>

<p>Check the <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-10020010-01.html">Document Tool</a> in Customer First for the claim documents to determine if they have been scanned incorrectly.</p>

<p>If there is a scan available and <strong>no claim activity</strong> and/or <strong>Progress of Claim Notes</strong> on the record&#58;</p>

<p>Initially, claims will be assessed for immediate eligibility, the requirement to provide more information and/or referral to a specialist.</p>

<p>Carers may be asked to supply more medical or non-medical information at the initial assessment and will be asked to supply this within 14 days.</p>

<p>If a claim is submitted under an exception category, the claim cannot be rejected until 22 days has been reached. If the claim is presented via WLM and 22 days has not been reached, the claim will need to be held until <strong>day 22</strong> before it can be rejected.</p>

<p>The claim can be rejected at any time when&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a claim has been submitted</li>
		<li>
documents lodged are inappropriate or not relevant to the claim</li>
		<li>
the claim has not been lodged under an exception category</li>
		<li>
the carer has failed to respond to a request for information</li>
		</ul>
<p>For requests sent by Australia Post, a <a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-04080010-01.html">reasonable time</a> to comply is <strong>22 days</strong> (14 days plus an extra 8 days) from the date of the original notice.</p>

<p>The original documents can be requested again with the claim placed on hold for 14 days when&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a claim has been submitted, and</li>
		<li>
documents lodged are not relevant to the claim</li>
		<li>
the carer believed they were lodging the correct information</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the <strong>care receiver's POI</strong> is a supplementary task for a submitted CP and/or CA claim and the POI is not provided, it must be requested and the claim placed on hold. Do not reject the claim 'FRC' unless the carer has failed to reply to the request for further information.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> in some cases, when a carer uploads a care receiver's POI, this displays on the care receiver's record. Check the carer receiver's record before rejecting the claim.</p>

<p><strong>Example&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Day 0&#58;</strong> Carer submits a complete claim with all required documents scanned to the carer's record</li>
		<li>
<strong>Day 5&#58;</strong> Claim allocated to a staff member who identifies the carer has not lodged the correct documents. If the documents provided&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
are what was requested, process the claim</li>
			<li>
are incorrect but <strong>relate</strong> to the documents requested, ask for the relevant information and allow 14 days</li>
			<li>
are incorrect and <strong>do not relate</strong> to the documents requested, reject the claim 'FRC'. Do not wait until day 22. If the rejection reason is 'FRC' or 'FSD', a decision <strong>DOC</strong> must list all the documents <strong>not provided</strong> at the time of the rejection</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>Check the CP/CA New Claim (NCL) progress <strong>DOC </strong>or<strong> Notes </strong>in Customer First. Tell the carer what is outstanding or must be provided (if applicable).</p>

<p>If the carer is calling to advise they have more information to support their claim, provide the following information&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
'Lodge your forms and/or documents online via <img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> <a href="../self-service/133-04060000-01.html">Upload documents</a> or at your local service centre as soon as you can.

<p>Consider 'Special Circumstances' for CP and/or CA claims when the carer or care receiver has a terminal condition or has recently passed away.</p>

<p>When a carer indicates they are experiencing financial hardship and requests urgent processing of a new claim, conduct an assessment for financial hardship.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Carers getting another income support payment are not considered to be in hardship nor the claim urgent</li>
		<li>
While CA is not considered an income support payment for 'hardship' provisions there are exceptions to this and it may be considered under 'special circumstances' provisions. An example of this is when the carer or care receiver is terminally ill or has recently passed away</li>
		<li>
Carers who have income from employment/self-employment or another source are generally <strong>not</strong> considered to be in hardship</li>
		</ul>
<p>See the <a href="../carers/009-01010030-05.html">Resources</a> page for an example of a Progress of Claim <strong>DOC</strong>.</p>

<p>When reviewing the carer's record, determine if an alternate income support payment should be offered.</p>

<p>If the claim has been streamed, check the carer's record and Progress of Claim <strong>DOC/Notes</strong> to determine if all the requested information/forms have been have been returned to allow urgent finalisation. This can include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Completed Claim</li>
		<li>
Medical Reports</li>
		<li>
Income and Asset Form (SA369) and associated modules</li>
		<li>
Internal referrals available and finalised</li>
		</ul>
<p>All scanned documents can be viewed via <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-10020010-01.html">Document Tools</a> on the carer's record.</p>

<p>If all of the requested information is not available on the carer's record at the time of assessing financial hardship, tell the carer the claim will be given priority when all of the requested information has been provided.</p>

<p>Offer the carer a <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-11040000-03.html">referral to community agency</a> for assistance due to financial hardship if required.</p>

<p><strong>All required information is available</strong></p>

<p>Carers who are <strong>not eligible</strong> for an alternative income support payment and meet financial hardship criteria can be referred for urgent processing provided the claim is actionable, that is, all information is available.</p>

<p>Create an <strong>open</strong> work item. Use <strong>Fast Note</strong> - select<strong> Auto Text</strong>, use <strong>Generic &gt; Urgent Claim Processing &gt; Carer Payment</strong> (if request is for Carer Allowance, add this in the free text section of the <strong>Fast Note</strong>) &gt; <strong>Confirm</strong></p>

<p>If required tell the carer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
'Your claim has been referred for urgent processing. A Service Officer will contact you when finalising your claim to advise of the outcome. Calls from us will display as a private number. Please answer this call.'</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>A work item for urgent claim processing</strong> <strong>must not</strong> be created in the following scenarios&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
carer is current on another income support payment. These claims are not considered to be in hardship or urgent as they are in receipt of another income support payment</li>
		<li>
carer is not current on another income support payment and the claim is within KPI and has no hardship indicator</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> financial hardship provisions <strong>do not apply</strong> to carer’s transferring from 1 income support payment to another, unless their previous payment was cancelled more than 14 days ago.</p>
