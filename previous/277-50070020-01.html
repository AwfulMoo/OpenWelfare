<p>This document outlines the definition and assessment of a couple separated due to illness. Customers who advise they are no longer able to live in their home with their partner due to illness, but who still consider themselves to be partnered or in a member of a couple relationship with that person, are treated as an illness separated couple.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>Although the definition of an illness separated couple applies if 1 or both members of the couple are no longer able to live in their home, a couple may only be considered an illness separated couple if they are <strong>not residing together</strong>, or are <strong>residing together in a care facility</strong>.</p>

<p>Members of a couple who permanently live in an aged care facility that provides low (hostel type) or high level (nursing home type) residential care will be considered illness separated. This will apply regardless of whether they are sharing the same room or different rooms in the care facility.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>An illness separated couple may be eligible to receive the following extra assistance&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a higher rate of payment. Certain allowance and pension customers may receive the equivalent of the single rate of payment. Parenting Payment (PP) and other allowance customers may be eligible for a special rate, which is above the member of a couple rate of payment but less than the single rate. Similarly, a <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07120040-01.html">respite care couple</a> are entitled to the single rate of payment, however their rate of Rent Assistance may be affected differently</li>
		<li>
single rate of Pharmaceutical Allowance (PhA), where applicable</li>
		<li>
single rate of Pension Supplement, where applicable</li>
		<li>
as the illness separated rate is higher than the member of a couple rate, the couple can have a higher level of income before their payment is reduced to nil by application of the partnered income test. A pensioner couple can also have a higher level of assets before their payment is reduced to nil by application of the partnered assets test</li>
		<li>
increased rate of Rent Assistance (RA)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> although illness separated couples may be paid a higher rate of payment, equivalent to the single rate of payment, the assessment will still take into account the combined income and assets as if they were a regular member of a couple.</p>

<p>After entering the appropriate 'illness separated' code on the Marital Status (<strong>MS</strong>) screen, the records of the customer and their partner will stay linked and correctly display as 'member of a couple'.</p>

<p>Members of a couple are considered to be in a care type similar to an aged care facility if they are residing in a&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
retirement village or Supported Residential Service (SRS) that is providing a low level (hostel type), or</li>
		<li>
high level (nursing home type) of care </li>
		</ul>
<p>The facility <strong>must</strong> be providing the care. If an external source, such as Home and Community care, provide the care, which the couple could receive in their own home, the agency would not consider the&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
SRS or Retirement village an aged care facility</li>
		<li>
couple illness separated</li>
		</ul>
<p>A customer can be treated as a member of an illness separated couple if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer is unable to live at home due to illness or infirmity, <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
have increased, or likely to have increased expenses because of the separation (it would be unlikely that a couple separated in this manner would <strong>not</strong> have increased expenses), <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
the inability to live together is likely to continue indefinitely</li>
		</ul>
<p>The agency does not consider a couple separated due to 1 or both members of the couple accessing approved respite care to be an illness separated couple. This is because approved respite care is for a temporary but definite period.</p>

<p>A couple that does not meet the Illness Separated criteria might meet the criteria for a <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07120040-01.html">Respite Care couple</a> and receive the higher single rate of payment if they are accessing approved respite care for a period of at least 14 days.</p>

<p>It is not the intention that medical evidence is required for the majority of assessments. A couple, who have left their home due to illness or infirmity, will be accepted as illness separated in situations where&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
it is apparent to Services Australia that the illness or infirmity of 1 or both members of a couple prevents them from living together, and/or</li>
		<li>
there is supporting evidence of illness or infirmity, for example, where the ill or infirm member of the couple&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
permanently lives in an aged care facility that provides low (hostel) or high level (nursing home) residential care, or</li>
			<li>
is a patient in a normal hospital ward and has been classified as a nursing home type patient, or</li>
			<li>
is residing in a psychiatric facility, or</li>
			<li>
has had an Aged Care Assessment Teams (ACAT) assessment that indicates care is needed on an ongoing basis, or</li>
			<li>
has current care needs that indicate that the couple cannot live together (this could be based on information the agency already holds on care needs provided to assess entitlement of a carer to receive Carer Allowance (CA) or Carer Payment (CP) in respect of the ill or infirm member of the couple)</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>The agency may ask the customer to provide supporting evidence from a treating doctor or relevant health professional where&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the illness or infirmity preventing the couple living together is not apparent, and </li>
		<li>
no other supporting evidence is available</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> it is not necessary for a care situation to exist for the illness separated rate to be paid. An illness separated couple should not be confused with former members of a couple whose relationship has ceased because of ill health.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Financial_hards">Financial hardship assistance for fees and charges in Residential Aged Care</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The Aged Care Act 1997 has 'financial hardship' provisions for people who have difficulty in paying their residential care payments and relevant ongoing expenses. Financial hardship assistance may be available to residents who do not have the income or assets to use to pay their costs of care. Each case is considered individually, based on a resident's financial circumstances. Financial hardship provisions let the agency provide financial assistance for fees and accommodation payments on application.</p>

<p>See <a href="../older-australians/065-05030000-01.html">Aged Care Financial Hardship Assistance - Overview</a> for further information.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Assessment_of_l">Assessment of living expenses</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>It is likely most couples separated due to illness will have, or be likely to have, an increase in their living expenses. In the residential aged care situation, where 1 or both members of the couple move to residential aged care, the aged care resident would be subject to a number of residential aged care fees. For further information on aged care fees, the <a href="../separated-parents/277-50070020-05.html#bp05_L2GT_External_websit">Resources</a> page has an external link to the myagedcare website.</p>

<p>The requirement for customers to pay residential aged care fees is likely to mean their expenses will increase. The illness separated provisions should apply, as the couple would not have the benefit of sharing expenses when living together. For example, for a pensioner couple in receipt of the maximum rate of payment and with no assets, the person moving into aged care would be subject to the basic daily fee. This is a fee they would not have had if the couple had remained together. Their capacity to share expenses is reduced, which the illness separated provisions is intended to recognise. Therefore, where 1 or both members of a couple are in aged care, illness separated provisions should be applied without further investigation of the couple's financial circumstances.</p>

<p>For all other situations, the assessment of living expenses should only be applied on a very selective case-by-case basis. When assessing if the customer's living expenses have increased, or are likely to increase, due to illness separation, take into account factors such as&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
transportation</li>
		<li>
medication, and </li>
		<li>
the loss of ability to pool resources</li>
		</ul>
<p>For example, where the customer or their partner have moved to hospital indefinitely or with family for care purposes. It may not be appropriate to apply an illness separated assessment, as this may not result in an increase in living expenses.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Assessment_of_i01">Assessment of indefinite separation</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>'Likely to continue indefinitely' generally means it is highly probable, based on available evidence that the term of the separation is for a period of time that is unknown or unstated. However, in some circumstances it may be difficult to determine whether a situation is likely to continue indefinitely when first making an assessment.</p>

<p>For example, in the case of a partnered customer who has entered a rehabilitation centre, in many situations the treatment will be for a specified period, such as 3 months. Where evidence is given about the length of time the separation is <strong>known or stated to be</strong>, the partner does not qualify for illness separated.</p>

<p>However, where it is not possible for the centre to determine a specific or defined period of treatment, a Service Officer should look at the full circumstances of each case and may exercise their discretion to pay the customer and partner at the illness separated rate.</p>

<p>This can include psychiatric care, aged care facility, community based care and hospitalisation as a 'nursing home type' patient.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>On 8 February 2005, the agency issued a Network News Update explaining customers who reside in serviced units or hostel units in Retirement Villages no longer automatically qualify for the illness separated rate.</p>

<p>From 20 September 2004, customers are required to qualify according to the above criteria.</p>

<p>However, as updated policy advice was not issued to the network until 8 February 2005, <strong>customers who entered serviced units or hostel units before 8 February 2005 will not be re-assessed unless their accommodation changes</strong>. No overpayments are to be raised on the difference between the illness separated rate and the combined member of a couple rate for customers who entered serviced units or hostel units in Retirement Villages before 8 February 2005.</p>

<p>The RA thresholds and maximum rate payable will depend on a customer's circumstances.

<p>If a couple do not qualify as an illness separated couple or a respite care couple, they may qualify for RA as a temporarily separated couple.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> where couples qualify for RA as a temporarily separated couple, the coding of the relevant temporary relationship qualifier code 'Tmp Sep/Both Left Home' (<strong>TEB)</strong>, 'Tmp Sep/Left Home' (<strong>TEC</strong>) or 'Tmp Sep/Ptnr Left Home' (<strong>TEP</strong>) will not adjust their income support payments to the single rate.</p>

<p>Members of a couple who reside together in a Hostel can be regarded as illness separated. When the agency introduced the Carer Allowance (CA) income test on 20 September 2018, it became compulsory to capture the current partner details of a CA claimant/recipient. Illness separated provisions do not affect the rate of payment of CA where the care receiver is their partner. CA is paid at a fixed rate regardless of relationship status.</p>

<p>This type of accommodation can meet the definition of a 'private residence' for CA, providing&#58;</p>

commercial care arrangements are not in place for the provision of personal care for the care receiver in the Hostel, and </li>

<p>They may however be considered as not being a member of a couple under Section 24 of the Social Security Act 1991 and therefore eligible for the single rate of payment.

<p><strong>One member of a couple lives in an approved institution on a permanent or indefinite basis due to a severe and debilitating illness </strong></p>

<p>They may be considered to be living separately and apart where&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the incapacity of the institutionalised partner is&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
severe</li>
			<li>
debilitating, <strong>and</strong> </li>
			<li>
of a permanent nature (such as Huntington's disease or the advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease), <strong>and</strong></li>		</ul>
		<li>
the institutionalised partner is totally and permanently incapable of providing their partner with such things as&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
companionship</li>
			<li>
comfort</li>
			<li>
physical</li>
			<li>
intellectual, or </li>
			<li>
emotional support</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>In these circumstances, they do not meet the 5 factors that determine a member of a couple as per Social Security legislation. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-50070020-04.html#bp04_L2GT_Policy">References</a> for a link to Social Security Guide, 1.1.M.120, Member of a couple.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, a couple may be assessed as single (paid the single rate and assessed under the single income and assets test). This is opposed to being assessed as illness separated (paid the single rate but the partnered income and assets test apply).</p>

<p><strong>Assessment of living separately and apart</strong></p>

<p>Under the provisions of living separately and apart, the relationship is considered to have ceased due to ill health. The individuals are deemed single and paid a single rate of income support payment. The single income and assets test provisions will apply to individuals assessed as living separately and apart.</p>

<p>If the customer entering care is considered to be living separately and apart and, regardless of whether the partner remains in the former principal home, the incapacitated person's share (as either tenant-in-common or joint tenants) of the principal home continues to be an exempt asset for up to 2 years (longer if further exemptions are met). The incapacitated customer's exemption of the principal home will cease after 2 years in care unless another exemption applies.</p>

<p>Consider the customer's individual circumstances when making a determination.</p>

<p>The application of the living separately and apart - 1 member of a couple institutionalised due to a severe and debilitating illness assessment can be a sensitive topic for customers. Particularly elderly couples, who may not be able to disconnect emotionally from their partner, regardless of the financial impacts. Making this assessment will separate the customers' records as if they were single. If a customer still strongly believes and states that they are a member of a couple with their partner, the records are not to be unlinked. In these situations, the customer and partner will be considered an illness separated couple.</p>

<p><strong>Living separately and apart should not generally be accepted if the couple are living apart solely because of ill health, employment and/or economic reasons</strong>. All other options should be explored before a determination is made that a couple are living separately and apart.</p>

<p>Policy contains examples and further information about provisions for members of a couple that are living separately and apart. See the <a href="../separated-parents/277-50070020-04.html#bp04_L2GT_Policy">References</a> page for links to the Social Security Guide.</p>
