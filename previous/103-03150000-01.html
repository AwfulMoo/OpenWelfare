<p>This document contains information about the Cashless Debit Card (CDC), participant support, and roles in the administration of the CDC.</p>
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Government_inte"></a>
<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Government_inte">Government intent</h2>


<p>The CDC aims to reduce the amount of cash in the community that could be used for gambling and to buy alcohol and drugs. Eligible customers, who are on income support payments, will have part of their payment delivered via a CDC that cannot be used to buy alcohol, gambling products, cash-like products, or to withdraw as cash. Cash-like products are defined as gift or store cards, vouchers, money or postal orders, shares or digital currency. </p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Overview_of_CDC">Overview of CDC</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The CDC is currently operating in the following locations&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Ceduna and surrounding region, South Australia</li>
		<li>
East Kimberley, Western Australia</li>
		<li>
Goldfields region, Western Australia</li>
		<li>
Bundaberg and Hervey Bay region, Queensland</li>
		<li>
Cape York, Queensland</li>
		<li>
Northern Territory (NT) for customers who&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
consent to transition from Income Management (IM) to the CDC</li>
			<li>
income support recipients in the NT who volunteer for the CDC</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>Once a customer is a participant in the CDC, the <a href="../payment-delivery/103-03150000-01.html#bp01_L2GT_Cashless_Debit_01">trigger payment</a> and additional restrictable payments they receive will be paid to their CDC account.</p>

<p>Staff can view the <a href="https&#58;//agdhs.maps.arcgis.com/apps/View/index.html?appid=5fae72f1a2d347caa80284d4a06f1097">Geospatial</a> tool to determine if customer resides in a CDC location.</p>

<p><strong>CDC in the NT</strong></p>

<p>In December 2020, legislation passed to allow income managed customers in the NT the option to consent and transition to the CDC.  The legislation also allows for customers in the NT, who are in receipt of an Income Support Payment, who are not currently on IM, the option to volunteer for the CDC program.  </p>

<p>From December 2021, participants within the Northern Territory will have the opportunity to choose their preferred card issuer. </p>

<p>All participants receive a personalised CDC supplied by the card issuer. Where a participant has a payment nominee, the nominee will be issued the personalised card. The card will have the payment nominee's name printed on the card and the participant's name printed underneath. The online account linked to the CDC will also be managed by the payment nominee.</p>

<p>In some cases the payment nominee may request the card only be issued in the participant's name. In these instances the participant and the payment nominee will have access to the online account.</p>

<p>When a payment nominee relationship is started, changed or ended, the system will perform an eligibility check for CDC and take the appropriate action automatically.</p>

<p>The card looks and operates like a normal bank card, except that it cannot be used to buy alcohol, gambling products, cash-like products or to withdraw cash. The card can be used at most shops that accept EFTPOS or Visa. It will work online, for shopping and paying bills. The card issuer website lists the approved merchants and excluded merchants for the CDC. The card can be used at most merchants nationwide with EFTPOS or Visa facilities, except merchants where the main business is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the sale of alcohol</li>
		<li>
gambling services, or</li>
		<li>
online stores that have not been pre-approved by the card issuer</li>
		</ul>
<p>The card also cannot be used to purchase cash-like products, that can be used to purchase alcohol or gambling products. Cash-like products are defined as gift or store cards, vouchers, money or postal orders, shares or digital currency.</p>

<p>Up to 80% of regular fortnightly and 100% of lump sums and arrears of restrictable payments will be restricted and paid to the recipient's CDC. The remaining percentage will be paid to the participant's normal bank account.</p>

<p>Lump sums that are 100% restricted and paid to a participant's CDC are payments that are not paid by regular instalment and include advance payments.</p>

<p>For NT customers who consent and transition to the CDC, the percentage of restricted funds is based on the previous IM measure. Interest is paid on CDC account balances. For more information, see <a href="../payment-delivery/103-03150000-05.html#bp05_L3TT_Talking_points_">Talking points - paying interest to CDC accounts</a> in Resources. For any enquiries that cannot be answered by Services Australia, advise participants to contact the card issuer directly.</p>

<p>All cards and support services to access restricted funds on the CDC are provided by the card issuer.</p>

<p><strong>Referrals to the CDC in Cape York</strong></p>

<p>The Family Responsibilities Commission (FRC), a Queensland State Government authority, is responsible for determining when a customer is required to participate in the CDC program. The FRC will send a notification to Services Australia.</p>

<p>The FRC may send a Notice to Commence the CDC because&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they believe the CDC will benefit the customer and their family, or</li>
		<li>
the customer has volunteered to participate in the CDC through the FRC</li>
		</ul>
<p>The FRC will determine the period of participation in the CDC program, and the percentage of a participant’s payment that will be quarantined. </p>

<p>To be eligible for Cashless Debit Card in the Cape York the customer or their partner must be in receipt of a category P or welfare payment and&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
reside in a Cape York Initiative area</li>
		<li>
do not have an excluded payment nominee for the purpose of the Cashless Debit Card, and</li>
		<li>
have be referred by the Family Responsibilities Commission (FRC)</li>

greater choice</li>
		<li>
opportunities to have their CDC account at the same financial institution as their personal account,</li>

reduced stigma (by providing CDC cards that look similar to other cards from the same institution), and </li>

<p>Cashless Debit Card participants can request to set their CDC account as their primary payment destination. </p>

<p>A CDC participant can contact the agency to request that their primary payment destination be the same as their CDC account. </p>

<p>It is important that participants understand that 100% of their eligible Income Support Payments will be subject to the restrictions associated with CDC account. Once funds are paid into the CDC account, it will not be possible to distinguish between the restricted and unrestricted portions.</p>

A list of blocked and mixed merchants and information can be found on the card issuer's website.</p>
