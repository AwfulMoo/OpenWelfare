<p>Where both parties are eligible carers, an agreement may provide that each parent is liable to pay child support under the terms of the agreement. For example, the agreement may state that each parent is to pay, by way of non-periodic child support, 50% of the child/ren’s school fees. Such agreements may be treated as if it were one agreement, or two separate agreements.</p>

<p>Where both parents are liable parents and receiving parents according to the terms of the agreement, one parent ceasing to be an eligible carer may impact <strong>all</strong> of the obligations within the agreement, or <strong>only</strong> the obligations payable to the parent who is no longer an eligible carer. This is dependent on whether or not the agreement is treated as one agreement, or two separate agreements.</p>

<p>An agreement that includes clauses for both parents to pay child support (periodic and/or non-periodic) should generally be treated as if it is one single agreement, <strong>unless</strong>&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the agreement specifically states that, in the event one parent ceases to be an eligible carer, <strong>only</strong> the payments payable by the other party will be suspended, or</li>
		<li>
both parents agree that their intention is that <strong>only</strong> the payments payable by the other party will be suspended. Contact both parents to confirm their intention.</li>
		</ul>
<p>In such cases, the payments payable to the party who is no longer an eligible carer will be suspended, and the payments payable by the other parent will continue to be in force.</p>

<p>In all other cases, the agreement will generally be treated as a single agreement, and all payments, payable by both parents, will be suspended in the event that one parent ceases to be an eligible carer.</p>

<p>When an initiating binding agreement is suspended for a child, any party to the agreement can make a section 151 election to end their assessment. Like other section 151 elections, the assessment will end from a specified day in the future, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-03150000-01.html">Ending a Child Support assessment</a>. </p>

<p>A customer can make the election on the phone, in writing, or by using the <a target="_blank" class="extwebsitelink" href="https&#58;//www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/forms/child-support#A2ZE">Ending a child support assessment</a> form.</p>

<p><strong>Liable parent election</strong></p>

<p>A liable parent may only elect to end the assessment if the agreement is an initiating agreement and the election is made on a day when the agreement is suspended. </p>

<p>Document the election in a Cuba notepad and send a manual UQ120.05 Election to end an agreement based assessment letter.</p>

<p><strong>Payee election</strong></p>

<p>If the payee under the agreement makes the election on a day when the agreement is suspended, record the election in Cuba in a notepad and send a manual UQ120.05 Election to end an agreement based assessment letter.</p>

<p>If the payee makes an election to end their assessment at any other time, process the election like any other section 151 election, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-03150000-01.html">Ending a Child Support assessment</a>. The system will generate the appropriate letters. </p>

<p>See <a href="../separated-parents/277-18030100-01.html">Managing changes affecting a Child Support agreement</a> for further information about the effect of section 151 elections on child support agreements. </p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> after the election to end the assessment has been accepted and a terminating event has occurred, either parent/carer can then apply for an administrative assessment for the child.</p>

<p>If the same customer who elects to end the assessment also applies for an administrative assessment, the agreement will continue to be in force. The agreement will no longer be classified as an initiating agreement with an agreement-based assessment. Instead, it will modify the underlying administrative assessment If the agreement is still suspended when the application is made, the new child support assessment for the child will be based on the formula.</p>

<p>If the care of the child changes before the suspension period ends and the payee under the agreement is again an eligible carer of the child, the agreement will restart and will modify the underlying administrative assessment.

<p>If an agreement did not initiate the child support case (an application for assessment was received prior to the agreement being accepted), child support will be payable under a formula assessment when the agreement is suspended or if the agreement ends for a child.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the agreement has ended or been suspended in respect of 1 child, but the agreement continues to apply to another child of the same child support case, a mixed assessment adjustment may be needed on that case or a reverse case may need to be created if the overall roles of the parents change. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-03020020-01.html">Complex system processing for reverse child support cases</a>.</p>

<p>If a parent has another child support case(s), the child for whom the agreement is suspended or ended will automatically be assessed as a multi-case child. This is because the parent will continue to be assessed as to the costs of the child under the formula based underlying assessment, which will continue to apply from the date the non-initiating agreement is suspended or ended.  </p>

<p></p>

<p>However, the child will not be assessed as a multi-case child if a care suspension period applies, see the Child Support Guide Chapter 2.10.4&#58; Suspension of Liability to Pay Child Support when there is a Change in Eligible Carer, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-18061455-04.html">References</a> page.</p>

<p>From December 2014 it was Child Support policy that where a payee under an agreement ceased to be an eligible carer of a child and the agreement did not include any clauses that addressed care changes, the liable parent under the agreement would still be required to pay the relevant child support liability under the agreement to the payee for that child.</p>

<p>Due to system limitations and in order for the correct liability to continue to be payable, these agreements were processed in Cuba as a Stage 1 Court order/agreement liability from the date of effect of the care change.</p>

<p>If one of the cases is identified where a Stage 1 liability still applies after 1 July 2018, refer the case to the Agreements team to take the following actions&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Agreements Service Officer to check with SSO  to confirm whether the Stage 1 liability should be ended. If so contact the customer by phone to advise them that the agreement will be suspended or terminated for the child as applicable from 1 July 2018 (15 May 2019 for WA Ex-nuptial cases). A suspension may be applicable if the care change occurred less than 26 weeks prior to 1 July 2018(15 May 2019 for WA Ex- nuptial cases), <a href="../separated-parents/277-18061455-03.html#bp03_tbl_Payee_ceases_to_Step04">go to Step 4</a> <a href="../separated-parents/277-18061455-05.html#bp05_L3TT_Date_of_effect_">Date of effect of care change – transitional provisions for suspensions and terminations</a>. </li>

change the end date of the stage 1 registration to 30 June 2018 (14 May 2019 for WA Ex-nuptial cases) and document the reasons in a notepad</li>
		<li>
send  manual letters advising that the agreement has been suspended or terminated for the relevant child/ren. Select the appropriate manual letter option from the <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-18061455-05.html">Resources</a> page</li>

<p><strong>Non-initiating agreement</strong></p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the agreement has ended or been suspended in respect of 1 child, but the agreement continues to apply to another child of the same child support case, a mixed assessment adjustment may be needed on that case or a reverse case may need be created if the overall roles of the parents change.

<p>Under previous Child Support policy in effect up until November 2014, if a payee under an agreement ceased to be an eligible carer of the child, Services Australia did not continue to apply the child support agreement, and child support ceased to be payable for that child under the agreement. If the agreement did not initiate the child support case, child support then became payable for the child under the underlying administrative assessment. </p>

<p>These agreements will be suspended or terminated for the child from 1 July 2018 (15 May 2019 for WA Ex-nuptial cases). These agreements will already have ended in Cuba with a <strong>'Child Left Payee Care'</strong> entitlement end reason.</p>

<p>Agreement cases affected by this previous policy will be identified if and when the payee under the agreement again becomes an eligible carer of the child after 1 July 2018 (15 May 2019 WA Ex-nuptial cases), or at any other time as part of processing other case events. The customers should be transferred to the Agreements team for the following actions&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
contact the customers to advise them that the agreement was terminated for the child from 1 July 2018(15 May 2019 for WA Ex-nuptial cases). <strong>Note&#58;</strong> a suspension may be applicable if the care change occurred less than 26 weeks prior to 1 July 2018(15 May 2019 for WA Ex-nuptial cases). <a href="../separated-parents/277-18061455-03.html#bp03_tbl_Payee_ceases_to_Step04">Go to Step 4</a></li>

The agreement will already be ended in Cuba with a ‘Child Left Payee Care’ entitlement end reason</li>
		<li>

		</ul>
<p><strong>Non-initiating agreement</strong></p>

<p><strong>Initiating agreement</strong></p>

<p>If the agreement <strong>is an initiating</strong> <strong>agreement</strong>, the child support case for the relevant child/ren will end.  The customers should be advised they can make an application for an administrative assessment for the child.</p>

<p>If a formula assessment applied to the child when the original care change occurred (under the previous policy  to November 2014) this will be treated as an error correction. The error will generally be corrected prospectively only for example from the date the payee under the agreement again becomes an eligible carer after 1 July 2018 (15 May 2019 Ex-nuptial cases) or the date the agency identifies the error as part of processing other case events. This is because the decision to apply the formula when the original care change occurred was in accordance with the policy that applied at the time. </p>

<p>An agreement termination due to a pre 1 July 2018 care change can only take effect from 1 July 2018 (15 May 2019 for WA Ex-nuptial cases).</p>

<p>There are some circumstances where an agreement suspension can apply due to a pre 1 July 2018/ 15 May 2019 care change. Such a suspension can also only take effect from 1 July 2018/15 May 2019. However, the suspension end date will depend on&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the date the payee ceased to be an eligible carer </li>
		<li>
whether a 28 day or a 26 week suspension period applies, and</li>
		<li>
whether the payee resumed being an eligible carer during the suspension period.   </li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; Consult a SSO for guidance before processing any suspension or termination due to a pre 1 July 2018/15 May 2019 care change.</p>

<p><strong>If the payee ceased to be an eligible carer more than 26 weeks prior to 1 July 2018/15 May 2019&#58; </strong></p>

<p>No suspension period can be applied. The agreement will terminate for the child from 1 July 2018. (15 May 2019 for WA ex nuptial cases.) </p>

<p>The Agreements team Service Officer will send a manual UQ120.06 Existing Agreement suspension or termination letter to the customers, advising that the agreement has ended. </p>

<p><strong>If the payee ceased to be an eligible carer more than 28 days but less than 26 weeks prior to 1 July 2018/15 May 2019</strong>&#58;</p>

<p>A 28 day suspension period could not apply. However, a longer suspension period could potentially apply. Contact the customers to determine if a 26 week suspension period should apply. See <a target="_blank" href="https&#58;//guides.dss.gov.au/child-support-guide/2/7/6">The Child Support Guide 2.7.6 Suspending a Child  Support Agreement</a>.</p>

<p>If applicable, the suspension period could only apply from 1 July 2018/15 May 2019 until the date 26 weeks after the date the payee ceased to be an eligible carer.  The suspension period may end earlier if the payee resumed care in that period. If so, the agreement liability would need to be manually restarted from the effective date of the payee resuming care. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-18061455-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Manual_processi">Agreement manual processing from 1 July 2018</a>.</p>

<p>If no suspension period applies OR if the payee did not resume care during the suspension period, the agreement will terminate from 1 July 2018/15 May 2019. </p>

<p>To explain the outcome, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-01010000-01.html">Contact with Child Support customers</a>. Manual letters will also be required.

<p><strong>If the payee ceased to be an eligible carer within 28 days prior to pre 1 July 2018/15 May 2019</strong>&#58;</p>

<p>A 28 day suspension period would apply. A longer suspension period could potentially apply. Contact the customers to determine if a 26 week suspension period should apply.

<p>If an agreement is suspended or terminated in relation to a child and there are child/ren who remain on the agreement, the agreement rate payable by the original liable parent will usually change by more than 15% and a new PNA will generate for the child/ren remaining on the agreement.  </p>

<p>When the PNA converts to a notional assessment the payee’s FTB Part A (for the children for whom the agreement is not suspended) will be calculated on the amount of child support that would have been payable for those children if the agreement was not in place.  </p>

<p>If the agreement is not an initiating agreement, the PNA should reflect the formula assessment that would otherwise be payable for the children remaining on the agreement (if the agreement was not in place), with all children of the case taken into account under the formula calculations (if there is a delayed care notification under the new care date of effect rules, both the decreased and increased percentage of care will apply in the PNA when it generates at that time).</p>

<p>If the agreement is an initiating agreement, the PNA should reflect the formula assessment that would otherwise be payable for the children remaining on the agreement (if the agreement was not in place), with only those children taken into account under the formula calculations (the child leaving the payee’s care is not assessed under the formula while the initiating agreement is suspended/terminated).</p>

<p>If a new PNA generates and the agreement terminates for a child before the notional assessment (NA) issues, the NA should still reflect the above.</p>

<p>If there is only 1 child on the agreement when it is suspended or terminated (or all children on the agreement are affected by the suspension or termination), information will be exchanged with Centrelink indicating that the child/ren is ‘inactive’ on the case with the original payee. The original payee under the agreement will not be eligible for FTB Part A for the child/ren and a NA will not be relevant for FTB purposes.  </p>

<p>If the child/ren returns to the original payee’s care during a suspension period and the agreement restarts, information will be exchanged with Centrelink indicating that the child/ren has an <strong>active</strong> status. </p>
		<ul>		<li>
If there was only 1 child on the agreement or if all children affected by the suspension return to the original payee’s care, a new PNA will not issue as the agreement rate has not changed by more than 15% and the previous NA will therefore be applicable for the child/ren</li>
		<li>
If only 1 child returns to the original payee’s care and other child/ren remain affected by the agreement suspension, a new PNA will usually issue in relation to the child/ren who has returned the payee’s care because the agreement rate will usually change by more than 15% </li>		</ul>
