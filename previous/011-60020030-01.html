<p>If a patient or claimant does not present a valid concession or Medicare card at the time of dispensing, they can present their PBS Patient refund claim at a Services Australia service centre. A patient refund can be processed over the counter only if a Service Officer proficient in processing patient refunds is present. Patient refund claims processed at a service centre are archived as per service centre guidelines and are not loaded to the Workload Management tool (WLM). </p>

<p>PBS patient refund claims which are not actioned at the service centre are scanned into the WLM for processing. </p>

<p>In the event a patient or claimant contacts the PBS general enquiry line to enquire on a claim completed in a service centre, Service Officers should advise that the claim cannot be accessed on the system as it has been archived at the service centre. Service Officers should escalate this enquiry to a <a target="_blank" href="../your-health/011-40120060-03.html">Programme Support Officer (PSO)</a> who can arrange for the claim to be recalled from archives.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>In March 2022, a federal budget measure was announced to lower the PBS Safety Net thresholds effective from 1 July 2022. As thresholds have never been updated part way through a calendar year, this means that 2 thresholds are in effect during 2022. As the lowered threshold is only effective from 1 July, it cannot be reached before this, and patient refunds are not payable for the difference between the higher and lower thresholds.</p>

<p>For PBS Safety Net and PBS Patient Refunds, this means&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Patients only need to meet the threshold once in a calendar year</li>
		<li>
Patients who reach the old threshold before 1 July have already qualified for the PBS Safety Net and will continue to receive the scripts at the Safety Net price</li>
			<ul>			<li>
As the new threshold was not active when the prescriptions were dispensed, patient refunds do not apply and are not payable</li>
			<li>
Patients are still able to apply for a refund for items that have exceeded the old thresholds</li>		</ul>
		<li>
For patients who reach the new threshold before 1 July but not the old threshold, it is the first script they have dispensed from 1 July that is considered the date they reached the threshold. This script is also the first one that can be supplied at the Safety Net price and therefore the first script that can be refunded in an over the threshold refund</li>
		</ul>
<p>As the lower thresholds are only effective from 1 July 2022, they cannot be retrospectively applied. Refunds will not be payable for any items that exceeded the lower thresholds before 1 July 2022.</p>

<p>Reject refund claims where the patient reached the old threshold before 1 July and is requesting a refund down to the lower threshold. For this type of claim, only items that exceed the old threshold can be refunded.</p>

<p><strong>Information concerning refunds for prescriptions dispensed prior to 1 July 2021</strong></p>

<p>From 1 July 2010, eligible patients can claim a patient refund for closing the gap (CTG) co-payment relief. For information on eligibility and who can annotate a PBS prescription, see <a href="../your-health/011-60050000-01.html">Closing the Gap (CTG) Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) Co-payment Measure</a>.</p>

<p>To write the CTG annotation, the prescriber must be registered to prescribe under the measure as part of either the Indigenous Heath Incentive (IHI) or a Practice Incentives Program (PIP) practice.  </p>

<p>A prescription endorsed with CTG enables a pharmacist to dispense the medication at a lower rate, for example, general patients with a CTG prescription are charged the concession rate and concessional patients with a CTG prescription receive the medication for free.</p>

<p>A patient is entitled to receive a patient refund for CTG co-payment relief when, at the time of supply by a pharmacist, the patient&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
was unable to establish their level of entitlement, or</li>
		<li>
had exceeded the threshold limit before a safety net entitlement or concession card was issued</li>
		</ul>
<p>To claim a patient refund for CTG co-payment relief from Services Australia, the patient must present proof of entitlement with a <a href="../your-health/011-60020030-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Letters_and_for">Patient claim for refund Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) form (PB132)</a> and attach&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
a valid pharmacy receipt with a CTG annotation such as a 6 digit code commencing with the letters <strong>CTG</strong>; or</li>
		<li>
a letter from the prescriber (on the practice letterhead) confirming the patient is eligible for CTG and the prescription details including, medicine name, quantity and date, supplied to the patient under the CTG co-payment measure. Pharmacists or patients cannot provide endorsement on the prescriber’s behalf</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> for manually annotated prescriptions, the manual code <strong>CTG00B</strong> must be keyed into the <strong>CTG</strong> field.</p>

<p>PSOs will escalate CTG claims to National Office, when supporting documents are not provided and will check the patient’s eligibility before requesting for more information is made. If the person was registered at the time of the script being dispensed complete the <a target="_blank" href="/letters/Pages/med/pbs.html#publicRefunds">Z1682 More information is needed for your PBS item refund<i></a> </i>letter. If the person is confirmed not to be registered complete the <a target="_blank" href="/letters/Pages/med/pbs.html#publicRefunds">Z1680 Your PBS item refund is not payable</a> letter.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Information for Refunds post 1 July 2021</strong></p>

<p>From 1 July 2021 a patient’s registration for the CTG PBS Co-payment program will be stored on their Medicare record in the Consumer Directory Maintenance System (CDMS). From 1 July 2021, there is no longer a legal requirement to write or electronically print ‘CTG’ on eligible PBS prescriptions for registered Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. However, annotation of a PBS prescription is encouraged to help community pharmacists, when dispensing medicines, to know that the patient is registered for the program. A script will not need to be annotated to receive a patient refund. Any eligible script that was not dispensed as CTG for a CTG registered patient can receive a refund.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> a patient <strong>must</strong> be registered for CTG in HPOS to receive the CTG benefit.</p>

<p>Services Australia staff have access to view a patient’s CTG status and registration history in CDMS.</p>

<p>A patient is entitled to receive a patient refund for CTG co-payment relief when, at the time of supply by a pharmacist, the patient&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
was actively registered for CTG PBS Co-payment measure in CDMS;</li>
		<li>
had exceeded the threshold limit before a safety net entitlement or concession card was issued</li>
		</ul>
<p>To claim a patient refund for CTG co-payment relief from Services Australia, the patient must supply&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a Patient claim for refund Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) form (PB132) and</li>

<p>Responsibility for claiming entitlements rests with the patient. When items accumulated on a Prescription Record Form (PRF) exceeds the PBS Safety Net threshold, Services Australia may refund the excess amount. </p>

<p>When a patient cannot satisfy a pharmacist they qualify for the PBS safety net, they may be charged at the pre-Safety Net rate. The patient can apply to Services Australia for a refund covering the cost difference. </p>

<p>The agency can only pay refunds for PBS items supplied through approved suppliers. Refunds for non-PBS hospital-supplied items should be referred to the relevant State or Territory hospital or health department.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> for refunds outside the current Safety Net year, where a Safety Net card is not issued, contact a <a href="../your-health/011-40120060-03.html">Programme Support Officer</a> to source a valid SN/CN number to issue.</p>

<p>The measure does not change the operation of the PBS Safety Net for participating patients or their families. The amount that can be added towards a family's Safety Net tally for each CTG prescription is the same amount that would have been added in the absence of the measure.</p>

<p>For example, a CTG eligible patient has a prescription dispensed under the concessional benefit. Without CTG it would cost them $6.80, the CTG means they pay $0.00. Their PRF will show as if they had paid $6.80 towards the PBS Safety Net.</p>

Escalate to a <a href="../your-health/011-40120060-03.html">Programme Support Officer</a> for further assistance.</p>

<p>The Service Officer must also verify the entitlement ID quoted on the patient refund claim. Where no details are held in PBS eligibility records, and the documentation states the entitlement was current on the date of supply (for example, a letter from Centrelink), escalate the details to the PBS Helpdesk. The PBS Helpdesk confirms validity of entitlement and arranges for the PBS eligibility records to be updated if appropriate.</p>

<p>Where the patient's entitlement is not valid, do not key the claim. Refer the claimant to the agency that issued the card. Use the <a target="_blank" href="/letters/Pages/med/pbs.html#publicRefunds">Z1682 We need more information to refund your PBS claim</a> letter.</p>

<p>The Safety Net checker is used to perform eligibility and threshold assessments of all PBS Safety Net applications. The checker can also generate a ‘script list’ displaying all prescriptions showing in a patient’s dispensing history. While the primary function of the checker is for assessment Safety Net claims, this ‘script list’ can also be used to check the details of an item in a refund claim. </p>

<p>The checker displays the details of the prescriptions supplied and this is extracted from PBS Online claims. Information included in the checker include the payment category. Medicare and concession numbers, item code, quantity and more.</p>

<p>The checker can be used to confirm the details if there is any doubt about the details on the pharmacy receipt. For example, there can be items that were supplied as concession that include a brand premium which is not refundable. The receipt shows the total amount the patient paid including the premium. As the amount will be over the concessional co-payment amount it may appear to be a general amount. </p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The PBS Safety Net threshold may be reached using prescriptions filled at both community pharmacies and out-patient pharmacies at public hospitals. This arrangement is called the Joint Safety Net arrangement.</p>

<p>The amount charged under the Joint Safety Net arrangements by public hospitals is determined by the relevant State and Territory. Although these medicines may not be dispensed as a PBS item, they can still count towards a customer’s total spending for the PBS Safety Net.</p>

<p>Non-reformed States, ACT and NSW, have a hospital formulary which contains non-PBS/Private items. For the purpose of PBS Safety Net, non-PBS/Private items can also count towards the PBS Safety Net threshold, as long as the drug is approved by the hospital therapeutic committee and the relevant State/Territory Health departments.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> these items are not eligible to be refunded if the patient has gone over the threshold. The reason a patient refund does not apply in this situation is that the Commonwealth did not provide a subsidy to the Non-PBS/Private item. The item was paid for by the patient or funded by the State/Territory entirely. </p>
