<p>Complaints can be received&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
via the Feedback and Complaints line </li>
		<li>
as part of business as usual</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Complaint received about Centrelink or Medicare</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
If a call is received and the customer wants to lodge a complaint about Centrelink or Medicare&#58;</li>
		<li>
cold transfer the call to the appropriate service delivery brand via the <strong><a href="../utils/CustomerReferralGuidelines/Customer-Referral-Guidelines.html?complaints.html">F</strong>eedback and Complaints line</a> </li>
		<li>
procedure ends here</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>General enquiry received on the Services Australia Feedback and  Complaints line</strong></p>

<p>General enquiries are contacts from customers that are <strong>not intended</strong> to be a complaint, compliment or suggestion.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Confirm with the customer they have a general enquiry and not a complaint</li>
		<li>
Advise the Feedback and Complaints line is for the lodgement of complaints and feedback</li>
		<li>
Manage the enquiry by providing general information and for example&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
correct contact information for future enquiries </li>
			<li>
self-service options </li>		</ul>
		<li>
Record the call in the customer <strong>Communication</strong> screen as a Complaint/Not a Complaint</li>
		<li>
Document the reason it is a general enquiry and not a complaint, compliment or suggestion</li>
		<li>
Procedure ends here</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Complaint about Child Support legislation/policy</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Record the complaint as a Level 1 and manage accordingly</li>
		<li>
Advise the customer they can contact the Department of Social Services to provide feedback about child support legislation and/or policy</li>
		<li>
Only discuss current legislation/policy with the customer. Services Australia cannot provide comment on pending or potential matters such as legislative changes, or Parliamentary Inquiry recommendations</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Complaint received on general enquiry line</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
If a customer calls the Child Support general enquiry line and the call is not a general enquiry but a customer complaint&#58;</li>
		<li>
record the call as a Level 1 complaint and manage accordingly</li>
		<li>
escalate the call to a Level 2 Complaints Officer if 1 of the 8 escalation reasons are met</li>
		<li>
If it is unclear whether the customer is lodging a complaint, ask if they want their issue recorded as a complaint.  A complaint has 2 specific characteristics that differentiate it from a general enquiry&#58;</li>
		<li>
It is an expression of dissatisfaction in relation to a product or service </li>
		<li>
A response or resolution is explicitly or implicitly expected by the customer</li>
		<li>
<a href="../separated-parents/277-09020020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Assessment_and_Step02">Go to Step 2</a></li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>If the customer is calling about an existing level 2 complaint</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Advise the customer their call will be transferred to a Service Officer in the Escalated Complaints Team </li>
		<li>
<strong>Do not</strong> transfer the customer to an individual Service Officer’s voice mail. If the Service Officer in the Escalated Complaints Team is unavailable, transfer the customer to the Level 2 Complaints phone queue using Interaction Workspace (iWS) Softphone</li>

		<ul>		<li>
Identify the customer’s issues. Ask the customer to provide specific information relevant to their complaint including dates, names and information they were provided</li>
		<li>
Apologise to the customer if appropriate, for any errors made or their perception of a negative experience</li>
		<li>
Ask if they have a desired remedy or outcome. This assists in managing the customer’s expectations and determining options available </li>
		<li>
If the complaint was made in writing or online, contact the customer to clarify the issues raised</li>
		</ul>
<p>Acknowledge all complaints and provide an overview of the complaints process. Advise the customer their issues will be investigated in accordance with the <a target="_blank" href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-02000000-04.html">Customer Complaints and Feedback Policy</a>. </p>

<p>If the complaint was received online, acknowledge receipt of the complaint via the customer's preferred channel within 3 days.</p>

<p>When customers lodge a complaint, they sometimes use language which does not align with language used internally by the agency. For example, a customer says they wish to lodge a formal complaint this should be managed as a Level 1 complaint if it does not meet any of the 8 Complaint Escalation Reasons. Everyone in the agency is authorised to receive and finalise complaints.</p>

<p><strong>Lock customer or allocate to owning officer</strong></p>

<p>Level 1 complaints are common activity under the Customer Management Approach (CMA). If the customer is not locked to a Service Officer lock the customer in accordance with CMA and manage the customer complaint to resolution.</p>

<p><strong>If the customer is locked to another Service Officer</strong></p>

<p>Service Officer who receives the complaint&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
has ownership of the complaint</li>
		<li>
manages the complaint to resolution</li>
		<li>
<strong>does not lock</strong> the customer</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>If the customer is locked to a Specialist area</strong> </p>

<p>Service Officer who receives the complaint advises the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they are managed in another business area</li>
		<li>
due to the particular specialisation, that area is best placed to manage their issues</li>
		</ul>
<p>Cold transfer the call using the following <a target="_blank" href="https&#58;//intranet.internal.dept.local/Pages/section/iws-softphone.html">Interaction Workspace (iWS) Softphone</a> options&#58;</p>

<p>A behavioural complaint is a complaint about the manner in which an individual staff member interacted with a customer, not about a technical decision or process. </p>

<p><strong>When a customer makes a behavioural complaint&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
ask the customer for specific details - what was said and how that led to the complaint </li>
		<li>
create a Level 1 complaint. See <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-30010140-01.html">Complaints handling Cuba Process Help</a>. This will automatically create a Step 1 complaint intray  </li>
		<li>
use the <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/elements/macros/ComplaintsHandling.html">Complaints Handling macro</a> to document the complaint. Ensure that sufficient information is obtained to enable the behavioural complaint to be investigated, but minimal information about the Service Officer (first name, team and site only) is documented in Cuba</li>
		<li>
consider a well-placed and appropriate apology. The NSW Ombudsman guide to an apology (Apologies - a practical guide) explains that an apology should be well placed (timed appropriately - not delayed where possible) and appropriate (in some occasions sympathy and an explanation is more appropriate)</li>
		<li>
explain that complaints about staff are taken seriously. Services Australia intends to provide a high quality service in accordance with the agency’s service commitments to every customer</li>
		<li>
explain that the complaint will be provided to the staff member’s manager to review and discuss</li>
		<li>
thank the customer for taking the time to provide feedback</li>
		<li>
explain the agency does not provide customers with details of feedback provided to staff</li>
		<li>
focus on what can be done to resolve other aspects of their complaint, for example, a decision, delay or process also included in the complaint</li>
		<li>
explain they <strong>will not</strong> get a call back or a response because behavioural complaints are managed internally</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>At the end of the call, the Service Officer confirms the above&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the customer <strong>is satisfied</strong>&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Service Officer who took the complaint routes the Step 1 complaint intray to the owning Team Leader (who manages the staff member the complaint is about) and emails the Team Leader to notify of the complaint.<br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> check Team Leader availability via Microsoft Teams</li>
			<li>
Service Officer documents Team Leader and team details on the intray</li>
			<li>
Service Officer, the behavioural complaint procedure ends here</li>		</ul>
		<li>
If the customer <strong>is not satisfied</strong> and requests a call back from the Team Leader&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Document these details for the Team Leader to action </li>
			<li>
Advise the customer they will receive a call back from the owning Team Leader within 10 working days to discuss the outcome of their complaint.</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Owning Team Leader will&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
review the complaint</li>
			<li>
pass on feedback where appropriate</li>
			<li>
finalise the Level 1 complaint in Cuba</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>If the customer has raised multiple complaint issues including behaviour</strong>&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Service Officer will&#58;</li>
		<li>
route the Step 1 complaint intray to the Team Leader who manages the staff member the behaviour complaint is about</li>
		<li>
create a Complaint follow up intray to ensure the other complaint issues are followed up by the relevant Service Officer</li>
		<li>
investigate every other issue and record the outcome in the complaint notepad. This may include contacting the customer to provide an outcome</li>
		</ul>
<p>The Team Leader reviewing the behavioural complaint, is responsible for recording the remedy and outcome of the behaviour complaint and finalising the complaint in Cuba. The Step 1 complaint intray is in the owning Team Leader’s Cuba position and they are responsible for making sure the complaint is finalised, including following up with the Service Officer about any outstanding complaint issues. Any feedback that occurs as a result of a complaint <strong>should not</strong> be documented in the complaint record.</p>

<p><strong>Transferring the behavioural complaint call directly to a Team Leader if the complaint is about the staff member taking the call or another person in their team</strong></p>

<p>If the customer wants to complain about the staff member taking the call or an officer in their team it may be appropriate to offer an apology as this could satisfy the customer and not require to the call to be escalated. If the call is escalated&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
record a Level 1 complaint</li>
		<li>
refer the customer to the relevant Team Leader</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the Team Leader and/or site leadership backup is unavailable to take the call, escalate the complaint to the Level 2 Escalated Complaints Team. Advise the customer their call is being transferred to a Service Officer in the Escalated Complaints Team. The Level 2 Officer will finalise the Level 1 complaint as ‘escalated’ and link it to the Level 2 complaint.</p>

<p>The Team Leader actions the behaviour complaint by&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
reviewing the customer issues</li>
		<li>
listening to relevant call recordings (mandatory)</li>
		<li>
reviewing whether the agency’s service commitments have been met</li>
		<li>
providing any required feedback to their staff</li>
		<li>
finalising the Level 1 complaint, and</li>
		<li>
documenting their investigation</li>
		<li>
calling the customer if a call back has been requested</li>
		</ul>
<p>The Team Leader will record the following information into the Level 1 complaint notepad&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Date Reviewed</strong> - date the call recording was reviewed</li>
		<li>
<strong>Person completing</strong> - team leader first name/team/site</li>
		<li>
<strong>Feedback provided</strong> - yes/no</li>
		<li>
<strong>Outcome Summary</strong> - either upheld or not upheld and any comments</li>
		</ul>
<p>Once all issues have a remedy and outcome the owning Team Leader who has the <strong>Step 1 Complaint</strong> intray finalises the complaint in Cuba.</p>

<p>Child Support is committed to ensuring customers receive the best service possible. Complaints can help business areas within Child Support to improve the services provided. Resolving a person’s complaint is not the last step in the process. The complaint may point to a systemic or administrative problem within a business area or the customer may suggest ways to improve child support legislation or policy.</p>

<p>Systemic issues are those that affect customer service delivery for multiple Child Support customers. Systemic issues relate to internal or external policies, procedures or legislation that affects Child Support service outcomes or work practices or tools that do not support positive service outcomes.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Discuss any potential systemic issue identified from the complaint with the Team Leader. Send an email to Multicultural and Tailored Services Branch Systemic Issues with the subject line 'Systemic Issue Notification' to advise of the system issue. Provide a summary of the identified issue and customer details in the email</li>
