	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Service Officers should determine eligibility for CrP-NHE by assessing&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
answers given in the claim </li>
		<li>
evidence of a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test or result uploaded by the customer (negative or positive result) </li>
		<li>
evidence the customer has reported the positive rapid antigen test (RAT) result to the appropriate health registry in their state or territory and the date of the test was on or after 13 January 2022 </li>
		<li>
evidence of bank balance as proof of financial hardship (<strong>only needed </strong>if the customer updated bank balance details in their claim) </li>
		</ul>
<p>Determine if the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>was required</strong> by the Commonwealth, a state/territory government or a health professional to quarantine/self-isolate, or</li>
		<li>
needs to care for an immediate family member, or member of their household, who <strong>was required</strong> to quarantine/self-isolate </li>
		<li>
had a COVID-19 PCR test <strong>or</strong> has returned a positive RAT</li>
		<li>
has previously been paid CrP-NHE for the same event</li>
		<li>
is in financial hardship (customers <strong>do not need</strong> to provide proof of financial hardship if the bank balance details were not updated in their claim)</li>
		<li>
has claimed CrP-NHE within 14 days after the start of the quarantine or isolation period. The 14 day claim period may be met by contacting Services Australia about a claim in that period and making a claim within 14 days after the contact day</li>
		<li>
for test dates on or between 1 July 2022 and 19 July 2022 refer to special <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-20032726-01.html#bp01_L2GT_Deemed_claim_pr">deemed claim provisions</a> apply</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong></p>

<p>People who have had a COVID-19 PCR test must quarantine/self-isolate while they wait for their results, even if they live in an area without any active cases and even if the PCR result is negative. This requirement entitles the person to CrP-NHE if all other eligibility criteria are met after having a PCR test. Customers undergoing a RAT are only eligible to CrP-NHE if the test is positive, as the result is instantaneous, and confirms the requirement to self-isolate.</p>

<p>Some people may need to quarantine/isolate more than once after multiple COVID-19 PCR tests (negative or positive), or positive RAT (even if they were only recently in quarantine/self-isolation).</p>

<p>A person may qualify for a CrP-NHE while in quarantine/self-isolating at home, in a motel/hotel, or any other appropriate place.</p>

<p>A health professional is a doctor, hospital staff or pathology services.</p>

<p>An immediate family member is a partner, child, parent, sibling, grandchild or grandparent of the person.</p>

<p>The period of quarantine or self-isolation can vary depending on the customer's circumstances, for example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a day or more if waiting for COVID-19 PCR test  results</li>
		<li>
14 days if returned from overseas and in mandated quarantine</li>
		<li>
more than 14 days if&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the person is diagnosed with COVID-19 and needs an extra self-isolation period(s) including a positive RAT or PCR</li>
			<li>
the person needs to be retested for COVID-19 and re-enter isolation</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>The following customers<strong> are not eligible</strong> for a CrP-NHE&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
People who are staying home because they have an existing health condition, even if told to do so by a health professional. They are <strong>not</strong> considered to meet the definition of '<strong>required</strong>' to isolate</li>
		<li>
People who are staying home but still able to go out to complete essential activities, such as shopping or work. For example, people in <strong>restricted movement/lock down</strong> who can still leave their homes for essential reasons</li>
		<li>
People self-isolating to prevent getting COVID-19</li>
		<li>
People claiming CrP-NHE to care for a person who is in quarantine/self-isolation in a hospital, as care is being provided by hospital staff</li>
		<li>
A person who is caring for one of the above people</li>
		<li>
A person who has self-tested for COVID-19 using a rapid antigen test and received a negative result</li>
		<li>
A person who has self-tested for COVID-19 using a rapid antigen test and provided only a photo of the test cartridge with an event date from 7 March 2022</li>

a COVID-19 PCR test notification or result (positive or negative), or</li>
		<li>
a positive RAT result reported to the appropriate health registry in their state or territory on or after 13 January 2022</li>

<p>Customers must give evidence of their existing savings account balance/s <strong>only</strong> if they updated these details in the claim.</p>

<p><strong>Determining if COVID-19 test evidence is acceptable&#58;</strong></p>

<p>The evidence can be&#58;</p>

PCR test notification, a screen shot of a text message sent directly to the customer or the person they are caring for from a pathology service, state health service or doctor’s surgery advising that the test was done and the date</li>

PCR test, a screen shot of a text message sent directly to the customer or the person they are caring for from a pathology service, state health service or doctor’s surgery with the test result (positive or negative) and the date</li>
		<li>
scanned document or photo of an ‘attendance certificate’ for a PCR test from a pathology service, state health service or doctor’s surgery with the test date</li>

		<ul>		<li>
If evidence is provided of a PCR test (positive or negative), it must show the date of the test</li>
		<li>
Evidence of reporting a positive RAT from customers in Western Australia will not have a date of test, only the date the test was registered. The self-declaration of the isolation date provided in the claim must be accepted in these cases. All other states and territories include dates relating to the isolation period in the notification. The date (depending on the state or territory) must correspond with the isolation start date stated by the customer in the claim. See the <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-20032726-03.html">Process</a> page for more details </li>
		</ul>
<p>It is not sufficient for a person to give a notice that they need to self-isolate or quarantine. For example, close contact notification. The person, or the person they are caring for, must give evidence that they have been tested and need to self-isolate as a requirement after&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a PCR test (positive or negative), as it is a health requirement to isolate after being PCR tested awaiting results, or</li>
		<li>
reporting a <strong>positive</strong> RAT to the appropriate health registry in their state or territory and being required to self-isolate according to mandated state or territory health requirements</li>
		</ul>
