</DIV>
<P>This document outlines information on provider numbers for health professionals in Medicare.</P>
<DIV class=twisty><A name=bp01_L2GT_Definition_of_a class=anchor></A>
<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_Definition_of_a>Definition of a provider number</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>A provider number is:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Allocated by Services Australia to a registered medical practitioner or non-medical health professional (dentist, optometrist, nurse practitioner or midwife) and identifies the person and their health profession at the practice location/s where the person practises their profession</LI>
<LI>Sometimes referred to as a provider/registration number for allied health professionals</LI>
<LI>Generated by the Provider Directory System (PDS) on processing of an application for a provider number and is allocated from a provider number stack held in the database tables</LI>
<LI><STRONG>not</STRONG> automatically granted with access to Medicare benefits. The issuing of a provider number does not mean the medical practitioner, non-medical health professional or allied health professional is eligible to attract Medicare benefits for their professional services</LI></UL>
<P>The term 'provider number' is used throughout the Medicare Provider Eligibility reference material as relating to the number issued by the agency to identify the health professional in the Medicare PDS system.</P>
<P>A provider number may allow the health professional to either:</P>
<UL>
<LI>refer their patient to another health professional (usually a specialist or consultant physician) or to request diagnostic imaging or pathology services where their patient will be able to claim Medicare benefits at the referred rate, or</LI>
<LI>attract Medicare benefits for their services at particular practice locations or at all practice locations, or</LI>
<LI>both of the above</LI></UL>
<P>Medicare benefit eligibility is determined by the Health Insurance Act 1973 (the Act) and supporting Regulations and Determinations. The <A href="../health-professionals/012-42010010-04.html">References</A> page contains a link to this Act.</P>
<P>To ensure accuracy of advice, refer all enquiries about a health professional's eligibility to access Medicare benefits for their services to Provider Registration staff in the state or territory where the health professional intends to provide services. Only give advice about a health professional's eligibility to the health professional or a third party after a security check is completed.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P></P>
<DIV class=twisty><A name=bp01_L2GT_Provider_number class=anchor></A>
<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_Provider_number>Provider number for each location</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>A health professional must have a provider number for every practice location where they provide services. This policy is supported by the Health Insurance Regulations 2018.</P>
<P>The exception <STRONG>does not</STRONG> apply when they are subject to any restrictions on accessing Medicare benefits. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<DIV class=twisty><A name=bp01_L2GT_Provider_locati class=anchor></A>
<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_Provider_locati>Provider location address</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>A practice address is recorded in PDS and is known as the provider number or provider location address. The address in PDS is available to authorised recipients, including:</P>
<UL>
<LI>private health funds</LI>
<LI>Department of Health</LI>
<LI>Department of Veterans' Affairs</LI></UL>
<P>Recording the correct practice address in PDS allows payment of Medicare incentive items. The incentive payment is linked to the Rural, Remote, and Metropolitan Arear (RRMA) and the Modified Monash Model (MMM) 2019 geographical classification system for the location where the service is performed.</P>
<P>For more information, see <A href="../health-professionals/012-42010020-01.html" target=_blank>Provider location details for health professionals in Medicare</A>.</P>
<P>Legislation requires a claim for a Medicare benefit must include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the name of the health professional and the address of the place of practice, <STRONG>or</STRONG></LI>
<LI>the provider number of the health professional for the practice location</LI></UL>
<P>For more information, see <A href="../your-health/011-43010030-01.html" target=_blank>Account and receipt documents for Medicare claims processing</A>.</P>
<P><STRONG>Use of a home address as the provider number location address</STRONG></P>
<P>Services Australia is unable to suppress a provider number address. Therefore, health professionals should carefully consider using a home address for a provider number, as the provider number location address may be publicly available. For example:</P>
<UL>
<LI>viewable on pay doctor via claimant (PDVC) cheques. <STRONG>Note: </STRONG>health professionals can request a pay group link to direct payment of Medicare benefit cheques to a PO Box address. See <A href="../health-professionals/012-40010000-01.html">Payment pay group link for Medicare benefit cheques</A> for more information and the form required</LI>
<LI>requests for pathology services</LI>
<LI>available to private health funds for the purposes of their business</LI></UL>
<P>Information for health professionals about using a home address as a practice location with the address being publicly available is included in the Application for a Medicare provider number (HW019 and HW093).</P>
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Provider addresses are <STRONG>no longer</STRONG> visible in a patient's myGov or My Health Record claims history, effective February 2021.</P>
<P><STRONG>Requests from health professionals to use an alternative provider location addresses (such as a PO Box)</STRONG></P>
<P>Due to the coronavirus (COVID-19), an increasing number of health professionals are provding COVID-19 specific telehealth services (currently included in the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) until 30 June 2021) from their home address.</P>
<P>Services Australia is aware some health professionals have expressed safety concerns following their move to home-based consultations.</P>
<P>Under the COVID-19 arrangements, health professionals can continue to use their <STRONG>current</STRONG> practice location number and address while delivering telehealth services from home. They do not need to apply for a new provider number.</P>
<P>Services Australia may consider recording an alternative address (such as PO Box), for a health professional where:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the home is the <STRONG>only</STRONG> practice location, and</LI>
<LI>the health professional is only providing telehealth services or mobile consultations</LI></UL>
<P>All health professionals requesting an alternative address <STRONG>must</STRONG>:</P>
<UL>
<LI>submit a signed request, and</LI>
<LI>include the information below the:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>current practice location arrangements. For example, the physical practice is closed due to COVID-19 and only providing telehealth services from the home location</LI>
<LI>reason for using an alternate address. For example, safety concerns</LI>
<LI>proposed alternative address. For example, a PO Box</LI>
<LI>physical practice (home address). This is recorded in the Notes section of PDS</LI></UL></UL>
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> the process for requesting a provider number for a new location, including home addresses, remains the same.</P>
<P><STRONG>Medical or non-medical practitioner requests to use alternative provider location address</STRONG></P>
<UL>
<LI>All requests from medical practitioners and non-medical health professionals are escalated to National Office</LI>
<UL>
<LI>See <A href="../health-professionals/012-42010070-01.html">Provider number registrations in PDS for health professionals in Medicare</A> for information on provider registration enquiry escalations</LI></UL>
<LI>The requests are assessed on a case-by-case basis to ensure legislative requirements are met</LI>
<LI>The use of an alternative location address may affect eligibility with other programs. For example:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS)</LI>
<LI>Prescription Shopping Programme (PSP)</LI>
<LI>Practice Incentives Program (PIP)</LI>
<LI>Workforce Incentive Program (WIP)</LI>
<LI>Australian Immunisation Register (AIR)</LI>
<LI>Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA)</LI></UL></UL>
<P><STRONG>Allied health professional requests to use alternative location address</STRONG></P>
<P>Service Delivery assess requests from allied health professionals. For information on eligibility criteria and process, see <A href="../health-professionals/012-19052715-01.html">Allied health and non-medical professionals provider number applications and requests</A>.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Requests to backdate a provider number may be granted in certain circumstances.</P>
<P>Prior to processing a request to backdate a provider number, the health professional must: </P>
<UL>
<LI>have had current registration, and </LI>
<LI>relevant access to Medicare benefits at the time of the requested location start date</LI></UL>
<P>A request to backdate may be where:</P>
<UL>
<LI>a provider number application is received, requesting a <STRONG>new</STRONG> provider number location start date prior to the date of lodgement, or</LI>
<LI>a written request is received, requesting an <STRONG>existing</STRONG> provider number location start date be amended prior to existing start date </LI></UL>
<P>A written request can be:</P>
<UL>
<LI>an email, providing the email is received from the email address recorded on the stem in PDS</LI>
<LI>a letter signed by the health professional</LI></UL>
<P>If the health professional <STRONG>meets</STRONG> these requirements, the Service Officer can start/backdate the location as per the application or written request. National Office approval is <STRONG>not </STRONG>required. There is no restriction on how far a provider number can be backdated if the health professional meets these requirements.</P>
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> due to COVID-19 requests to backdate can be processed via the phone, under the following conditions:</P>
<UL>
<LI>a security check has been performed successfully</LI>
<LI>provider is eligible and is unrestricted from the requested start date (add note to stem)</LI></UL>
<P>If the health professional <STRONG>does not</STRONG> meet the above requirements, the start date of the location should be:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the date the health professional held current registration, or </LI>
<LI>the date when the relevant access is required</LI></UL>
<P>The above process <STRONG>does not apply</STRONG> for locations with <STRONG>3GA placements</STRONG> or for medical practitioners subject to <STRONG>section19AB of the Act</STRONG>. Follow current processing requirements for these health professionals.</P>
<P>For assistance with backdating requests contact a Programme Support Officer (PSO)</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
