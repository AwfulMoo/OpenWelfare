<p>Determine the likely care period. A care period is generally the 12 month period starting from the <a href="../separated-parents/277-03060010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Gather_informat_Step03">date of event</a>.</p>

<p>In some circumstances, a shorter or longer care period may be appropriate. Assess each case on its own merits.</p>

<p><strong>Care periods longer than 12 months</strong></p>

<p>A care period of more than 12 months may be appropriate where there is a care arrangement in place that follows a cycle over a period greater than 12 months, for example every 2 years. For more information see <a href="../separated-parents/277-03060010-04.html">References</a> for a link to the Child Support Guide 2.2.1&#58; Basics of care and <a href="../separated-parents/277-03040010-05.html#bp05_L3TT_Care_period_12_">Example - Calculate care period 12 months and over</a> table in Notification of change in child support care (post 1 July 2010). </p>

For example, one customer is to increase their care by 1 day per week every 3 months over the upcoming period.

		<li>
a carer has unexpectedly gained 100% care of a child for a temporary period (generally 4 weeks minimum). The agency will determine the care over a short care period related to the unexpected circumstance and make a one-off block of 100% care determination. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-03040010-05.html#bp05_L3TT_Care_period_sho01">Example - Calculate care period shorter than 12 months - one-off block of 100% care</a> table in Notification of change in child support care (post 1 July 2010).

<p>Ask the customer for the pattern of care based on what they expect to occur during the care period. In most cases, the actual care each customer has determines the percentage of care. If satisfied a pattern established in the past will continue, use that pattern to determine care for the care period.</p>

<p>Questions that may assist in determining the likely percentage of care include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Have they and the other customer established a pattern of care for the child?</li>
		<li>
Is the other carer likely to agree that these are the new care arrangements?</li>
		<li>
How many nights do they and the other customer expect to care for the child/ren during the care period?</li>
		<li>
How did they calculate the expected care?</li>
		<li>
Do they or the other carer provide care other than in nights? For example, are they a shift worker or do they provide extensive care during the day but little or no overnight care? For more information see <a href="../separated-parents/277-03060010-04.html">References</a> for a link to the Child Support Guide 2.2.1&#58; Basics of care&#58; Care other than in nights</li>
		<li>
Is the care set out in a written care arrangement? For example, court order, parenting plan or written agreement. If so, what is the commencement date of the written care arrangement?</li>
		<li>
Do they have a co-signed FA012 form, or have both customers provided the same details in separate forms? If so, and no details/discrepancies need clarification and the signatures can be verified accept the form/s without any pre-decision contact as care is considered to be agreed</li>
		<li>
If care is not occurring in accordance with a written care arrangement, are either they or the other customer trying to enforce the care set out in the care arrangement?</li>
		<li>
If so, what actions have been taken to enforce this to date? See <a target="_blank" href="../utils/CustomerReferralGuidelines/Customer-Referral-Guidelines.html">Customer Referral Guidelines</a> to determine if a disputed care referral is appropriate</li>		</ul>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; if a Centrelink or mutual customer reports or confirms a reduced level of care for themselves action immediately in Customer First. Create a ‘preliminary care’ record to prevent an overpayment. Recording preliminary care is not a care decision, see <a href="../families/007-02040020-01.html">Notification and Assessment of shared care arrangements for Family Tax Benefit (FTB)</a>. The change of care can only be finalised in Cuba once the change in care determination process is finalised and processed in Customer First.</p>

<p><strong>Special rounding rules</strong></p>

<p>Special rounding rules apply to the calculation of care percentages. To manually calculate the percentage of care divide the number of nights the customer has care of the child in the care period by the total number of nights in the care period and multiply by 100. For example, if the care period is 12 months, divide the number of nights of care by 365 and multiply by 100. To ensure the total care percentage equals 100%, if the final percentage of care figure is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
below 50%, round the number down to the next whole percentage</li>
		<li>
50% or more, round the number up to the next whole percentage</li>
		</ul>
<p>See <a href="../separated-parents/277-03040010-05.html#bp05_tbl_Applying_specia_Item">Example - Percentage of care (special rounding rules)</a> table in Notification of change in child support care (post 1 July 2010) for more information.</p>

<p>To apply the special rounding rules&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
in Cuba, key the number of nights into the Care window to automatically calculate the percentage of care used in the assessment. For customers with a care percentage of 50% each, record the payee as having 50% care, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-30010060-01.html">Care Cuba Process Help</a>. Do not record as a number of nights. Where care is entered as 50% to the payee, Cuba will automatically change payee to 51% care and the other party to 49% care. The 'Care Reported as 50%' checkbox will be automatically ticked and a care percentage of 50% will be transferred to mutual customer family assistance assessments</li>
		<li>
in Customer First, see <a href="../families/007-02040020-01.html">Notification and assessment of shared care arrangements for Family Tax Benefit (FTB)</a> to code the care change</li>
		<li>
for principal carer assessment purposes only round up percentages between 45.1 and 45.9 to 46%. See <a href="../families/007-02050000-01.html">Shared care for social security payments</a></li>

<strong>Interim care determinations</strong> – when care changes within an interim care period a new care determination cannot take effect until after the interim care period ends. If&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
a care determination would otherwise take effect within the interim period, it will take effect from the day after the interim care period ends</li>
			<li>
the care changes after the interim period but within the maximum interim period, it will take effect from the date of notification</li>
			<li>
the customers make a new written care arrangement, and actual care is in line with that arrangement, make a new decision based on that written care arrangement. This exception applies to both Child Support and Centrelink assessments</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Below regular care determinations</strong> – when a below regular care determination is made and Services Australia was advised within a reasonable period of time, the care determination takes effect from either&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the date a customer ceased a pattern of care or</li>
			<li>
the date a pattern of care is first used in the assessment </li>

		<li>
<strong>WA Ex-nuptial children</strong> – If the change occurred prior to 1 July 2018 and the notification date is outside 28 days and prior to 15 May 2019 the effective date is the date of notification</li>
		<li>
<strong>Reconciliation</strong> – where care is updated for a relevant dependent or ‘Claimed For’ child because an assessment is suspended upon reconciliation or reinstated due to separation see <a href="../separated-parents/277-03110000-01.html">Suspension of child support liability on reconciliation</a></li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Terminating Events</strong></p>

<p>When a change in care causes a terminating event, the assessment will end from the date the care changed. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-03060010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Determine_likel_Step07">Step 7</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; before 1 July 2018 a child moving from the care of 1 party to the assessment to another was not a terminating event. The assessment was amended to reflect the new care percentage from the date of notification.</p>

<p><strong>Payment of arrears for FTB customers</strong></p>

<p>Generally, date of effect for FTB customers will occur from the date the care changed. However where arrears are payable, the date of effect can be no earlier than 1 July of the financial year before the financial year in which the determination is made.
