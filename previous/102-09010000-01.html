<P>When a customer is a <STRONG>notification reporter</STRONG> and starts work, whether full-time, part time, casual, on-call, etc., they must advise Services Australia within 14 days .They can also advise up to 30 days before being paid by their employer. Notification reporters will be automatically changed to 2 weekly statement reporters when:</P>
<UL>
<LI>they commence work with an employer who reports income via Single Touch payroll (STP), and</LI>
<LI>the STP data is received from the employer</LI></UL>
<P>When a customer is a <STRONG>statement reporter</STRONG> and starts work, whether full time, part-time, casual, on-call, etc, they must advise on their Entitlement Period End Day (EPED) of any paid employment income. They may advise in advance that they will be starting work but must still report their paid gross employment income on their reporting day.</P>
<P>If a customer has worked but not yet been paid, they must report the hours they worked in their reporting period, but are not required to report any employment income until this is paid.</P>
<P>Service Officers must ensure during this contact, they discuss the importance of reporting correctly.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<P>Any employment income a customer is paid may affect their payments under the appropriate Income Test. When the customer has employment income:</P>
<UL>
<LI>if <STRONG>under Age Pension age</STRONG> - Working Credits or Income Bank may enable the customer to <A href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07020000-01.html">keep some of their income support payment while they are working</A></LI>
<LI>if <STRONG>over Age Pension age</STRONG> - and in receipt of a pension (excluding Parenting Payment Single) they may be entitled to the <A href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010130-01.html">Work Bonus</A>. <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> the Work Bonus is not used in the customer's transitional rules calculation, however the Work Bonus will still be used in the comparison calculations and partners may still benefit by the reduction in total income</LI>
<LI>if a customer, who is in receipt of an income support payment, <STRONG>reduces their fortnightly rate to nil</STRONG> and some of that income is employment income, the customer's payment may <A href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010160-01.html">remain current at nil rate for up to six fortnights</A> <STRONG>and</STRONG> they may retain certain benefits as long as they still remain qualified for the income support payment</LI>
<LI>Customers under the age of 25 and in receipt of Youth Allowance (YA) (other) or JobSeeker Payment (JSP) who are placed in employment by their jobactive provider may be eligible for the Youth Bonus Wage Subsidy (YBWS) initiative. At either the completion of the employment income nil rate period or if they cease to qualify for YA (other) or JSP for an employment related reason, the <A href="../job-seekers/001-17030800-01.html">YBWS customer will commence a 26 week suspension period</A></LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<P>Before cancelling a customer's payment, care must be taken to establish the customer no longer meets the qualification and/or payability provisions for their current income support payment. Any entitlement to Working Credit, Income Bank or the Work Bonus may enable the customer to keep some of their income support payment while they are working. If the customer's income reduces their fortnightly rate to nil and some of that income is from employment, the customer may <A href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010160-01.html">remain current at nil rate for up to six fortnights and retain certain benefits</A>.

<P>Customers whose employer reports income via Single Touch Payroll (STP) may be contacted by Services Australia to update their current annual income estimate when it does not align with their projected STP annual estimate.</P>
<P>In general, customers who advise they have ongoing full-time work under casual conditions must not be treated as 'casual' if the work is likely to continue for more than 12 weeks.
