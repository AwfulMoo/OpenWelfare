<P>Discuss appropriate options with the applicant to resolve their issues, these may include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>error correction- simple factual errors and some more complex errors can be fixed without the need for an objection</LI>
<LI>complaint - if the customer is unhappy with the service provided rather than the actual decision, lodging a complaint may be a more suitable option. See <A href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-02000000-01.html">Managing customer complaints and feedback</A>.</LI>
<LI>new administrative action- other administrative action such as reviewing a payment arrangement may resolve the customer’s concern </LI>
<LI>new decision- if the customer’s circumstances have changed it may be more appropriate for a new decision to be made</LI>
<LI>change of assessment - if the customer has special circumstances a change of assessment application may be a better option. See <A href="https://guides.dss.gov.au/child-support-guide/2/6">Child Support Guide 2.6: Change of assessment in special circumstances</A></LI></UL>

<P>Explain to the respondent:</P>
<UL>
<LI>an objection has been received from the other parent</LI>
<LI>the decision, subject to the objection</LI>
<LI>the grounds of the objection</LI>
<LI>they will receive a copy of the objection and will be made aware of any new information provided by the applicant</LI>
<LI>the applicant may withdraw their objection at any time before the decision has been finalised</LI>
<LI>possible outcomes, including potential contrary or adverse decision</LI>
<LI>they are encouraged to provide a response either verbally or in writing as quickly as possible but have 28 days if needed. (90 days for customers in a reciprocating jurisdiction). See <A href="../separated-parents/elements/macros/ExtensionOfTimeCalculator.html">Extension of time calculator macro</A></LI>
<LI>their response and any information provided may be discussed and/or sent to the other customer</LI>
<LI>the respondent can lodge their own objection at any time, however:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>if the respondent objects outside the 28 day timeframe (90 days for customers in reciprocating jurisdictions) they will need to request an extension of time for objection to proceed</LI>
<LI>if the objection is about a care percentage decision (including date of event of a care change) the respondent can object at any time, however if they object outside the 28 (90) day timeframe, any change to the care percentage will only apply to the assessment from the date the objection was lodged, unless there were special circumstances that impacted on the respondent's ability to lodge an objection earlier</LI></UL></UL>

<P><STRONG>Open Exchange of Information (applicant and respondent)</STRONG></P>
<P>Explain to both customers:</P>
<UL>
<LI>when information is used by Child Support to make the decision, it is provided to the other party for comment</LI>
<LI>information is usually exchanged by providing the other party with copies of documents, but information can also be provided verbally if it is more efficient to do so</LI>
<LI>Child Support must exchange information with parties to ensure customers who may be adversely affected by the information, have the opportunity to comment before the decision is made</LI>
<LI>if they do not want the other party to see information provided to Child Support, they should either not include it or delete/edit the specific details from the documents they provide. Deleted information will not be available to the decision maker for consideration when making the decision. The decision will be based on information that was made available to both customers</LI></UL>

<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> a decision maker may become overly familiar with the report and read information into the content that is not there. It may also be harder for the person who wrote the report to pick up errors. Ask a peer or Team Leader to act as a ‘second set of eyes’ to review the report.</P>
