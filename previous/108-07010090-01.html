<p>This document outlines the assessment and coding of paid leave and redundancy payments advised before 19 April 2010. It is for historical purposes and should not be used to assess current paid leave. Leave or redundancy payments received upon termination of employment, or leave payments received while on paid leave from ongoing employment, may affect payability of a customer's Centrelink payment.</p>

This will be for the duration of the period the leave payment covers, for example, 2 weeks paid sick leave.
