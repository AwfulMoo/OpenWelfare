<p>For most post-birth claims, the DOV of the income estimate can remain as the original date used in the online claim. The system will insert the DOV.</p>

<p>This also applies when a coding an FA100 in the Assisted Customer Claim (ACC) workflow. The DOV of the estimate pre-filled by the workflow does <strong>not</strong> have to be changed in most cases.</p>

<p><strong>Example&#58;</strong> Post-birth claim lodged 10 August 2019 for an eligible child who entered care on 2 August 2019. The DOV for the income estimate is 2 August 2019 as this is the latest date between the date the child entered care and 1 July of the current financial year.

<p><strong>Income related cancellation</strong></p>

<p>If a person lodges a claim for FTB after their partner's FTB cancels or rejects due to income (<strong>CAN-INC</strong>, <strong>REJ-INC</strong>), assess the claim based on the claimant's previous FTB circumstances only.</p>

<p>The DOV of the claim estimate will depend on when the partner's FTB cancelled or rejected. If the partner's <strong>CAN-INC</strong> or <strong>REJ-INC</strong> applied&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
on 1 July of the current financial year. the DOV is the <strong>later</strong> of&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
1 July of the current financial year, or</li>
			<li>
date an eligible child entered care</li>		</ul>
		<li>
after 1 July of the current financial year, update the pre-filled DOV to the earliest possible date the claimant can be granted from. This is usually the date the partner's FTB was cancelled</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Example&#58;</strong> Mary's FTB cancelled due to income from 2 Dec 2019. Peter (Mary's partner), lodges an FTB claim on 30 January 2020. Peter has never claimed or been in receipt of FTB. As Mary has already received FTB up to and including 1 December 2019, the earliest date Peter can be granted FTB is 2 December 2019. The DOV of Peter’s claim estimate should be no earlier than his earliest possible date of grant, 2 December 2019.</p>

<p><strong>Non-income related cancellation</strong></p>

<p>If a partner lodges a claim for FTB after a customer’s FTB has been cancelled for a non-income related reason, the DOV of the estimate must be no earlier than the date of grant.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>&#58; Emily’s FTB cancels from 14 October 2019 due to a lone overseas absence. John has never been in receipt of FTB. John claims FTB and is eligible from the date Emily’s FTB had cancelled (14 October 2019). The DOV must be corrected from 1 July 2019 to 14 October 2019.</p>

<p>When correcting the DOV from 1 July to date of grant, the 'E135FI-ISP client's estimate needs Taxable income and Tax Free pension' error may present and stop the claim from being finalised. This will only occur if the customer or their partner was in receipt of an income support payment (ISP) since 1 July and the amount of ISP received from 1 July to cancellation is more than the estimate already recorded for 1 July. In this case, staff must manually process the claim as follows&#58;</p>

<p><strong>For combined FTB/PPL claims</strong>&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Keep a copy of the Review Claim information open from 'Search Online Claims'</li>
		<li>
Cancel the online FTB/PPL NCL on AL</li>
		<li>
Index and manually process the FTB claim, see <a href="../families/007-17092600-01.html">Manual Processing of Family Tax Benefit (FTB) claims</a></li>
		<li>
Reindex the PPL only claim by running Assisted Customer Claim (ACC) and inserting the PPL information from 'Review Claim'. See <a href="../self-service/133-03010070-01.html">Online or Assisted Customer Claim (ACC) for family assistance, Parental Leave Pay (PPL) and Dad and Partner Pay (DAP)</a></li>
		<li>
Once it is finalised, select the claim from 'Search Online Claims' and update the claim status by selecting the <strong>User Status</strong> tab, select <strong>Set New Status</strong> and change to <strong>Completed</strong></li>
		<li>
To monitor the frequency of this workaround, send an email to Families and Child Care - Business Process Branch with the following in the subject line&#58;</li>

<p><strong>New claim lodged</strong></p>

<p>If FTB is eligible for restoration, treat the new claim as a request for restoration of payment.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Process the claim, make sure the date of event (DOV) of the estimate is the date the estimate was provided</li>
		<li>
If the claim activity is applying an incorrect DOV for the income estimate and it cannot be manually changed within the activity, cancel the claim on the <strong>AL</strong> screen and complete a standard BA restoration activity. Make sure&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the DOR is the date the claim was lodged</li>
			<li>
the DOV of the income estimate is the date the estimate was provided</li>
			<li>
any changes advised within the claim are updated inside the restoration activity</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>See <a href="../families/007-07090030-01.html">Restoration of FTB</a> for more information.</p>

<p><strong>Required to lodge a new claim</strong></p>

<p>The date of event of the new estimate must be the lodgement date of the new claim. See <a href="../self-service/133-03010070-01.html">Online or Assisted Customer Claim (ACC) for family assistance, Parental Leave Pay (PPL) and Dad and Partner Pay (DAP)</a>).</p>

<p>If the customer is <strong>eligible for restoration</strong> and&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>FTB CAN-INC is within current financial year</strong></li>
			<ul>			<li>
The DOV of the income estimate is the date of notification of the revised estimate</li>
			<li>
If there is a previous estimate provided for CCS that is <strong>lower</strong> than the most recent estimate provided, FTB arrears may be paying for the CAN-INC period. If arrears are paying, code the FYSO screen for the CAN-INC non-payment period, using Status code CAN and Reason code OTH. This will stop FTB arrears paying for this period. The arrears will be assessed in reconciliation when actual income is confirmed and the customer has lodged a lump sum claim or requested a reassessment within the relevant time frame</li>
			<li>
If there is a previous CCS estimate that is <strong>equal</strong> to or <strong>higher</strong> than the most recent estimate provided, FTB arrears may pay prior to DOR. Identify the reason for the arrears and confirm the customer is entitled before paying. No discussion around payment choices for this period or retrospective correction of estimates is necessary</li>
			<li>
Assessment of the non-payment period from the date of cancellation to the date of restoration cannot be finalised until after the end of the financial year, when actual income is known. See <a href="../families/007-11010100-01.html">Assessment of income cancellation periods in FTB reconciliation</a></li>
			<li>
If the customer is receiving CCS, any change to their subsidy percentage will take effect from the start of the CCS fortnight after the DOV. <a href="../families/007-17103115-01.html">Activity Test details</a> may need updating when a customer has had a change in their income estimate (For example, may have started or ceased work)</li>		</ul>

If the customer receives CCS and the DOV is backdated for FTB, the DOE for CCS will be the start of the CCS fortnight after the DOV</li>
		<li>
A lower estimate may result in an arrears issuing to the customer</li>
		<li>
A higher estimate may result in a potential overpayment</li>
		<li>
Customers can also choose to increase their CCS withholdings to reduce the risk of an overpayment where there has been an increase in their estimate</li>
		<li>
Arrears/overpayments will depend on whether session reports have been received and processed for the past periods</li>
		</ul>
<p><a href="../families/007-17103115-01.html">Activity Test details</a> may also need updating if there is a change in income estimate.</p>

<p><strong>Become partnered</strong></p>

<p>Where a customer advises they have become partnered, either verbally or via a completed Partner Details (MOD P) form&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
FTB is reassessed from the relationship start date to include the partner's income</li>
		<li>
The DOV of the income estimate for the partner is the date they became partnered</li>
		<li>
If the customer chooses to also update their estimate, the DOV for their income estimate is the date of notification</li>
		<li>
FTB will cancel <strong>INP</strong> (income not provided) from the date they became partnered if the partner's estimate is not recorded</li>
		<li>
For CCS the DOV of the income estimate for the partner will be the date they became partnered</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Any change in entitlement will take effect from the start of the next CCS fortnight (Monday) after the DOV. Treat the customer as single during the CCS fortnight when they partnered. If the customer becomes partnered on the start of a CCS fortnight, it will take effect from that date</li>
			<li>
Activity Test details must be provided for the partner, using the date they became partnered as the DOV. Customer’s details may also need updating if they have had a change in their income estimate. See <a href="../families/007-17103115-01.html">Activity Test for CCS</a></li>
			<li>
The Date of Receipt (DOR) for CCS activity test details updated in Process Direct must be the date the customer advised they became partnered. This is especially important where the activity test update occurs on a different date to the marital status update completed in Customer First</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; if both the customer and partner got FTB before becoming partnered, and they do not want to be paid as a blended family, see <a href="../families/007-03030090-03.html">FTB or CCS customer becomes partnered</a> for how to code the care details.</p>

<p><strong>Separated</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
FTB is reassessed from the relationship end date to exclude the partner's income</li>
		<li>
If the customer chooses to update their estimate, the DOV for the income estimate is the date of notification</li>
		<li>
Do not code nil income for the ex-partner, their income is still taken into account until customer and partner records are unlinked</li>
		<li>
CCS is reassessed from the start of the next CCS fortnight (Monday) after the date they separated (DOV)&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Treat the customer as partnered during the CCS fortnight when they separated. If the customer separates on the start of a CCS fortnight, it will take effect from that date</li>
			<li>
The customer’s <a href="../families/007-17103115-01.html">Activity Test details</a> may also have to be updated where they have had a change in their income estimate</li>			</ul>			</ul>
