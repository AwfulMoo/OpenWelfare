	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Locum arrangements occur where a locum-tenens (locum) tenders a service on behalf of another health professional.</p>

<p>A locum is a health professional who temporarily fulfils the duties on behalf of a health professional in a practice. It is each locum's responsibility to ensure that their provider number is used on patient accounts.</p>

<p>It is an offence to use another health professional's allocated number.</p>

<p>Where a locum practices for more than 2 weeks or is at a practice for less than 2 weeks but on a regular basis, the locum should apply for a provider number for the relevant location.</p>

<p>Where either a&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
general practitioner (GP) acts as a locum for a specialist, or consultant physician</li>
		<li>
specialist acts as a locum for a consultant physician</li>
		<li>
GP acts as a locum for a principal health professional</li>
		</ul>
<p>The Medicare benefit is only payable at the level appropriate for the qualifications held by the locum, for example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
GP level for GP locum</li>
		<li>
specialist level for a referred service rendered by a specialist</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Account documents</strong></p>

<p>When a locum renders a service on behalf of another health professional, the account documents must indicate it is a locum service either by the word 'Locum' or the letters 'LT' (Locum Tenens).</p>

<p>The account must also include both the&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
locum's name and provider number (and their address if required)</li>
		<li>
name, address and provider number of the doctor on whose behalf the locum is acting</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>PAYP lines</strong></p>

<p>A pay provider (PAYP) line is used when an account indicates that the service(s) was performed by a locum, for example, 'locum' or 'LT'. </p>

<p>A PAYP line must be keyed regardless of whether a paid or unpaid account is involved.</p>

<p>Keying a PAYP line ensures that Medicare benefits are correctly assessed and made payable to the health professional for whom the locum is acting.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> for quality control purposes, locum details must be present for a PAYP line to be keyed.</p>

<p><strong>New referrals</strong></p>

<p>New referrals are not required for acting locums. Referrals to a health professional in the practice are accepted as applying to the locum.</p>

<p><strong>Initial attendance</strong></p>

<p>Medicare benefits are not payable at the initial attendance rate for an attendance by a locum if the health professional being replaced has already performed an initial attendance in respect of the particular instrument of referral.</p>
