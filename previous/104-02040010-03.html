<P><STRONG>Customer contact requirements</STRONG></P>
<P>The objective of escalated complaint management is to speak with the customer. Complaints Officers are required to make a minimum of 3 genuine contact attempts to the complainant, including making:</P>

<LI>further contact attempts on the day of receipt of the complaint if the customer is vulnerable or in hardship</LI>
<LI>a second contact attempt within 48 hours of receipt of the complaint</LI>
<LI>contact attempts within 5 working days if the complaint is received online, in writing or escalated via the Customer Feedback Tool</LI></UL>
<P>To be considered genuine contact attempts Complaints Officers are expected to make the attempts at separate times of the day. This means:</P>
<UL>
<LI>if the first contact attempt is during the morning and is unsuccessful, then the second attempt should be made during the afternoon of the same day and the third on the next business day</LI>
<LI>if the first attempt is during the afternoon and is unsuccessful, the second and third attempts should be done in the morning and afternoon of the next business day</LI></UL>
<P>If phone contact is unsuccessful the Complaints Officer is required to:</P>
<UL>
<LI>send a 'please contact request' to the customer:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>providing the customer with a timeframe to respond (10 working days), and</LI>
<LI>advising the complaint will be finalised with the information at hand if the customer does not call back within the required timeframe</LI></UL>
<LI>attach a copy of the 'please contact request' letter to the Customer Feedback Tool entry</LI>
<LI>make another attempt to contact the customer on the due date of the 'please contact request' letter</LI></UL>

<P>Personalised Services provides tailored services and support to customers to help them manage their affairs with reduced conflict and/or aggression, to eliminate unnecessary customer contact via other channels, and to reduce the costs associated with repeat unnecessary customer contact.</P>
<P>Personalised Services provides ongoing management to customers who have shown they need a high level of ongoing support, such as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>highly complex needs</LI>
<LI>a history of unreasonable complainant behaviour including vexatious or frequent complaints, ongoing demands or disputes with the department</LI>
<LI>a history of aggressive behaviour, where other customer management strategies (such as <A href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-07050000-01.html" target=_blank>Managed Service Plan (MSP)</A>, <A href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-07050060-01.html" target=_blank>One Main Contact (OMC)</A> servicing arrangements etc.) have not resulted in behavioural change</LI></UL>
<P>Consider making a referral to Personalised Services when:</P>
<UL>
<LI>complex issues or behaviours mean the customer would benefit from a collaborative approach to complex case management</LI>
<LI>persistent and unreasonable complainant behaviour is having a negative impact on the customer, business and staff</LI>
<LI>a privacy breach has occurred and due to the nature of the breach a referral may assist the customer</LI>
<LI>a high level of support is required to assist a vulnerable customer.</LI>
<LI>the customer has a history of escalating issues with the department and a Personalised Services single point of contact will restrict the impact on the broader business</LI></UL>
<P>To refer the customer to Personalised Services:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Centrelink complaints staff - discuss with the Complaints Officer's Manager and if approved complete the Personalised Services Centrelink Trial Referral Form, see 'I want to' Refer a customer to Centrelink Personalised Services available on the Customer complaints and feedback management page</LI>
<LI>Medicare complaints staff - discuss the proposed referral with the Complaints Officer's Manager who will discuss this referral with the Child Support Personalised Services Program Manager for assessment.
