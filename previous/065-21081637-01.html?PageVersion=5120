		<div class="block">

<p>As part of the 2021-22 Budget, the Australian Government announced a new aged care reform package. The Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety identified a need for a face-to-face presence to further support customers to access the aged care services they need and navigate the system. The reform package builds an aged care system that provides high quality and safe care for older Australians.</p>

<p>The <strong>Connecting Senior Australians to Aged Care Services budget measure</strong> was introduced to further help older Australians understand, access, and navigate aged care services. Services Australia introduced an aged care face-to-face general service offer in October 2021. This complements the existing aged care means assessment service offer. </p>

<p>The key deliverables of the budget measure include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>My Aged Care General Service Offer&#58; </strong>all staff in face-to-face and aged care telephony roles provide this service. Older Australians, their carers or nominees who need support can access digital assistance and basic aged care information</li>
		<li>
<strong>Aged Care Specialist Officers&#58;</strong> customers who need more specialised support, or who prefer face-to-face services, have access to an <a href="../older-australians/065-21081646-01.html">Aged Care Specialist Officer (ACSO)</a> in some service centres. By December 2022, ACSOs will be available in 70 service centres across Australia, along with 10 additional outreach officers for customers in rural or remote areas. Staff can book an appointment with an ACSO or where there is no ACSO available in the customer’s location, warm transfer them to the My Aged Care contact centre</li>
		<li>
<strong>Warm transfers&#58;</strong> Services Australia and My Aged Care contact centres are linked so customers can be warm transfer customers between the two services. My Aged Care Contact Centre staff do not have access to the Centrelink booking system therefore are unable to book customers into an appointment with an ACSO</li>

<p>The Commonwealth Home Support Programme (CHSP) helps senior Australians access entry-level support services to live independently and safely at home. It also provides respite services to give carers a break. </p>

<p>The program aims to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
help people live as independently as possible</li>
		<li>
focus on working with them, rather than doing things for them</li>
		<li>
give a small amount of help to a large number of people.</li>
		</ul>
<p>Most people want to stay at home for as long as possible. To support this, the government subsidises a range of in-home aged care services, including&#58;</p>

help around the house</li>
		<li>
transport</li>
		<li>
meals</li>

		<div class="block">

<p>A home care package (HCP) enables older Australians access to affordable care at home. HCPs are designed for those with more complex care needs that go beyond what the Commonwealth Home Support Programme can provide.</p>

<p>There are no minimum age requirements for eligibility purposes. However persons under age 65, will need to provide evidence that there are no other options available for their support.</p>

<p>There are no citizenship, visa or residency restrictions on accessing the HCP Program. However, the packages are not intended for visitors to Australia or people requiring temporary or short-term care.</p>

<p>Eligibility for home care packages is determined through a comprehensive assessment using the National screening and Assessment form. The Aged Care Assessment Team (ACAT) undertakes comprehensive assessments. </p>

<p>If approved, the customer will receive a letter telling them  the outcome of their assessment and that they are part of the National Prioritisation System. Allocation to the system does not automatically assign a customer to a home care package.</p>

<p>Residential aged care is provided in aged care homes on a permanent or respite (short-term) basis. It is for people who need more care than can be provided in their own homes. Services include personal care, accommodation, laundry and meals, nursing, and some allied health services.</p>

<p>Both the Australian Government and contributions from residents fund residential aged care. The Australian Government pays subsidies and supplements to approved providers for each resident.</p>

<p>All residents can be asked to pay a basic daily fee set at 85 per cent of the single basic age pension. Some residents also pay a means-tested care fee based on an assessment of their income and assets. Some residents will have their accommodation costs paid in full or in part by the Australian Government, but those with greater means are required to pay the accommodation price (formerly known as a bond) agreed with the aged care home.</p>

<p>For more in depth information on Aged Care homes, an appointment should be booked with an ACSO or warm transfer to My Aged Care.</p>

<p>Indigenous Australians can also receive flexible care. The National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Flexible Aged Care Program makes grants to services that provide culturally appropriate residential and home care for Indigenous Australians, mainly in rural and remote areas.</p>
