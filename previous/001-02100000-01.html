<p>The New Enterprise Incentive Scheme (NEIS) of Training and Assistance. The programme aims to help eligible job seekers start and run their own small businesses by providing&#58;</p>

accredited small business training</li>
		<li>
business advice, and</li>
		<li>
mentoring for up to 52 weeks</li>
		</ul>
<p>If eligible, NEIS Allowance may be paid for up to 39 weeks.</p>

<p>NEIS is administered by the Department of Education, Skills and Employment and is delivered by specialist providers who have expertise in small business planning and development.

<p>Job seekers contact Services Australia regarding NEIS participation. If the job seeker is already connected to an employment services provider, the Service Officer should refer them to their jobactive or Disability Employment Services (DES) provider for information.</p>

<p>Job seekers who are not in receipt of an income support payment with mutual obligation requirements can directly enquire and register with a NEIS provider in their local area. Job seekers can search for NEIS providers in their area on the jobactive website.</p>

<p>NEIS Training is delivered by Registered Training Organisations (RTOs) and helps job seekers achieve a nationally accredited qualification. Depending on the type of small business the job seeker is planning, the NEIS provider will refer them to either a&#58;</p>

During the training, the job seeker will develop a NEIS Business Plan. NEIS Allowance is not paid to the job seeker during the 13 weeks of NEIS Training (also known as NEIS pre-training) and they will remain eligible for any income support payment they were previously receiving</li>

<p>NEIS Training is an approved full-time activity and meets the short course guidelines for the <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-08050000-01.html">Education Entry Payment (EdEP)</a>.

<p>Participants can receive NEIS Allowance for the first 39 weeks of business operation during this mentoring (NEIS Assistance) phase. The amount of NEIS Allowance payable will not be affected by income from the job seeker's NEIS business.</p>

<p>Most NEIS participants transfer from their income support payment to NEIS Allowance when they commence in NEIS, after they complete NEIS pre-training.</p>

<p>Certain job seekers may be entitled to a higher rate of income support than that paid under NEIS Allowance, for example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
JobSeeker Payment (JSP) and Special Benefit (SpB) job seekers who are single with a dependent child</li>
		<li>
JSP, SpB and Youth Allowance (YA) single principal carers with long term automatic exemptions</li>
		<li>
JSP and SpB job seekers aged 60 and over, who have been in receipt of an income support payment for more than 9 continuous months, and</li>
		<li>
JSP and SpB job seekers who are assessed as either 'Illness Separated', 'Respite Care Couple' or 'Partner in gaol'</li>
		</ul>
<p>These job seekers, if they have no affecting income, should be eligible to continue to receive a partial rate of their income support payment on top of their NEIS Allowance after the dollar for dollar reduction. The partial rate paid by Services Australia should be paid as a manual rate and is subject to the income and assets test. If these job seekers also receive employment income, they may be eligible for Working Credit.</p>

<p>Customers in receipt of&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Carer Payment (CP)</li>
		<li>
Age Pension</li>
		<li>
Parenting Payment Single (PPS)</li>

Disability Support Pension (DSP)</li>
		<li>
Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) Partner Service Pension, or</li>

War Widow(er) Pension</li>
		</ul>
<p>can elect to remain on their income support payment while participating in NEIS, up to the maximum of 52 weeks, providing all other pension/payment and NEIS eligibility criteria are met. Alternatively, they may elect to receive the NEIS Allowance and a partial rate of their income support payment.</p>

<p>NEIS rental assistance is available for up to 26 weeks if eligible.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Payment_amount_">Rate of NEIS Allowance</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The amount of NEIS Allowance paid is equivalent to the 'single, 22 and over, with no children' rate of JSP. NEIS Allowance reduces income support on a dollar for dollar basis, meaning NEIS participants are usually no longer entitled to their income support payment.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> job seekers receiving NEIS Allowance cannot obtain <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-09020000-01.html">early release of superannuation</a>. NEIS Allowance is specifically excluded by this legislation. Queries regarding this should be referred to Department of Education, Skills and Employment Services National Customer Service Line.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_NEIS_allowance_">Eligibility for income support after NEIS allowance ceases</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The maximum period that NEIS Allowance is payable to a NEIS participant is 39 weeks. Job seekers complete 52 weeks of NEIS participation, even though the NEIS Allowance ceases after 39 weeks.</p>

<p>As a result, these customers may contact the agency to test their eligibility for an income support payment for the remaining 13 weeks of NEIS Assistance. Provided these job seekers meet all other eligibility requirements, participation in NEIS assistance does not preclude them from income support.</p>

<p>Participation in NEIS fully satisfies mutual obligation requirements for payments such as JobSeeker Payment (JSP). This means the job seeker will not be referred to a provider at new claim, because they are already connected to a NEIS provider and not eligible for other employment services.</p>

<p>See the <a href="../job-seekers/001-02100000-03.html">Process</a> page for coding procedures where a NEIS participant contacts the agency to claim an income support payment, or to have their rate of payment restored to full rate, following the cessation of their NEIS Allowance after 39 weeks. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> the NEIS participant will be prompted by their provider to supply their NEIS Allowance cessation letter as evidence.</p>

<p>NEIS participants who were receiving JSP or Youth Allowance (YA) and whose payment was reduced or cancelled due to receiving the NEIS Allowance, will receive an advice from Department of Education, Skills and Employment to verify that their NEIS Allowance has ceased. Where a JSP or YA customer re-applies for payment after 39 weeks, Service Officers will need to manually zero the NEIS Allowance on the Other Government Payments (<strong>OGP</strong>) screen, and end any manual rate overrides that existed to continue partial rate payments during the 39 weeks of NEIS Allowance.</p>

<p>NEIS participants who were previously receiving AGE, CP, PPS or DSP and whose rate was reduced by NEIS Allowance, will have this automatically zeroed on the <strong>OGP</strong> screen at 39 weeks. Service Officers will not have to manually zero NEIS Allowance for these customers as part of a new claim or to restore payment back to full rate.</p>
