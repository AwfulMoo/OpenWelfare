		<div class="block">

<p>CCS is generally paid to the child care provider and passed onto the customer as a reduced fee entitlement. The rate of entitlement paid during the year is based on an estimate of family income.</p>

<p>CCS reconciliation is an automatic balancing process that compares&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the amount of CCS a person received in a CCS year, based on an estimate of their family's income, to</li>
		<li>
the amount of CCS a person is entitled to, based on their family’s actual income and child care attendance for that CCS year</li>
		</ul>
<p>Reconciliation will result in one of three outcomes&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
top up payment</li>
		<li>
nil adjustment</li>
		<li>
overpayment</li>

<p>Any changes to previously recorded activity test details may also affect a customer’s reconciliation outcome.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The CCS year is not necessarily the same as a financial year. This is because CCS is assessed in fortnightly periods which must start on a CCS Monday and end on a Sunday.</p>

<p>The end of a CCS year is the Sunday of the fortnight containing 30 June.</p>

<p>CCS reconciliation can commence from the 29th day after the end of the CCS year. This is due to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the CCS fortnight assessment, and </li>
		<li>
to allow child care providers enough time to lodge session reports </li>
		</ul>
<p>Reconciliation will only occur for a customer once all the reconciliation requirements are met.</p>

<p><strong>Example&#58;</strong></p>

<p>The <strong>2018-19</strong> CCS year commenced on the 2 July 2018 and ended on Sunday 30 June 2019 with reconciliation commencing  29 July 2019. This was the 29th day after the end of the CCS year.</p>

<p>The <strong>2019-20</strong> CCS year commenced on the 1 July 2019 and ended on the 12 July 2020. Reconciliation for 2019-20 CCS year commenced on 10 August 2020. This was the 29th day after the end of the CCS year.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Reconciliation_01">Reconciliation requirements</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>All CCS customers must meet CCS reconciliation requirements by confirming their taxable income for the CCS year. This includes confirming income for any partners or ex-partners they may have had during the relevant year.</p>

<p>Income can be confirmed in the following ways&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
lodging an Income Tax Return with the Australian Tax Office (ATO), or</li>
		<li>
advising Services Australia they are not required to lodge an Income Tax Return and providing their actual income, or</li>
		<li>
submitting a non-lodgement advice to the ATO, <strong>and</strong> advising actual income to Services Australia even where the income is $0.</li>
		</ul>
<p>The income confirmation requirements apply to <strong>ALL</strong> CCS customers and their partners/ex-partners. Even customers who have received an Income Support Payment (ISP) for the full CCS year <strong>must</strong> still confirm their income with Services Australia before reconciliation can occur.</p>

<p>Reconciliation cannot occur until&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
income for all parties has been confirmed, or</li>
		<li>
an exception is applied for any ex-partners</li>
		</ul>
<p>Time limits apply to the CCS reconciliation process. Penalties apply to customers who do not meet these conditions by the specific deadlines.</p>

<p>CCS cannot be claimed as a lump sum.</p>

<p>Customers who received CCS for at least 1 day in the relevant CCS year will receive reminder letters in November and May of the lodgement year (for example&#58; prior to the 1st deadline) if income confirmation requirements have not been met. Customers will also receive letters in November and May in the extended lodgement year, for example&#58; in the year after the lodgement year, if income requirements remain outstanding after the 1<sup>st</sup> deadline but prior to the 2nd deadline. </p>

<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Annual_Cap"></a>
<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Annual_Cap">Annual Cap</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The amount of CCS payable per child per year was capped if the family’s income estimate exceeded the lower income threshold plus $120,000 in applicable CCS years. There was no cap limit applied if the Adjusted Taxable Income (ATI) is below this amount. </p>

<p>The Annual Subsidy Cap only applied only to CCS payments. Additional Child Care Subsidy (ACCS) payments were not subject to the Annual Subsidy Cap.</p>

<p>There are two different annual cap calculations used at reconciliation where a customer’s relationship status changed during the year&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
One for the 2018-19 CCS reconciliation year, and </li>
		<li>
One for the 2019-20 and 2020-21 CCS reconciliation years</li>
		</ul>
<p>For the 2021-22 CCS year and ongoing, the annual cap was removed.</p>

<p><strong>2018-19 only</strong></p>

<p>If a CCS customer changed relationship status during the financial year, the CCS entitlement was based on the circumstances relevant at the time. That is, for the period of the time they were partnered, their combined ATI and level of activity was used to determine the family’s CCS entitlement. When separated, CCS (including any annual cap) was based on the individual’s ATI and level of activity.</p>

<p>At reconciliation, where a customer was partnered for part of the relevant year, an applicable portion of the partner’s/ex-partner’s/deceased partner’s income was included in the actual annual income used to assess the entire year's annual cap. This was based on the number of CCS fortnights that the customer was partnered in the CCS year. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> a fortnight was counted as part of the partnered period if the customer was partnered for at least 1 day in that fortnight.</p>

<p><strong>2019-20 and 2020-21</strong></p>

<p>For the 2019-20 and 2020-21 CCS years , the way the annual cap was applied during the year did not change, however reconciliation applied a different assessment process. </p>

<p>At reconciliation, customers had different income assessments for different periods, depending on the income and marital status changes that occurred, instead of one income assessment across the whole CCS year. This meant the annual cap may have applied only to certain periods in 2019-20 and 2020-21. The annual cap did not apply to any fortnights where the ATI was less than the annual cap threshold. If different income assessments were used in separate periods such as during marital status changes, the annual cap  only applied where the combined ATI exceeds the annual cap threshold for that specific period.</p>

<p>During periods where the income was above the annual threshold, there will be no entitlement once the total amount of CCS received exceeded the annual cap amount. </p>

<p><strong>2021-22 and ongoing</strong></p>

<p>From 10 December 2021, the CCS annual cap for the 2021/22 financial year (1 July 2021 - 30 June 2022) onwards has been removed. Families who reached the annual cap prior to 10 December 2021 were paid any CCS entitlement owed to them in December 2021. </p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Families may still be subject to the annual cap for financial years prior to the 2021/22 financial year.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Additional_Chil">Additional Child Care Subsidy (ACCS) and reconciliation</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>CCS reconciliation does not apply to any period where Additional Child Care Subsidy (ACCS) is paid for a child, unless the result is that the customer is ineligible for CCS (meaning the customer is also ineligible for ACCS).</p>

<p>ACCS customers are still required to meet CCS income requirements. Any debts raised at reconciliation for a period where a customer was ACCS current will be related to qualification not reconciliation.</p>

<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Deadlines"></a>
<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Deadlines">Deadlines</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p><strong>1st Deadline</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
1 year after the end of the relevant income year (midnight 30 June or if this falls on a weekend, midnight of the first business day after), or </li>
		<li>
the agreed extension date (where a special circumstance extension has been granted)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> on 30 June 2020, the Department of Education, Skills and Employment (DESE) announced that the 1st deadline date for 2018-19 financial year would be extended until 31 March 2021. This is to allow customers who have not met their CCS reconciliation requirements for 2018-19 to retain their CCS entitlement until 5 April 2021.</p>

<p>This means that for the 2018-19 financial year, customers have until 31 March 2021 to meet their reconciliation requirements for CCS. This extension only applies to CCS and does not apply to FTB or for ATO lodgement requirements for the 2018-19 financial year.</p>

<p>If the reconciliation requirements are not met by the 1st deadline, (for example either the customer, partner or ex-partner have not confirmed their income for the relevant year), CCS and ACCS (with the exception of ACCS (Child Wellbeing) will reduce to a zero percent (0%), but remain current from the first CCS Monday after the 1st deadline review date. This means the customer will lose all entitlements and will be liable to pay full child care fees from that CCS Monday. ACCS (Child Wellbeing) will continue to be paid.</p>

<p>In addition, all weeks with CCS only payments made during that relevant year will be calculated as an undetermined debt. Recovery of the debt, however will be temporarily paused until the 2nd deadline. ACCS periods of payment per child are not included in this debt amount.</p>

<p>Customers will be notified of the calculated potential overpayment and advised that if they do not meet the reconciliation requirements by the 2<sup>nd</sup> deadline, they will be required to repay all CCS received for the relevant year.</p>

<p>If a customer meets their relevant year reconciliation requirements between the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> deadline dates, they will not be eligible for any backdated payment for periods assessed as zero percent (0%). CCS will only recommence from the first CCS Monday after the reconciliation requirements were met. The calculated non-lodger debt will also be reverted to zero and reconciliation will automatically occur for the relevant year.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when 30 June falls on a weekend, the deadline moves to midnight of the next available working day.</p>

<p><strong>2nd Deadline</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
2 years after the end of the relevant income year (midnight 30 June or if this falls on a weekend, midnight of the first business day after), or </li>
		<li>
the agreed extension end date, where an extension has been granted</li>
		</ul>
<p>For example, if CCS was paid during the 2018-19 financial year, the 2nd deadline is midnight 30 June 2021.</p>

<p>If a customer fails to meet all the income requirements by the 2<sup>nd</sup> deadline, CCS and ACCS (including ACCS (Child Wellbeing)) will cancel from the first CCS Monday after this date and all CCS paid during the relevant year will be raised as a recoverable debt.</p>

<p><strong>Confirming income after 2nd deadline</strong></p>

<p>A customer can still confirm income after the 2nd deadline to meet income requirements for the relevant year. </p>

<p>Once the income requirements for the relevant year have been met, CCS will be reconciled. The status of the recoverable debt will be changed to, Finalised No Debt (FND). If the customer or the partner / ex-partner (where applicable) confirm their income after the 2nd deadline they will be assessed as a late lodger.</p>

<p>For CCS late lodgers the reconciliation will result in&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Any CCS withholdings amounts for the relevant financial year not being paid. However, if the reconciliation results in a debt, the withholdings may be used to offset the debt amount</li>
		<li>
If the customer has a previous year CCS, CCB or CCR debt, top ups or withholdings will not be used to offset that debt</li>
		<li>
Any top ups not being paid where this is the overall reconciliation result</li>
		<li>
A debt where customers have been overpaid</li>
		<li>
Zero outcome if the customer received the correct entitlement during the year</li>
		</ul>
<p>If a customer has been granted an extension to the 2nd deadline and meets income requirements before the end of the extended period, the customer will be entitled to receive any top ups or withholdings for the relevant financial year. </p>

<p><strong>Reclaiming CCS after the 2nd deadline</strong></p>

<p>A customer cannot reclaim CCS again until they meet all the CCS income requirements for outstanding financial years. </p>

<p>The new CCS claim can only be backdated to the later of&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the date the customer met all the CCS income requirements, or</li>
		<li>
by using the 28 day backdating rules</li>
		</ul>
<p>The customer must also have either&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
repaid the outstanding debt or </li>
		<li>
have an adequate debt repayment plan in place<br>(noting the general debt hierarchy rules apply, where the customer may have to pay off an older debt for another payment before they commence repaying the CCS debt)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the granting of the CCS new claim, as long as the customer is entitled to more than 0%, will meet this requirement as the customer will have automatic debt withholdings applied.</p>

<p><strong>Legislative changes have been introduced to the way income is reconciled, where a customer was not partnered for the full CCS year. Because of this change, there will be two different calculation types used for the actual income in the reconciliation calculation. One for the 2018-19 CCS reconciliation year and one for 2019-20 CCS reconciliation year and ongoing. See below for the differences between the two.2018-19 CCS year</strong></p>

<p>If partnered for part of the 2018-19 year, an applicable proportion of the partner’s/ex-partner’s/deceased partner’s income was included in the actual income used to reconcile CCS for the full year. This was based on the number of CCS fortnights in the CCS year that the customer was partnered. A fortnight was counted as part of the partnered period if the customer was partnered for at least one day of the fortnight.</p>

<p>Example&#58; a customer who was partnered for 1 month of the relevant financial year (this period covers 3 fortnights in the CCS year), would have 11.54% (3/26x100 = 11.54%) of their ex-partners actual income applied to the full CCS year at reconciliation.</p>

<p>If the customer's partner died during the relevant financial year, the apportioning assessment also includes annualised actual income of the deceased partner for the period they were a couple.</p>

<p>The <a href="../families/007-19022123-05.html">Resources</a> page contains scenarios and examples.</p>

<p><strong>2019-20 CCS year and ongoing</strong></p>

<p>If the CCS customer is not partnered for the full 2019-20 CCS year, the treatment of income will be different for the 2019-20 reconciliation and ongoing. The customer will have separate income assessment periods according to whether they were single or partnered at the time. The percentage applied to each of these periods at reconciliation will be based on ATI for&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
only the customer’s individual income during single periods</li>
		<li>
the combined family income during partnered periods</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the change in relationship status occurred in the middle of a CCS fortnight, the new status will not be applied until the following CCS Monday. For example, a customer advising of a separation which occurred on October 10th 2019, would be treated as partnered until October 20th, the last Sunday of the CCS fortnight.</p>

<p>If the CCS customer or their partner has died during the year, the deceased individual’s ATI will be annualised but only applied to the period the two were partnered. This also means the CCS customer will have separate assessment periods instead of one percentage applied to the whole year at reconciliation. </p>

<p>If a partner has died within the year and the income is annualised, a comparison will be made between the annualised amount and the estimated amount. Reconciliation will complete based on the most favourable outcome of these two figures.</p>

<p>If the customer is prevented from meeting income requirements by the 1st and/or 2nd deadlines due to exceptional and unforeseen circumstances, an extension to confirm income can be requested.</p>

<p>Special circumstances are only to be granted in limited situations that are&#58;</p>

The 1st deadline can be extended up to 12 months only. It cannot be extended past 30 June of the year after the end of the relevant income year, (where 30 June falls on a weekend or public holiday, the next available business day). If an extension is granted the customer will be paid their full entitlement during the extension period.</li>
		<li>
The 2nd deadline may be extended indefinitely, but only for a maximum of six months at each application. If an extension is applied the customer’s CCS will reduce to 0% but will not cancel until the extension end date is reached</li>

<p>Re-reconciliation will occur automatically if&#58;</p>

new actual income details are transferred by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO)</li>

updated attendance or session reports are received within 28 days of the end of the CCS year</li>
