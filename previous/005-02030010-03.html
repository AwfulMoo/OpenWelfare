<P>Customers may have documents, such as their passport, showing the visa subclass held by the customer. However, some visas are not displayed in a person's passport, for example, New Zealand (NZ) Special Category Visa (SCV).</P>
<P>If the customer does not provide proof of their visa subclass or there are other queries regarding the customer's residence requirements for payment, there are several ways to obtain assistance:</P>
<P>The <A href="../migrants-refugees-and-visitors/005-02030010-04.html">References</A> page contains links to Chapter 9 of the Social Security Guide, which details entitlements for holders of each visa subclass</P>
<P>If the customer's visa has been granted since 1 September 1994:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Details of the customer's subclass can be obtained by completing the Immigration Enquiry (<STRONG>RSIMME</STRONG>) screen to populate visa information to the Legal Residence Details (<STRONG>RSLEG</STRONG>) screen</LI>
<LI>If the information is not available, or the customer's last travel was before 1 September 1994, Centrelink International Services (CIS) can generally provide verification of a customer's arrival and their visa subclass</LI>
<LI>Verification of whether a New Zealand citizen is a protected Special Category Visa (SCV) will also generally be automatically assessed and recorded on the <STRONG>RSLEG</STRONG> screen</LI>
<LI>Any movement information received from the immigration datalink can be checked on the Immigration Advised Movements (<STRONG>RSIM</STRONG>) screen</LI></UL>

<P>Permanent visas or resident visas are granted to migrants entering Australia to allow them to remain indefinitely. <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> generally, a customer will still need to satisfy a qualifying residence period or a Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Period (NARWP) for most income support payments and concession cards. However, some visa subclasses will give the customer an exemption from this requirement.</P>
<P>The end date of a permanent resident visa is regarded to be the date the entry/re-entry rights into Australia expire and does not mean legal authority to remain in Australia has changed.</P>
<P>Permanent visa subclasses are 100-158, 175, 176, 186, 187, 189, 190, 200-217, 431, 800-819, 831-846, 851-883 and 885-893.</P>

<P>A provisional visa is a temporary visa that may lead to the grant of a permanent visa, if the entrant meets the conditions required for the permanent visa they are applying for.</P>
<P>Provisional resident visas have the subclass of 309, 310, 820 or 826. From 1 July 2009 visa subclasses 310 and 826 are no longer issued.</P>
<P>Holders of provisional visas are not considered to be permanent residents and do not qualify for most social security payments. However, Special Benefit (SpB), Crisis Payment (CrP), Family Tax Benefit (FTB), Parental Leave Pay (PPL), Dad and Partner Pay (DAP) and Low Income Health Care Card (LIC) may be granted where qualification exists.</P>

<UL>
<LI>From 24 June 2014, visa subclass 449 was given the status of a Temporary Humanitarian Stay Visa. This visa is issued to illegal maritime arrivals and generally for a period of 12 months, after which time the holder will usually either be granted a bridging or THV subclass 786, depending on their individual circumstances</LI>
<LI>Before 24 June 2014, visa subclass 449 holders did not qualify for any social security payments or family assistance payments (other than Child Care Benefit under the hardship residence exemption)</LI></UL>
<LI><STRONG>RPBV subclass 070</STRONG> allows its holders to remain in Australia from date of grant until removal from Australia becomes practicable</LI></UL>
<P>Although all of these visa subclasses are temporary, their holders are not subject to the NARWP and are therefore residentially qualified for the following payments as long as they are physically in and residing in Australia. They can also <A href="../job-seekers/001-02020000-01.html" target=_blank>access employment assistance services through jobactive</A>:</P>

<LI>Parental Leave Pay (PPL)</LI>
<LI>Rent Assistance (RA)</LI>
<LI>Special Benefit (SpB)</LI>
<LI>Stillborn Baby Payment (SBP)</LI></UL>
<P>If the person leaves Australia, most payments received will stop on departure, except for SBP, which may continue as long as they are qualified and were granted before departure.</P>
<P>TPV 785 granted after 16 December 2014 will have the 8570 travel condition, which means the visa holder can re-enter Australia after a temporary departure. The portability of payments will be assessed by Centrelink International Services (CIS) when the customer notifies Services Australia of their intention to travel. Any TPVs granted prior to 16 December 2014 is not eligible for portability of payments, as the 8570 travel condition does not apply to them.</P>

<P>SCVs (subclass 444) are issued automatically to New Zealand passport holders on arrival in Australia. There is no evidence of these visas in a person's NZ passport.</P>
<P>Although granting the holder permission to remain permanently in Australia and to be employed, they are <STRONG>not</STRONG> permanent visas and do not qualify as an Australian resident under the Social Security Act unless they are a protected SCV holder.</P>
<P>In most cases, the protected or not protected status will be automatically assessed and recorded on the Legal Residence Details (<STRONG>RSLEG</STRONG>) screen during a new claim activity. Where a status is not automatically generated, an activity will be created. CIS will automatically pick up this activity and record the correct status on the <STRONG>RSLEG</STRONG> screen. The new claim will not be able to be finalised until this assessment has been completed.</P>
<P>All SCV holders residing in Australia are residentially qualified for Family Tax Benefit (FTB), Stillborn Baby Payment (SBP), Parental Leave Pay (PPL), Dad and Partner Pay (DAP), Child Care Subsidy (CCS), Commonwealth Seniors Health Card (CSHC) and Low Income Health Care Card (LIC). Under the Agreement with New Zealand, they may also be qualified for Age Pension, Disability Support Pension (DSP) or Carer Payment (CP).</P>

<P>From 26 February 2001, a 'protected SCV' holder meets the definition of an Australian resident under section 7 of the Social Security Act 1991 and can claim income support payments.

<P>Generally, a protected SCV holder is a person who was physically in Australia on 26 February 2001, or was in Australia for 12 months in the two years immediately prior to 26 February 2001 or was assessed as 'protected' before 26 February 2004.</P></DIV>

<P>A Special Category Visa (SCV) is issued to people arriving in Australia on a New Zealand passport, categorised by the Department of Home Affairs by visa subclass 444.</P>
<P>A non-protected SCV holder is a New Zealand citizen who was not in Australia on the 26 February 2001, or for 12 months in the 2 years immediately prior to this date nor assessed as 'protected' before 26 February 2004. A person under this category does not meet the definition of an Australian resident for social security purposes.</P>
<P>A non-protected SCV holder can claim family assistance payments (e.g. Family Tax Benefit (FTB) and Child Care Subsidy (CCS)), Parental Leave Pay (PPL), Dad and Partner Pay (DAP), Commonwealth Seniors Health Card (CSHC), Foster Child Health Care Card and Low Income Health Care Card (LIC).</P>
<P>A non-protected SCV holder can access a one off payment of JobSeeker Payment (JSP), or Youth Allowance (YA) where they have lived in Australia continuously for a period of at least 10 years immediately before claiming under the New Zealand 10 year residence exemption.</P>
<P>From 1 July 2017, an additional pathway to permanent residence was introduced for New Zealand citizens who arrived in Australia after 26 February 2001, and on or before 19 February 2016.</P>
<P>The Department of Home Affairs is responsible for assessing whether an individual meets the criteria for this pathway. These individuals should go to the Department of Home Affairs to test their eligibility for this pathway and submit a permanent visa application.</P>
<P>Once granted a permanent skilled migrant visa (subclass 198) they will be eligible to claim social security payments, subject to residence qualification and waiting periods, as a permanent visa holder.</P></DIV>
