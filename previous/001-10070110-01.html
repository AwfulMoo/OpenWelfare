	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Job seekers who are receiving a participation payment are required to actively seek and be willing to accept any offers of suitable work.</p>

<p>For job seekers with mutual obligation requirements, the Job Plan will record what the job seeker must do to satisfy those requirements under social security law.</p>

<p>Workforce Australia Job Plans include a Points Based Activation System (PBAS) requirement which will require job seekers to meet a specified monthly points target and, in most cases, also a minimum job search requirement. The monthly points target and minimum job search requirement will be set by the provider and should be based on a participant's individual circumstances and local labour market.</p>

<p>Community Development Program (CDP) and Disability Employment Services (DES) Job Plans cannot contain a requirement to meet a monthly points target. Where appropriate, CDP and DES Job Plans include a requirement to undertake and report a specified number of job searches each month. The inclusion of job search requirements in a CDP Job Plan is dependent on the strength of the local labour market.</p>

<p>Providers are responsible for notifying job seekers of the points target and/or job search requirement that applies to them, and for setting the monthly target for that requirement. Job seekers with queries or concerns about the contents of their job plan, points target or minimum job search requirement are to be referred back to the Provider for assistance.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The monthly points target only applies to job seekers who have a Workforce Australia provider, including Workforce Australia Online.</p>

<p>The job seeker's Job Plan will specify that the job seeker must meet their monthly points target. It will not include the number of points the job seeker is required to get or the number of job search efforts required. The points target can be achieved through a variety of work-related activities, such as&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
applying for a job</li>
		<li>
going for a job interview</li>
		<li>
accepting a job offer</li>
		<li>
doing paid or voluntary work, or</li>
		<li>
participating in Mandatory Activation Point activities</li>
		</ul>
<p>The Workforce Australia provider can tailor a job seeker's monthly points target in consultation with the job seeker based on&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
where they live (local labour market)</li>
		<li>
the job seeker's personal circumstances (such as caring responsibilities or assessed capacity)</li>
		</ul>
<p>The monthly points target is displayed on the job seeker's homepage in their Workforce Australia account.</p>

<p>The job seeker must record on their points reporting page the activities they do to accrue points. Job seekers who cannot regularly access their homepage will be notified of their points, negotiate the tasks they participate in and record the completion of those tasks with their Provider.</p>

<p>Job seekers can also bank points. This occurs when a job seeker exceeds their monthly points target in the reporting period, including meeting their minimum job search requirement in full. The excess points can be carried over into the next reporting period (up to a maximum of 50% of the total points target), reducing the number of points required to be met in the next monthly points period.</p>

<p></p>

<p>A compulsory job search requirement includes the&#58;</p>

number of job searches that must be undertaken each month, and</li>
		<li>
the date each month the job seeker is required to provide evidence they have met this requirement</li>
		</ul>
<p>When setting the number of compulsory job searches the job seeker is required to do per month, the provider considers&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
social security law</li>
		<li>
guidelines provided by the Department of Education, Skills and Employment</li>
		<li>
the job seeker's circumstances and assessed capacity, and</li>
		<li>
the strength of the local labour market (this is particularly relevant in CDP regions)</li>
		</ul>
<p>For job seekers with Workforce Australia, including Workforce Australia Online, their minimum job search requirement is displayed on their Workforce Australia homepage. They must record their job search efforts in the Workforce Australia online account. They cannot meet their monthly points target unless they also meet their minimum job search for the same period.</p>

<p>For all other job seekers, their provider is responsible for notifying them how and when they are to report their job search efforts to them. Job seekers are required to provide evidence they have met their job search requirement to their provider by the due date. If the date falls on a weekend or public holiday, job seekers will have until close of business the following working day.</p>

<p>Job seekers in Workforce Australia (including Workforce Australia Online) will be required to meet a monthly points target when in receipt of a participation payment.</p>

<p>By default, a job seeker’s standard points target will be set at 100 points. Only Providers or the Digital Services Contact Centre (DSCC) will have the capacity to tailor the points target in consultation with the job seeker.</p>

<p>As part of their points’ target, job seekers will generally need to complete a minimum job search requirement of five job searches each month. It will not be possible for job seekers with a minimum job search requirement to meet their points target if they do not meet their minimum job search requirements for the same points period.</p>

<p>Only Providers or the DSCC in consultation with the job seeker will have the capacity to adjust the minimum job search requirement.</p>

<p>The Department of Education, Skills and Employment expect Providers to consider the each job seeker’s personal circumstances and local labour market in setting tailored points targets and job search requirements.</p>

<p>A Workforce Australia job seeker's monthly points target and accrued points are displayed on their homepage in their Workforce Australia account. Job seekers accrue points towards their monthly points target by participating in tasks selected and recorded through their Homepage. Job seekers with digital literacy limitations will be required to discuss their options for available tasks and report their completed tasks to their Provider so that these may be recorded. Points for recorded tasks will be applied automatically, regardless of if they are recorded by the job seeker online or with assistance from the Provider.</p>

failing to provide evidence the required number of job searches has been undertaken by close of business on the due date</li>
