<p>An authorised representative must be nominated for partnerships, companies, government agencies and public bodies. This person may also be the responsible executive officer who signs the form, but the 2 roles are to be distinguished. Examples of a responsible executive officer include&#58;</p>

<p>The nomination of an authorised representative is optional for practices owned by an individual. </p>

<p>The proprietor, or a currently listed authorised representative, must sign the amendment form to nominate a new authorised representative. If one of the above are not able to sign the form, the practice must&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
have the forms signed by someone in a managerial position at the practice</li>
		<li>
include a signed letter outlining the change and why an authorised representative is unavailable to sign the declaration form</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> authorised representatives cannot nominate themselves.</p>

<p>Both authorised representatives have equal authority to act on the proprietor’s behalf. The only difference between the 2 is that system generated correspondence is addressed to the primary authorised representative.</p>

<p>Where a new Authorised Representative&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
has been nominated on the amendment form, and</li>

the form is not signed by a listed proprietor or current Authorised Representative&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the applicant can attach a letter to the form that has been signed by a responsible executive officer authorising the change of representative</li>

this request must explain the authority this person has to act on behalf of the proprietor, including their position</li>
			<li>
it must also outline the circumstances which prevented the eligible people from signing the request</li>

<p>Diagnostic Imaging and Radiation Oncology Practices are required to update registration details as recorded by Services Australia when those changes occur. An annual reminder letter is sent to practices requesting an update to details contained on the register.</p>

<p>Should an authorised person from the  practice fail to respond by the 'end date,' their registration may be suspended. If they fail to respond within 3 months from the date of suspension, their registration may be cancelled.</p>

<p>Service Officers renew the registration of active and suspended practices. Delegate approval is required to suspend or cancel a practice. Delegate approval is required to reinstate a cancelled practice registration. Any request to register a practice which was cancelled in the previous 12 months must be escalated to a  Programme Support Officer (PSO) for consideration by the Pathology and Diagnostic Imaging Team.</p>

HDAA Australia Pty Ltd (HDAA)</li>
		<li>
Quality Innovation Performance (QIP)</li>
		<li>
National Association of Testing Authorities Australia (NATA)</li>

<p>The chosen accrediting body will provide a report to Services Australia with the modalities and accreditation period for which the practice has been accredited. Eligibility for Medicare benefits for services on specified modalities will commence on the accreditation start date. </p>

<p>Current accreditation details are available on the published extract of the LSPN register from 19 June 2022. The <a href="../health-professionals/012-41040040-05.html">Resources</a> page contains a link to the register.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> accreditation is not required for Radiation Oncology practices.</p>

<p><strong>Processing Accreditation Reports in PDS</strong></p>

<p>Accreditation reports are sent to Services Australia and uploaded into PaNDA. . There are 4 types of accreditations updates. These include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
creating new start and end dates for each modality</li>
		<li>
ending accreditation for a modality</li>
		<li>
amending existing start and end dates for a modality</li>
		<li>
renewing accreditation for each modality</li>

<p>Where a practice has closed, a completed Application to register or amend a diagnostic imaging or radiation oncology practice form (HW061) is required.
