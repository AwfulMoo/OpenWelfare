<p>This document outlines how to determine whether a customer has sufficient real estate assets to secure and repay a loan under the Home Equity Access Scheme (the Scheme) and how to calculate the Maximum Loan Amount.</p>
<div class="twisty">
	
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Real_estate_the"></a>
<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Real estate the only accepted security</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Only real estate owned in Australia can be used as security for a loan. Any Australian real estate can be used by the customer including their principal home or an investment property. Overseas property cannot be accepted as security.</p>

<p>Any property, including the person’s principal home, which is offered as security for the Scheme, must be valued before the loan can be granted. When determining the value of the property any charge or encumbrance over the property will be considered and may reduce the real asset value for the purposes of determining the Maximum Loan Amount (MLA) that can be paid.</p>
		</div>

<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Ownership of real estate as security</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The customer can own the real estate solely or jointly with their partner or a third party co-owner. The customer’s or their partner’s name must be on the Title Certificate. All other owners need to consent to the property being offered as security for the loan. Partners must provide consent even if they are not a co-owner.</p>

<p>If the customer’s partner has sole ownership of the property it can still be used as security for the customer’s application. Generally, the value for each member of the couple is set as half of the value of their combined interest for consistency in treatment of shared assets in the Social Security Act and in recognition a claim may be made on the property in the case of separation settlement. Exceptions may be made in consultation with Policy Helpdesk. See <a href="../older-australians/065-08020020-05.html">Resources</a> for a link to the Policy Helpdesk.</p>

<p>If the customer or their partner is an attributable stakeholder of a company or trust, then real estate assets owned by the company or trust may be used as security. In this situation the company or trust must provide a guarantee to the Commonwealth that any Scheme debt incurred by the customer will be repaid by the company or trustee. The customer is required to supply a copy of the company constitution or trust deed with their Scheme application.</p>

<p>Real estate obtained under a ‘long lease’ which would not preclude the Commonwealth from recovering the Scheme debt, and does not prevent the person who receives the benefit of the lease (the lessee) from selling the property, may satisfy the requirement for ownership under section 1133 of the Social Section Act 1991. For example, due to the system of land title in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), a registered proprietor for the lease (or Crown lessee) in the ACT has the right to use land under a lease for a term of 99 years. Even though the Crown lessee only has a ‘lease’ on the land, the person, not the ACT Government, receives the financial benefit of the land value on sale.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>Any property which is offered as security for the Scheme must be valued, including the principal home. When determining the equity of real property you must take into consideration any charge or encumbrance over the property.</p>

<p>The presence of a mortgage or reverse mortgage on the property offered as security for a Scheme debt, does not necessarily disqualify a person from the Scheme. The mortgage should be considered to determine the available equity of real assets to calculate the customers (and partner if applicable) maximum loan amount.</p>

<p>Factors that are taken into account when assessing the real estate include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
current market value of the real estate</li>
		<li>
adequate insurance on the real estate</li>
		<li>
valuation of the real estate</li>
		<li>
life interest</li>
		<li>

<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Limiting the Maximum Loan Amount (MLA)</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The Maximum Loan Amount is determined by a statutory formula, being the equity offered rounded down to the nearest 10,000 divided by 10,000 and then multiplied by the age component amount.</p>

<p>The age component amount is determined by using the customer’s age, or if a member of a couple the younger of the couple’s age against a table set by ministerial determination. See the <a href="../older-australians/065-08020020-04.html">References</a> page for a link to the determination.</p>

<p>A customer may choose to limit the MLA in 2 ways by&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
nominating a Customer Maximum Loan Amount which will limit the total amount of loan payments that can be borrowed over the life of the loan. The Customer Maximum Loan Amount must be equal or lower than the actual MLA.</li>
		<li>
nominating an amount to be excluded from the asset’s value for calculation of the loan. The nominated amount can be changed at any time by written request. This request must be signed by the customer (and their partner if they are a member of a couple)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Neither of these prevent the loan being recovered if the loan balance exceeds the maximum loan amount.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Decisions on adequate security are subject to the discretion of the delegate and depend on the individual circumstances of the case. If there is any doubt about whether a property is acceptable to secure a Home Equity Access Scheme loan, escalate to the Policy Helpdesk for assessment.

<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Scheme loans secured by placement of a statutory charge or caveat</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The agency secures repayment of the Scheme loan by placing a statutory charge or caveat over the item(s) of real estate of the customer's choosing. In practical terms, what the Commonwealth will do is lodge a caveat over the real estate with the relevant Land Titles Office to ensure Services Australia is advised of any impending sale of real estate which has been used to secure a Scheme loan. The delegate can then renegotiate or cancel and recover the loan as appropriate.</p>

<p>The customer (and their partner, if they are a member of a couple) must consent to the lodgement of a charge or caveat over the nominated real estate. In some jurisdictions (e.g. Queensland) third parties with a registered interest must provide consent before a charge can be registered. The charge or caveat will be removed when the customer repays the debt in full. If the customer provides an alternate property as security for the debt, the charge or caveat will be removed from the previous security and lodged against the new security.</p>

<p>See <a href="../older-australians/065-19060355-01.html">Processing claims for the Home Equity Access Scheme</a> for more information about the registration of a caveat or charge when a Scheme loan is granted.</p>

<p></p>
<div class="twisty">
	
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Costs_involved_"></a>
<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Costs involved with caveats</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The costs involved in registering a caveat are payable by the customer and are added to the Scheme loan balance. Once these costs are added to the loan balance they attract interest (compounded fortnightly) the same way as the principal loan payments and previously accumulated interest. The customer bears the cost of removal of the caveat, or in the event of the customer's death, their estate.</p>

<p>Instances may arise where a customer wishes to rearrange their assets and it becomes necessary to remove the caveat from one property and place it on another. Again, these costs are paid by the customer. This rearrangement of assets is not an obstacle to continuing to participate in the Scheme as long as the value of the substitute property provides adequate security for the debt. Costs may also be incurred if another dealing is registered on the property and it requires Services Australia to assess and consent.</p>

<p>The Complex Assessment Officers (CAO) in the PLS National processing team are solely authorised to organise the registering of a caveat or charge at the time of the claim assessment via Services Australia's Legal Services Division. A tasking request is completed and provided to the Legal Services Division via email, who then act on behalf of the agency by communicating with external legal service providers.</p>

<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Scheme loan balance an allowable deduction</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The Scheme loan balance is an allowable deduction against the assessable asset amount (not including exempt amounts) of secured properties. The deduction is manually updated at least once per year by the PLS National processing team as part of the Scheme <a href="../older-australians/065-08020060-01.html">annual real estate review</a> on the customer’s record. The deduction applies to the assessable asset component of the offered security only which is different to the treatment of other loans or encumbrances which are apportioned between the assessable and non-assessable components of the property.</p>

<p>See the <a href="../older-australians/065-08020020-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Deducting_PLS_l">Process</a> page for instructions on how to assess and apply the deduction.</p>
