<p>Geoff applies for a one-off FTB advance payment of $500. Geoff states that after paying for living expenses, groceries and bills there is $30 left over each fortnight.</p>

<p><strong>FTB advance payments for blended families</strong></p>

<p>Each of the members of a blended family couple may be paid an FTB advance payment if they are eligible.</p>

<p>They must each be receiving FTB by instalments and the family must be entitled to a rate of FTB Part A at least equivalent to the full base rate of FTB Part A payable for one child under 18. For the base rate of FTB Part A, see <a target="_blank" href="../utils/RatesChart/rateschart.html?part%20a">Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A - rates (pf)</a>.</p>

<p>The minimum and maximum advance amounts are calculated for the family and each member of the blended family couple may apply for a share of the family's allowable advance amount based on the individual customer's blend percentage.</p>

<p>Each individual is required to apply independently; it is <strong>not</strong> necessary for both members of a blended family to apply before an advance payment can to be paid to one of the couple.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario&#58;</strong> Elizabeth and Steve are paid FTB as a blended family with percentages of 60% and 40% respectively. Between them they get the maximum rate of FTB Part A for 2 children aged under 13 and do not receive Rent Assistance.</p>

		<li>
Steve&#58; 40% of $193.54 = $77.42</li>
		</ul>
<p>Elizabeth chooses to set up a regular advance of $116.12 every 26 weeks - leaving $348.38 in reserve to claim later as one-off advance/s (dependent upon Elizabeth meeting requirements to get the further advances on those future dates).</p>

<p>Nine days later Steve applies for and is granted a one-off advance of $309.66, using up all of Steve's allowable maximum advance amount.</p>

<p><strong>Change in circumstances during advance repayment period</strong></p>

<p>Amie is receiving the maximum rate of FTB Part A for their 3 year old child Frankie. On 13 July 2022 Amie applies for a maximum advance payment of FTB.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
$5,161.10 x 7.5% = $387.08</li>
		</ul>
<p>The advance period is 26 weeks (182 days). Amie's repayments are calculated as follows&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
$387.08 / 182 days = $2.13 per day (after rounding)</li>
		<li>
$2.13 x 14 days = $29.82</li>
		</ul>
<p>Amie's repayment schedule is $29.82 per fortnight for the first 12 fortnights and a final payment of $29.24 (to make up for the rounding). The repayments commence from the next available FTB instalment on 21 July 2022.</p>

<p>On 5 September 2022 Frankie leaves Amie's care and the FTB is cancelled (NDE). Amie has made 4 repayments from the FTB instalment payments before the FTB was cancelled.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
4 x $29.82 = $119.28 repaid</li>
		<li>
$387.08 - $119.28 = $267.80 outstanding</li>

<p><strong>Change in FTB rate during advance repayment period</strong></p>

<p>If a customer's FTB rate decreases, but remains above their scheduled repayment rate, repayments will continue as scheduled; In this case, the customer's advance repayments will use up a greater proportion of their ongoing FTB instalments.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario&#58;</strong> Based on the combined family estimate of income, Simon gets base rate FTB Part A for their 7 year old child Lucy.</p>

<p>On 1 April 2022 Simon applies for and receives the maximum allowable FTB advance.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
$4,985.90 x 7.5% = $373.94</li>
		</ul>
<p>The advance period is 26 weeks (182 days). Simon's repayments are calculated as follows&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
$373.94 / 182 days = $2.05 per day</li>
		<li>
$2.05 x 14 days = $28.70</li>
		</ul>
<p>Simon's first repayment comes out of the next available FTB instalment on 7 April 2022.</p>

<p>On 5 July 2022, after having made 7 repayments, Simon provides a new combined FTB estimate which is above the HIFA and reduces the ongoing FTB entitlement to $11.60 per fortnight under the higher income taper.</p>

<p>Simon has paid 7 x $28.70 = $200.90</p>

<p>Simon still owes $373.94 - $200.90 = $173.04</p>

<p>At the rate of $11.60 per fortnight it will take Simon a further 15 fortnights to fully repay the advance, making the total repayment period 22 fortnights.</p>

<p><strong>Change of FTB rate during advance repayment period (less than the scheduled repayment rate)</strong></p>

<p>If a customer's rate of FTB Part A falls below their scheduled repayment rate the recovery amount will reduce to the new FTB Part A rate and the advance repayment period will be extended.</p>

<p>A debt will be raised for any advance amount that has not been recovered when the extended period is considered to be an unreasonable amount of time to repay the FTB advance. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the repayment period increases to between one to two years, a number of factors must be considered before manually raising an advance debt.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario - advance repayment period 1-2 years&#58;</strong> Jan and Thom have 5 children. Based on their combined income, Jan qualifies for and is paid an FTB advance payment of $1,000 on 20 June. Up to 31 July, Jan has repaid 3 payments of $77 per fortnight from the advance payment.</p>

<p>On 1 August, Jan and Thom separate and 4 children live with Thom while Jan has shared care of 40% of one child. Jan's rate of FTB Part A further reduces due to income and receives FTB Part A of $20 per fortnight.</p>

<p>Jan's advance balance at 1 August  is $769&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
$1,000 - ($77 x 3 = 231) = $769</li>
		</ul>
<p>This would extend Jan's advance repayment period to 532 days&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
$769 / $20 = 38 fortnights</li>
		</ul>
<p>If an advance repayment period is increased to more than 1 year but less than 2 years (between 365 and 730 days), a debt of the outstanding advance balance ($769) may be raised at the discretion of the Service Officer. If a debt is not raised, recovery can continue at the reduced rate of FTB Part A ($20) each fortnight.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario - advance repayment period greater than 2 years&#58;</strong> Jan and Thom have 5 children. Based on their combined income, Jan qualifies for and is paid an FTB advance payment of $1,000 on 20 June. Up to 31 July, Jan has repaid 3 payments of $77 per fortnight from the advance payment.</p>

<p>On 1 August  Jan and Thom separate and 4 children live with Thom while Jan has shared care of 40% of one child. Jan's rate of FTB Part A further reduces due to income and receives FTB Part A of $14 per fortnight.</p>

<p>Jan's advance balance at 1 August  is $769&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>

<p><strong>Known cancellation event</strong></p>

<p>If the customer will lose entitlement to FTB Part A within 26 weeks from the date of application the advance payment period will be reduced.</p>

<p>Events that can result in the cancellation of FTB Part A include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
permanent departures overseas/overseas absence greater than three years (<strong>DOS/O3Y</strong>)</li>
		<li>
income estimate will cancel entitlement (<strong>OIS</strong>)</li>
		<li>
Prohibition of Instalment Payments (<strong>N3O/N3P/N3Y</strong>)</li>
		<li>
cancellation of income support (<strong>OIS</strong>)</li>
		<li>
no dependant eligible child in care (<strong>NDE</strong>)</li>
		</ul>
<p>For more information, see <a href="../families/007-07090010-01.html">Cancellation, rejection and Current Zero Rate codes for Family Tax Benefit (FTB)</a>.</p>

<p>If the youngest child (eligible for FTB) is completing Year 12 in the calendar year then the customer may not be eligible to receive an FTB advance depending on the time they apply. For example, customers applying in October to December may not be eligible or may receive a reduced rate based on the cancellation date of their FTB Part A.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario&#58;</strong> Based on their rate of payment, Belinda is eligible for a maximum FTB advance payment of $500 over a period of 26 weeks (182 days). Belinda has previously advised they will be permanently departing Australia in 100 days. This has been recorded and the FTB is due to cancel in 100 days.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
$500 / 182 days = $2.7472 daily rate</li>
		<li>
$2.7472 x 100 days = $274.72</li>
		</ul>
<p>Due to the shortened period, Belinda is entitled to receive an FTB advance payment of $274.72 which will be repaid over 100 days.</p>

<p>If Belinda was only entitled to a maximum advance payment of $250 over the shortened period of 100 days&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
$250 / 182 days = $1.3736</li>
		<li>
$1.3736 x 100 days = $137.36</li>
		</ul>
<p>As this is lower than the minimum FTB advance payment amount of $178.75, Belinda would not be entitled to receive an advance payment of FTB.</p>

<p>An FTB advance payment debt may be raised or advance repayment recommence as a result of the FTB reconciliation process.</p>

<p>Reconciliation of FTB can result in an advance payment of FTB being unrecovered if it is retrospectively determined for a previous financial year that the customer was not entitled to receive FTB Part A at a sufficient rate so as to recover the advance payment.</p>

<strong>before</strong> the unrecovered advance payment was originally finalised <strong>both</strong> advance payments will be recovered concurrently</li>

<p><strong>Multiple FTB advance payments</strong></p>

<p>Louise is claiming FTB Part A for 4 children aged under 4 years. Louise has an income estimate of $50,000 and estimated Maintenance Income of $1,200.</p>

<p>At 1 May 2022 Louise's annual FTB rates are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Part A&#58; $4,985.90 x 4 children = $19,943.60</li>
		</ul>
<p>In May 2022 Louise receives a one-off advance of $335.79 which is to be repaid from the next 13 FTB instalments, commencing on Louise's next available pay-day 19 May 2022.</p>

<p>On 1 June 2022, Louise requests a one-off FTB advance payment of $450. Louise meets all eligibility checks and their circumstances have not changed.</p>

<p>Louise's maximum advance entitlement is the FTB advance payment ceiling ($1,161.71) less the unpaid one-off advance payment&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
$1,161.71 - $335.79 = $825.92</li>
		</ul>
<p>The FTB advance payment of $455 is granted because in total the amount advanced is below the maximum advance amount available and Louise has demonstrated an ability to afford the amount to be deducted from the FTB.</p>

<p>The daily repayment rates for both of the current advances are added together and multiplied by 14. This is the new fortnightly repayment rate which will apply from Louise's next FTB instalment payday.</p>

<p>Louise requests a regular FTB advance payment on 25 June 2022. Louise meets all eligibility requirements and circumstances have not changed.</p>

<p>Louise's maximum advance entitlement is the FTB advance payment ceiling ($1,161.71) minus the total amount of all FTB advances that have not yet been fully recovered&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
$1,161.71 - $335.79 - $455 = $370.92</li>
		</ul>
<p>The regular advance payment of FTB is set at 3.75% of the annual maximum FTB Part A rate for one child aged under 13 years ($186.97), so Louise has room under the maximum allowable advance limit to also get the regular advance (if able to afford the repayments without getting into hardship). It is decided Louise can afford the repayments so the advance is granted.</p>

<p>Louise now has 3 advances of different amounts being recovered over different 26 week repayment periods. While the advance repayment periods overlap, the daily repayment rates of all three advances are added together and multiplied by 14 to calculate the fortnightly repayment amount.</p>

<p>The total amount of all FTB advances that have not yet been fully recovered is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
$335.79 + $455 + $186.97 = $9677.76</li>
		</ul>
<p>Louise nominally has another $183.95 available to be advanced to her. However, as each advance must be at least equal to the minimum advance amount ($186.97), Louise will not be able to get any further advances until one of the outstanding advances has been fully repaid.</p>

<p><strong>Outstanding debts less than $0.05</strong></p>

<p>When a customer pays the outstanding balance of a debt but there is still a rounding amount of less than $0.05 outstanding, any FTB advance payment application processed will automatically reject. The rejection reason can be over-ridden, and the advance processed as normal.</p>

<p>The rounding amount will not clear until the customer's next pay day. After the amount has cleared, the FTB advance payment can be processed following normal procedures.</p>

<p><strong>Example&#58;</strong> Customer has a debt to the Commonwealth for $234.67, they attend a Post Office or service centre to pay $234.67 but due to rounding only pay $234.65. The $0.02 cents outstanding will not clear until the customer's next pay.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Can a customer repay an outstanding debt in cash to qualify for an advance payment?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Yes, Customers can repay their debts in cash at Australia Post. <img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> A customer cannot repay their outstanding debt in cash at a service centre, however they can repay debts at any time via Centrelink online account or the Express Plus mobile app.</p>

<p>Where the repayment is made via Centrelink online account or Express Plus mobile app using their debit or credit card, the repayment will be recognised immediately as 'paid' and the customer may apply for a new advance.</p>

<p>Customers may also use Australia Post BillPay, Direct Debit and BPAY® to repay their debt. The customer will not be able to apply for a new advance until payments made by these methods have been received by Services Australia.</p>

<p>Payments made via cash or card in person at Australia Post using Post Billpay will be recognised as 'paid' within 10 minutes. Other payment methods may take from 3 - 7 days to be received.</p>

<p>Answer&#58; Generally eligible customers can apply for an Advance Payment via a self service channel, over the telephone or by visiting their local service centre. There are some restrictions on which customers can use self service.</p>

<p>Customers who apply for an advance payment in the service centre or via self service channels will be issued with either a receipt number only or an immediate printed receipt number and information about the decision that has been made at the time of contact. Smart Centre Service Officers can issue a verbal receipt number to the customer.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; How can 'at risk' customers and customers with a nominee arrangement in place apply for an advance payment?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; For Family Tax Benefit (FTB) advance payment applications, customers under the age of 18 are considered to be 'at risk' and are required to discuss their application with a Service Officer prior to receiving an FTB advance payment. This contact may be completed by the Smart Centre.</p>

<p>This ensures customers access advance payments only after a thorough assessment of their individual circumstances and are aware of the impacts of taking up the offer of an advance payment.</p>

<p>If, during the interview, it is determined that the customer is in the care of a government authority, such as Child Services, it may be appropriate to contact the case worker to discuss the customer's application for advance payment.</p>

<p>Customers must be made fully aware of the impacts of taking the offer of an advance payment.</p>

<p>Rurally isolated customers are those who live in rural or remote areas who live more than 90 minutes from a service centre and have no access to a service centre.</p>

<p>Customers with a nominee cannot use self service channels to apply for an advance payment and must contact a Service Officer at either a service centre or Smart Centre.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the information currently displayed in the advance payment workflow in relation to weekly payment customers requiring a face to face contact to request an advance payment is incorrect.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Can income managed customers apply for an advance payment?</strong></p>

These funds will be available the next day in the customer's Income Management account and can be accessed by the customer through their BasicsCard or Third Party Organisation allocations.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; there is no one day or two day delivery based on the payment type the customer is receiving. Funds are credited with the nightly payment strip and available in the Income Management account the next day. This means customers who are granted an advance on a Friday can access funds on the weekend using self service options to transfer to their BasicsCard.</p>

<p>Answer&#58; For tax purposes, advance payments are treated as a 'loan of money'. This applies irrespective of when the advance payment was paid during the financial year. Advance payments do not attract any additional tax liability as they are not an extra payment but a lump sum payment of the customer's ongoing entitlement.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Should a Service Officer grant a customer an advance when they apply with an outstanding debt balance of less than 5 cents?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Yes. When a customer pays an outstanding balance of a debt but a rounding amount remains outstanding, any advance payment application will automatically reject. Service Officers are allowed in these instances to override the rejection using the advance payment workflow where the customer has an outstanding debt balance of less than five cents. This is so the customer is not disadvantaged by the administrative process which occurs as the remaining rounding amount will not clear until the customer's next pay day.</p>

<p><strong>Example&#58;</strong> Customer has a debt for $234.67, they attend a Post Office to pay the full amount but due to rounding, can only pay $234.65 (the customer cannot pay more than the amount due). The 0.02 cents outstanding will not clear until the customer's next payday. A Service Officer can manually override the application rejection and process the next advance if the customer meets all the other qualification criteria.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; If the customer has a Compensation Insurer debt that has not been repaid, can they receive an advance payment?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; This type of debt does not meet the qualification requirements and should not prevent the customer from receiving an advance. The debt is owed to the Commonwealth by the insurer, not the customer.</p>

<p>As the system cannot identify this type of debt from other debts, the workflow will automatically reject the application. In these cases, the rejection should be overridden.</p>

<p>For customers who may have more than one advance payment in place at a time, each advance payment is recovered separately. If the customer is granted a second or third advance payment while still repaying an earlier one, the amount deducted from their fortnightly payment will increase.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Can a customer repay their advance payment with extra amounts?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; A customer may elect to repay an amount/s of an outstanding advance payment at any time. Customers can repay their advance amount using their debit or credit card via the <img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> self-service channels, or with staff assistance over the phone or in a service centre.</p>

<p>Where the repayment is made via Centrelink online account or Express Plus mobile app, the repayment will be recognised immediately as 'paid' and the customer may apply for a new advance as long as all other eligibility criteria is met.</p>

<p>Customers also have the option to make an in person repayment at Australia Post using Post BillPay. Customers who chose this option will need to print their Post BillPay barcode from their online account.</p>

<p>If the customer is repaying the outstanding amount/s in order to immediately qualify (pending all other criteria) for another advance payment, see <a href="../payment-delivery/103-05040050-01.html">Lump sum repayment of advance payment</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> customers cannot repay an amount that is greater than the outstanding balance.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Can a customer have their rate of repayment increased?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Yes. Customers may request their rate of repayment to be increased.</p>

<p>The repayment can only be increased if the customer will not suffer financial hardship due to the new repayment amount.</p>

<p>There is no restriction on the amount a staff member can increase the repayment amount to, as long as the customer has the capacity to meet the repayment amount without being placed in hardship.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Can a customer increase their rate of repayment via the online service?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Yes. <img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> Customers can request to increase their rate of repayment. The preferred channel is to use Centrelink online account or the Express Plus mobile app. This request will be approved only if the customer will not suffer severe financial hardship.</p>

<p>The increased amount must be less than or equal to twice the legislated repayment amount which is determined by dividing the advance amount by 13. For example, a $500 advance equals repayments of $38.50 per fortnight, therefore the increase should not exceed $77 per fortnight.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Can the customer have their rate of repayment decreased?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Decreasing the rate of repayment or stopping the repayments should only be considered for the standard advance, FTB advance (except the one-off transitional FTB advance payment) or SEA if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer has special and unusual circumstances, and</li>
		<li>
they would suffer severe financial hardship if the repayment rate was not reduced</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> future applications for an FTB advance payment will reject if an outstanding advance of any type has a reduced recovery arrangement in place.</p>

<p>Repayments are <strong>not</strong> to be decreased on the same day as the advance is granted as the customer must have capacity to make repayments at the standard rate for the advance to be granted.</p>

<p>Repayments can only be decreased or ceased for up to 3 months and then the customer’s circumstances must be reviewed.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Can the customer use online services to have their rate of repayment decreased?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; <img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> A customer may decrease their advance repayment amount using the online channels only if they are currently on an increased repayment rate and the decreased amount is greater than or equal to the prior legislated repayment amount. This is determined by dividing the advance amount by 13. For example, a $500 advance equals repayments of $38.50 per fortnight.</p>
