<p>Service Officers may refer job seekers to an Employment Services Provider. Employment Services Provider is a generic term that covers a range of organisations, including jobactive, Intensive Support-Transition to Work (TtW), Disability Employment Services (DES) and Community Development Program (CDP). This topic provides information on Services Australia role in the referral process.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Selecting_a_pro">Selecting a provider at New Claim</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Job seekers will select or be automatically allocated a provider including Online Employment Services during their initial contact with the agency. If the job seeker is subject to <a href="../job-seekers/001-02030010-01.html">RapidConnect</a> and not referred to Online Employment Services, they must be referred to an available appointment within 2 days. If there are no available appointments, they can select from providers who have appointments available within 14 working days.</p>

<p>The <a target="_blank" href="../job-seekers/001-03020100-01.html">Participation Interview</a> is used to complete the Job Seeker Classification Instrument (JSCI) (when required) and refer job seekers to an Employment Services Provider.</p>

<p>Job seekers who don't have a preference for a provider are randomly allocated one from those in the local area. Job seekers can ask to exclude certain providers from the random allocation process.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> there is only one CDP provider per remote area, job seekers in these areas will not have a choice of providers.</p>

<p>From 1 July 2019, all Stream A job seekers in 2 designated pilot areas are selected by the Department of Education, Skills and Employment to participate in the New Employment Services Model (ESM) Pilot.

<p>The role of Services Australia in OES and ESM is to explain to the job seeker that they&#58;</p>

<p>The Star Rating system, where available, measures the success of a DES provider in finding jobs for job seekers. The highest rating is five and the lowest is a rating of one. New providers may have a nil rating and as such, the rating in these instances does not indicate poor performance of the provider - this should be taken into account when explaining ratings to customers. If the customer is a RapidConnect customer, the system will only display the list of providers with immediate appointments and will not display their full status.</p>

<p>If the job seeker believes they can receive a better service elsewhere, they should talk to their current or proposed provider. Job seekers may be transferred by agreement if the losing and gaining providers agree to the transfer. A request for transfer may also be lodged electronically by a job seeker via their Personal Page on the jobactive website, see <a href="../job-seekers/001-02060000-05.html">Resources</a> for a link.</p>

<p>If a job seeker advises Services Australia that they refuse to engage with their jobactive provider due to a <a href="../job-seekers/001-02070030-01.html">breakdown in relationship</a> with their Employment Service Provider, the job seeker must be advised to contact the Department of Education, Skills and Employment Customer Service Line, See <a href="../job-seekers/001-02060000-05.html">Resources</a> for a link. This includes situations where the job seeker has been exited from their provider due to threatening, aggressive, or violent behaviour and there is a Job Seeker Incident Report (JSIR) recorded, and they wish to discuss the exit or referral to another provider.</p>

<p>CDP job seekers cannot generally transfer between providers unless they move to another region, however these job seekers may also be referred to the Department of Education, Skills and Employment National Customer Service Line (NCSL), See the <a href="../job-seekers/001-02060000-05.html">Resources</a> page for a link, where they have reported a breakdown in the relationship with their provider.</p>
