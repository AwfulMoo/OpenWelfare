<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_Referral_to_Emp>Referral to Employment Service Providers</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Service Officers may refer job seekers to an Employment Services Provider. Employment Services Provider is a generic term that covers a range of organisations, including jobactive, Intensive Support-Transition to Work (TtW), Disability Employment Services (DES) and Community Development Program (CDP). This topic provides information on Services Australia role in the referral process.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P></P>
<DIV class=twisty><A name=bp01_L2GT_Selecting_a_pro class=anchor></A>
<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_Selecting_a_pro>Selecting a provider at New Claim</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Job seekers will select or be automatically allocated a provider including Online Employment Services during their initial contact with the agency. If the job seeker is subject to <A href="../job-seekers/001-02030010-01.html">RapidConnect</A> and not referred to Online Employment Services, they must be referred to an available appointment within 2 days. If there are no available appointments, they can select from providers who have appointments available within 14 working days.</P>
<P>The <A href="../job-seekers/001-03020100-01.html" target=_blank>Participation Interview</A> is used to complete the Job Seeker Classification Instrument (JSCI) (when required) and refer job seekers to an Employment Services Provider.</P>
<P>Job seekers who don't have a preference for a provider are randomly allocated one from those in the local area. Job seekers can ask to exclude certain providers from the random allocation process.</P>
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> there is only one CDP provider per remote area, job seekers in these areas will not have a choice of providers.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_Referral_to_onl01>Referral to jobactive online employment service</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Most job seekers are referred to <A href="../job-seekers/001-02000000-01.html">Online Employment Service (OES)</A>, with selection and referral being undertaken by the Department of Education, Skills and Employment during the Participation Interview. Selected job seekers do not require a referral to a jobactive provider, but instead manage their obligations through the Online Employment Service website.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P></P>
<DIV class=twisty><A name=bp01_L2GT_New_Employment_ class=anchor></A>
<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_New_Employment_>New Employment Services Model Pilot</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>From 1 July 2019, all Stream A job seekers in 2 designated pilot areas are selected by the Department of Education, Skills and Employment to participate in the New Employment Services Model (ESM) Pilot. The ESM pilot will continue until the New Employment Services Model is implemented in July 2022.</P>
<P>The role of Services Australia in OES and ESM is to explain to the job seeker that they:</P>
<UL>
<LI>have been selected for the OES and ESM and are required to register with the jobactive website via myGov</LI>
<LI>must agree to a Job Plan in order to meet their RapidConnect requirements</LI>
<LI>will not be required to attend face to face appointments with a jobactive provider</LI>
<LI>can contact the Department of Education, Skills and Employment to discuss:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>their participation</LI>
<LI>issues accessing the jobactive website</LI>
<LI>agreeing to the Job Plan, or</LI>
<LI>exiting from the OES/pilot</LI></UL></UL>
<P>Job seekers will agree to a Job Plan, develop or upload a resume, a career profile and other relevant information and report mutual obligation activities (principally job search) via the online jobactive employment service. If at any time a job seeker needs to be transferred to a jobactive provider, the Department of Education, Skills and Employment will refer the job seeker.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>It is the agency's role to give the customer unbiased information about providers to assist them with their choice of provider. The agency can give the following information to assist customers in choosing an Employment Services Provider:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the names of available providers</LI>
<LI>provider locations</LI>
<LI>provider appointment availability</LI>
<LI>the Star Rating if available (for DES providers only)</LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_Initial_intervi>Initial appointment</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>At the initial appointment with the provider, the job seeker and the provider discuss job search requirements and complete a vocational profile and a resume. In most circumstances, an Employment Services Provider will negotiate a Job Plan with the job seeker at this appointment.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P><A href="../job-seekers/001-02020010-01.html">jobactive</A> organisations provide job seekers a range of tailored services, according to their circumstances and needs. A job seeker registering for services will be referred to a provider who will deliver or broker all appropriate services available during the customer's period of registration.</P>
<P>The outcome of the <A href="../job-seekers/001-02050000-01.html">Job Seeker Classification Instrument (JSCI)</A>, or an <A href="../job-seekers/001-02330000-01.html">Employment Services Assessment (ESAt)</A> if conducted, will determine the level of service (or stream) the job seeker will receive from jobactive.</P>
<P>Job seekers identified as eligible for TtW should not be referred to jobactive.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>When a job seeker lives in a Department of Education, Skills and Employment designated remote area, they are referred to a <A href="../job-seekers/001-02140000-01.html">Community Development Program (CDP)</A> provider.</P>
<P>There is only one CDP provider per remote area, job seekers in these areas do not have a choice of providers.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_Disability_Empl>Disability Employment Services (DES)</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Disability Employment Services (DES) offers 2 programs to help people whose disability, injury or health condition is their primary barrier to finding and maintaining employment. The participant will be in either Disability Employment Services - Disability Management Service (DES-DMS) or Disability Employment Services - Employment Support Service (DES-ESS), depending on their level of need and their eligibility for Program Services:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Disability Employment Services - Disability Management Service (DES-DMS)</LI>
<UL>
<LI>provides services to job seekers with temporary or permanent disability, injury, or health conditions who require the assistance of a disability employment service and who may require flexible ongoing support but are not expected to need regular long-term support in the workplace: and</LI></UL>
<LI>Disability Employment Services - Employment Support Service (DES-ESS):</LI>
<UL>
<LI>provides services to job seekers with permanent disability and who are assessed as needing regular long-term ongoing support in the workplace</LI></UL></UL>
<P>DES is funded by the Department of Social Services (DSS).</P>
<P>See <A href="../people-with-disability/008-04030110-01.html">Referring a job seeker to Disability Employment Services (DES)</A> for further information regarding the referral process.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_The_Star_Rating>The Star Rating system (DES only)</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>The Star Rating system, where available, measures the success of a DES provider in finding jobs for job seekers. The highest rating is five and the lowest is a rating of one. New providers may have a nil rating and as such, the rating in these instances does not indicate poor performance of the provider - this should be taken into account when explaining ratings to customers. If the customer is a RapidConnect customer, the system will only display the list of providers with immediate appointments and will not display their full status.</P>
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> The star rating system for jobactive providers ceased 1 June 2021.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>The <A href="../job-seekers/001-02290000-01.html">Intensive Support - Transition to Work (TtW)</A> Service is for young people 15- 24 years of age who are not in education or employment and are at high risk of long term unemployment. Participants will be given pre-employment assistance by a TtW provider to prepare them for work, an apprenticeship, a traineeship, or further education. Eligibility is determined by the Department of Education, Skills and Employment ICT system.</P>
<P>TtW services are provided by Employment Service Providers that operate separately to jobactive, Disability Employment Services, and Community Development Program. A job seeker eligible for TtW must not be referred to jobactive.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_Breakdown_in_re>Breakdown in relationship with provider</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>If the job seeker believes they can receive a better service elsewhere, they should talk to their current or proposed provider. Job seekers may be transferred by agreement if the losing and gaining providers agree to the transfer. A request for transfer may also be lodged electronically by a job seeker via their Personal Page on the jobactive website, see <A href="../job-seekers/001-02060000-05.html">Resources</A> for a link.</P>
<P>If a job seeker advises Services Australia that they refuse to engage with their jobactive provider due to a <A href="../job-seekers/001-02070030-01.html">breakdown in relationship</A> with their Employment Service Provider, the job seeker must be advised to contact the Department of Education, Skills and Employment Customer Service Line, See <A href="../job-seekers/001-02060000-05.html">Resources</A> for a link. This includes situations where the job seeker has been exited from their provider due to threatening, aggressive, or violent behaviour and there is a Job Seeker Incident Report (JSIR) recorded, and they wish to discuss the exit or referral to another provider.</P>
<P>CDP job seekers cannot generally transfer between providers unless they move to another region, however these job seekers may also be referred to the Department of Education, Skills and Employment National Customer Service Line (NCSL), See the <A href="../job-seekers/001-02060000-05.html">Resources</A> page for a link, where they have reported a breakdown in the relationship with their provider.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_Participant_Ini>Participant Initiated Transfer (DES only)</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Once the participant commences DES, they are able to use a Participant Initiated Transfer at any time. Participants can use these transfers up to 5 times over a 2 year period.</P>
<P>Participants should contact the National Customer Service Line to help to make this change. They will not be asked to provide a reason for wanting to change DES provider.</P>
<P>If the participant exhausts their 5 initiated transfers, or do not wish to use their initiated transfers, they can still transfer using a Transfer by Agreement but only after ESAt is finalised.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
