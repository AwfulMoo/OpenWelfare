<p>This class exemption is location specific.</p>

<p><strong>Eligibility and supporting documentation</strong></p>

<p>To be considered eligible for a DPA/DWS class exemption, Services Australia must receive a HW019 application form. The medical practitioner must also have one of the specialty codes recorded on the system. See <a href="../health-professionals/012-18050801-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Assess_a_prov">Assess a provider number application and supporting documentation</a>.</p>

<p>The DPA/DWS class exemption does not apply to temporary residents for assisting at operations, these applications must be sent to Health for approval of a 19AB exemption.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If the practice location is not in a DPA for general practitioners and non-specialists or in a DWS for specialists and consultant physicians, the request must be sent to Health for assessment on the <a href="../health-professionals/012-18050801-05.html#bp05_L2LL_Forms">19AB spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Effective date</strong></p>

<p>If a location falls within a DPA or DWS area, the effective date of the class exemption is the date the Medicare provider number application is received or date requested, whichever is the latter (if the health practitioner meets the eligibility requirements of the class exemption). If the location falls within an MM3-4 area for general practitioners and non-specialists, the effective date of the class exemption is the date the Medicare provider number application is received or date requested or 01/01/2022, whichever is the latter. If the location does not fall within a DPA or an MM3-4 area but is listed as ‘Granted’ on the exceptional circumstances reviews and outcomes list, the effective date of the class exemption is the date the Medicare provider number application is received or date requested or 14/03/2022, whichever is the latter.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; locations that return a ‘No’ for DPA but fall within a MM 3-4 cannot commence prior to 1 January 2022. Locations that return a ‘No’ for DPA or fall within an MM 1-2 cannot commence prior to 14 March 2022.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If DPA/DWS and non-DPA or non-DWS locations are received together&#58; The effective date of the Section 19AB exemption for the non-DPA or non-DWS locations is the effective date of the approved 19AB exemption</p>
