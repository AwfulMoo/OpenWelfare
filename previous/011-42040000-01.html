		<div class="block">

<p>Professional attendance items for use by general practitioners (GPs), non-vocationally recognised medical practitioners (non-VR MPs), other medical practitioners (OMPs), specialists, consultant physicians and public health physicians are listed in the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) under Category 1 - Professional Attendances (MBS category 1).</p>

<p>Professional Attendances are structured according to provider category. Practitioners should only use items which&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
relate to their particular practitioner grouping, and</li>
		<li>
the service provider meets the item description</li>
		</ul>
<p>Other factors taken in to consideration in structuring attendance items are location, for example, surgery, home or hospital.</p>

<p>Professional attendances by medical practitioners cover consultations during which the practitioner&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
evaluates the patient's health-related issue/s using certain health screening services if applicable</li>
		<li>
formulates a management plan in relation to one or more health-related issues for the patient</li>
		<li>
provides advice to the patient and/or relatives (if authorised by the patient)</li>
		<li>
provides appropriate preventive health care; and records the clinical detail of the service(s) provided to the patient</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Non-vocationally recognised medical practitioners </strong></p>

<p>From 1 July 2018 non-VR MPs practising in metropolitan areas (Modified Monash Model 1) will&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
continue to bill Group A2 items for standard GP services</li>
		<li>
continue to bill Group A19 items for attendances associated with Practice Incentive Payments, and</li>
		<li>
bill the relevant Group A7 items for all other eligible services</li>
		</ul>
<p>Non-VR GPs providing services in MMM 2–7 locations will be able to access all of the new items under Group A7 they are eligible for.</p>

<p>The Modified Monash Model (MMM) designation of any location can be identified using the DoctorConnect locator map, see the <a href="../your-health/011-42040000-05.html">Resources</a> page for a link.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>All professional attendance items only attract benefits if they have been personally performed by a medical practitioner.</p>

<p>Professional attendance items (other than an attendance on a person in the course of a group session) only attract benefits if the service has been provided on no more than one patient on the one occasion. Two or more patients cannot be attended simultaneously, although patients may be seen consecutively.</p>

<p>The requirement of 'personal performance' is met whether or not assistance is provided in the performance of the service according to accepted medical standards.</p>

<p>Accepted medical standards will determine the nature and extent of the assistance required, guiding the choice of individual best placed to provide that assistance. This may vary with each service provided.</p>

<p>In considering whether assistance is being provided according to accepted medical standards, the medical practitioner should take into account whether the nature and extent of assistance would be considered acceptable to the general body of medical practitioners.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
a continuous period of employment within a 24 hour period (a shift) where a medical practitioner (general practitioner or other medical practitioner) is employed or contracted to provide services to private patients in a private hospital</li>

a period during which a medical practitioner (general practitioner or other medical practitioner) renders a professional attendance to each of one or more private patients at a hospital, and in order to provide that service or services the medical practitioner has travelled to the hospital from a distant location, such as a surgery or place of residence</li>

<p>Where doctors have arrangements with a local hospital to routinely use out-patient facilities to see their private patients, the appropriate surgery consultation item applies.</p>

<p>The benefits for these items are based on both the time spent with the patient and the number of private patients visited on the one occasion.</p>

<p>Medical practitioners should use the item number appropriate to the time spent with each patient and advise the number of private patients seen on their invoice or Medicare claim.</p>

<p>Where a medical practitioner sees a mixture of private and public patients on the one occasion, only the private patients are counted when determining the benefit. If the medical provider sees 8 patients, of which 3 are public patients, the benefit is calculated based on 5 patients.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
part of a formal or informal training program</li>
		<li>
undertaken to improve a person's professional skills, for example, mental health medical and paramedical personnel who are required or encouraged by their employer to undergo a course of psychotherapy</li>
		<li>
attendance for treatment concurrent with, though not a part of, a training program</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Interview of a person other than the patient</strong></p>

<p>There are provisions in the MBS which enable investigative interviews of a patient's relatives or close associates to determine whether the particular problem with which the patient presented was focused in the patient or in the interaction between the patient and the person being interviewed. This does not necessarily involve a psychiatric assessment of that person. These items do not cover counselling of family or friends of the patient.</p>

<p>Family group therapy items (items 170 to 172 for GPs and 221 to 223 for non-VR MPs) refer to group therapy services supervised by a medical practitioner other than a consultant psychiatrist. Medicare benefits are only payable if the group therapy is conducted by the medical practitioner themselves.</p>

<p><strong>Group psychotherapy</strong></p>

<p>Group psychotherapy and family group psychotherapy items (items 342 to 346) apply when group psychotherapy is rendered by a consultant psychiatrist.</p>

<p><strong>Family related consultations</strong></p>

<p>A joint attendance by both partners for family planning or sex counselling attracts benefits once only under the appropriate consultation item. Questioning or advice given to one partner independently during the course of the consultation would not constitute a separate attendance.</p>

<p>An interview with a partner or family member (who is not the patient), for example, for the purpose of explaining the nature of sterilisation and obtaining consent for the operation, or to give advice/discuss treatment, does not attract benefit.</p>

<p><strong>Marriage guidance counselling</strong></p>

<p>Benefits are not payable for marriage guidance counselling. While Level D consultations provide for counselling, it is only in the context of implementing the patient's medical management plan.</p>

<p><strong>Special provisions for specified conditions - Item 319</strong></p>

<p>Item 319 was introduced to allow patients suffering from certain psychiatric disorders to obtain Medicare benefits at the higher level for an additional number of services (up to 160 in a calendar year).</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of the consultant psychiatrists to ensure a patient meets the criteria for item 319. Account documentation does not need to be annotated when item 319 is used. Post payment checking is used to ensure Medicare benefits are paid in accordance with the clinical requirements of the item.</p>

<p>Where a patient exceeds 160 services in a calendar year, further clinically required services claimed using item 319 are payable under the lower level benefit item (310 to 318). If the psychiatrist has not advised the attendance time on the account documentation the claim must be rejected as there is insufficient information to correctly identify the correct item number to use.</p>

<p><strong>Limitations on the number of referred psychiatric service</strong></p>

<p>While there are a specific number of services available under the higher level of benefit items and item 319 each calendar year, there is no limit on the number of times a lower level benefit item can be used.</p>

<p>There is no calendar year limit to the number of psychiatric services which can be claimed for referred psychiatric services taking place as home visit, hospital or nursing home attendances.</p>

<p>For information regarding referred psychiatric attendance items see MBS online.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>A number of procedural services not listed as MBS items are regarded as forming part of a consultation are identified in the general explanatory notes of the MBS. The requirement of 'physical performance' by the medical practitioner must be met for benefits to be payable on an attendance basis. If any doubt exists as to whether a service should attract benefits on an attendance basis, please seek advice from the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) contacts.</p>

<p>Some services are precluded from attracting benefits, for example, medical examination for life insurance purposes or removal of tattoos. In these circumstances, the service does not attract benefit on an attendance basis, see <a href="../your-health/011-42020000-01.html">Services which do not attract Medicare benefits</a> for a detailed listing of excluded services.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>Items relating to consultations by a specialist or consultant physician only apply where the patient has been referred. Itemisation is based on whether the consultation is an initial or subsequent attendance (excepting a minor consultation by a consultant physician) and where the consultation takes place, for example, consulting rooms, hospital, nursing home or home visit.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the patient has not been referred, benefits are payable at the non-referred medical practitioner consultation level unless the practitioner is also a vocationally registered general practitioner.</p>

<p><strong>Minor attendance by a consultant physician</strong></p>

<p>The Health Insurance Regulations 2018 provide that a minor consultation is regarded as being a consultation in which the assessment of the patient does not require the physical examination of the patient and does not involve a substantial alteration to the patient's treatment.</p>
