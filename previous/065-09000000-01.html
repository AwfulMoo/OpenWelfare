<p>The Aged Care Calculation of your cost of care forms are located on the Services Australia website. They are available as a dynamic digital form or paper form. The <a href="../older-australians/065-09000000-05.html">Resources</a> page has a link to the forms and an explanation of which forms are required.</p>

<p>Explain the benefits of accessing the forms online to the care recipient or nominee. For example, the dynamic digital form (SA486) is intuitive and adjusts the questions according to the care recipient’s circumstances and the answers they give. It also provides early warnings if they may not be eligible and a document checklist that adjusts based on the applicant’s responses. </p>

<p>Encourage applicants to access the forms from the website themselves, where possible. If the applicant is unable to complete the digital form, they can print and complete a paper form (SA456, SA457 or SA485). If an applicant is unable to access the form online, issue the form using the Customer First Mail Forms Guided Procedure.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58; </strong>to<strong> print </strong>the SA486 <strong>all </strong>questions must be answered<strong>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>SA486 (digital) form&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
collects income and asset details for permanent residential aged care purposes or an income assessment for home care</li>
		<li>
is a dynamic digital form that only asks questions relevant to the individual’s circumstances. This will shorten the time taken to complete the form</li>
		<li>
care recipients should be encouraged to use this form where possible</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p><strong>SA456 (home care) and SA457 (residential aged care) forms&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
are required when a care recipient does not receive a means tested payment from Centrelink or Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA)</li>
		<li>
request all income and asset information required for the completion of a means assessment</li>
		<li>
The SA456 form was previously titled &#160;Aged Care Fees Income Assessment<strong> </strong>and the SA457 was previously titled Permanent Residential Aged Care - Request for a Combined Assets and Income Assessment</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p><strong>SA485 (residential aged care property details) form&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
may be used when a care recipient receives a means tested payment from Centrelink or DVA and owns or part owns their home, including retirement villages, if a verbal assessment is not able to be completed</li>
		<li>
is shorter than the SA457 form, and only collects information related to the principal home</li>

<p><strong>Downloading the Aged Care Calculation of your cost of care (SA486) digital form</strong></p>

<p>The best way to download the Aged Care Calculation of your cost of care (SA486) digital form&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Go to the Services Australia website and search Aged Care Calculation of your cost of care (SA486)</li>
		<li>
From the form page, right click on the link Aged Care Calculation of your cost of care form and select ‘<strong>save link as’</strong>. Save the document to a PC or tablet</li>
		<li>
To open the saved document from a PC or tablet right click on the saved document. Select ‘Open with’ and choose ‘Adobe Acrobat Reader’</li>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when opening the saved document, there may be a message saying ‘<strong>Please wait</strong>’. If this occurs, users should select the ‘<strong>Enable All Features</strong>’ yellow button on the top right hand side of the screen. The form will open.</p>

<p>There is a change to the request for information (RFI) process for carers and close relatives when assessing Aged Care Calculation of your cost of care forms (SA457, SA485 and SA486). The Aged Care Carer or close relative assessment (SA483)<i> </i>form replaces the decommissioned questionnaire.

<p><strong>Liability for accommodation costs</strong></p>

<p>The care recipient’s status, set at the date of permanent entry to care, determines liability for accommodation costs. The status will be either <strong>low means</strong> or <strong>not low means</strong>.</p>

<p>A <strong>low means</strong> care recipient is eligible for assistance with their accommodation costs. They can be asked to pay either&#58;</p>

an Accommodation Contribution. This is a partial contribution towards the accommodation cost (the government will pay the remainder)</li>

no accommodation costs. The government will pay the full accommodation cost</li>

<p>A <strong>not low means</strong> care recipient is not eligible for government assistance with their accommodation costs. They must pay an Accommodation Payment (that is, the accommodation price they agree to with the service provider). The accommodation price must be agreed to before entry to care.</p>

<p>The care recipient’s status will not change following entry to care, even if there are changes to their circumstances.</p>

<p>For <strong>low means</strong> care recipients, a change in circumstances after entry to care&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
may affect the amount of accommodation contribution and/or means tested fee payable</li>
		<li>
will not make them liable for an accommodation payment while they remain in the same facility</li>

will not affect the accommodation price that was agreed to prior to entering care</li>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Residential_car02">Residential care means assessment - pre 1 July 2014 schemes</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Prior to 1 July 2014, a means assessment was known as a Residential Care Assessment (RCA). The RCA covered 2 different types of assessment&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Residential Care Income Assessment (RCIA), and</li>
		<li>
Residential Care Assets Assessment (RCAA)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Income Assessments</strong></p>

<p>Aged Care Income Assessments (previously known as RCIA) are applicable for care recipients who&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
first entered permanent residential care after 1 March 1998 and prior to 1 July 2014, and </li>
		<li>
have not had a break in care of greater than 28 days since 1 July 2014</li>
		</ul>
<p>The income assessment determines the daily income tested fee amount. If no means assessment is completed, care recipients are liable for the full cost of their care. An income assessment could be completed at the time of entry or a care recipient could subsequently choose to complete an <a href="../older-australians/065-19041705-01.html">income assessment</a> at a later date.</p>

<p><strong>Assets Assessments</strong></p>

<p>Aged Care asset assessments (previously known as RCAA) are required for care recipients who first entered permanent residential care after 1 July 2005 and prior to 1 July 2014, and have not had a break in care of greater than 28 days since 1 July 2014.</p>

<p>Applying for an assets assessment is voluntary. It is compulsory where the care recipient wishes to claim either concessional, assisted, or supported resident status. <a href="../older-australians/065-19042305-01.html">Assets assessments</a> can be completed either prior to, or after entry into care.</p>

<p>Prior to July 1 2005 the service provider completed these.</p>

<p>The assets assessment determines the amount payable for accommodation costs. The care recipient will be liable for one of the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Accommodation Bond&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
For those in low level care and extra service places</li>
			<li>
Amount payable is dependent on the assets assessment</li>
			<li>
Can be paid as a daily amount or as a lump sum</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Accommodation Charge</li>
			<ul>			<li>
For those in high level care</li>
			<li>
Can only be paid as a daily amount</li>
			<li>
Depending on the date that the care recipient first entered care, different rules regarding this charge apply. Further information regarding these rules is available on the <a href="../older-australians/065-09000000-05.html#bp05_L2GT_External_Websit">Resources</a> page linking to the Department of Health and Aged Care – Residential Care Fees and Charges for residents that entered care before 1 July 2014</li>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A care recipient who chooses not to have their means assessed is not eligible for government assistance with their fees except in the circumstances of annual and lifetime caps. They are deemed to be means not disclosed (MND) and are liable for the maximum care fee based on the cost of their care. Residential care recipients who are MND are also liable for an Accommodation Payment.</p>

<p><strong>MND Letters</strong></p>

<p>Where a care recipient has&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
commenced care and does not have a valid means assessment&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
An MND initial letter is sent requesting they lodge an Aged Care Calculation of your cost of care form</li>
			<li>
If no response is received following the MND initial letter, an MND reminder letter is sent (unless the care recipient advises that they do not wish to disclose their means) </li>
			<li>
If no response is received following the MND reminder letter (or if the care recipient has advised that they do not wish to disclose their means), the MND final letter is sent. The letter advises that they are now deemed to be MND and are liable to pay the maximum fees for their level of care</li>		</ul>
		<li>
not commenced care and has advised they do not wish to disclose their means&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
MND letters are not sent before the care recipient has commenced care</li>
			<li>
When care has commenced, the MND final letter is sent. This advises that they are deemed to be MND and are liable to pay the maximum fees for their level of care</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>Details of MND letter types are available in the <a href="../older-australians/065-20110349-05.html">Aged care letter codes and descriptions</a>.</p>

<p>Where a calculation of your cost of care application has commenced, but documentation required to complete the assessment is not received, a written request for information will be issued. The care recipient is deemed to be MND if they fail to provide the requested information.</p>

<p><strong>MND and responsible department/agency</strong></p>

<p>For care recipients who entered care <strong>prior</strong> to 1 July 2019, the agency managed the MND process for <strong>all</strong> care recipients. </p>

<p>For care recipients entering care <strong>from</strong> 1 July 2019, the department/agency <strong>responsible</strong> for completing the means assessment, for example, Services Australia or Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA) manages the MND process.</p>

<p>Care recipients may commence home or residential care with the DVA as the responsible department, and during their care period, the responsibility may change to Services Australia. Where change of responsibility occurs Customer First will receive an entry event to create an RCA/HOM or RCA/NCL. The date of entry on <strong>RCIRC</strong> will display the <strong>date</strong> the responsible department <strong>changed</strong> not the actual date of entry into care. The change in responsibility date is the date of event for coding a means assessment.</p>
