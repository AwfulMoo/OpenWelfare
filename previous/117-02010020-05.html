If a debt has been waived in the period, the debt remains waived unless it is a small debt waiver. The <strong>Lump Sum Assessment Results</strong> screen will need to be adjusted to add back in debts waived because they were less than $50</li>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">
		<ul>		<li>
&quot;When a person receives a lump sum payment of compensation, Centrelink uses a formula to calculate a non-payment period, referred to as the ‘preclusion period’, during which there is no entitlement to most social security income support payments&quot;</li>
		<li>
&quot;During this period you are not able to receive income support from Centrelink&quot;</li>
		<li>
&quot;It is important to note that your partner does not have a preclusion period and may continue receiving an income support payments subject to the appropriate income and assets tests&quot;</li>
		<li>
&quot;It is important to note that you understand that you need to use some of the money you receive from your settlement to support you for the duration of your preclusion period and to cover all your living costs. Please refer to the back of your letter for more details&quot;</li>
		<li>
&quot;If you use some of your compensation settlement to buy assets (for example purchase or pay off a house or buy a car), you should make sure that you still leave enough aside to live on during the preclusion period. If you don’t do this and then ask Centrelink to review your preclusion period then you will be expected to use or sell the asset for income support throughout the preclusion period. Preclusion periods can only be shortened if you can show that there are unusual, uncommon, or exceptional circumstances that have caused your hardship. You will be expected to be able to support your claims with evidence&quot;</li>
		<li>
&quot;You may also be interested in talking with a Centrelink Financial Information Service Officer who can help you make decisions about your investment and financial situation. The service is free, independent and confidential. You can call 132 300 to make an appointment with a Financial Information Service Officer&quot;</li>

<p>What is a lump sum preclusion period?</p></td>
<td>

<p>&quot;If you receive a lump sum payment, we may apply a preclusion period, which is a period of time you may not be able to receive an income support payment. This means the money you receive is to support you for the duration of your preclusion period and cover all your living expenses.&quot;</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

<p>What happens if I received a Centrelink payment in the preclusion period?</p></td>
<td>

<p>&quot;If you have received Centrelink payments during the preclusion period (non-payment period), you may have a debt. Generally, this will be deducted from the lump sum payment before it is paid to you.&quot;</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

<p>How does a lump sum compensation payment affect my partner's Centrelink payments?</p></td>

<p>&quot;It is important to note that your partner does not have a preclusion period and may continue receiving an income support payment subject to the appropriate income and assets tests.&quot;</p></td>

<p>Can I buy a house or pay off my house?</p></td>

<p>&quot;If you use some of your compensation settlement to buy assets (for example, purchase or pay off a house or buy a car), you should make sure that you still leave enough aside to live on during the preclusion period.

<p>What payments are affected by compensation?</p></td>
<td>

<p>&quot;Compensation affects most Centrelink income support payments. Payments impacted by compensation are called ‘compensation-affected payments’ and are defined in the Social Security Act 1991. Age Pension and Disability Support Pension customers who are blind are paid free of the income and assets tests but are affected by the compensation provisions of the Social Security Act 1991.&quot;</p></td>

<p>What payment is not affected by compensation?</p></td>

<p>&quot;Widows Pension, Wife Age Pension, Bereavement Allowance, Carer Allowance and Mobility Allowance.&quot;</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

<p>Is Family Tax Benefit affected by compensation rules?</p></td>
<td>

<p>&quot;No. The compensation rules do not affect the Family Tax Benefit. However, compensation payments may include a component of taxable income. It is this component that is included as income for Family Tax purposes. For information on the effect of compensation payments on entitlements to Family Tax Benefit or other family assistant payments, please visit <strong>serviceaustralia.gov.au\family tax benefit</strong>&quot;</p>

<p></p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

<p>Can I get a Health Care Card in the preclusion period?</p></td>

<p>&quot;To test your eligibility for a Health Care Card, you should contact your local Centrelink office, which can assist in reducing your pharmaceutical costs.&quot;</p>

<p></p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

<p>What happens if I do not have any money left and I am still in my preclusion period?</p></td>
<td>

<p>&quot;If you do not agree with a decision we have made about your payments, you have the right to ask for a formal review of the decision. For more information about review and appeal rights, visit <strong>servicesaustralia.gov.au/reviews and appeals</strong>&quot;</p>
