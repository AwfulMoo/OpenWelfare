<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> job seekers may be employed as casual or part-time under YBWS. These job seekers may not be paid enough employment income to reduce their income support payment to nil.

<P>How to identify if a job seeker is employed under the YBWS initiative:</P>
<UL>
<LI>information will display on the <STRONG>Participation Summary</STRONG> screen in Customer First, under the Subsidy heading and will include the job seeker's start date with the initiative</LI>
<LI>YBWS information may be displayed on the <STRONG>Participation Summary</STRONG> screen even though the customer may not be suspended (SUS) or cancelled (CAN), that is, they could be reporting income within a 6 fortnight nil rate period or reporting income that is below the income test limit</LI>
<LI>the YBWS information will display as 'no current information' where the job seeker is not a current YBWS participant. This could be because they have had payment restored within the 26 week suspension period or where their income support payment is cancelled at the end of the 26 week suspension period</LI>
<LI>previous periods in YBWS will be included under the History heading</LI></UL>
<P>Has the job seeker contacted Services Australia within the 26 week suspension period?</P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Yes</STRONG>, and:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>the job seeker advises they have not commenced employment under the YBWS incentive <STRONG>and</STRONG> is incorrectly coded as YBS suspend, <A href="../job-seekers/001-17030800-03.html#bp03_tbl_Youth_Bonus_Wag_Step03">go to Step 3</A></LI>

<P>If there has been no contact from the job seeker and the YBWS 26 week suspension period has ended, the job seeker's payment will auto-change from suspended to cancelled with the reason '<STRONG>YBE</STRONG>'. A cancellation advice letter will be issued to the job seeker.</P>
<P>Once this has happened, their income support payment cannot be restored and the job seeker will have to lodge a new claim, if they wish to claim an income support payment.</P>
<P>The customer can apply for a formal review of the cancellation decision. For more details about reviews and appeals, see <A href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/109-02000000-01.html">Request for an explanation, quality check or review (CLK)</A>.</P>

<P>Where the reason for ceasing employment is the fault of the job seeker and, the reason for ceasing employment has been confirmed by evidence on the Employment Separation Certificate (SU001), or from other evidence provided, the payment is <STRONG>not</STRONG> to be restored.</P>

<P><STRONG>Cancelling the income support payment</STRONG></P>
<P>Cancel the payment from the date the job seeker ceased employment using the '<STRONG>Verify Employment Separation</STRONG>' guided procedure to correctly cancel the job seeker's payment.</P>
<P>The evidence provided by the job seeker or their employer must include information on any leave or redundancy payments received by the job seeker on termination from the employer.

<P>The job seeker's payment will auto-change from suspended to cancelled with the reason '<STRONG>YBS</STRONG>'. A cancellation advice will be issued to the job seeker.</P>
<P>Once this has occurred their income support payment cannot be restored and the job seeker will have to lodge a new claim if they wish to claim an income support payment.</P>
<P><STRONG>Advising the job seeker</STRONG></P>
<P>Advise the job seeker their income support payment has been cancelled, if the job seeker is not present make one genuine contact attempt. If the job seeker still requires an income support payment they must lodge a new claim.</P>
<P>The job seeker must be advised that an unemployment preclusion period may apply, if an unemployment failure has been committed due to voluntary unemployment or dismissal due to misconduct.</P>
<P>If the contact attempt is:</P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>successful or the job seeker is present</STRONG>, record discussion information within the <STRONG>Notes</STRONG> tab of the <STRONG>Cease Employment - Change of Circumstance</STRONG> activity</LI>
<LI><STRONG>unsuccessful</STRONG>, record this information within the <STRONG>Notes</STRONG> tab of the <STRONG>Cease Employment - Change of Circumstance</STRONG> activity</LI></UL>

<P><STRONG>Continuity dates</STRONG> - Existing continuous period on payment rules will apply to restorations. For example, if a customer is restored after being suspended for more than 13 weeks, continuity dates will be auto-reset as the date payment recommenced.</P>
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> if the payment does not restore when expected after completing the guided procedure, the record will need to be checked to determine what is preventing the restoration from completing. Any incorrect information will need to be updated before the payment can be restored.</P>
<P>Some possible (but not limited to) reasons could include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>End date the job seeker's full-time work on the Customer Employment Status Update (<STRONG>EAES</STRONG>) screen, or</LI>
<LI>Key a 'zero' income against the last employer that the job seeker had, or</LI>

<P>Once a customer is restored from a YBWS suspension period, the 26 week YBWS period ends. If they then return to work they must advise, and normal Return to Work (RTW) provisions are applied.
