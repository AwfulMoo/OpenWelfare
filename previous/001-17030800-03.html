<p>Notification from the Department of Education, Skills and Employment will be received, advising the job seeker has commenced employment under the YBWS. The job seeker's income support payment will auto-suspend for a period of 26 weeks when the job seeker loses qualification for payment. The income support payment will suspend using reason '<strong>YBS</strong>' and a notification letter will be issued advising the job seeker that they have commenced the suspension period.</p>

<p>To identify if a job seeker is employed under the YBWS initiative, Service Officers can review the <strong>Participation Summary</strong> screen in Customer First under the <strong>Subsidy</strong> tab.</p>

<p>Job seekers placed in the YBWS initiative will be exited from their jobactive or Transition to Work (TTW) provider when they commence the 26 week suspension period. They will not become Services Australia managed. The YBWS job seeker will remain provider managed until their income support payment cancels or they return to their income support payment.</p>

<p>If there is no contact from the job seeker at the end of the 26 week suspension period, the job seeker's payment will auto-change from suspended to cancelled with the reason '<strong>YBE</strong>'. A cancellation advice letter will be issued to the job seeker.</p>

<p>Once this has happened, their income support payment cannot be restored and the job seeker will have to reclaim if they wish to claim an income support payment.</p>

<p>The customer can apply for a formal review of the cancellation decision. For more details about reviews and appeals, see <a href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/109-02000000-01.html">Request for an explanation, quality check or review (CLK)</a>.</p>

<p>Where the job seeker's employment has ceased due to no fault of their own, their income support payment can be restored.

<p>Where the reason for ceasing employment is the fault of the job seeker, the payment is to remain suspended until the reason for ceasing employment has been confirmed by evidence on the Employment Separation Certificate (SU001) or from other evidence provided.</p>

<p>If it is determined the payment is not to be restored&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
cancel the payment from the date the job seeker ceased employment using the <strong>Verify Employment Separation</strong> guided procedure, and</li>
		<li>

			<ul>			<li>
to submit a new claim if they want to receive an income support payment, and</li>

			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Cancelling the income support payment</strong></p>

<p>The <strong>Verify Employment Separation</strong> guided procedure must be used to correctly cancel the job seeker's payment.</p>

<p>The evidence provided by the job seeker or their employer must include information on any leave or redundancy payments received by the job seeker on termination from the employer. These payments are to be assessed and recorded on the <strong>Maintain</strong> screen in the guided procedure and applied under the existing <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-05020020-01.html">Income Maintenance Period (IMP)</a> rules.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the <strong>Verify Employment Separation</strong> guided procedure may display the IMP leave types in a different order on the <strong>Review</strong> screen compared to the Income Maintenance Period Summary (<strong>IMPS</strong>) screen. The overall IMP calculated start and end period in the guided procedure will be calculated correctly and display as per the <strong>IMPS</strong> screen calculation for the start and end date of the applied IMP.</p>

<p>Finish the <strong>Verify Employment Separation</strong> guided procedure and include comments within the <strong>Notes</strong> tab of the <strong>Cease Employment - Change of Circumstance</strong> activity advising the reason for cancellation.</p>

<p>The job seeker's payment will auto-change from suspended to cancelled with the reason '<strong>YBS</strong>'. A cancellation advice will be issued to the job seeker.</p>

<p>Once this has occurred their income support payment cannot be restored and the job seeker will have to submit a new claim if they wish to claim income support payment.</p>

<p>The customer can apply for a formal review of the cancellation decision. For more details about reviews and appeals, see <a href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/109-02000000-01.html">Request for an explanation, quality check or review (CLK)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Contact the job seeker</strong></p>

<p>Attempt to contact the job seeker by phone to tell them their income support payment has been cancelled and if they would like to receive an income support payment they must reclaim. The job seeker must be advised that an unemployment preclusion period may apply, if an unemployment failure has been committed due to voluntary unemployment or dismissal due to misconduct.</p>

<p>If the contact attempt is <strong>successful</strong> and the customer wants to reclaim, tell the customer to claim online. Include details from the customer's contact within the <strong>Notes</strong> tab of the <strong>Cease Employment - Change of Circumstance</strong> activity.</p>

<p>If the contact attempt is <strong>unsuccessful</strong>, record this information within the <strong>Notes</strong> tab of the <strong>Cease Employment - Change of Circumstance</strong> activity.</p>

<p>If the reason for ceasing employment is accepted and payment can be restored, action the restoration via the <strong>Verify Employment Separation</strong> guided procedure. The payment cannot be restored manually via the Benefit Action (<strong>BA</strong>) screen unless an error in recording the YBS indicator has been identified, see Step 4.</p>

<p>The payment can only be restored from the date of notification. There are no backdating provisions.</p>

<p>Any leave or redundancy payments received by the customer on termination from the employer are to be assessed and recorded on the <strong>Maintain</strong> screen in the guided procedure and applied under the existing <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-05020020-01.html">Income Maintenance Period (IMP)</a> rules.</p>

<p>If the <strong>Cease Employment - Change of Circumstance</strong> activity has not been completed upon finalisation of the guided procedure, manually change the status on the Change of Circumstances activity to '<strong>Completed</strong>'.</p>

<p>Any Centrepay deductions the job seeker had in place prior to commencing the 26 week suspension period and concession card entitlements will recommence.</p>

<p><strong>Continuity dates</strong> - Existing continuous period on payment rules will apply to restorations. For example, if a customer is restored after being suspended for more than 13 weeks, continuity dates will be auto-reset as the date payment recommenced.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the payment does not restore when expected after completing the guided procedure, the record will need to be checked to determine what is causing this. Any incorrect information will need to be updated before the payment can be restored.</p>

<p>Some possible (but not limited to) reasons could include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
End date the job seeker's full-time work on the Customer Employment Status Update (<strong>EAES</strong>) screen, or</li>
		<li>
Key a 'zero' income against the last employer that the job seeker had, or</li>
		<li>
Ensure that there are no outstanding previous reporting periods that have not been completed, or</li>
		<li>
End date the 'other income' on the Other Income Summary (<strong>OINS</strong>) screen, or</li>
		<li>
End date the job seekers full-time work from the Employment Paid (<strong>EAPP</strong>) screen</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> customers who turn 22 during the YBS suspension period may not be able to be restored using the <strong>Verify Employment Separation</strong> guided procedure. Refer to scenarios in <a href="../job-seekers/001-17030800-05.html">Resources</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Once a customer is restored from a YBWS suspension period, the 26 week YBWS period ends. If they then return to work they must advise, and normal RTW provisions are applied. The customer's payment will not re-suspend unless their employment services provider sent through a new second notification.
