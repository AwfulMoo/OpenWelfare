Body tissue biopsies for examples, pap smears</li>
		<li>
Bodily fluids</li>

<p>Pathology test results assist health professionals to diagnose and treat patients correctly.</p>

<p>Pathology services are located in Category 6 of the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS).</p>

<p>A health professional must register with Medicare as an Approved Pathology Practitioner (APP).</p>

<p>Pathology benefits are payable if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
either&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
performed by an APP who has an agreement, arrangement or contract of employment with the laboratory proprietor</li>

		<li>
a prescribed self-determined service by the APP as a result of a requested service</li>
		</ul>
<p>Non-approved pathology practitioners are limited to performing simple basic pathology tests. These tests are referred to as prescribed pathology services and listed in Group P9 of the Pathology Schedule.</p>

<p>APPs can also render prescribed pathology services in Group P9, but they usually itemise equivalent services from Group P1 to Group P8 of the Pathology Schedule.</p>

<p>There are specific conditions for both requesting and providing pathology services. </p>

<p><strong>Request for service</strong></p>

<p>A pathology service can only be provided&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
In response to a request from the treating health professional or from another Approved Pathology Practitioner (APP). The request must be in writing (or, if oral, confirmed in writing within 14 days)</li>
		<li>
In response to a request made or confirmed (within 14 days) by electronic means</li>
		<li>
If determined to be necessary by an APP who is treating the patient</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Services not attracting benefits</strong></p>

<p>Some tests are part of a normal consultation and do not attract an additional benefit. For example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
blood glucose estimation using Dextrostix and reflectance meter</li>
		<li>
blood urea estimation using Azostix or Testex reagents</li>
		</ul>
<p>Some tests do not qualify for benefits, for example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
certain tests of public health significance </li>
		<li>
tests for the purposes of control estimation, and </li>
		<li>
repeat tests (for example, for confirmation of earlier tests on the same specimen) </li>
		</ul>
<p>These services are available in the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) online explanatory notes for Category 6.</p>

<p>Benefits are not payable for a pathologist standing by during an operation where a specific service is not rendered.</p>

<p><strong>Required service details</strong></p>

<p>Benefits are not payable unless specified details are provided on the account, receipt or assignment form from the APP. </p>

<p>Before Medicare benefits are payable to an Approved Pathology Practitioner (APP), they must be&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
requested in writing by a medical practitioner, dental practitioner, participating nurse practitioner or a participating midwife, or</li>
		<li>
determined as necessary by the pathologist when treating their own patient</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Request guidelines</strong></p>

<p>A treating health professional can request a pathology service either orally, in writing or electronically. Oral requests must be confirmed in writing or electronically within 14 days of the request.</p>

<p>Requests must include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the patient’s details (name, address, date of birth, sex, Medicare card number, hospital status)</li>
		<li>
the requesting health professionals name and practice address or provider number</li>
		<li>
the tests required</li>
		<li>
the date of request</li>

<p>If a specific pathologist is not clinically necessary to provide the service, the patient can choose which they use. This includes Rule 3 exempt repeated tests.</p>

<p>The <a href="../your-health/011-42090000-05.html">Resources</a> page has links to MBS explanatory note PN.2.2 and Services Australia website – Referring and requesting Medicare services.</p>

<p><strong>Electronic request guidelines</strong></p>

<p>Electronic requests must include information as per written requests.</p>

<p>Required IT standards for electronic transmission, and storage of requests for pathology are published on the Services Australia website.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Retention of requests</strong></p>

<p>An APP must have a request in writing for all services before billing a patient.</p>

<p>An APP <strong>must</strong> retain requests and confirmation of requests for pathology services for a period of 2 years from the date of service.</p>

<p>Where tests are referred from one APP to another APP, the following applies&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
where only some of the tests are referred to a second APP the first APP retains the request</li>

		<div class="block">

<p>The Pathology Service Table (PST) is governed by rules.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Each rule is designed as per legislation and more than one rule can apply to a claim</li>
		<li>
Some rules allow services to be exempt from other rules under certain circumstances</li>
		</ul>
<p>Understanding these rules assists with assessing pathology claims. The assessing system automatically applies most pathology rules to claims.</p>

<p><strong>Interpretation of the rules for the Pathology Services Table</strong></p>

<p>Pathology rules 1, 2 and 3 collectively prevent the same pathology test item being claimed more than once per patient episode. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> this is unless it is subject to pathology rule 4, rule 6(4) or section 4B(3) of the Health Insurance Act 1973.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>A Patient Episode Initiation (PEI) fee is payable for all the specimens required to perform the tests requested in the patient episode. Generally only one PEI is payable per patient episode.</p>

<p>PEI fees are for the collection and management of specimens, not for the pathology tests themselves.</p>

<p>For example, if a health professional requests 3 pathology tests for a patient on the one day&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Medicare benefits will be payable for each test </li>
		<li>
Only one PEI will be applicable</li>

<p>However, certain rules allow for multiple PEIs on the one date of request. Four exceptions allow for the payment of more than one PEI service per patient episode&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
PEI item is claimed with Rule 3 Exemption (R3EX) endorsed eligible items</li>
		<li>
PEI item is claimed with Section 4B(3) endorsed eligible items</li>
		<li>
Group P5 (Tissue Pathology) items are billed by one APA, and&#58; </li>
			<ul>			<li>
another APA bills for items not in Group P5</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Group P6 (Cytology) items are billed by one APA, and&#58; </li>
			<ul>			<li>
another APA bills for items not in Group P6</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58;  the PEI payable under Rule 3 Exemption includes all items in the same patient episode, including Rule 3 exempt and non-Rule 3 exempt items. If further tests are required for the Rule 3 exempt item, then a subsequent PEI is payable for each of the subsequent payable tests.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Assessing_rules_for_">Exemption for pathology rules</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p><strong>Multiple services rule exemptions</strong></p>

<p>The pathology multiple services rule has 2 categories of exemptions&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
Rule 3 exemption (R3EX)</li>
		<li>
Section 4B(3) exemption (S4B(3))</li>
		</ul>
<p>These exemptions mainly apply for seriously or chronically ill patients</p>

<p>Where an exemption applies, the services are paid individually and the pathology multiple services rule is not applied.</p>

<p><strong>Rule 3 exemption</strong></p>

<p>The term ‘Rule 3 exemption’ (R3EX) describes an arrangement that allow for certain tests from the same request to be repeated over a 24 hour or 6 month period.</p>

<p>R3EX applies to specific MBS pathology items.</p>

<p>A health professional must endorse their account 'Rule 3 exempt' (or similar) when they deem additional pathology services necessary to&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
make or confirm a diagnosis</li>
		<li>
or to determine if a course of treatment is working</li>
		</ul>
<p>Rule 3 exemptions cannot be used to overcome an item restriction in the same episode. Restrictions between ‘Rule 3 exempt’ endorsed and non-Rule 3 exempt endorsed items must still be enforced. See <a target="_blank" href="../your-health/011-42090000-05.html#bp05_tbl_Rule_3_exempt_i01_6506065">Resources</a> page for some services exceptions. </p>

<p>If the account documents contain the notation ‘Rule 3 exemption’ or ‘R3EX’, the services can be paid individually. <strong>Note</strong>&#58; this is only if the criteria for Rule 3 exemptions are met.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The claim pays automatically when a 'Rule 3 exemption' flag is transmitted via an electronic claim channel and there are no errors/warnings</li>
		<li>
Where text is transmitted/notated with the claim endorsing ‘Rule 3’ or ‘R3EX’ will pay using reason code 366</li>
		</ul>
<p>The <a href="../your-health/011-42090000-05.html">Resources</a> page contains a table with Rule 3 exemption item rules. It includes which items are eligible for this exemption.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>S4B (3) exemption</strong></p>

<p>Section 4B (3) of the Health Insurance Act 1973 allows for a pathology test to be performed more than once in a patient episode. This is for a clinically relevant service in exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p>S4B (3) can apply to any MBS pathology item. This exemption overrides any relevant same day, time dependent or composite restrictions.</p>

<p>If account claim contains the notation ‘S4B (3)’, the claim must be escalated. This allows a delegate to determine whether the individual items are payable.</p>

<p><strong>Who is the Delegate?</strong></p>

<p>APS Level 5 and all higher levels for making decisions under Section 4B of the Health Insurance Act.</p>

<p>A Services Australia delegate is required to assess the information provided by the APP. The APP is required to provide text/notation stating why the tests were necessary.</p>

<p>Reasons that may be taken into consideration by the Agency’s delegate when reviewing requests for S4B(3) exemption are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The patient is seriously ill</li>
		<li>
Substantial additional expense was incurred</li>
		<li>
More than one test is clinically required</li>
		</ul>
<p>See Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) online Category 6 explanatory notes for information on the pathology multiple services rule and exemption criteria.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Rule 6 - Designated tests referred from 1 APP to another APP</strong></p>

<p>Where an APP has performed some tests but not all in a coned item, the remaining tests can be referred to a second APP. The second APP must be in a separate APA.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
APP (a) claims the appropriate item/s for the service they provided and the patient episode initiation fee</li>
		<li>
APP (b) claims the corresponding designated service and a specimen referred fee</li>
		</ul>
<p>Designated pathology services are exempt from coning. They are payable in addition to the 3 other pathology tests from the same patient episode (multiple services rule). </p>

<p></p>

<p>See Assessment of Pathology claims for a list of designated pathology items.</p>

<p>The <a href="../your-health/011-42090000-05.html">Resources</a> page has a link to the MBS explanation note N.0.11- Designated pathology.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Services not listed in schedule</strong></p>

<p>Pathology services that are not listed in the MBS do not attract a Medicare benefit. A health professional cannot use an existing item for a service which differs from the MBS item description.</p>

<p>A health professional or organisation seeking changes to the Schedule can make a submission to the Pathology Services Table Committee.</p>

<p>Enquiries should be directed to the Secretariat at the Department of Health.</p>

<p>Pathology submissions for new medical services and technologies should be forwarded to the Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC).</p>

<p>Tissue pathology services were previously known as histopathology and are located in Group P5 of Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) Category 6.</p>

<p>Item 72813-72838 in Group P5 are the basic tissue examinations. These items are generic in nature and are defined in terms of complexity levels and the number of specimens involved.</p>

<p>There are a range of complexity levels and each type of tissue pathology procedure is separately identified and given a complexity rating. The item being claimed depends on&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
the complexity level rating of the tissue pathology service being performed and </li>
		<li>
the number of separate specimens involved</li>
		</ul>
<p>For example, <strong>Group P5 – Tissue pathology</strong>&#58; <strong>item 72816</strong>.</p>

<p>Examination of complexity level 3 biopsy material on 1 or separately identified specimen with 1 or more tissue blocks, including&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
specimen dissection </li>
		<li>
all tissue processing </li>
		<li>
staining </li>
		<li>
light microscopy, and </li>
		<li>
professional opinion or opinions (Item is subject to rule 13)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> The above information is an example only and may not accurately reflect the current MBS.</p>

<p><strong>Additional add-on procedures</strong></p>

<p>Additional items are included to cover add-on procedures such as immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy and frozen section. They are claimable in addition to the basic tissue pathology items when ordered by the requesting health professional.</p>

<p>Benefit is only payable for one basic tissue pathology items (72813-72838) in a patient episode. Only the service with the highest schedule fee is payable in a patient episode when&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
more than 1 tissue pathology examination is performed on separate specimens of different complexity levels    </li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Separately identified specimens</strong></p>

<p>A <strong>separately identified specimen</strong> is&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
an individual specimen collected </li>
		<li>
identified so that it is clearly distinguished from any other specimen </li>
		<li>
sent for testing by or on behalf of the treating health professional responsible for the specimen collection  procedure. </li>
		</ul>
<p>This rule prevents inappropriate claims being made for multiple unidentified specimens under new changed tissue pathology items.</p>

<p><strong>Biopsy material</strong></p>

<p>Biopsy material is&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
all tissue (other than bone marrow biopsy) received by an APP from an operation, or group of operations at the same occasion, or </li>
		<li>
where the tissue was spontaneously expelled from the patient (spontaneous abortion)</li>
		</ul>
<p>This definition relates to biopsy items in Group P5. Biopsy material is not limited to one organ or one body area as biopsy items in Group P5 are for ‘all tissue’. For example, cell blocks from an ovary, fallopian tube and uterus cannot be considered as separate biopsy material.</p>

<p>The examination of the biopsy material attracts benefit once only under the appropriate item regardless of whether&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
one, or more than one service is performed</li>
		<li>
the services are rendered on the same day or on different days</li>
