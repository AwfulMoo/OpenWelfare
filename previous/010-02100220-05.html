<p><strong>FAA interstate travel approved for boarding school - cost effective</strong></p>

<p>Allira's permanent home is Minjilang, in the Northern Territory (NT). Allira has been granted the away from home rate of Living Allowance in March and will be enrolling into Aquinas College in Perth from the start of term 2. The most expensive journey from Minjilang to a location within NT, which has a boarding school/hostel, is Wangkana Kari Hostel, Tennant Creek.</p>

<p>At the time of assessment, no average fare costs have been determined for these intrastate and interstate locations.</p>

<p>Allira must travel from Minjilang to Darwin, before travelling from there to either Tennant Creek or Perth. The cost of travel between Minjilang and Darwin would be the same for both an intrastate or interstate journey. It can be disregarded, as it has no impact on the cost effectiveness comparison.</p>

<p>The Smart Centre assesses cost effectiveness using the average fare costs method&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Quotes are requested from the Travel Management Company (TMC) for the journeys from Darwin to Tennant Creek and from Darwin to Perth</li>
		<li>
Three quotes for each journey are requested to obtain fares costs as at the remaining term commencement dates in the relevant State/Territory that year</li>
		<li>
The TMC provides the following quotes, using Flex Fares where available&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Darwin to Tennant Creek&#58;<br>23/04/2019 - $849.00<br>23/07/2019 - $849.00<br>14/10/2019 - $849.00</li>
			<li>
Darwin to Perth&#58;<br>29/04/2019 - $638.00<br>22/07/2019 - $628.00<br>14/10/2019 - $648.00</li>		</ul>
		<li>
To calculate the <strong>intrastate</strong> average from the 3 quotes&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
$849.00 + $849.00 + $849.00 = $2547.00</li>
			<li>
$2547.00 / 3 = <strong>$849.00</strong></li>		</ul>
		<li>
To calculate the <strong>interstate</strong> average from the 3 quotes&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
$638.00 + $628.00 + $648.00 = $1914.00</li>
			<li>
$1914.00 / 3 = <strong>$638.00</strong></li>		</ul>
		<li>
The average interstate fare cost of $638.00 is less than the average intrastate fare cost of $849.00</li>
		<li>
Service Officers must use the Operational Blueprint feedback function to have the average fares list updated. Include the cost effectiveness assessment outcome and the quotes obtained. See the Definition of cost effectiveness and intent of interstate travel</li>		</ul></td>

<p><strong>FAA interstate travel approved for boarding school - cost effective</strong></p>

<p>Durahn lives at Maningrida, in the Northern Territory (NT) and wants to board at St Monica's College, Cairns, because related cousins are already boarding there. The most expensive journey from Maningrida to a location within NT, which has a boarding school/hostel, is Wangkana Kari Hostel, Tennant Creek.</p>

<p>Durahn must travel from Maningrida to Darwin, before travelling from there to either Tennant Creek or Cairns. The cost of travel between Maningrida and Darwin would be the same for both an intrastate or interstate journey and can be disregarded, as it has no impact on the cost effectiveness comparison.</p>

<p>The average fare cost of a flight from Darwin to Cairns is cheaper than the average fare cost of a flight from Darwin to Tennant Creek. Therefore, interstate travel can be approved, as it is more cost effective.</p></td>

<p>Stan lives in Alyangula, Groote Eylandt in the Northern Territory (NT) and wants to board at Brisbane Grammar School because an older sibling studies there. Stan's older sibling had already been approved for interstate travel on the basis that it was more cost effective. Therefore, Stan would also be approved for FAA to Brisbane.</p></td>

<p><strong>FAA interstate travel approved for boarding school – cousin under same carer already approved for interstate travel as cost effective</strong></p>

<p>Jada and Nikkaya are sisters, both boarding at Clontarf Aboriginal College, and are approved for interstate Fares Allowance, based on cost effectiveness.</p>

<p>Jada finishes Year 12 and leaves Clontarf Aboriginal College. Nikkaya remains enrolled and attending in Year 8.</p>

<p>Neve is Jada and Nikkaya’s cousin, and is in the care of their guardian. </p>

<p>Even though Jada is no longer at Clontarf, Nikkaya is still attending and the initial approval for interstate fares for Jada was based on cost effectiveness.</p>

<p>As such, Neve is approved for interstate travel to attend Clontarf Aboriginal College also.</p>

<p>The intent of the policy is to support siblings to attend the same school by approving interstate fares once one family member has been approved for interstate fares on the basis of cost effectiveness. This stops the need to undertake an assessment for cost effectiveness for each subsequent sibling or family member.</p>

<p><strong>FAA interstate travel assessment where the nearest major travel hub is interstate</strong></p>

<p>Cedric lives in Pukatja (Ernabella), South Australia (SA). Cedric wants to attend Clontarf Aboriginal College in Perth. As Cedric lives north of Adelaide, the most expensive intrastate trip should be assessed to Westminster School, Marion (a suburb of Adelaide).</p>

<p>The nearest major travel hub to Pukatja is Alice Springs. Cedric must travel from Pukatja to Alice Springs, before travelling from Alice Springs to either Adelaide or Perth. The cost of travel between Pukatja and Alice Springs would be the same for both an intrastate or interstate journey and can be disregarded, as it has no impact on the cost effectiveness comparison.</p>

<p>Although Cedric will be not travelling from a travel hub located in SA, the most expensive <strong>intrastate</strong> cost for Cedric should be assessed as the trip from Alice Springs to Adelaide. Similarly, the <strong>interstate</strong> cost should be assessed as the trip from Alice Springs to Perth.</p>

<p>The required information can still be located in the Interstate Cost Effectiveness Assessments spreadsheet, as the Alice Springs tab displays the average fare costs for travel between Alice Springs to Adelaide and Alice Springs to Perth, for various schools.</p>

<p>By comparing these costs, it is not considered cost effective for Cedric to travel to Clontarf Aboriginal College in Perth.</p></td>

<p><strong>FAA interstate travel not approved as cost effective - decision is appealed</strong></p>

<p>Brenton lives at Halls Creek in Western Australia and wants to study in Melbourne. A cost effectiveness assessment showed interstate travel was not approved. Brenton's parents paid for the travel in the first term and appealed the decision to reject the interstate travel. They lodged a claim for reimbursement along with the relevant invoices. The evidence provided confirmed that it was more cost effective for Brenton to travel to the interstate location and the rejection for interstate travel was overturned and approved.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> where an appeal is lodged against a decision not to approve interstate travel due to cost effectiveness, the applicant/student must lodge evidence to show it is more cost effective for the student to travel to the interstate location. This evidence must show a comparison of similar fares structures wherever possible. For example, a comparison of a Fully Flexible Business Class intrastate fare and a Restricted Economy Class interstate fare does not demonstrate cost effectiveness.</p></td>

<p><strong>FAA interstate travel not approved for Certificate level course - not a unique course</strong></p>

<p>Bruce's permanent home address is in Cairns. Bruce has successfully done a testing and assessment activity for entry into the Certificate in Dance delivered by the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts (WAAPA). Bruce correctly received FAA to do the Away from Base activity. Bruce has lodged a completed ABSTUDY claim for assistance to study full-time at WAAPA in the course.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Bruce is eligible for ABSTUDY Living Allowance for this course, but not eligible for FAA to travel from Queensland (QLD) to Western Australia (WA) to start the course. Bruce is not eligible for interstate travel to do the Certificate level course despite receiving FAA to be tested for entry to the course</li>
		<li>
Bruce appeals this decision stating that the WAAPA course is a special course only available in WA. Services Australia provides details of the course to Department of Social Services (DSS) for assessment of whether or not it qualifies as a unique course and its content or outcome is not available in Bruce's home state of QLD</li>
		<li>
DSS advise Services Australia that the course at WAAPA is not a unique course and similar curricula and outcomes are available from courses delivered at the QLD Academy of Dance. Services Australia tells Bruce via a review of decision that the original decision (that FAA is not available to do the Certificate in Dance at WAAPA) has been confirmed</li>		</ul></td>

Brianna qualifies for interstate travel for commencement and end of study travel to do the course. The Bachelor of Engineering has a compulsory 2 week placement as part of the minimum requirements for successful completion of the course. Brianna applies for interstate travel to do the activity in Melbourne at a relative's electrical engineering firm.</p>

<p>Brianna is not eligible for interstate FAA to do the activity in Melbourne, as similar placements are available in Sydney.
