<p>A system error may be present if changes are attempted to Real Estate Business (REBS) details and no updates have been made since the customer’s relationship status had changed. This will happen if the customer is single and the real estate is still recorded as partly or fully owned by the partner.</p>

<p>If this error is presented when attempting to apply changes to the Real Estate Business (<strong>REBS</strong>) details&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
print all pages, including historical pages, on the Real Estate (<strong>RE</strong>) screen, relating to the impacted property or business</li>
		<li>
delete the relevant entry in the Real Estate and Business (<strong>REBS</strong>) and in the same activity recode all relevant information including historical entries and the correct % ownership</li>
		<li>
Look at ex-partner’s record to check if property is still being assessed and if updates are needed. <strong>Do not</strong> use the information supplied by the customer to update the ex-partner’s record</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> This activity should not create any overpayment or arrears payment for the customer, if no other income and assets updates are completed in the same activity. Once the property details have been restated the Real Estate Business (<strong>REBS</strong>) should allow updates without the edit appearing.</p>

<p><strong>For an existing property&#58;</strong></p>

<p>See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-04130100-01.html">Maintaining the value of real estate assets on customer records</a>, for details of how the value of a current customer's real estate is indexed.</p>

<p>Procedure ends here.</p>

<p><strong>For a new or unrecorded property&#58;</strong></p>

<p>Where the customer advises of a new real estate asset, a net market value of the customer's real estate must be established by directing the customer to the relevant online service or issuing the customer with the following forms&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Real Estate form (MOD R), or</li>
		<li>
Income and Assets Update (SA220m) for Age Pension and Carer Payment (CP) customers (and Disability Support Pension (DSP) customers from mid-January 2010)</li>
		<li>
Business details form (Mod F). (Where the customer's real estate is used for business purposes a Mod F <strong>and</strong> a Mod R must be issued)</li>
		<li>
The Rural Property Questionnaire (Q454) is used in conjunction with the Mod R for medium to large farm properties. It collects more information from the customer for the valuer, to allow them to more correctly value the property from the roadside. Generally, if the property operates as a commercial enterprise, issue the Q454 in addition to the Mod R. The Q454 is not needed for smaller properties such as hobby farms with minimal farm improvements or bush blocks. Where the whole <strong>property is exempt</strong> because it is the principal home, or it is an exempt farm asset, do <strong>not</strong> issue a Q454 for that property. If required, issue the Rural Property Questionnaire (Q454)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a customer is conducting a business from their principal home, only the portion used exclusively for business purposes is assessed as an asset. Where part of the home is used for both domestic and business purposes, the Assets Test exempt status of the customer's principal home is retained, so a Mod R is not required.</p>

<p>If the customer is receiving a <strong>Blind Pension</strong>, only issue a Mod R and/or Mod F if they are being assessed for rent assistance or have a partner and the partner is not on a means test free payment. In these cases, details are still needed to determine rent assistance or the partner's rate.</p>

<p>A valuation that is <strong>higher</strong> than a previous valuation or a customer's estimate is applied from the first payday after it is received.</p>

<p>When a valuation is <strong>lower</strong> than a previous valuation or a customer's estimate, apply the date of effect rules.</p>

<p>Exceptions are where&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
there is evidence the customer deliberately misrepresented details of the asset&#58; the value may be applied from a date earlier than the valuation date</li>

<p>The legal structure of timeshare arrangements vary widely and can include a share in holiday homes/units, caravan parks, houseboats, etc. Do not request valuations for timeshare assets.</p>

<p>A Module R is not required in most circumstances. If the customer has provided evidence of the sale price or recent sale values then these will be accepted. The asset value of a timeshare depends on when it was purchased. If purchased&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
in the last 12 months, use the purchase price</li>
		<li>
more than 12 months ago, use the most recent sale price within that timeshare. Customers should be able to obtain this from the timeshare management</li>
		</ul>
<p>A timeshare asset has been purchased, sold or its value has changed.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the timeshare is already recorded on Other Assets (<strong>OAS</strong>) this must be ceased. From December 2015, timeshare in a property is assessed as a managed investment on a Direct Investment Account (<strong>SVDI</strong>)</li>
		<li>
To cease the timeshare assessment on <strong>OAS</strong>, code the following fields&#58;</li>
		<li>
<strong>Expand</strong> <img src="../resources/images/process_direct_small/Closed_chevron.PNG" alt="Closed chevron" title="Closed chevron" /> the time share investment</li>

<p>See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-04130100-01.html">Maintaining the value of real estate assets on customer records</a>, for details of how the value of a current customer's real estate is indexed.</p>

<p>Procedure ends here.</p>

<p><strong>For a new or unrecorded property&#58;</strong></p>

<p>Where the customer advises of a new real estate asset, a net market value of the customer's real estate must be established by directing the customer to the relevant online service or issuing the customer with the following forms&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Real Estate form (MOD R), or</li>
		<li>
Income and Assets Update (SA220m) for Age Pension and Carer Payment (CP) customers (and Disability Support Pension (DSP) customers from mid-January 2010)</li>
		<li>
Business details form (Mod F). (Where the customer's real estate is used for business purposes a Mod F <strong>and</strong> a Mod R must be issued)</li>
		<li>
The Rural Property Questionnaire (Q454) is used in conjunction with the Mod R for medium to large farm properties. It collects more information from the customer for the valuer, to allow them to more correctly value the property from the roadside. Generally, if the property operates as a commercial enterprise, issue the Q454 in addition to the Mod R. The Q454 is not needed for smaller properties such as hobby farms with minimal farm improvements or bush blocks. Where the whole <strong>property is exempt</strong> because it is the principal home, or it is an exempt farm asset, do <strong>not</strong> issue a Q454 for that property. If required, issue the Rural Property Questionnaire (Q454)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a customer is conducting a business from their principal home, only the portion used exclusively for business purposes is assessed as an asset. Where part of the home is used for both domestic and business purposes, the Assets Test exempt status of the customer's principal home is retained, so a Mod R is not required.</p>

<p>If the customer is receiving a <strong>Blind Pension</strong>, only issue a Mod R and/or Mod F if they are being assessed for rent assistance or have a partner and the partner is not on a means test free payment. In these cases, details are still needed to determine rent assistance or the partner's rate.</p>

		<li>
If the customer has a partially constructed home which is to be <strong>assessed</strong> on <strong>REBI</strong> as an asset, obtain the customer's estimate of the value of the property (usually the deposit amount).

the amount and frequency of the progress payments (customer must advise each time these payments are made)</li>

the amount of the progress payment which represents the labour costs (these should not be included in the value of the property)</li>

the customer's revised estimate of the value of the property (usually by adding the initial deposit and any progress payments)</li>

<p>Link new real estate to a business where it is unavoidable; for example, a non-primary production business where there is a liability over all business assets (real estate and other) and the value of the net business assets excluding the real estate are negative.</p>

<p>If linking is unavoidable, enter the details of the business first to link the real estate to the business record.</p>

<p>Exemptions from the Assets Test for house and curtilage may apply if the business real estate is also the customer's principal home and the customer satisfies the extended land use test. In this case or where the customer is using part of their principal home <strong>exclusively</strong> for the business, a valuation is not required and it is not coded on the Real Estate (<strong>RE</strong>) screen. The value of the portion used exclusively for business listed on a balance sheet or advised by the customer can be used and included in the business assets coded on the Business Details (<strong>BUS</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>Updates are required on the following 3 screens.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Code the Real Estate/Business Identifying (REBI) screen. The customer must uniquely identify the location of any real estate or business site they own or in which they have an interest. For more information, see <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-04130040-01.html">Address recording for real estate</a>. When coding is complete, press [<strong>Enter</strong>]</li>
		<li>

		</ul>
<p>For property <strong>used for business purposes</strong>, the completed Mod F must also be coded, see <a href="../business-and-employers/043-03060020-01.html">Assessing and coding the Business details for sole traders and partnerships Mod F</a>.</p>

<p>Customers who own real estate as 'tenants in common', have their legal share assessed based on the agreed ownership percentage, for example, if a customer owns 40% of the property, use 40% of the whole property value.</p>

<p>If the customer <strong>disposes of a real estate asset</strong>, do not update the property value. Code the <strong>% Asset Owned&#58;</strong> field as '<strong>0</strong>'.</p>

<p><strong>For overseas properties&#58;</strong></p>

<p>Using the Real Estate Update script, code asset values of overseas real estate on the Foreign Income and Assets (<strong>FID</strong>) screen. <strong>Do not code</strong> it on the <strong>RE</strong> screen. Code the asset value in the relevant foreign currency and the system will convert it to $AUD. The asset value automatically updates with variations in exchange rates each month.</p>

More than 12 months ago, use the most recent sale price within that timeshare. Customers should be able to obtain this from the timeshare management</li>

Code the full proceeds of the sale on either the Direct Investments (<strong>SVDI</strong>) screen or the Deposit Accounts (<strong>SVDA</strong>) screen. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> ensure the proceeds are only recorded once, so the asset is only counted once</li>
		<li>

		</ul>
<p><strong>Any money intended for purchasing or building another home</strong> can be exempted from the Assets Test for an initial 12 months with a possibility of an extension for another 12 months. However, regardless of the Assets Test exemption, the funds are assessed under the <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-05050000-01.html">deeming provisions</a>. If the customer uses part of the proceeds of sale to purchase a block of land or other assets to build a new home, these assets are also exempted under the Assets Test. This is provisional upon the joint value of the land and money exempt for the building of the new principal home does not exceed the total value from the proceeds for the sale of the old principal home. Record details of the purchase of the block of land in a <strong>DOC</strong> and adjust the balance of the proceeds of sale on <strong>SVDI</strong> or <strong>SVDA</strong>.</p>
