If a residency determination has never been made or the customers’ residency status has changed, a residency decision is required.

<p>Conduct Family and domestic Violence Risk Identification (as per initial <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/elements/macros/COADiscussion.html">COA Discussion macro</a>). <br>If the customer indicates there is a Family Domestic Violence issue and does not wish to proceed with the application for this reason, discuss whether a referral for a Centrelink exemption is appropriate. If not, consider whether a Capacity to Pay referral is appropriate. If yes, discuss this option with the applicant and whether or not they are agreeable to this referral.</p>

<p>If the customer mentions one of the following reasons for pursing a COA, explain that the COA process does not provide for&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a reduction from a minimum assessment (unless the paying parent has at least regular care)</li>
		<li>
a change for a period greater than 18 months before the COA application without leave from the court or greater than 7 years with the leave of the court</li>
		<li>
a change to the child support assessment in a way already determined by a court order or agreement that limits the ability to apply for COA</li>
		<li>
a change to a liability that is not an Australian administrative assessment</li>
		<li>
a change to the child support assessment when the COA application is made after the assessment for the child has ended, including when a court has granted the Child Support Registrar leave under Section 112 to make a determination for a specified period. For a Section 112 order to be considered in respect of a child the COA application must be lodged prior to the assessment ending for the child. Customers should be advised to obtain legal advice about seeking a court departure order in these circumstances</li>
		</ul>

		<ul>		<li>
Approximately <a href="../separated-parents/277-03120000-01.html">50 day timeframe</a> from lodgement to finalisation</li>
		<li>
The application must be on the approved form, signed by the applicant and include evidence and supporting documents</li>
		<li>
If the customer has multiple cases, they must lodge a separate COA application for each case they are seeking a change</li>
		<li>
Requirements for open exchange of information. Advise the following&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
'Change of assessment is an open exchange of information process which means your application and any supporting information, including verbal, third party and court information, will be exchanged with the other parent and information they provide will be exchanged with you'</li>
			<li>
'If there's information you don't want the other parent to see, you should either not include it or edit it from your documents (for example. you can remove your employer's name, bank details etc. from your payslip) but be aware any information you delete won't be considered in the decision'</li>
			<li>
'If you submit an application with information you do not want the other parent to see then you must withdraw your application then resubmit your application with the information you are prepared to exchange'</li>
			<li>
'If you plan to include information about third parties make sure you have discussed disclosing this information with them. For further information see the Child Support Guide 6.3.4, Collection and use of third party information'</li>
			<li>
'If you signed a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement, you may want to seek legal advice before sending documents in'</li>
			<li>
'Keep your application factual and free from offensive content, otherwise it will be considered ineligible and you'll need to re-apply'</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>See <a href="../separated-parents/277-09190000-01.html">Open exchange of information for Child Support customers</a></p>
		<ul>		<li>
The decision is made by a decision maker (DM). A final determination will be made once the circumstances of both parents have been considered</li>
		<li>
The respondent can cross apply under any of the 10 reasons. If this occurs the DM will also consider their cross application when making a decision</li>
		<li>
The DM is not limited to making the decision either parent requests. Even if a reason is established the DM may decide not to make a change</li>
		<li>
Changes to the assessment are generally given effect from the date of lodgement, however the date of effect is determined by the DM</li>
		<li>
Although the DM can review periods up to 18 months, to consider backdating the DM generally needs to be satisfied that exceptional circumstances existed which impacted the customer's ability to apply at an earlier date. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-03120010-04.html#bp04_L2LL_">References</a> page for a link to the Child Support Guide 2.6.1</li>
		<li>
If the customer believes backdating should be considered, they will need to provide evidence in their application. There is no guarantee past periods will be reviewed</li>
		<li>
In the event either parent is not satisfied by the decision, both parents will have the right to object to the decision within 28 days of receiving the written decision. If the applicant is either a non-parent carer, or one of the parents in a case involving a non-parent carer, all parties to their case are parties to the COA application - if they do not want to involve all parties they have the option of withdrawing their application</li>
		</ul>
<p>The DM will not communicate with a customer’s representative through the COA process unless they are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
A person appointed under an administration order to manage the financial affairs of a party, e.g. an administrator, public trustee or guardian. In such instances, that person is not considered to be representing the party because they are legally permitted to act as if they are the party</li>
		<li>
A person with an Enduring Power of Attorney that is acting for the party because the party is incapable of attending to, or making decisions concerning, their estate/affairs because of a medical condition (mental or physical)</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer wishes to proceed with the COA process, encourage them to download a COA application form from the Services Australia website. If they request a COA application form be sent to them, do this via the Products and Services window in Cuba, see the <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-30010510-01.html">Products and Services Cuba Process Help</a>. The <a href="../separated-parents/277-03120010-05.html">Resources</a> page has a link to the Application to Change your Assessment - Special Circumstances form (CS1970).</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; only issue COA forms where it is established that COA is an appropriate option. This will reduce the number of invalid, withdrawn or refused applications.</p>

<p>Utilise the <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/elements/macros/COADiscussion.html">COA Initial Discussion macro</a> to document the discussion with the customer then paste in the Communication window. The DM may rely on this information to provide background for their customer interactions or if they are unable to contact the customer.</p>

<p>Administrative remedies include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
an agreement, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-02010000-01.html">Agreements between Child Support customers</a></li>
		<li>
other types of provisional notional assessment variations (if the customer is applying for a COA to vary their provisional notional assessment), see <a href="../separated-parents/277-02020000-01.html">Notional assessment relating to child support agreements</a></li>
		<li>
a change in care, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-03040000-01.html">Change in child support care levels (post 1 July 2010)</a></li>
		<li>
updating an income, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-07010000-01.html">Income processing for Child Support customers</a></li>
		<li>
an estimate, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-07040000-01.html">Child support estimates (post 1 July 2010)</a></li>
		<li>
reviewing an estimate, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-07050000-01.html">Child support estimates review (post 1 July 2010)</a></li>
		<li>
reconciling an estimate, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-07060000-01.html">Child support estimates - Reconcile (from 1 July 2011)</a></li>
		<li>
a change to a fixed annual rate, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-03090000-01.html">Fixed annual rate not to apply applications (CS)</a></li>
		<li>
a non-agency payment, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-04230000-01.html">Non Agency Payments (NAPs) (CS)</a></li>
		<li>
reflecting a relevant dependent child in the assessment</li>
		<li>
under Reason 4 (child’s income), determining if the other parent wishes to end the case. This option may only be relevant if the child recently started earning an income</li>
		<li>
suspending the COA decision where there has been a change in circumstances, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-03120010-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Suspending_a_CO">Table 4</a></li>

<p>Encourage the customer to pursue an administrative option in the first instance, regardless of whether they can establish a reason for a COA. Discuss the potential administrative advantages which include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the change can be made immediately, avoiding the lengthy COA process</li>
		<li>
the change to the assessment is predictable, there is no contrary decision</li>
		<li>
other future changes in circumstance can be taken into account more easily</li>
		<li>
reduced risk of disrupting the customers' relationship through the exchange of personal or sensitive information or the adversarial nature of COA</li>
		<li>
less interference in the customers' personal affairs</li>

<p>In limited circumstances, the Registrar may suspend a COA decision, to give effect to a change of circumstances that has arisen since the decision was made. </p>

		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Payee ceases to be an eligible carer</strong></li>

<p>When the special circumstances no longer exist, the Registrar may amend the assessment to stop applying the COA determination.</p>

<p>When considering to suspend a COA decision, it needs to be clear that the change of circumstances was not taken into account as part of the decision. </p>

<p>The option to suspend a decision due to special circumstances ceasing is unlikely where a decision&#58;</p>
