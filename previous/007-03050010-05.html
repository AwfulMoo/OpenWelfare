<p><strong>Nil FTB fortnightly</strong></p>

<p>This payment option would suit families who&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
have a high annual family income, which is still expected to be under the <a target="_blank" href="../utils/RatesChart/rateschart.html?Incomelimits-">income limit at which FTB Part A paid fortnightly stops, not including supplement</a> and</li>
		<li>
if partnered, the lower income earner is not confident about estimating their income accurately</li>
		</ul>
<p>If suitable, they should <strong>be given the option</strong> of choosing FTB at nil rate or claiming FTB as a lump sum each financial year.</p>

<p>They <strong>should not</strong> be encouraged to choose FTB at nil rate in order to reduce the number of annual FTB lump sum claims lodged.</p>

<p>This option is different from cancelling FTB. FTB will remain current at nil rate (FTB/CUR-CZR). They will not need to claim FTB as lump sum after the end of the year. Any FTB will be paid automatically after the end of the financial year once actual income is known.</p>

<p>If they choose nil rate&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
They can choose to receive Rent Assistance (RA) fortnightly or annually</li>
		<li>
FTB Energy Supplement, Newborn Supplement (NBS)/Newborn Upfront Payment (NBU) will be included in the FTB reconciliation calculation. The Energy Supplement cannot be claimed fortnightly or quarterly</li>
		<li>
They will still receive a Health Care Card and can apply for an FTB advance if entitled based on their legislative rate of FTB Part A</li>
		<li>
If they have current withholdings from their FTB to repay a debt, they will need to make new repayment arrangements. See <a href="../debts/107-05010020-01.html">General Centrelink debt recovery information</a></li>
		<li>
If they had requested Centrepay deductions, they will need to make other arrangements</li>
		</ul>
<p>Their estimate of income must still be reasonable, even if they choose this payment option. FTB/CUR-CZR status could allow eligibility to other government assistance such as the Medicare Safety Net, <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-03030000-01.html">Child Dental Benefit Schedule (CDBS)</a> administered by Medicare and Insulin Pump Subsidy.</p>

<p>They must be made aware that they are still required to advise of any changes to their circumstances.</p>

<p>If they are receiving FTB Part A for a child from a previous relationship, remind them that, if they have not done so already, they are required to take reasonable action to obtain child support during the financial year, even if they choose to receive base or nil rate of FTB Part A. If the customer does not take action to obtain child support, they will not be eligible for more than the base rate of FTB Part A.</p></td>

<p class="info-box warning">This option is no longer available from 13 June 2015. If an FTB instalment customer had chosen this option, it ceased to apply from 1 July 2015. For the 2014-15 financial year, those who chose to defer payment for a child do not need to contact after the financial year as the child income limit was removed from 1 May 2014. FTB entitlement for the child will be automatically included in the FTB reconciliation calculation.</p>

<p>This option allowed families to defer payments for one or more children.</p>

<p>Until the child income limit was removed from 1 May 2014, this option allowed the family to defer payments for children they thought may have had income equal to or over the child income limit.</p>

<p>This option could be combined with another FTB payment choice, including Rent Assistance (RA) and Energy Supplement choices.</p>

<p>The child was included on the person's Health Care Card if they were entitled to the maximum legislative rate of FTB Part A.</p>

<p>When deferring FTB for their only FTB child, their ongoing FTB rate was nil. Any recovery of an FTB advance stopped.</p>

<p><strong>2013-14 and earlier financial years</strong></p>

<p>If they deferred payment for a child they would have had to contact after the end of the relevant financial year to report whether their child's income was below the FTB child income limit. The child income limit was removed from 1 May 2014, but was still applicable for the period 1 July 2013 - 30 April 2014.</p>

<p>This choice was recorded on the Child Entitlement Deferment (<strong>CHDF</strong>) screen.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> although no new instances of child deferral can be recorded, on or after 13 June 2015, existing deferrals can be revoked.</p>

<p><strong>Lump sum FTB claim</strong></p>

<p>This option would suit families who are not confident that they can accurately estimate their income for the relevant financial year, particularly if they think their income may be over the <a target="_blank" href="../utils/RatesChart/rateschart.html?Incomelimits-">income limit at which FTB Part A paid fortnightly stops, not including supplement</a>.</p>

<p>By claiming a lump sum after the end of the financial year, the family will be paid their exact entitlement based on their family's actual adjusted taxable income with no risk of being overpaid.</p>

<p>An FTB lump sum claim must be lodged by 30 June of the lodgement year. In addition to lodging a claim, income must be confirmed by either lodging tax returns with the ATO or advising Services Australia tax lodgement is not required, and providing a reasonable estimate of income for the financial year.</p>

<p><strong>Rent Assistance (RA)&#58;</strong> Families will need to also claim ongoing FTB instalments to be paid RA unless they are not eligible for FTB instalments.</p>

<p>Advise them if they will be claiming FTB Part A as a lump sum for a child from a previous relationship, they are required to take reasonable action to obtain child support during the financial year. If they do not take reasonable action and then claim via a lump sum claim, they will not be entitled to more than the base rate for the child/ren.</p>

<p><strong>Advance payments of FTB Part A</strong></p>

<p>Eligible customers can request to be paid lump sum <a href="../payment-delivery/103-05040040-01.html">FTB Part A advance payments</a> of part of their future FTB Part A entitlement. Ongoing FTB payments will be reduced to repay the advance payment.</p>

<p>To be eligible for an FTB advance payment a person must receive FTB Part A instalments. This includes FTB instalment customers who elect to defer part or all of their FTB Part A entitlement. All advance calculations are based on the person's legislative rate of FTB, prior to any reductions due to their FTB payment choice.</p>

<p>If they have an FTB regular advance arrangement in place, they may wish to also <a href="../self-service/133-04010000-01.html">cease the regular advance payment arrangement</a>.</p>

<p>If their legislative rate of FTB Part A rate falls below the advance payment recovery rate, all of their on-going FTB Part A entitlement will go towards repaying the advance/s and will extend the advance repayment period.</p>

<p>A debt will be raised for any FTB advance amount that has not been recovered where the customer's&#58;</p>

<p><strong>Energy Supplement</strong></p>

<p>The Energy Supplement is calculated separately for FTB Part A and FTB Part B.</p>

<p>Those receiving FTB fortnightly can choose to receive the Energy Supplement fortnightly or quarterly in arrears. Quarterly payments are made in October, January, April and July based on their first Entitlement Period Start Date (EPSD) after the end of the quarter. They can change their choice at any time. The change takes effect in line with other FTB payment choices.</p>

<p>How the Energy Supplement is paid depends on FTB Part A and Part B payment choices&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>FTB Part A fortnightly&#58;</strong> the Part A Energy Supplement is paid fortnightly by default. They can choose to receive the Energy Supplement quarterly in arrears instead</li>
		<li>
<strong>Base FTB Part A&#58;</strong> the Part A Energy Supplement is paid at base rate, fortnightly by default. They can choose to receive the Energy Supplement quarterly in arrears instead. Any extra Part A Energy Supplement will be included in the FTB reconciliation calculation</li>
		<li>
<strong>FTB Part A after financial year&#58;</strong> The Part A Energy Supplement will be included in the FTB reconciliation calculation</li>
		<li>
<strong>FTB Part B fortnightly&#58;</strong> The Part B Energy Supplement is paid fortnightly by default. They can choose to receive the Energy Supplement quarterly in arrears instead</li>
		<li>
<strong>FTB Part B after financial year&#58;</strong> The Part B Energy Supplement will be included in the FTB reconciliation calculation</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> persons receiving both FTB Part A <strong>and</strong> Part B fortnightly must receive the Part A Energy Supplement and Part B Energy Supplement the same way (either both fortnightly or both quarterly).</p>

<p>The FTB Energy Supplement is included when calculating their correct FTB entitlement at FTB reconciliation.</p>

<p><strong>To update</strong> the Energy Supplement payment choice, run the <strong>Family Income and Choices</strong> workflow.</p>

<p><strong>To view history</strong>, go to the Energy Supplement Quarterly Payment Choice History (<strong>FYCQ</strong>) screen. If nothing is recorded, the Energy Supplement is being paid fortnightly or annually depending on their FTB payment choice. If only a start date is recorded, the Energy Supplement is being paid quarterly (if they have not chosen to receive FTB annually). If an end date is recorded, they have chosen to no longer receive the Energy Supplement quarterly.</p>

<p><strong>FTB lump sum claims</strong></p>

<p>Those claiming FTB as a lump sum after the end of the financial year (for 2013-14 onwards) will have their Energy Supplement entitlement calculated when their claim is finalised.</p></td>

<p>Families should be made aware of how their payment choice may affect their NBS and NBU payments.</p>

<p><strong>Financial hardship</strong></p>

<p>Financial hardship needs to be considered on a case-by-case basis. For arrears to be paid a reasonable explanation must be provided by the person, supporting the fact that financial hardship would result if the payment of arrears was not granted. This information can be provided verbally, evidence is not required.</p>

<p><strong>Revoking payment choice due to financial hardship</strong></p>

<p>Kim and Todd have just had their first child and are uncertain of what their income will be for this coming year. Rather than take the risk of receiving an overpayment, they elect to receive the base rate of FTB Part A and wait until the end of the financial year to receive any additional FTB Part A they may be entitled to.</p>

<p>Part way through the year the family's income stabilises and they decide to revoke their choice, as the risk of an overpayment is now minimal. However, due to unforeseen medical expenses relating to their baby Toby, Kim and Todd ask for arrears of FTB A to be paid. Services Australia assesses the family's income and expenses and determines that the family could not reasonably meet their medical expenses and would experience considerable financial hardship if arrears were not paid.</p>

<p>The family's entitlement to FTB Part A will be determined based on their estimated family income and they will be paid arrears amounting to the difference between the entitlement and what they have already received.</p></td>

<p><strong>Example of revoking payment choice for Newborn Upfront Payment (NBU)/Newborn Supplement (NBS) to be paid</strong></p>

<p>Joseph and Louise are receiving FTB for their first child and currently have a nil rate FTB choice in place. They claim FTB on 1 April 2014 for their 2nd child born on 4 March 2014. In this claim they have requested to change their choice to receive all FTB payments fortnightly.</p>

<p>In order for NBU to be paid, the payment choice would need to be revoked from the date of birth (DOB) of the 2nd child (4 March 2014).</p>

<p>If the choice is not revoked, the change would only take effect from the date paid to (DPT) + 1, therefore resulting in NBS paying for the remaining period, but NBU would not be paid due to the change not including the first day of NBS eligibility (for example, child Date of Birth (DOB)).</p></td>
