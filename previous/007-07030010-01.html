		<div class="block">

<p>Families have 1 year from the end of an entitlement year to meet certain family assistance requirements. The one year period following the entitlement year is known as the lodgement year. These requirements include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
lodging an FTB lump sum claim, </li>
		<li>
lodging a SIFS claim, and </li>
		<li>
confirming income by either&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
lodging tax returns with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) or </li>
			<li>
advising they are not required to lodge a tax return</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>If families do not meet these requirements by the end of the lodgement year, then&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
FTB lump sum and SIFS claims will be rejected if they are lodged outside of the allowable time, and</li>
		<li>
FTB top ups and supplements will not be paid to instalment customers if income is confirmed late</li>
		</ul>
<p>Families may be granted an extension if they have special circumstances which prevented them from meeting their requirement/s by 30 June of the lodgement year. The extension may be granted up to the end of the extended lodgement year, but no later as there is no legislative provisions to do so.</p>

<p>A special circumstance extension cannot be granted for financial years prior to 2012-13 as there were no legislative provisions to do so.</p>

<p>Prior to the 2018-19 financial year, families who claimed FTB were able to seek a special circumstances extension to meet other requirements.</p>

<p>For FTB lump sum claim customers a special circumstances extension could be granted to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
meet <a href="../families/007-11010040-01.html">immunisation requirements</a> for a child until the end of the calendar year in which the child turned 19 (for the FTB Part A Supplement from the 2012-13 up to and including the 2017-18 financial years)</li>
		<li>
meet <a href="../families/007-11010050-01.html">health check requirements</a> for a child if the customer was impacted by the Healthy Start For School measure and the child turned 4 during the financial year (for the FTB Part A Supplement from the 2012-13 up to and including the 2017-18 financial years)</li>
		<li>
notify child education details for <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-03080000-01.html">Schoolkids Bonus</a> (from the 2012-13 up to and including the 2015-16 financial years)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Changes to the timeframe for FTB lump sum claim lodgement and income confirmation were promoted throughout the 2012-13 financial year. The <a href="../families/007-07030010-05.html">Resources</a> page contains questions and answers relating to the changes.</p>

<p><strong>Before undertaking a special circumstances assessment</strong>, staff must refer to the table in the <a href="../families/007-07030010-05.html">Resources</a> page containing information about circumstances for which an extension would <strong>not</strong> generally be granted.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Special circumstances are by their very nature incapable of precise or exhaustive definition. 'Special circumstances' are generally due to situations that are unusual, uncommon or exceptional and each situation must be assessed on an individual basis.</p>

<p>A special circumstances extension should only be granted in limited situations where the customer and/or their partner has been prevented from meeting the relevant requirements by the end of the lodgement year. The circumstances must be solely due to circumstances which are unusual or exceptional and are outside of the customer's control.</p>

<p>In all cases, consider why the customer was unable to meet the requirement within the allowable period. When assessing a special circumstances extension request, the nature of the event (or impacts associated with the event) must have had a significant impact on the customer's capacity to meet the relevant requirement within the allowable period.</p>

<p>A special circumstances extension is not to be granted solely on the basis that the customer advises they were not aware of the change in lodgement periods or solely due to ‘running out of time’ to meet the requirement.</p>

<p>An extension may be granted without a discussion with the customer if there is sufficient information to support the extension on their record.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Family Tax Benefit (FTB) lump sum or Single Income Family Supplement (SIFS) claim customers may be granted multiple extensions. If a customer is granted an FTB lump sum or SIFS claim lodgement extension, the extension will only apply to that requirement. A separate extension will also need to be recorded if an income confirmation extension is required.</p>

<p>Only one extension date can be recorded. If a customer is granted multiple extensions the extension date will be the same for all requirements.</p>

<p>If a further extension is granted, it will be applied to all recorded special circumstances extension requirements, even though the extension may only be intended for one requirement.</p>

<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Income lodgement extension</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Income lodgement extensions can be granted for lump sum claimants or customers who have received FTB fortnightly in the relevant financial year.</p>

<p>If a customer has not received FTB as fortnightly payments, including at a zero rate they <strong>must</strong> first lodge an FTB lump sum claim and/or a SIFS only claim for the relevant financial year. Claim and income lodgement extensions can be granted at the same time; however legislatively a lump sum claim <strong>must</strong> have been lodged before a decision about an extension can be made.</p>

<p>If an income lodgement extension is granted, the extension can be recorded for the instalment and/or lump sum claim periods. If a mixed delivery customer is granted an extension, separate extensions will need to be recorded to ensure the extension is correctly applied to both instalment and lump sum claim periods.</p>

<p>An income lodgement extension can only be used by Services Australia in the assessment of FTB entitlement for a financial year. The lodgement extension does <strong>not extend</strong> to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). Customers should still contact the ATO to discuss their reasons for late lodgement in order to avoid an ATO penalty. The customer should be advised to visit the ATO website for more information.</p>

<p>If a customer has been granted a lodgement extension by the ATO, details of the extension will not be reported to the agency. The customer will need to contact the agency to discuss their circumstances and request a separate extension of time to meet family assistance income confirmation requirements.</p>

<p>An income lodgement extension is <strong>granted at an individual level</strong>. An extension granted to a customer will not apply to their partner. If an extension is to apply (and is warranted) to the customer's partner, a separate income confirmation extension will need to be recorded.</p>

<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Non-lodger debts</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A decision to grant an income lodgement extension for a Family Tax Benefit (FTB) instalment or past period claim customer may result in a delay in the raising of a non-lodger debt. If an income lodgement extension is granted for a customer whose income has not been confirmed before a non-lodger debt is raised, and the extension date is after 1 September of the extended lodgement year, the non-lodger debt will not be raised until 15 days after the extension end date, providing the customer continues to meet the conditions for being assessed as a non-lodger.</p>

<p>If an income lodgement extension is granted after a non-lodger debt has been raised, the extension will not have any impact on the debt. The non-lodger debt will remain and will be subject to recovery.</p>

<p>When considering a request for a special circumstance extension, the following factors must be considered&#58;</p>

The nature of the event that prevented (or will prevent) the customer and/or their partner from meeting the relevant lodgement requirement (for example, natural disaster, bereavement, ill health, personal issues, accident)</li>
		<li>
Was the event outside the customer's control?</li>
		<li>
How has the event contributed to the customer being unable to meet the requirement by the end of the lodgement year?</li>
		<li>
When did the event occur?</li>
		<li>
What does the customer need to do to meet the requirement and what level of input is required by them?</li>
		<li>
How much time remains in the lodgement year?</li>
		<li>
How was the customer and/or their partner prevented from taking action to meet the requirement before they were impacted by the event/incident?</li>
		<li>
How much time remains in the extended lodgement year?</li>
		<li>
Has another agency (that is, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO)) already granted an extension)?</li>

<p>If a customer does not meet the special circumstances requirements, their request for an extension will be rejected. In all instances, a letter will be sent advising the customer of the decision and their review and appeal rights.</p>

<p>A decision to reject a special circumstances extension should only be changed as a result of a review.</p>

<p>A decision about a special circumstances extension will be recorded on the Family Assistance Lodgement Period Management screen and in a <strong>DOC</strong> on the customer's record.
