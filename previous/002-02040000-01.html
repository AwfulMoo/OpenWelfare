<p>FHA is paid to eligible farmers and/or the partner of a farmer. Both members of a couple can be paid as a farmer if qualification criteria are met.</p>

<p>FHA cannot be paid in conjunction with any other social security benefit, social security pension or a Service Pension, Income Support Supplement or Veteran Payment.</p>

<p>The Australian Government extended the period farmers and their partners can receive FHA on 1 August 2018 to 4 years (1,460 days). A further change introduced on 16 December 2019 allows FHA to be payable for 4 years in every specified 10 year period. The first specified 10 year period commenced on 1 July 2014. Customers that have already received 1,460 days of payment can reapply for FHA again from 1 July 2024.</p>

<p>Forestry is not considered to be an activity falling within the above industries. It does not meet the definition of a ‘farm enterprise’ for the purpose of FHA.

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Significant_lab">Significant labour</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>As assessment of the labour a farmer contributes to a farm, will establish that the labour is both significant to the farmer and to the farm enterprise. An assessment should examine the farmers time spent working the farm enterprise as compared with their other activities (for example, off-farm employment). When balancing labour from other activities such as employment, it is important to consider if the off-farm work is irregular and how it works around the requirements of the farm.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> where a farmer is incapacitated by a temporary illness or injury which results in an exemption from the activity test, they will be taken to contribute a significant part of their labour to a farm enterprise if, immediately before the temporary illness or injury, they had been contributing a significant part of their labour to a farm enterprise.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>The assessment of significant capital is not a defined proportion of capital for the qualification requirement to be met. Rather, it is determined on a case-by-case basis. Assessment of significant capital contribution is in comparison to other capital and liabilities the farm holds. The capital contributed by the farmer must also be significant to the farmer's enterprise. The assessment of capital looks at only the farmer's contributions of capital to the farm enterprise and is not a comparison of the total contribution where others are involved in the farm enterprise.</p>

if the farmer or their partner (where the partner is not a farmer) is not an expert in respect of the farm enterprise</li>

whether relevant expert advice has been sought about the farm enterprise from a relevant authority, an experienced farmer or an agent, or</li>
			<li>
whether relevant technical literature on the farm enterprise has been obtained</li>		</ul>
		<li>
whether it has been established that the land that is used for the purposes of the farm enterprise is suitable for the farm enterprise, including by analysing soil and water samples</li>
		<li>
whether the farmer of their partner (where the partner is not a farmer) has</li>
			<ul>			<li>
considered if there is a commercial market, or a potential commercial market, for the farm enterprise, and</li>
			<li>
investigated the capital requirements of the farm enterprise, including planning how capital for the farm enterprise will be obtained and used, and</li>

conducted research into the farm enterprise confirming (based on market prospects, the expected level of production, and the running costs, of the farm enterprise) that profits can be expected, and</li>

ensured the size and scale of the farm enterprise is sufficient for a commercial enterprise</li>		</ul>

whether legal requirements required to operate the farm enterprise on a commercial basis have been, or could at the appropriate time be, complied with</li>

<p>Section 7(7) of the Social Security Act allows that under certain circumstances, a customer may receive an exemption from meeting the residence requirements, in order that they can be paid JobSeeker Payment or Youth Allowance for a period of 6 months, see <a target="_blank" href="../initial-contact-general/106-06010030-01.html">New Zealand 10 year residence exemption</a>.</p>

<p>This exemption <strong>does not</strong> apply for FHA due to the modifications to the Social Security Act imposed by section 94 of the Farm Household Support Act 2014.
