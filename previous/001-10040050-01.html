<UL>
<LI>Capability Assessment is needed, or</LI>
<LI>work refusal failure or mutual obligation failure or unemployment failure has been committed to determine if a financial penalty or payment cancellation will be applied</LI></UL>
<P>Job seekers managed under the Job Seeker Compliance Model (Community Development Program (CDP) job seekers), may contact the agency in response to the generation of a:</P>
<UL>
<LI><A href="../job-seekers/001-10030000-01.html">Non-Attendance Report (NAR)</A></LI>

<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_Capability_Asse>Capability Assessments</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Providers are responsible for notifying the job seeker they are required to contact Services Australia to arrange a Capability Assessment. A participation suspension applies until the job seeker complies with this reconnection requirement.</P>
<P>Job seekers who contact to arrange a Capability Assessment should be referred to the Participation Solutions Team. If possible the Capability Assessment is conducted at the time of first contact. The Service Officer uses the <STRONG>Capability Assessment</STRONG> workflow in the Participation Compliance workflow to record the contact, conduct the Capability Assessment and return a Capability Assessment outcome to the Employment Services System.</P>
<P>When a Capability Assessment has been started, but is unable to be completed at first contact, the Participation Solutions Team (PST)-skilled Service Officer will record the job seeker contact in the <STRONG>Capability Assessment</STRONG> workflow and advise the job seeker to call back before midday the following business day. This action is required to lift the participation suspension. A contact trigger will prevent further reporting until a Capability Assessment has been conducted and the outcome is recorded.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_Mutual_obligati>Mutual obligation, work refusal and unemployment failures</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>When a mutual obligation failure or work refusal failure has been committed, payment is not payable until the job seeker talks with their provider and complies with reconnection requirements. Job seekers who contact the agency because of a participation suspension following a mutual obligation failure or work refusal failure should be advised to contact their provider. For further information, see <A href="../job-seekers/001-18030205-01.html">Re-engaging job seekers - Targeted Compliance Framework</A>.</P>
<P>Outstanding unemployment, work refusal or mutual obligation failures in the financial penalty zone prevent job seekers from finalising their reporting.</P>
<P>Contact with the Participation Solutions Team (PST) is required when a job seeker has an outstanding unemployment failure or work refusal failure.</P>
<P>As part of reporting, job seekers can choose to accept the financial penalty for certain mutual obligation failures without a compliance investigation being conducted by Services Australia. These failures include a first or second failure in the financial penalty zone for non-attendance at provider appointments, third party appointments, job interviews or activities.</P>
<P>Contact with the PST is required when the job seeker has an active mutual obligation failure. A failure becomes 'active' in Services Australia's system when:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the provider has electronically notified Services Australia the job seeker has met the conditions to lift a participation suspension</LI>
<LI>the job seeker is due to report for the entitlement period in which the Non-Compliance Report was received</LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_NonAttendance_>Non-Attendance Reports (NAR)</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Community Development Program (CDP) providers are responsible for actioning NARs and re-engaging CDP job seekers following a NAR.</P>
<P>Valid NARs received by Services Australia will result in the CDP job seeker's payment being suspended 'Non-Attendance Report Received' (ANR) if another suspension is not already in place. When another suspension is in place, a display on access (DOA) <STRONG>DOC</STRONG> will automatically be created on the CDP job seeker's record alerting that a NAR is outstanding.</P>
<P>A letter and SMS are issued advising the CDP job seeker to contact their provider to discuss the non-attendance. Messaging on IVR and the online landing page will also direct CDP job seekers to contact their provider about the outstanding NAR.</P>
<P>When a CDP job seeker contacts Services Australia and the only outstanding compliance action is a NAR, Service Officers should advise the CDP job seeker to contact their provider as quickly as possible to have any outstanding issues resolved so payment can be restored.</P>
<P>If the CDP job seeker requests an explanation or applies for a formal review of a decision to suspend (ANR) or cancel their payment as part of the NAR process, refer them to the Participation Solutions Team (PST)–skilled Service Officer who will initiate the internal review process.</P>
<P>When other compliance action is outstanding, the CDP job seeker should be referred to the PST who will advise the CDP job seeker to contact their provider after the other compliance action has been resolved.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<DIV class=twisty><A name=bp01_L2GT_Provider_Appoin class=anchor></A>
<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_Provider_Appoin>Provider Appointment Reports (PAR)</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Provider Appointment Reports (PAR) can be transmitted by a Community Development Program (CDP) provider to initiate a compliance investigation following a CDP job seeker's non-attendance at a provider appointment. The PAR is a type of non-compliance report used when the CDP provider believes the CDP job seeker did not have a reasonable excuse for their non-attendance and considers the imposition of a financial penalty is the best way to ensure future compliance by that CDP job seeker. A PAR may only be submitted by a CDP provider after they have spoken to the CDP job seeker about their reasons for non-attendance at an appointment, and a NAR has already been submitted for the same non-attendance event.</P>
<P>The PAR will include all relevant information from the CDP provider for a Participation Solutions Team (PST)-skilled Service Officer (with PFDEC or WNPPD security resource) to investigate. A submitted PAR will also place a contact trigger onto the record, and a letter and/or SMS will be issued requesting the CDP job seeker contact as soon as possible. The PST-skilled Service Officer is required to establish contact with the CDP job seeker. The purpose of this contact is to:</P>
<UL>
<LI>advise the CDP job seeker a failure is under investigation, and</LI>
<LI>provide the CDP job seeker with an opportunity to explain the circumstances that led to the failure</LI></UL>
<P>A submitted PAR may lead to one of the following types of failures for PST to investigate if the CDP job seeker failed to attend a:</P>
<UL>
<LI>regular (contact) appointment with their CDP provider, a submitted PAR will trigger a Non-Attendance Failure for investigation</LI>
<LI>re-engagement appointment that is a reconnection requirement, a submitted PAR will trigger a reconnection failure investigation</LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_Participation_R>Participation Reports</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>When a Participation Report is received from a Community Development Program (CDP) provider, the CDP job seeker's payment may be suspended or a contact trigger may be added to the CDP job seeker's record. A letter and/or an SMS are issued requesting the CDP job seeker contact as soon as possible.</P>
<P>The Participation Report may lead to one of the following types of failures, which are investigated by PST skilled Service Officers with a PFDEC or WNPPD security resource:</P>
<UL>
<LI>connection/reconnection failures</LI>
<LI>No Show, No Pay failures</LI>
<LI>serious failures, and</LI>
<LI>Unemployment Non-Payment Periods (UNPP)</LI></UL>
<P>As part of the failure investigation, the Service Officer is required to establish contact with the CDP job seeker. The purpose of this contact is to:</P>
<UL>
<LI>advise the CDP job seeker a failure is under investigation, and</LI>
<LI>provide the CDP job seeker with an opportunity to explain the circumstances that led to the failure, and</LI>
<LI>re-engage the CDP job seeker with their requirements if appropriate</LI></UL>
<P>Until contact with the CDP job seeker is established, a decision regarding the failure cannot be made.</P>
<P>If a payment suspension (participation) has been imposed, the CDP job seeker's payment will be restored when they agree to re-engage or the Service Officer determines re-engagement is not required.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>When a <A href="../job-seekers/001-18030212-01.html">CCA is triggered</A>, the Service Officer establishes contact with the job seeker to explain the purpose of the CCA, gather relevant information and make arrangements for a specialist assessment.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>When a job seeker has a language barrier, an interpreter should be used for any contact.</P>
<P>When a job seeker has a significant barrier and/or vulnerability impacting their ability to discuss the non-compliance with the Service Officer, the Service Officer should consider contact and servicing approaches which are appropriate to the job seeker's needs and circumstances. Consultation with a specialist such as a social worker may assist the Service Officer to determine appropriate servicing.</P>
<P>Similarly, contact may involve a third party such as a correspondence nominee or a person (such as a partner, social worker or friend) authorised by the job seeker to support them in their discussion with the Service Officer. Unless there is an impediment, which prevents the job seeker discussing the non-compliance with the Service Officer themselves, they are expected to be involved in the discussion and their third party can be involved as a support person.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_Finalising_Repo>Finalising Reporting Requirements</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>When a job seeker has contacted following an unsuccessful attempt to finalise their reporting requirements, most of their reporting information will have already been collected during the reporting process. This is stored in an activity on the job seeker's record. The Participant Solutions Team (PST)-skilled Service Officer may need to stimulate the report once the compliance action is finalised.</P>
<P>Similarly, if the job seeker <A href="../job-seekers/001-18120545-01.html">reports late</A> and has pending compliance investigations, the job seeker will need to be referred to the PST to discuss the pending compliance investigations. PST-skilled Service Officers will process the late report as part of this discussion.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
