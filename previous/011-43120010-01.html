	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p><strong>Wrong bank account</strong></p>

<p>If bank account details have been collected by a third party, for example a medical practice, it is the claimantâ€™s responsibility to verify the bank account details are recorded correctly. The department will undertake an EFT retrieval for payments made to an incorrect bank account, but the department will not reimburse funds if the EFT retrieval is unsuccessful.</p>

<p><strong>Wrong patient, claimant or Medicare card</strong></p>

<p>When a medical practice transmits a claim online using the wrong patient, claimant or Medicare card, contact the health professional to obtain correct details either&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
verbally and notate information received</li>
		<li>
by requesting an invoice to be faxed for processing</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Child on 2 Medicare cards</strong></p>

<p>When a medical practice transmits a claim online for a child and the child is on 2 Medicare cards, check if bank details have been recorded for the child. Check if the payment has gone to anyone other than the person identified as the correct claimant, for example the payment has been incorrectly paid to the other parent.</p>

<p>If the payment has been paid to someone other than the person identified as the correct claimant, for example benefit paid to other parent, the claim must be reprocessed with the correct claimant and a debt raised for the person whose bank account details were recorded.</p>

<p>In this case, <strong>no</strong> <strong>EFT retrieval or trace</strong> is to be carried out by the department.</p>

<p>The <a href="../your-health/011-43120010-03.html">Process</a> page contains information about how to action an incorrect EFT payment where the cause of the incorrect payment was a child being on 2 Medicare cards.</p>

<p>Where a determination cannot be made whether the incorrect payment was due to claimant or departmental error this could be because the department no longer has the original document/s, the error is deemed a departmental error and the claimant is to be paid the Medicare benefit.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>When the claim or an update to bank account details for the claimant is more than 2 years old, an investigation must be done to try and determine if it can be identified if the benefit went into the wrong bank account, and whether it was departmental or claimant error.</p>

<p>This investigation can include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
checking Government Direct Entry Service (GDES)</li>
		<li>
looking at CDMS bank account history</li>
		<li>
checking to see if other payments have been made</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where a determination cannot be made whether it was claimant or departmental error as we no longer hold the original document/s, and the investigation could not determine otherwise, the claimant is to be repaid.</p>

<p>For example, bank account details were updated in 2011, no payments can be verified as having been paid into this account as the claimant has since been bulk billed or the patient history has been culled.</p>

<p>An EFT retrieval should be requested where the payment amount is over $100.</p>

<p>Where an EFT dispute is being resolved within a service centre, the claimant must complete the bank details collection form. The form is to be added to the Service Officer daily batch work. The <a href="../your-health/011-43120010-05.html">Resources</a> page contains a link to the form.</p>

<p>Where new bank details have been provided via telephony, ensure that comments have been recorded in CDMS confirming the bank details have been read back to the claimant to confirm. This will ensure the department has evidence of the details being verified with the claimant.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Where a bank deposit has been rejected by the financial institution (account closed or does not exist) the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) provides the department with a GDES report identifying details of any Medicare EFT payment failures.</p>

<p>The time that elapses between the department depositing the funds and when the financial institution accepts and releases the funds to the claimant or rejects and returns the funds to the department will vary depending on the internal process of the financial institution.</p>

<p>Financial institutions do not always return benefits to the RBA that cannot be deposited into a bank account. In some cases the financial institutions retain these benefits in their internal suspense accounts. These funds will be identified by a trace request.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the department deposits funds into a claimantâ€™s bank account according to the information on their records or as per the claimantâ€™s instructions. The claimantâ€™s financial institution will either accept or reject the deposit. If the financial institution rejects the deposit, it is the claimantâ€™s responsibility to ensure correct bank account details are provided and that the account can be used for electronic funds transfers.</p>

<p><strong>GDES report</strong></p>

<p>The GDES report is automatically run and will update the status of the payments listed on the report from <strong>PAID</strong> to <strong>REJECTED</strong> and apply the appropriate reason code within the Mainframe <strong>BRNA</strong> screen.</p>

<p>This then automatically updates the status of the banking details that relate to the payment in CDMS. For example, bank account closed. The bank details in CDMS are not end dated, but the Status will be updated to reflect the rejection code on the GDES report.</p>

<p>If bank account details are updated in the system after the money is returned to the department from the RBA, any claims that have <strong>rejected</strong> in the claiming details will need to be repaid by the Service Officer. See the <a href="../your-health/011-43120010-03.html">Process</a> page for more information.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> a claim that has redirect showing should <strong>not</strong> be changed to <strong>reject</strong> by a Service Officer or the claimant will receive the payment twice.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>When bank account details have been collected online, Service Officers must try to determine if it was fraudulent activity or claimant error.</p>

<p>Examples of claimant error can include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
incorrectly transposing bank account details</li>
		<li>
not updating their details after a change in family circumstances (separation)</li>
		<li>
their previous bank account has closed</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the claimant advises that the bank account details were updated without their knowledge, the dispute is to be referred to MPS Assessing to investigate further. Complete an EFT dispute form adding comments that the claimant is advising the account has been changed without their knowledge.</p>

<p>If MPS Assessing can determine there is enough evidence to support the claimantâ€™s statement that the bank account had been updated without their knowledge, the department will repay the claimant and then refer the matter to Medicare Payments Integrity (MPI) section to review and refer to compliance for further investigation.</p>

<p>If there is not enough evidence, the matter will be referred to the MPI section to review and refer to compliance for further investigation before any decision on repayment to the claimant is made.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_The_provider_ha">The provider has an automated debt recovery in place</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>If a provider has a debt recovery arrangement in place, they may notice that the amount shown on their EFT bulk bill statement is different to the amount actually deposited into their nominated bank account. For example, the providerâ€™s EFT bulk bill statement may show $100 as being paid by Medicare, but after 20% is taken by debt recovery only $80 will be deposited into the providerâ€™s nominated bank account.</p>

<p>The Commonwealth department or agency recovering the debt is responsible for notifying the provider of their debt recovery arrangement, as well as providing all ongoing communication. For this reason, minimal enquiries are expected to be received by Service Officers.</p>

<p>Providers or a member of their staff may still contact the department regarding the discrepancy between their EFT bulk bill statement and the actual amount deposited into their bank account. If this happens, a providerâ€™s debt recovery information can be viewed in the Provider Directory System (PDS) and Mainframe (CICS).</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when a debt has been fully paid the debt instruction will no longer appear in the PDS but the debt recovery history and corresponding agencies will remain in Mainframe (CICS)</p>

<p>There will be no impact or changes to internal adjustments or recoveries processed as a result of the compliance debt recovery system. If a provider who has had a payment garnished contacts the department to advise the claim (from which a deduction was taken) was incorrect and they wish to instigate a voluntary recovery, ignore the fact there was a reduced benefit paid and recover the amount paid by Medicare (That is, the full Medicare benefit, as is current process).</p>

<p><strong>Do not</strong> discuss details of the debt recovery arrangement (for example how much is being recovered) with the provider or their staff. Refer the provider to the relevant department or agency that is recovering the debt.</p>

<p>Automated recovery arrangements are in place to recover debt/s on behalf of the following Commonwealth departments or agencies&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Australian Financial Securities Authority (AFSA)</li>
		<li>
Australian Taxation Office (ATO) </li>
