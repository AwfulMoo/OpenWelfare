<p>Thoroughly review the customer’s record and review <strong>all of the following</strong> to decide what action can be taken before making any updates or actioning any work items. This information may impact the claim assessment if fraud concerns have been raised on the customer’s record</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Display on Access (DOA) <strong>DOCs</strong></li>

Select the <strong>Notes</strong> icon from the menu bar</li>

Previous claim <strong>DOCs </strong>or <strong>Notes,</strong> including <strong>Progress of Claim Notes</strong> on the <strong>DL</strong> screen under the <strong>Document list</strong>/<strong>note</strong> section </li>
			<ul>			<li>
If the ‘Channel’ of the claim is <strong>INTERNAL,</strong> this means an Assisted Customer Claim (ACC) was run. Check any <strong>DOCs/Notes</strong> or annotations to <strong>Progress of Claim Notes</strong> from other staff for points to consider when assessing the claim. For example, the customer may have been asked to provide evidence to support their claim within 7 days</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Requests for information issued about a <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-20080418-03.html#bp03_tbl_Common_definiti_12">fifth or subsequent claim</a> </li>

		<li>
Any notes that may help in assessing the claim</li>
		<li>
Outcomes of previous claims lodged</li>
		<li>
All previous withdrawn claims</li>
		</ul>
<p>Review the claim details <strong>in each claim withdrawn within the last 14 days</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>How to check withdrawn claims</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Select the <strong>Transactions </strong>icon</li>
			<ul>			<li>
This will show any claims withdrawn or not completed</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Select <strong>All Transactions</strong></li>
			<ul>			<li>
This will show all completed claims, including claims&#58;<br>- granted and paid, and <br>- rejected</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Review the claim details and <strong>Claim Summary</strong> in each claim withdrawn within the last 14 days by selecting the <strong>claim ID</strong> (in blue text) with a <strong>Status </strong>of <strong>Withdrawal confirmed</strong> </li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
has submitted the same information in each claim and has not previously been requested to provide evidence to support their claim, keep assessing the claim</li>
		<li>
made minimal changes and they are advising the same circumstances for this ACC, it is reasonable the customer may have had issues with the claiming process. For example, number of hours lost, or self-isolation, quarantine or caring dates for overlapping periods. Keep assessing the claim</li>
		<li>
tried to change responses to the questions in each claim submitted and when lodging this claim, including bank account details, customer contact will be needed after assessing all other criteria, to discuss why responses have been changed. Keep assessing the claim.</li>
		</ul>
<p>Determine if the customer is showing behaviour that may suggest their claim is not valid. </p>
		<ul>		<li>
This could be shown by, for example</li>
			<ul>			<li>
a history of withdrawing claims for the Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment and/or different emergency payments, including the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment (AGDRP), New Zealand Disaster Recovery Payment (NZ DRP), Disaster Recovery Allowance (DRA) and New Zealand Disaster Recovery Allowance (NZ DRA)</li>
			<li>
a <strong>DOA DOC</strong> relating to concerns about fraud</li>
			<li>
debt <strong>ACT DOCS</strong> completed on record<br>- <strong>Note&#58;</strong> this is not a complete list. Staff need to consider details on the customer’s record to determine next steps. </li>		</ul>

For help, contact Technical Peer Support </li>

		</ul>
<p>A claim can be rejected with no further customer contact if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a customer lodged a fifth or subsequent claim, <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
an RFI letter was sent requesting evidence to support that claim, <strong>and</strong> </li>
		<li>
they withdrew that fifth or subsequent claim <strong>or</strong> that claim was rejected as the customer ‘Failed to Provide Information’ (FPI) <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
they then lodged a new fifth or subsequent claim without the evidence previously requested </li>
			<ul>			<li>

has provided <strong>all </strong>evidence previously requested to support previous claims paid<strong> and</strong> their current claim</li>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if Real Time Analysis have assessed a claim as ‘not eligible’, staff <strong>must not</strong> do further checks or request evidence from the customer.

There may be <a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-21120238-03.html">warning signs<strong></a> </strong>that a claim may be fraudulent. It may be an odd feeling or inconsistencies in what the customer claims.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the following may have already been considered at the <strong>Review record and Note/DOCs</strong> step</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Determine if the customer is showing behaviour that may suggest their claim is not valid. </li>
		<li>
This could be shown by, for example</li>
			<ul>			<li>
a history of withdrawing claims for the Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment and/or different emergency payments, including the <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-01000000-01.html">Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment (AGDRP), New Zealand Disaster Recovery Payment (NZ DRP)</a>, <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-03000000-01.html">Disaster Recovery Allowance (DRA) and New Zealand Disaster Recovery Allowance (NZ DRA)</a></li>
			<li>
a <strong>DOA DOC</strong> relating to concerns about fraud</li>
			<li>
debt <strong>ACT DOCS</strong> completed on record<br>- <strong>Note&#58;</strong> this is not a complete list. Staff need to consider details on the customer’s record to determine next steps </li>		</ul>
		<li>
For help, contact Technical Peer Support</li>
		</ul>
<p>If there are concerns about employer details provided, use the <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-22011652-05.html#bp05_L2GT_External_websit">ABN Lookup</a>. <strong>Do not</strong> try to contact the employer. </p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> later steps will advise the process to follow if&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
a customer has not met the requirement of declaring income in the payment period before cancelling JSP or YA (this would have been identified in the <strong>Customer voluntarily cancelled JSP or YA</strong> step), <strong>and</strong> </li>
		<li>
there are no other warning signs that a claim may be fraudulent</li>
			<ul>			<li>

		<li>
concerns about the validity of information, <strong>before</strong> submitting a fraud report, first try to review the claim information and clarify any concerns with the customer. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> do not use the term 'fraud’ when speaking to a customer or updating their record.

			</ul>			</ul>
<p>After clarifying any concerns and reviewing evidence (if applicable)&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the Service Officer is unsure whether to report a situation that they think may be suspected fraud, contact Technical Peer Support </li>
		<li>
If fraud concerns have been resolved, but the evidence requested to validate discussions has not been provided, and the timeframe to lodge evidence&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
has expired, the claim should be rejected. See <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-22011652-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Rejecting_claim">Table 2</a></li>
			<li>
has not expired, place the claim <strong>On Hold </strong>for a further 28 days using hold reason <strong>‘Customer to Provide information’</strong>. Procedure ends here</li>		</ul>

		<li>
If the Service Officer believes the customer has acted fraudulently&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
<strong>Do not grant the claim</strong></li>

<p>Send an RFI letter in Process Direct requesting evidence for all claim periods paid where the customer <strong>has not</strong> yet provided evidence, <strong>and</strong> evidence to support the current claim.</p>

<p><strong>Request all evidence needed in the one RFI letter.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a customer has already been asked to provide evidence for previous claims and has not done this within 14 days, there is no need to ask for it again. This might happen if a&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
previous claim has been rejected</li>

<p>If any of the above happen, only ask for evidence of claims that <strong>have not</strong> been requested yet.</p>
