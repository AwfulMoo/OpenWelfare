<P><STRONG>Job seeker commences employment</STRONG></P>
<P>Job seekers may obtain full-time employment, part-time or casual work during the course of their placement.</P>
<P>Job seekers who are on a part-rate of income support cannot be compelled to undertake Work for the Dole.</P>
<P>Full-time employment will prevent ongoing participation in WFD. In the case of part-time and casual work, where a job seeker is earning less than the affecting income amount they will be required to remain in WFD. <STRONG>If a job seeker's rate is affected by employment for more than one consecutive fortnight they may choose to withdraw from WFD</STRONG>.</P>
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Services Australia cannot code the exit. The job seeker should be referred to the provider who will code the exit.</P>
<P>If a job seeker has accrued Working Credits and their rate would have been affected by more than one consecutive fortnight if they didn't have accrued Working Credits, they may choose to withdraw from WFD.</P>
<P>Where a job seeker is referred to WFD and they have subsequently gone onto the partial rate, but have <STRONG>not</STRONG> yet been sent a letter by the provider, the system will automatically exit the job seeker from the WFD referral. The exit code which is used is NLE (No Longer Eligible).</P>
<P>Where a job seeker is referred to WFD and they have subsequently gone onto the partial rate, and <STRONG>have</STRONG> been sent a letter by the provider to attend an interview, the job seeker must attend the interview and participate in WFD until the job seeker has had more than one consecutive fortnight of casual earnings which affect their payments.</P>
<P>Where possible, job seekers should be encouraged to continue their placement.</P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Part-time/casual work:</STRONG> Where a job seeker states that the part-time or casual work conflicts with participation, the job seeker should be referred to the provider. The provider and job seeker should attempt to negotiate attendance suitable to both parties. If an arrangement cannot be reached whereby the job seeker is able to work the required hours, and the job seeker is earning more than the affecting income, the provider can allow the job seeker to leave WFD without penalty</LI>
<LI><STRONG>One-off employment:</STRONG> If the paid work is only within one fortnight and results in a reduced rate of payment, the job seeker is not exited, but is taken to have participated in WFD for that fortnight</LI></UL>
<P>Where a job seeker is offered paid part-time work with the WFD sponsor, the above requirements apply; however, care needs to be taken to ensure there is no conflict of interest.</P></DIV>

<P><STRONG>Medical certificate - general</STRONG></P>
<P>Job seekers who supply medical certificates for their absences are not required to make up the time they missed during their WFD placement and the time covered by the certificate will count towards their WFD placement.</P>
<P><STRONG>Exemption from mutual obligation requirements</STRONG></P>
<P>Ensure that the job seeker is not referred to WFD until the medical certificate expires.</P>
<P>If using <STRONG>Customer First</STRONG>, the medical certificate must be coded using the Medical Certificate Guided Procedure. On return to WFD, these job seekers would need their provider to negotiate a new Job Plan, taking into account their personal circumstances (which may have changed).</P>
<P>If using <STRONG>Process Direct</STRONG>, suitably skilled Service Officers are to select 'Medical Certificate' from the Task Selector (if relevant training has been undertaken).</P>
<P>However, no participation hours are credited towards the job seekers WFD participation requirement for the period of absence. Exiting the job seeker in these circumstances will ensure they are not paid the WFD supplement for the period they are not participating.</P>
<P>If a job seeker has been referred to WFD, but has not received a letter from the provider advising of requirement to attend an appointment to discuss WFD participation and the job seeker subsequently goes on to a partial rate, or has an exemption from their mutual obligation requirements, an automatic exit (NLE - no longer eligible) from WFD will occur.</P></DIV>

<P>A job seeker can choose to participate in WFD whilst serving a Community Service Order. They can also be compelled to participate in WFD where the community service is for less than 20 hours per week, however, the Community Service Order should take precedence. The provider and the job seeker should negotiate the times and days of participation if the periods overlap. If negotiation is not possible, then the job seeker can leave the requirement without penalty.</P>
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> participation in a WFD program cannot be used to meet the terms of a Community Service Order.</P></DIV>

<DIV class=showcont>
<P>Job seekers on Army Reserve Training Camps are taken to satisfy their mutual obligation requirements. This means that while they are undertaking a Training Camp, they are not expected to participate in WFD. In this case it is treated like other exemptions such as illness, and the days spent at the camp are treated as time on the requirement. A camp that is coming up doesn't exempt the job seeker from the initial referral. For the rest of the time (whilst they are on normal weekend training) the job seeker is eligible for WFD participation and cannot be exempted. Army reserves are usually done on one weekend per month. This should not clash with WFD which is generally undertaken on weekdays.</P></DIV>
