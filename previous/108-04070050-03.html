<p><strong>Income Streams</strong></p>

<p>If the purchase date of the income stream is on or after 1 January 2015, the income stream will be subject to the deemed income provisions, however the asset test exemption can still apply. The customer must commute part, or all, of the income stream and use the funds for their new principal home prior to expiration of the exemption period.</p>

<p>The customer must state they will partially or fully commute the income stream within the exemption period and use the money to purchase another principal home.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Account-based income streams subject to deeming, for example, Cat 9 non-grandfathered products, cannot be coded on the Pension/Annuities Identification (<strong>SUPI</strong>) or Pension/Annuities Details Variable (<strong>SUPV</strong>) screens where an exemption for principal home sale proceeds is applicable. This is because there is no asset test deduction facility on the <strong>SUPV</strong> screen</li>
		<li>
To provide the customer with an asset test deduction for the sale proceeds, but still apply deeming to the account balance for income test purposes, code the account-based income stream on the Deposit Accounts (<strong>SVDA</strong>) screen with the Investment Type as ‘<strong>OTH</strong>’. Code the amount intended to be used to purchase a new principal home in the <strong>Assets Test Deduction Amt&#58;</strong> field</li>
		<li>
If any funds remain in the income stream after the purchase of the new principal home, cancel the Direct Investments (<strong>SVDI</strong>) record. Recode the income stream as normal on the <strong>SUPI/SUPV</strong> screens</li>
