<p>Customers who have had their <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-08000000-01.html">foreign pensions</a> updated through the bulk data exchange process or auto-indexation will have Data Exchange (<strong>DEX</strong>) or Consumer Price Index (<strong>CPI</strong>) appear in the <strong>Channel&#58;</strong> field on the Foreign Pension Details (<strong>FPD</strong>) screen.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> channel code '<strong>RVL</strong>' will appear after each monthly exchange rate revaluation; it may be necessary to check older dates of event to determine whether DEX or CPI updates have been made in the past.</p>

<p>These codes were introduced to protect and identify foreign pension rate information obtained direct from the paying authority. Only authorised users (for example, International Services (CIS)) can change amounts after these codes have been applied.</p>

<p>Auto-indexation increases (CPI) are applied from the 1st of the applicable month. These updates are applied prior to the monthly exchange rate revaluation process. The exception is United Kingdom (UK) increases which apply from early April each year.</p>

<p>The DEX update processes reassess entitlements using a Date of Receipt of 'T' for today. This means no arrears or debts will be automatically generated for DEX updates.</p>

<p>The 'favourable determination' rules under social security law apply in respect of Australian payments that increase whilst 'unfavourable determination' rules will apply when potential debts are investigated following DEX updates.</p>

<p>International Services (CIS) is responsible for investigating and raising any debts that arise from DEX updates.</p>

<p>The normal <a href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/109-03000000-01.html">review and appeals system applies</a>.</p>

<p>Customer initiated reviews relating to DEX updates are the responsibility of the customer's local service centre.</p>

<p>Information received via data exchange or a rate updated via auto-indexation is considered to be accurate. Customers who advise that rates of foreign pension that are being maintained are incorrect should provide suitable proof from the paying authority such as a pension statement, letter or certificate. A bank statement is not sufficient evidence of the gross rate of pension in the original currency.</p>

<p>However, only authorised users, for example International Services (CIS), can change amounts after DEX or CPI updates have been applied. If a customer supplies new information from the paying authority about their rate of foreign pension, details must be forwarded to CIS.</p>

<p>CIS is responsible for appeals relating to any debts that are raised following DEX updates.</p>

<p>The <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-08040000-05.html">Resources</a> page contains a link to CIS contact details.</p>
