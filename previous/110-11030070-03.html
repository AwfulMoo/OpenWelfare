<p>Before contacting the customer, consider&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Social worker?</strong> If the customer is at risk, vulnerable, in crisis or has a mental illness, consult with a <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-12070000-01.html">Payments and Integrity social worker</a>. They will provide advice on the best ways to deal with the customer. If they recommend not conducting a ROI, discuss appropriate action with the Senior Investigator/Approver of Investigations</li>
		<li>
<strong>AFP?</strong> If the customer poses a safety risk, for example, known violent offender, consult the Australian Federal Police (AFP) out posted officer. They will provide advice on the best way to conduct the interview, which may include having an AFP officer present at the interview. They may recommend referring the case to the AFP</li>
		<li>
<strong>Nominee?</strong> If the customer has a nominee it may be appropriate to ask the nominee to attend the interview and/or to send them a copy of the interview invitation. See <a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-04090020-01.html">Obligations of nominees</a></li>
		<li>
<strong>Interpreter?</strong> For criminal prosecutions they must be appropriately qualified</li>
		<li>
<strong>Where?</strong> ROIs are generally conducted at the customer's closest Service Centre or other agency offices within reasonable access for the customer. Conducting it anywhere else must be approved by the Senior Investigator/Approver of Investigations, considering possible safety issues and risks. A home visit may be appropriate only if there are no other options</li>		</ul>

The objectives of the interview - the information being sought from the customer through questioning. Prepare questions for each objective, but relying on a prescribed list or script can lead to not listening to the customer's answers and missing appropriate follow-up questions</li>

Evidence and documentation to be presented, for the customer to be asked to comment on. Ensure it is available, and organised in a logical way so it can be readily obtained and presented during the interview</li>		</ul>

		<ul>		<li>
Two interviewers are required&#58;</li>
		</ul>
<p>Two people must conduct the ROI, a lead interviewer and an interviewer whose role is to corroborate.</p>

<p>They should have obtained at least Certificate IV in Government (Investigation) or be supervised by an experienced investigator with that qualification.</p>

<p>One should be the same sex as the person being interviewed. If this is not possible, document an assessment in consultation with the Senior Investigator/Approver of Investigations.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Role of lead interviewer</strong></li>
			<ul>			<li>
prepare interview plan</li>
			<li>
outline the interview process, including the intention to electronically record the interview</li>
			<li>
explain the reasons for the interview</li>
			<li>
issue the caution and advise rights</li>
			<li>
ask most of the questions</li>
			<li>
ensure exhibits are available</li>
			<li>
ensure the corroborator is briefed on the investigation and the interview plan</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Role of corroborator</strong></li>
		</ul>
<p>To assist the lead interviewer. They are a potential witness in court proceedings. They may ask questions when relevant, but normally at the end of the interview or if prompted by the lead interviewer. They may also&#58;</p>
			<ul>			<li>
take notes during the interview (using these as a basis for questions if relevant)</li>
			<li>
record the start and finish times and times of all suspensions and resumptions</li>
			<li>
record Proof of Identification supplied by the customer</li>
			<li>
note the exhibit number of all exhibits shown to the customer during the interview</li>
			<li>
set up and test recording equipment before the customer arrives</li>
			<li>
describe and record any evidence or documents supplied by the customer during the interview</li>
			<li>
monitor the interview questions, considering the proofs of the offence and ensure any missed questions or rights are brought to the attention of the lead interviewer</li>
			</ul>
<p>Purpose built verifiable equipment such as TPR recording devices must be used. Most equipment used by the agency records audio and video simultaneously. Triple deck tape recorders may also be used.</p>

<p>The media being used for the recording should be removed from its packaging in the presence of the customer.</p>

<p>If using an <strong>interpreter</strong>, explain interview purpose and process before the customer arrives, introduce them to the customer to check for communication problems and their independence, ensure they translate in first person.</p>

<p>The interpreter must be independent of the matter under investigation (do not use agency staff or a person connected to the customer, for example, family or friend).</p>

<p>If the need for an interpreter is not identified until the interview, defer questioning until interpreter is present.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Speak with the interpreter before the customer arrives&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
briefly outline the case</li>
			<li>
advise the purpose of the interview</li>
			<li>
advise the process to be used during the interview</li>
			<li>
check they have experience in interpreting in the circumstances proposed</li>
			<li>
advise that they will be required to supply a statement at the completion of the interview and potentially be called as a witness in subsequent court proceedings</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Introduce the interpreter to the customer and allow them to talk privately in the customer's preferred language. This is to establish&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
If there are any communication problems</li>
			<li>
That the interpreter is competent to interpret in the language</li>
			<li>
If they have any prior or current relationship. If so, check the nature of the relationship. If they are not considered to be independent, arrange a different interpreter</li>
			<li>
If there is any social, cultural or political affiliation, or animosity between them. If so, check the nature of the relationship. If they are not considered to be independent, arrange a different interpreter</li>		</ul>
		<li>
During the interview&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
position the interpreter between the interviewer and the customer</li>
			<li>
ensure translation is in the first person, for example, 'I didn't fill in the form', not 'he says he didn't fill in the form'. Interpreters must not answer on behalf of the customer, but merely interpret what the customer is saying</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Check the <strong>customer's health</strong> before and during the interview</li>
		</ul>
<p>An existing medical condition should have been considered when deciding if the interview was appropriate. If advice was provided that it was appropriate, continue to gauge the customer's state of health.</p>

<p>When the customer arrives, check that they do not appear to be&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
suffering from an illness or fatigued, or</li>
		<li>
under the influence of alcohol or drugs (prescription or illicit)</li>
		</ul>
<p>An interview conducted in the above circumstances may be ruled as inadmissible. If the customer insists on participating in the interview, advise them that due to agency policy the interview will not proceed at this time and an alternative date will be arranged.</p>

<p>If interviewing&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a customer with an intellectual disability or mental illness, ensure they are capable of being interviewed</li>
		</ul>
<p>People with mental illness may not exhibit any signs and the agency's records may not always indicate that the person is ill. Consider&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Is the customer capable of understanding the caution?</li>
		<li>
Are they aware of their surroundings?</li>
		<li>
Are they behaving in a rational manner?</li>
		<li>
Are they capable of understanding and responding to the questions?</li>
		</ul>
<p>If it is determined that the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
is not capable of being interviewed, consider this when deciding if they had intended to commit an offence</li>
		<li>
is capable of being interviewed&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Ensure they understand the caution and their rights. Ask them to repeat the caution in their own words</li>
			<li>
Communicate in a way they can understand and check that they do understand</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>Offer to have their interview friend, parent or guardian present at the interview. If they cannot name an interview friend, seek advice/help of social worker.</p>

<p>The Court may exclude an admission by the defendant in a record of interview if the Court believes that&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the admission is not reliable, or</li>
		<li>
it would be unfair to allow the admission into evidence</li>
		</ul>
<p>The fact that the customer has an intellectual disability or a mental illness could be a factor the Court considers in determining the above.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
An Indigenous customer, consider the Anunga rules</li>
		</ul>
<p>These special guidelines apply to Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders, particularly those living the tradition lifestyle. The law recognises that they may be at a disadvantage in deciding whether or not to exercise their right to remain silent.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
An interpreter who speaks the customer's dialect should be present unless the customer is fluent in English</li>
		<li>
Where practical, an interview friend should be present. They should be someone independent of the agency who will not feel intimidated by the interview. They should <strong>not</strong> be agency employees such as an Indigenous Specialist Officer, a co-offender (such as a partner), or a witness to the proceedings. If the customer waives this right it should be clear it is being done voluntarily</li>
		<li>
The caution should be given with special care to ensure proper understanding. Phrase it in simple terms and ask the customer to repeat it in their own words, phrase by phrase. Do not proceed unless satisfied that the customer understands the right to remain silent</li>
		<li>
Avoid questions that suggest the answer (leading questions)</li>
		<li>
Make every effort to put the customer at ease, as they are often nervous or uncomfortable in the presence of authority figures</li>
		</ul>
<p>Legal assistance&#58; If sought, all reasonable steps should be taken to enable the customer to obtain legal assistance. This may include helping them contact an Aboriginal legal aid organisation.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
A customer aged under 18, a parent, guardian or friend <strong>must</strong> be present and their name, address and relationship to the customer included in the interview</li>
		</ul>
<p>Most jurisdictions impose special obligations on interviewers if the person is under 18. In particular, the presence of a parent, guardian or friend is obligatory.</p>

<p>Advice may need to be sought from the CDPP.</p>

<p>Courts are particularly vigilant when assessing whether a confession or admission made by a child was voluntary. They recognise that a child may have a reduced capacity to understand their rights or to look after their own interests.</p>

<p>The role of a parent/guardian or other adult is to support and help the child in deciding whether or not to answer questions.</p>

<p>Explain to the customer, clearly and precisely, why they are being interviewed in the presence of the friend, parent or guardian.</p>

<p><strong>If the customer&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
is unable or unwilling to provide the name of a person to attend the interview, seek advice/help of social worker</li>
		<li>
insists on being interviewed without a third person present, explain why the presence of an adult is required</li>
		</ul>
<p>If a <strong>third party</strong> is present, obtain customer permission, explain purpose of interview and their role.</p>

<p>Third parties are normally present at the interview to support the customer.</p>

<p>Co-offenders should not be present.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Explain the purpose of the interview and obtain the customer's permission for the third person to be present</li>
		<li>
Advise the interview friend they are there to act in an advisory role and to help the customer understand the matters discussed. They should not answer a question on behalf of the customer</li>
		</ul>
<p>(The only admissible evidence from an interview is what the customer says, not what the interview says, even if the customer agrees to what is said.)</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Advise the customer and interview friend that the friend is not permitted to interrupt or interfere with the interview</li>
			<ul>			<li>
If they interrupt during the interview, politely tell them that the customer is the person being interviewed, and that they will be given an opportunity later in the interview to make a statement</li>
			<li>
If they continue to disrupt the interview, politely request that they stop interrupting or leave</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>(An interview with constant interruptions from a third party may be of little evidentiary value. If they continually interrupt, the interviewer may decide not to continue with the interview unless they leave. The customer will need to decide whether they continue without the third party or end the interview.)</p>

<p>If a <strong>solicitor</strong> is present, allow them to speak with the customer before the interview, explain interview process.</p>

<p>It is the right of a customer to seek legal advice before and during the interview. The customer also has the right to have legal representation present during questioning.</p>

<p>A solicitor representing the customer should be given the opportunity to talk with their client in private before the interview.</p>

<p>When the solicitor wishes to be present, explain&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
how the interview will be conducted and the reason for the interview</li>
		<li>
the interview is between the customer and the interviewer and the solicitor cannot answer questions on behalf of the client</li>
		<li>
the solicitor may become a witness to the things said or done during the interview</li>
		<li>
any decision about referring the customer to the CDPP will be made at a time after the interview</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Seating&#58;</strong> If possible, position the solicitor where they are unable to provide advice to their client through body language. Any advice they wish to give must then be given verbally and this will be recorded.</p>

<div class="showcont">


<p>Treat the customer with respect and courtesy. Answer any questions honestly and clearly. Build rapport with the customer so they do not feel intimidated by the process.</p>

<p><strong>Preliminary discussion</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
When the customer arrives, interviewers are to introduce themselves and show identification</li>
		<li>
Remind customer that participation is voluntary, they can have a break or stop the interview at any time</li>
		<li>
Show the customer the recording equipment, explain how it works, and that they will get a copy of the audio recording at the end of the interview. If they do not wish the interview to be recorded electronically, a written record may be offered</li>
		</ul>
<p>A written record of interview should be recorded in the interviewer's official notebook. If this is not available, a note pad can be used. The notes are to be kept in the investigation file for inclusion in the brief of evidence.</p>

<p>Note the names of those present and the time the interview started and ended.</p>

<p>At the end of the interview ask the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
To read over the interview and point out any errors</li>
		<li>
If they are prepared to sign the record of interview. If they are, ask them to sign or initial the record on each page and to initial any alterations that they have made (in the presence of the interviewer)</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer does not sign the record of interview, the prosecution will need to argue its probative value, which may or may not be admitted into evidence.</p>

<p>Provide the customer a copy of the notes within seven days of the interview.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Ask the customer if they are happy to begin. If so, commence the interview</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Start recording</strong></p>

<p>Formally identify all persons present, and the relationship of any third parties to the customer.</p>

<p>State the reason for the interview and the allegation of criminal conduct under investigation.</p>

<p><strong>The caution</strong></p>

<p>An appropriate form of caution is&#58;</p>

<p><strong>Investigator&#58;</strong> &quot;I must advise you that you do not have to do or say anything unless you wish to do so, but anything you do say or do will be recorded and may be used in evidence. Do you understand the caution?&quot;</p>

<p>Ask the customer to repeat the caution in their words.</p>

<p>It is vital that the customer understands the caution. If there is any doubt, ask further questions like&#58;</p>

<p><strong>Investigator&#58;</strong> &quot;Do you have to talk to me today? Can you stop the interview at any time and leave?&quot;</p>

<p>The caution must be given before any admission. Re-caution the customer after any break in the interview.</p>

<p>The <strong>purpose</strong> of cautioning a person in relation to an alleged offence is to advise&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
their right to remain silent, and</li>
		<li>
the use to which their answers may be put</li>
		</ul>
<p>The caution assists the prosecution in proving that any answers given after the caution were made voluntarily.</p>

<p><strong>Re-caution</strong> the customer after any break in the interview, after changing CDs or after a rest break.</p>

<p>If an <strong>admission</strong> is made before a caution is given, advise the customer to cease, give the caution, then ask the customer to restate their admission under caution.</p>

<p>The <strong>right to remain silent</strong> is not affected by the customer consenting to be interviewed. Therefore, the customer may refuse to answer questions during the interview and may at any time request that the interview end. This right must be respected and if requested by the customer the interview should be immediately terminated.</p>

<p><strong>Any admissions must be voluntary</strong>. There must be no inducements.</p>

<p>An admission is a statement that goes towards establishing an element of the offence. It is not the purpose of a ROI to obtain an admission.</p>

<p>If an admission is made <strong>before a caution</strong> is given, advise the customer to cease, give the caution, and then ask them to restate their admission under caution.</p>

<p><strong>Inducements&#58;</strong> Admission will not be accepted by the Court if there is any kind of inducement made by the interviewers, usually threats or promises, for example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Threats against the person who makes the admission or another person</li>
		<li>
Statements that suggest the outcome of a confession might be to bring some beneficial result in connection with the prosecution. These statements may not always be explicit. For example it would be inappropriate to say&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
'You had better tell the truth', or</li>
			<li>
'If you don't tell me you may get yourself into trouble and it will be worse for you'</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Admissions made because of physical coercion and oppression</li>
		</ul>
<p>Always phrase questions in a non-threatening way.</p>

<p><strong>Questioning the customer</strong></p>

<p>Generally, it is important to remain courteous, keep an open mind, remain objective, and pay attention to what the customer is saying.</p>

<p>Relying too much on prepared questions can result in missing important information or leads.</p>

<p>Do not badger the customer if they do not answer or state they cannot remember.</p>

<p>Discrepancies in the customer's answers can be clarified in a courteous and respectful way.</p>

<p>If it is thought that the customer is not telling the truth, avoid any expressions of disbelief. Do not seek to directly challenge or discredit the customer by questioning the accuracy, credibility or value of their answers.</p>

<p><strong>Avoid&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
leading questions or questions that suggest an answer, especially with vulnerable customers</li>
		<li>
multiple questions within a question, as it can be unclear which question the customer was answering</li>
		<li>
asking the customer to speculate or guess</li>
		<li>
using acronyms and jargon (it is best to ask the customer about their payment, and then refer to it as they know it)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Introducing forms, business records and exhibits</strong></p>

<p>Fully describe any document when introducing it to the customer. Include reference to identifying numbers, date stamps, names or exhibit numbers.</p>

<p>Question the customer about it, for example, Do they recognise it? Can they say who completed it? Is it their handwriting? Is it their signature?</p>

<p><strong>Interview breaks</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Do not discuss the case with the customer while the interview is suspended</li>
		<li>
When the interview is resumed&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
re-caution the customer</li>
			<li>
ask them to confirm on record that there was no discussion about the case during the break (if there was, state that for the record)</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>A consideration break near the end of the interview can allow the customer to consider anything else they may wish to say, and the interviewers to consider any further questions.</p>

<p>Give a copy of the audio recording to the customer and ask them to sign a receipt stating that they have been given a copy of the audio recording.</p>

<p>Each copy of the recording should be dated and signed by the interviewer, corroborator, the customer (and interpreter), in the presence of each other. If the customer is under 18, the copy of the recording should also be signed by the adult present.</p>

<p>If the customer admitted that any documents presented relate to them, ask them to initial and date the records shown to confirm that they were the ones discussed during the interview. The customer may refuse to do so.</p>
