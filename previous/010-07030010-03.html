<p>The RS will be paid automatically to qualifying students based on the information coded on the following screens&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Higher Education Scholarship (<strong>!HES</strong>) screen in Customer First (CF) - RS will <strong>not</strong> be paid if receipt type '<strong>YES</strong>' is coded for a Commonwealth Accommodation Scholarship (CAS) or for an RS from Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) in relation to the same period. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a customer has ceased receiving a CAS, it <strong>must</strong> be end dated on the <strong>!HES</strong> screen or the RS will not be granted for the new course or education institution. The end date that must be used is 31 Dec in the year it ceased for all CAS, regardless as to when they ceased receiving it in that academic year</li>
		<li>
Higher Education Scholarship Summary (<strong>HESS</strong>) screen - same conditions as above for (<strong>!HES</strong>) screen</li>
		<li>
Education Course Details (<strong>EDC</strong>) screen - RS will only be paid if course type is MST, HGA, HGB, TGA, TGB, SSN, TSC, DOC (ABSTUDY only) or UPC (ABSTUDY only) and institution type on <strong>CODES</strong> screen is U (university), Q (higher education TAFEs) or H (higher education private providers)</li>
		<li>
Independent/Homeless/Away From Home Details (<strong>NIH</strong>) screen - RS will only be paid if <strong>Act&#58;</strong> field code is <strong>AFH</strong> or <strong>HOM</strong> (with <strong>Start/Reject Reason</strong> of HDH, HNH, HOE, HSR or HUR) or <strong>IND</strong> (with <strong>Start/Reject Reason field&#58;</strong> of PCC, PCH, PCM, POR, PPG, PRE, PSF, PSN, PSU)</li>
		<li>
Accommodation History (<strong>ACS</strong>) screen - RS will not be paid if Sharer status is <strong>LWP</strong> or <strong>RCO</strong></li>
		<li>
The Regional Location Details (<strong>RLD</strong>) screen - RS will be paid automatically if the student's RS family home is in Australia and classified as being in a non-major city location. RS will not be paid if the student's RS family home is in an Australian major city, unless the <strong>Ver</strong> field is coded with CLV (campus location verified) to indicate that the student has provided verification that their place of study is in a non-major Australian city location or an overseas location</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>RS for students lodging a claim via the ABSTUDY Claiming Tool (ACT)</strong></p>

<p>Eligibility for RS is determined by ensuring all independence questions are completed as a part of the new claim process within the ABSTUDY Claiming Tool (ACT).</p>

<p>The ACT will only pre-populate the latest current independence details directly from the student record and may not reflect all of the student's independent circumstances, which is used to determine RS eligibility. Once a RS qualifying independence reason is selected, the ACT will gather the 'Family Home' address required to assess the correct rate of RS</p>
		<ul>		<li>
To ensure a new claim is assessed with the correct information staff must discuss <strong>all</strong> the independence questions while running ACT</li>
		<li>
Students may meet more than one independence criterion. To ensure students are not disadvantaged, any independence criterion the student meets must be selected. This will ensure the claim is assessed and processed correctly to provide the best outcome for the student</li>
		<li>
<img src="../resources/images/icon-processing.png" alt="" title="Processing Team&#58; Typically done by specialised processing teams in a service centre or Smart Centre. Unless otherwise stated, staff may complete this step if they are trained." />When processing an ACT claim and the assessment has resulted in the student being eligible for a RS payment, the Regional Location Details (<strong>RLD</strong>) screen must be updated as part of the new claim process</li>		</ul>

<p><strong>For newly qualified students&#58;</strong></p>

receiving Youth Allowance (YA), the RS will issue on the first Entitlement Period End Date (EPED) after their <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-07030020-01.html">RS qualification date</a></li>

			<li>
as immediate arrears following reassessment</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>For continuing students</strong> (students whose start date is before the current period) who do not need to provide verification of study location their RS payment will be issued on their first normal payday after 21 February each year, to coincide with the start of the traditional higher education study year.</p>

<p>RS payments to continuing students who have provided campus verification as requested prior to their RS qualification dates are triggered by a batch reassessment on the default study start date.</p>

<p>If verification of study location was required and is provided after the default study start date, the RS payment depends on whether the student has been studying for 35 days. If they have, then the payment is issued the following day otherwise the day after they complete 35 days of study.</p>

<p>All students who receive the Verification of Campus form (SY101) will have a review (RS1). This review is set to mature 29 days prior to 21 February each year. Upon maturity of this review and, where no verification had been received, the system will create a second review (RS2) to mature in 6 months. Students will need to provide verification before the end of the second review to remain eligible for RS for that calendar year.</p>

<p><strong>Records for students receiving&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>ABSTUDY</strong> will display all RS payments for the student until the end of course (or end of RS qualification if earlier) on the Payment Summary (<strong>PS</strong>) screen</li>
		<li>
<strong>YA</strong> will only display RS payments that occur in the next 2 pay periods (next 2 fortnights). A RS payment further into the future than the student's next 2 pay periods will not display on the Assessment Results (<strong>AR</strong>) screen within an activity or on the <strong>PS</strong> screen. To ensure a scholarship will be assessed in the future, check the Future Activity List (<strong>FAL</strong>) screen for the future scholarship qualification date</li>		</ul>

<p>The higher rate can be paid to students who have had a previous RS qualifying year(s) but only if when they first met the conditions of a RS qualifying year(s) is less than 6 months prior to the current RS qualification date.</p>

<p>Students whose RS family home is in an Australian major city location when commencing the course of study, only qualify for RS if their study location is classified as being in a non-major Australian city location.</p>

<p>In these circumstances, students must provide verification that they are not studying in an Australian major city location using the Verification of Campus form (SY101). For students studying overseas, verification can be obtained from the documents provided by the student for their portability assessment. The necessary coding is the same as that for verification provided on the SY101.</p>

<p>Part A of the form must be completed by the student; Part B must be completed, signed and stamped by an authorised employee of the institution where the student is studying.</p>

<p>The completed form must be returned to Centrelink.</p>

<p>When the SY101 is returned, Service Officers must check that the institution on the form matches the details on the <strong>EDC</strong> screen.</p>

<p>If the form information&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
matches the coding on the <strong>EDC</strong> screen, code the institution details on the <strong>RLD</strong> screen. Update the <strong>VER</strong> field on the <strong>RLD</strong> screen to '<strong>CLV</strong>' (campus location verified)</li>
		<li>
does not match the coding on the <strong>EDC</strong> screen, update the <strong>EDC</strong> screen to match the institution on the SY101 form. Code the institution details on the <strong>RLD</strong> screen and update the <strong>VER</strong> field on the <strong>RLD</strong> screen to '<strong>CLV</strong>' (campus location verified)</li>
		</ul>
<p>The coding will trigger issuing of RS on the relevant day based on&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the student's RS qualification date, and </li>
		<li>
if the study location is an area not classified as an Australian major city or is overseas</li>
		</ul>
<p>Students whose RS family home is <strong>not</strong> in a major city are <strong>not </strong>required to provide verification to receive RS.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Coding of an event date in the future is generally not recommended. This is because a change of circumstance, for example a change of address, may occur and be automatically updated through online services with an event date prior to any future date coding. As a result, the system would not correctly assess the latest change of circumstances. Some online services will automatically code the date the service was used, or a 1 January date. This is acceptable for QOL or QMA purposes.</p>

<p>If granting the away from home rate in the future or a course of study commences in the future, the event date is the date of assessment not the future date. The system will refer to the latest <strong>RLD</strong> entry at the time the away from home rate or course commences to determine RS entitlement.</p>

<p>When processing a new claim for a student who has not provided a family home address but otherwise may be eligible for RS, the <strong>Address Reason</strong> field is auto-populated with <strong>CMP (</strong>Regional Campus Detail). To code <strong>RSD</strong> or <strong>RSI</strong>, both the family home address and details of at least one campus must be present. The Service Officer needs to request family home details from the student before coding <strong>RSD</strong> or <strong>RSI</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>Address Reason</strong> field also has <strong>SSI</strong> as a selectable option, however this is not used for RS assessment purposes.

This will ensure the system is applying the latest location classifications for RS rate determination purposes. This will not impact the original <strong>RLD</strong> entry used to determine qualification in relation to course commencement</li>

<p><strong>Address</strong></p>

<p>Address details are dependent on <strong>Address Reason</strong> field&#58;</p>

<p><strong>Overseas RS family home&#58;</strong></p>

<p>Where it is determined that the RS family home is located overseas the full overseas address is not required to be obtained or entered. ‘<strong>Overseas</strong>’ can be entered into the <strong>Country</strong> field on the <strong>RLD</strong> screen.</p>

<p>If the RS family home was overseas at the time of course commencement additional coding is required in the <strong>Campus</strong> field to ensure the system assesses the student as being qualified for RS. Further information is provided below in <strong>Overseas RS Family Home Campus Coding Requirements</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Online Services/Express Plus Apps&#58;</strong></p>

<p>Services that collect the RS family home information (Update Family Home Address, Update Study Details, Digital Study Load Declaration and Advise Parental Income) will attempt to automatically load information declared by the student or parent.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
When a response of ‘<strong>No</strong>’ is provided to the question&#58; ‘Is your family home located in Australia?’ the relevant service will attempt to load <strong>Overseas</strong> to the <strong>Country&#58;</strong> field. The question response will also be viewable via the Change of Circumstance (CoC) Interaction receipt page.</li>
		<li>
When a response of ‘<strong>Yes</strong>’ is provided to the question&#58; 'Is this your current family home address?' this confirms that the family home address has not changed. The question response will also be viewable via the Change of Circumstance (CoC) Interaction receipt page but it will not display the actual address as it is already on record.</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Online claims&#58;</strong></p>

<p>If an RS family home address is not displayed in the claim summary information, this suggests that the student has answered <strong>No</strong> to claim question 'Is your family home located in Australia?'. ‘<strong>Overseas</strong>’ or ‘<strong>OS</strong>’ can be entered into the <strong>Address Country Code</strong> field in Process Direct via ‘Regional Location Details (<strong>RLD</strong>)’.</p>

<p>Information provided in a claim or online and subsequently automatically data loaded may be inaccurate or incorrect. To help determine the RS family home location details required for an RS assessment, a check of the student’s record and/or parent(s) details is also recommended (Address History (<strong>ADH</strong>) screen, Immigration data on the <strong>TOAS/RSIM</strong> screens, Parental information via MOD JY, Education Details (<strong>EDCH/EDC</strong>) screen).</p>

<p>Where the RS family home was located overseas at the time of course commencement there is a requirement to enter ‘regional placement’ in the <strong>Campus 1</strong> field. This will assess the student as being qualified for RS. This will also ensure the student is not paid the regional rate in relevant subsequent years.</p>

<p><strong>Overseas campus coding</strong></p>

<p>Campus coding of ‘<strong>overseas</strong>’ will result in campus being treated as a regional area and can result in student being qualified to receive RS (this is a different qualification assessment to assessing the RS family home location at the time of course commencement). </p>

<p>If the student qualifies as a result of studying overseas it is important to code another <strong>RLD </strong>screen entry with a future date of event (end date of Customer Advised Travel Details (<strong>RSCD</strong>) screen ‘<strong>OFS</strong>’ coding + 1 day) with the campus details they will study at when they return to Australia. Code the subsequent line in a separate activity. This ensures the ‘<strong>overseas</strong>’ coding will not remain indefinitely and the student is not overpaid.</p>

<p><strong>Ver (Verified field)</strong></p>

<p>The campus verification field must be completed for students whose RS family home is classified as being in an Australian major city location and&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they wish to receive RS on the grounds that all or part of their course in a given year is at a campus or practical placement in a non-major location within Australia, or</li>

<p>If the&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
student's RS family home address is in Australia and classified as a major city location and the customer has <strong>not</strong> provided evidence of their study location, the <strong>Ver</strong> field will default to <strong>CVR</strong> (verification required) and a letter requesting verification of study location will be issued automatically</li>
		<li>
student <strong>has</strong> provided evidence that their study location is in a regional area, the <strong>Ver</strong> field must be manually coded as <strong>CLV </strong>(campus location verified) to trigger the payment of RS</li>
			<ul>			<li>
coding <strong>CLV</strong> must be performed after the Service Officer has processed the returned Verification of Campus form (SY101) or has sighted the documentation submitted at the portability interview for students leaving for overseas study</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>If the SY101 shows the study location is in Australia and in a major city location the customer is not eligible for RS and the <strong>Ver</strong> field should be coded with <strong>CNR</strong> (campus verification is not required). Procedure ends here.</p>

<p>The <strong>Ver</strong> field will default to <strong>CNR</strong> (campus verification not required) if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the student's RS family home address is in a location classified as 'inner regional', 'regional', 'remote' or 'very remote', or</li>

the student's RS family home address is in a location classified as an Australian 'major city' and their study location is in an area classified as an Australian 'major city', or</li>

<p>RS will not be paid for students whose RS family home address is in Australia and in a major city location and studying at a regional campus, until CLV is coded in the <strong>Ver</strong> field.</p>

<p>Because of the break in the away from home rate on the Independent/Homeless/Away from Home Details (<strong>NIH</strong>) screen, the system may read the reinstatement of the away from home rate as a new grant of away from home and may attempt to pay the higher rate or regional rate of RS when only the lower rate is payable.</p>

<p>An overpayment must be raised if a student receives an RS and subsequently ceases to be qualified for the RS.</p>

<p>Usually, the whole amount of the RS is raised as an overpayment. However, if the student receives a higher rate of RS but was only eligible for the regional or lower rate of RS (or if they received the regional rate and were only eligible for the lower rate), the overpayment is the difference between the 2 amounts. See <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-07030010-05.html#bp05_tbl_Manual_adjustme_3">Scenario 3 in the Manual adjustments to system issued RS payments</a> table on the Resources page.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
Youth Allowance (YA) or ABSTUDY Living Allowance was not payable to the student throughout a period (whether or not they were qualified for YA or ABSTUDY Living Allowance at that time)</li>
		<li>
the student received an RS payment because they proposed to undertake an approved scholarship course in a period, however they&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
do not start to undertake that course (this does not apply if the Secretary is satisfied that the student was prevented from starting the course due to exceptional circumstances beyond the person's control), or</li>
			<li>
are not undertaking that course at the end of 35 days after the course commences in the relevant study period, or</li>
			<li>
are not undertaking that course at the end of 35 days after their qualification date for the RS</li>		</ul>
		<li>
a reassessment reduces a student's entitlement to YA or ABSTUDY Living Allowance during the entire period so that only Rent Assistance (RA), Pharmaceutical Allowance (PhA) or both were payable. Any RS they received in relation to that period is a debt</li>

<p>Overpayments may also be raised by the system based on coding on the Education Course Details (<strong>EDC</strong>) screen, and (where applicable) the default study start date.</p>

<p>The student end date is compared with the student start date to determine whether the student is studying in an approved scholarship course on day 35 from qualification date in the period.</p>

<p>All students with a student start date in the same scholarship period (for example, same semester, same year etc.) will have their overpayment calculated <strong>automatically</strong> by the system.</p>

<p>For continuing students a default study start date will be automatically provided to ensure scholarship payments are generated during each scholarship period.</p>

<p>When updating a study end date, the system may determine a particular student is eligible for a scholarship payment based on this default study start date</p>

<p>This is not an accurate reflection on the actual start date for the student in any ongoing semester/study period. If an overpayment has been identified, Service Officers <strong>must</strong> raise a debt by updating the Higher Education Scholarship (<strong>HES</strong>) screen accordingly</p>

<p>If it is identified that a debt should not have been raised, the record should be documented clearly for the teams managing these debts to be aware of the circumstances and investigate accordingly</p>

<p><strong>If the system has incorrectly raised an RS debt</strong> to a qualified student, to ensure the duplicate payment is not issued for the same scholarship period at a later date&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
go to the <strong>HESD</strong> screen and enter the following&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
<strong>Type</strong> ORS</li>
			<li>
<strong>Receives</strong> Y</li>
			<li>
<strong>Start Date</strong> start date of the period</li>
			<li>
<strong>End Date</strong> end date of the period</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>These students must have re-commenced studies in the new year/semester and be studying in an approved scholarship course on day 35 from scholarship qualification date to remain eligible for the RS payment. If they are not studying on day 35 and the system does not automatically raise the RS as an overpayment, manually raise the RS payment as an overpayment.</p>

<p>The system's reliance on a default study start date for continuing students may result in an incorrect payment (overpayment or underpayment) when a new course end date is coded. This may happen if the student's actual institution start date for the relevant scholarship period is different from the default study start date.</p>

<p><strong>RS overpayment&#58;</strong> If an RS overpayment is created by the system based on a default study start date, Service Officers must check the student's actual start date and determine whether study is undertaken in an approved scholarship course on day 35 after this date before raising the debt.</p>

<p><strong>Coding course end date&#58;</strong> When coding a course end date, Service Officers must also check the actual start date for the student even if there are 35 days between the default study start date and the end date. If the student's actual start date was later than the default study start date, there may not be 35 days before the end date, and a manual overpayment will need to be raised.</p>

<p>RS may not appear on the Assessment Results (<strong>AR</strong>) screen within an activity.
