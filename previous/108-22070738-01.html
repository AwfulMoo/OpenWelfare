<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_What_is_Single_">What is Single Touch Payroll</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Single Touch Payroll (STP) is an Australian Government initiative where employers report payroll information via STP enabled software to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) each time employees are paid. This STP reported payroll information is known as a pay event and can occur weekly, fortnightly, monthly or other frequencies. </p>

<p>Payroll reporting of PayEvent 2020 data via STP-enabled software was mandatory from 1 January 2022. The ATO has, however, taken a flexible approach based on the readiness of the business and their software provider. This will mean that Services Australia will continue to see growth in the number of customers with STP data.</p>

<p>Not all payroll data reported to the ATO is required by Services Australia to administer the Social Security system. Services Australia accesses and prepares only the required data in near real time to pre-fill in customer and staff-facing tools. Pre-filling means customers do not have to provide information that is already known by the government and provides a simple, helpful, respectful and transparent experience.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_STP_Service_Pro">STP Service Profiling</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>When an STP employer reports employment income data for a customer receiving an income support payment (ISP), service profiling will automatically place the customer onto 2 weekly <a target="_blank" href="../self-service/133-04180000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Reporting_onlin_2">statement reporting</a>. This can be viewed on the Reporting Regime Summary (<strong>RPRS</strong>) screen, where the reason will show as STP.</p>

<p>If a customer advises they do not work after being placed on reporting for the STP reason, Service Officers are not to take the customer <strong>off</strong> reporting until the <strong>STP Employer Update Workflow</strong> in Process Direct has been run, to check for any employer details.  If an STP Employer is presented, discuss this with the customer and either accept or reject the employer details and complete the update. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> where there is no pre-filled STP employer details available, cancel the activity.</p>

<p>Service profiling can also take some customers off reporting. Customers with no mutual obligations and with no other employment income, will be taken off reporting or reverted back to their prior reporting requirements&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
6 fortnights after confirming their STP cessation details including the cessation date, or</li>
		<li>
if there is no STP cessation details, after having no STP pay events for 6 consecutive fortnights.  </li>
		</ul>
<p>If customers are automatically taken off reporting for the above reasons, or manually by a Service Officer and a subsequent STP pay event is available, the customer will be placed back onto 2 weekly statement reporting.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Reviewing_and_c">STP Confirmation Service</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>When STP data is available when reporting through self service channels, the customer is advised there is information reported by their employer through Single Touch Payroll. This means the reporting task will be a 2 step process. </p>

<p><strong>First step&#58;</strong> Customers are directed to the <strong>STP Confirmation Service</strong> in the <strong>Report Employment Income (REI) workflow</strong> to review, accept or change the pre-filled STP data and submit the information with the STP Declaration. Once submitted, they are unable to make any additional changes to the confirmed STP data, however they can add further pay details that may not have pre-filled yet for the STP employer. If there is more than one STP employer, the customer will need to review the STP data for each employer separately. The STP income details will then update to <strong>EAPP/IMPS</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Second step&#58;</strong> After submitting the STP data, the customer will enter the REI service of the workflow to continue with their reporting. They will see the confirmed STP data pre-filled into their report. They can then add employment income for non-STP employers, income for their partner and report any hours worked, if required. The fortnightly report is only finalised once the customer also submits the REI Declaration. </p>

<p>After the customer submits the REI Declaration, a <strong>DOC</strong> will generate with the captured STP data and other details. If the customer exits the reporting service after only submitting the STP data at the first step, a <strong>DOC</strong> will generate with the STP data only. If a Service Officer assists the customer to complete their reporting, a separate<strong> DOC</strong> is generated. This DOC may show ‘no income declared’ if no further income details are reported because the customer has already confirmed STP data and will be viewable on <strong>EAPP</strong> and <strong>EMGI</strong>. </p>

<p>STP data is presented to customers when they report through their Centrelink online account, Express Plus Centrelink mobile app or though Interactive Voice Response (IVR). When claiming certain income support payments and benefits, STP data will present through their Centrelink online account or via an Assisted Customer Claim (ACC).</p>

<p>Service Officers can access STP data when using the following in Process Direct&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Earnings and Reporting workflow</li>
		<li>
STP Employer Update workflow</li>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>When STP data is available at the time a customer is reporting or claiming certain income support payments and benefits, the employer’s name and ABN/WPN will present for the customer to review and either confirm or reject that they are working for the STP employer.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
When <strong>confirmed</strong>, the customer can link as a <strong>New Employer</strong> or merge with an existing employer where it matches on the record, to avoid any duplication of employers </li>
			<ul>			<li>
The customer only needs to confirm each STP employer once</li>
			<li>
if linked as a New Employer, it will pre-fill to <strong>EAPP</strong> with a pay event of <strong>0.00</strong> with <strong>DOV</strong> that the update is being made </li>		</ul>
		<li>
If <strong>rejected</strong>, the STP employer details are added to <strong>EMCF</strong> with a status of ‘Rejected’</li>
			<ul>			<li>
If STP data is available when next reporting, the STP employer name and ABN/WPN will present again for the customer to review</li>
			<li>
If the customer rejects the employer a second time, an STP intervention activity will be created for follow up by compliance staff</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when an STP employer has been confirmed on<strong> EMCF</strong> and linked to an existing employer from <strong>EAPP</strong>, the pre-filled ABN will override the <strong>Employer ABN</strong> field of the linked employer. If an incorrect employer was selected from <strong>EAPP</strong>, the <strong>STP Employer Update workflow</strong> must be run to reject the status. Once the activity is completed, the <strong>Employer ABN</strong> field of the incorrectly linked employer will revert to its previous status. See Process tab.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>Once a customer confirms an STP employer, each pay event that occurs in the customer’s entitlement period pre-fills when reporting, for the customer to check, confirm or change. The pay event data may include more than one type of <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-22070738-05.html#bp05_L3TT_STP_employment_">income component</a>. Where there are multiple STP employers, the STP income must be reviewed and accepted separately.</p>

<p>There may be instances where pre-filled STP data may not match the gross figure of what was paid in a customer’s reporting period. Remind the customer that if the information does not match their payslip details, the amounts can be adjusted before accepting the data. </p>

<p>Service Officers who are assisting the customer with their reporting through the Earnings and Reporting workflow in Process Direct can add notes about any variations made before finalising the activity.  </p>

<p>Once STP data is confirmed and accepted by the customer, it is automatically loaded onto the appropriate screens on the customer’s record. The Employment Income Paid Details (<strong>EAPP</strong>) screen will display <strong>each</strong> assessable employment income component under the one employer name with a frequency of LOP and DOV of when it was paid. See <a target="_blank" href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010010-01.html">Recording and correcting employment income details</a>.</p>

<p>If STP data has not pre-filled at the time of reporting, customers can manually add the pay components, by selecting ‘add pay event’. Manually added pay events on<strong> EMGI</strong> will update to <strong>EAPP</strong> with a verification code of ‘<strong>NVE</strong>’.</p>

<p>The <strong>EMGI</strong> screen displays <strong>Gross STP Income</strong> reported by the STP employer and <strong>Gross Income Reported</strong> by the customer. <strong>Income Variation</strong> will advise whether income has been varied downward, varied upward or not varied. </p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010050-01.html">Salary Sacrifice</a> components will pre-fill for display purposes only and will not be used in the PayPP calculation, as the amount is already included in the Gross Income. <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-05020040-01.html">Reportable Fringe Benefits</a> will pre-fill with the non-grossed up amount, however the grossed-up amount will map to EAPP without Service Officers needing to make any adjustments.

		<div class="block">

<p>STP data that has been reviewed and confirmed by the customer will display on EAPP with a source code of STV and on the IMPS screen with a source code of STP. If any of these confirmed amounts need to be updated, evidence must be provided before corrections can be made by Service Officers. <strong>Do not manually make any updates directly on EAPP or IMPS.</strong> </p>

<p>Corrections to these confirmed amounts must be made using the Earnings and Reporting workflow in Process Direct, selecting <strong>Update past periods</strong> and then <strong>Yes</strong> to wanting to ‘Update income for a past period’. After selecting the relevant periods from the Past Period Range, the <strong>EMGI</strong> screen appears. Each reporting period will display one at a time and once the corrections are made and <strong>Accept Income</strong> is selected, the changes will update the coding on <strong>EAPP</strong> or <strong>IMPS</strong>.</p>

<p>When updating a past period where employment income was manually coded on <strong>EAPP</strong>, but STP data is available and hasn’t been accepted, the workflow will navigate to <strong>EMGI</strong> to check, confirm or change the STP details. The confirmed STP data will update to <strong>EAPP</strong>, so the manually coded income will need to be deleted. This is because updates to <strong>EMGI</strong> will only update the relevant reporting period that had previously been mapped to <strong>EAPP</strong>.</p>

<p>Where a customer has confirmed and accepted pay events which have been duplicated, Service Officers will need to <strong>Update past periods</strong> and zero out each duplicated pay component on <strong>EMGI</strong> so that only the singular pay event remains. Once <strong>Accept income</strong> is selected, the <strong>Gross STP Income</strong> field will display the duplicated total and the <strong>Gross Income Reported</strong> field will show the correct singular total for the reporting period. Service Officers will need to delete the duplicated components when navigated to <strong>EAPP</strong> as system functionality doesn’t allow a correction of $0 to be inserted.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the Earnings and Reporting workflow task in Process Direct is not selected, the edit option on EMGI will not be enabled so Service Officers will only be able to view the STP data.</p>

they are subject to mutual obligation requirements during statement reporting or in a new claim</li>
		<li>
STP cessation data is pre-filled, and</li>
		<li>
the STP employer advises the cessation reason is dismissal or voluntary</li>
		</ul>
<p>An unemployment failure will need to be generated for PST-skilled Service Officers to investigate.</p>

<p>When leave and redundancy payments are reported with cessation data, the customer is asked to provide the amount of days the leave covers or their average weekly wage, to determine the duration of any potential Income Maintenance Period (IMP). Service Officers must ensure that the leave period is reasonable.</p>

<p><strong>For example</strong>, for an unused leave payment of $900 (annual leave), 2 days would be considered unreasonable but 5 days would be reasonable.</p>

<p>The customer will not need to supply an Employment Separation Certificate (<strong>SU1</strong>) when there are no changes made to the cessation data. However, if there are changes to amounts paid or there is any doubt about the number of days of the leave or termination payments, an SU1, final payslip or letter from the employer will be required.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58; </strong>some employers may pay their employees <strong>Unused leave on Termination</strong> with no cessation date or reason being pre-filled. If this occurs, the customer will be asked if they are still working for that employer and may need to provide an <strong>SU1</strong> where they confirm they have ceased working. This may occur for the following scenarios&#58;</p>

<p><strong>Transition to Phase 2 PayEvent 2020 (PE2020)</strong></p>

<p>In situations where an employment relationship terminates prior to the employer transitioning into PayEvent 2020, it is possible that after they transition to PayEvent 2020 the employer may still make a payment of unused leave to the individual. That may result in cessation date and reason being unavailable within the payroll system, as the timing of the termination was prior to transition, during phase 1. Unused leave and terminations payments will update to IMP. An SU1/letter from employer will be required for payments subject to mutual obligation requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Employment basis changes from permanent to casual</strong></p>

<p>An employee may change from a permanent employment status (full time or part time) to casual. When paid, these entitlements are correctly classified in STP as unused leave on termination but because the individual remains a casual employee of the same employer the payment is assessed as a lump sum and coded on <strong>EAPP</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Reinstatement</strong></p>

<p>An employee may leave their employment, be paid their entitlements, and later be reinstated. Commonly, this can occur in wrongful termination situations and the effect of the reinstatement is that the cessation is taken to have never occurred. The instruction for employers is to remove the cessation date. However, the reinstatement does not change the fact a payment for unused leave was made, and so it must remain in the STP reporting. The STP reporting will, as a result, show amounts present as <strong>Unused Leave on Termination</strong> without a cessation date or reason. If the customer advises they are still working for that employer, the payment is assessed as a lump sum and coded on <strong>EAPP</strong>.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Services Australia uses the STP data from Pay Events to calculate a Pay Per Period (PayPP) amount. This is done by comparing the gross YTD (Year to Date) figure of all income components from the previous Pay Event with that of the current Pay Event. The difference between these amounts is the PayPP amount, and displays as <strong>Gross STP Income</strong> .</p>

<p>When presented with pre-filled STP data, customers must review and either confirm or change the PayPP information before the system will code and apply the amounts. Assessable PayPP amounts that have been confirmed are used to calculate a customer’s entitlement and are indicated under <strong>Used in PayPP Calculation</strong>.</p>

<p>For further information about the different types of income components refer to <a target="_blank" href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010000-01.html">Assessment of employment income for Centrelink payments</a>. </p>

<p>Income components that are assessable and included in the PayPP calculation are displayed to customers when they are reporting through their Centrelink online account or the Express Plus mobile app. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-22070738-05.html#bp05_L3TT_STP_Allowance_t">Resources</a> to view which allowances are assessable.</p>

<p>When a customer reports through self service channels and has the allowance type Other allowances, they are asked if the allowance is a reimbursement of a work related expense. This will determine whether the amount is assessable or not. Service Officers using the Earnings and Reporting workflow in Process Direct need to</p>

<p>Customers who are paid worker’s compensation payments by an STP employer, will have these amounts pre-filled as <strong>Paid leave - worker’s compensation</strong>. </p>

<p>When compensation payments are reported through STP, the system will check the Compensation Management Summary (CMS) screen for a previous assessment by the Compensation Recovery Team (CRT). Where this has already been assessed and is coded on CMS, the amounts reported through STP will not be applied to the record, unless the amounts have changed.</p>

<p>Where there has not been a previous assessment of the worker’s compensation, the pre-filled <strong>Paid leave - worker’s compensation</strong> amount will automatically load onto the <strong>EAPP</strong> screen for at least 2 fortnights. <a href="../compensation/117-01040010-01.html">The customer will need to complete a MOD C - Compensation Details form</a>.
