<p>On 2 June, Claire lodges a pre-birth FTB claim for her first child due on 23 July. Within the claim, Claire provides a current year estimate of $35,000 and a next financial year estimate of $20,000.</p>

<p>Danielle lodges a Newborn Child Declaration (FA081) on 10 December to support a claim for Parental Leave Pay (PPL) and FTB for a child born on 28 November.</p>

<p>Danielle receives a phone call from the processing team to discuss Danielle's current year income estimate to ensure PPL has been included as it is a taxable payment.</p>

<p>Danielle provides a revised estimate. The estimate change is a non-income related change as it relates directly to the birth of the child, therefore the DOV is 28 November (date of birth).</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 2</strong></p>

<p>Barry is currently receiving FTB based on an estimate of $50,000 for 2 school-aged children. Barry contacts on 5 February to advise a 2 year old family member came into Barry's care on 11 January. Because of this, Barry has to reduce hours of work and provides a revised estimate of $40,000.</p>

<p>The estimate change is a non-income related change as it relates directly to a child coming into care. Therefore, the DOV is 11 January (date the family member came into Barry's care).</p>

<p>On 1 October, Diane lodges a claim for Paid Parental Leave (PPL) and FTB for the birth of a second child, born on 28 July. At the same time, Diane provides a new estimate.</p>

<p>Diane receives a phone call from the processing team to discuss Diane's current year income estimate, to make sure PPL has been included and to determine the reason for the change in income. Diane advises that the change in income is due to a change in salary from 5 September and is not related to the birth of the child. </p>

<p>As an income related change exists, the DOV of the income estimate is the date of notification, 1 October. The system will automatically determine the date of effect (DOE) for the birth of the baby and the income estimate.</p>

<p>The birth of the baby is a change in <strong>non-income related</strong> circumstances, so the DOE for the FTB rate change relating to the birth of the child is 28 July (child's date or birth).</p>

<p>Diane's change in salary is a change in <strong>income related</strong> circumstances not related to the birth of the child. The DOE for the income related change will depend on whether it is a favourable or unfavourable decision.</p>

<p>Diane lodged the claim on 1 October and the next Entitlement Period End Day (EPED) is 12 October.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the change can be actioned before 12 October (EPED) regardless of whether the income estimate has increased or decreased the DOE will be 1 October (date of notification)</li>
		<li>
If the update cannot be actioned before 12 October (EPED) and the income estimate has increased, the DOE applies from the later of the date of notification (1 October) and date paid to plus 1 (29 September) as it is considered an unfavourable decision, that is, rate of payment has decreased</li>
		<li>
If the update cannot be actioned before 12 October (EPED) and the income estimate has decreased, the DOE applies from the date of notification (1 October) as it is considered a favourable decision, that is, rate of payment has increased and arrears may be payable</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Outcome</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
FTB for the newborn baby is payable from 28 July based on the customers previous estimate</li>
		<li>
The new estimate is recorded with a DOV of 1 October (date of notification)</li>
		<li>
The system will determine the DOE for the new estimate and change the FTB rate from this date</li>

See <a href="../families/007-11010100-01.html">Assessment of income cancellation periods in Family Tax Benefit (FTB) reconciliation</a>.</p>

<p>If the customer receives CCS, any change to their subsidy percentage takes effect from 12 August 2019. This is the start of the CCS fortnight after the DOV. <a href="../families/007-17103115-01.html">Activity Test details</a> may also need updating where a customer has had a change in their income estimate.</p>

<p><strong>FTB CAN-INC within previous financial year</strong></p>

<p>Customer's FTB has cancelled due to income (CAN-INC) on 30 March 2019 (2018-19 financial year). The customer lodges an online claim on the 10 August 2019 providing a revised income estimate. The customer has not lodged a tax return for the 2018-19 financial year.</p>

<p>The request is actioned by a Service Officer who assesses the claim as a request for <a href="../families/007-07090030-01.html">restoration of FTB</a> (CAN- INC in the previous financial year).</p>

<p>Date of Event (DOV) of new estimate is the Date of Receipt (DOR) 10 August 2019.</p>

<p>Date of Effect (DOE) is the date the original FTB- CAN-INC in previous financial year that is 30 March 2019.</p>

<p>Non-payment periods&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The non-payment period between the 30 March and 30 June 2019 will be assessed once actual income is known during reconciliation</li>
		<li>
The non-payment period between 1 July and 9 August 2019 will not be assessed or paid until the customer contacts after the end of the financial year, once actual income is known. See <a href="../families/007-11010100-01.html">Assessment of income cancellation periods in Family Tax Benefit (FTB) reconciliation</a></li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>FTB arrears due to previously recorded CCS income estimate(s)</strong></p>

<p>FTB arrears should not be paid when the system is attempting to pay FTB arrears for the CAN- INC non-payment periods due to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
an existing estimate(s) given for CCS purposes, and</li>
		<li>
this is lower than the most recent estimate provided</li>
		</ul>
<p>Code the FYSO screen for the CAN-INC non-payment period, using Status code CAN and Reason code OTH. This will stop any FTB arrears paying for this period. The arrears will be assessed in reconciliation when actual income details are confirmed.</p>

<p>If the system is paying FTB arrears prior to the DOR and the previous estimate given for CCS purposes is <strong>equal</strong> to or <strong>higher</strong> than the most recent estimate provided, these arrears can be paid if the customer is eligible. It is not necessary to discuss payment choices for this period.</p>

<p>Samantha is currently in receipt of FTB and separates from a partner on 12 October. Samantha contacts the Smart Centre on 1 November to advise of the change in circumstances and provide a new income estimate of $50,000 as an individual (previously $70,000). FTB is reassessed from the date of separation to exclude the partner's income.</p>

<p>The DOV for the revised estimate is 1 November (date of notification).</p>

<p>From 12 - 31 October, FTB will be paid based <strong>only</strong> on the customer's previous estimate (the system will disregard the ex-partner's estimate for this period).</p>

<p>From 1 November, FTB will be paid based on the customer's revised estimate.</p>

<p>From the start of the CCS fortnight after the date of separation, CCS will be assessed based solely on Samantha’s previous estimate ($70,000). Any increase in CCS subsidy percentage due to Samantha’s new estimate will take effect from the start of the CCS fortnight after the DOV (1 November). <a href="../families/007-17103115-01.html">Activity Test details</a> may also need updating where a customer has had a decrease in their income estimate.</p>

<p><strong>Separation and FTB CAN-INC</strong></p>

<p>Customer is FTB CAN-INC from 2 July 2019 due to an income estimate of $50,000 and $60,000 for customer and partner. On 1 November 2019, the customer separates from the partner. Customer lodges an FTB claim on 25 November 2019 and advises an income estimate of $57,000.</p>

<p>As the customer is FTB CAN-INC in the current financial year, consider the FTB NCL a request for restoration of FTB.</p>

<p>The customer is revising their estimate at the same time as notifying the change in relationship status. Therefore, two different date of effects apply in reassessing the FTB entitlement.</p>

<p>After the separation has been recorded, the customer's FTB can be restored from 1 November 2019 as this is the date the customer's circumstances changed (date of separation).</p>

<p>The revised estimate of the customer's income is coded with a date of event (DOV) of 25 November 2019 (date of notification).</p>

<p>The period from 1 November 2019 to 24 November 2019 will be paid based on the previous estimate of $50,000. From 25 November 2019, the new estimate of $57,000 will be used to assess FTB payment.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; if the system is attempting to pay FTB arrears for the CAN-INC periods when being restored based on a previous estimate which is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>lower</strong> than the most recent estimate provided, the arrears should be adjusted to match the estimate most recently supplied</li>
		<li>
<strong>equal to or higher</strong> than the most recent estimate provided, these arrears can be paid provided they are correct</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Separation - CCS CUR and FTB NCL</strong></p>

<p>Melanie has a partner and has been CCS CUR since 1 July. The income estimates on file are $50,000 for Melanie and $60,000 for Melanie’s partner, a combined income of $110,000.</p>

<p>On 1 May, Melanie lodges a FTB NCL via the online service. Within the new claim, Melanie advises of a separation from the partner on 1 April. The income estimate provided for Melanie in the new claim is $20,000.</p>

<p>As Melanie is CCS CUR and has not claimed FTB previously in this financial year, the DOV for the new estimate is 1 July.</p>

<p>The FTB arrears will be paid for the period 1 July to 31 March based on Melanie's new estimate of $20,000 and the partners existing estimate of $60,000. From 1 April (date of separation), FTB will be paid based only on Melanie's estimate of $20,000.</p>

<p>Any CCS estimates on file are corrected to 1 July, resulting in a reassessment of CCS. Any increased CCS percentage will take effect from the start of the CCS financial year. This may result in arrears issuing directly to the customer, subject to the submission of session reports. <a href="../families/007-17103115-01.html">Activity Test details</a> may also need updating where a customer has had a decrease in their income estimate.</p>

<p><strong>Separation – FTB claim is lodged by ex-partner following separation from FTB current customer</strong></p>

<p>Kim has a partner, Tom, and receives FTB entitlement for their 3 children. The income estimates on file from 1 July are $50,000 for Kim and $60,000 for Tom, a combined income of $110,000.</p>

<p>On 1 May, Tom lodges an FTB NCL via the online service. Within the claim, Tom advises they separated on 1 April and both have 50% shared care for their 3 children from the same date. The income estimate provided for Tom in the new claim is $70,000.</p>

<p>The DOV for Tom’s new income estimate is 1 April (date of separation). This must be manually changed within the online claim.</p>

<p>In this instance, the income estimate must not be backdated to 1 July or to a date prior to separation. If this occurs, it will cause an incorrect reassessment of Kim’s FTB entitlement for the period they were partnered, based on Tom’s new increased estimate of $70,000.</p>

<p>Customer is FTB CUR with an income estimate of $35,000. The customer contacts on 15 May 2015 to advise of becoming partnered on 30 March. They provide an income estimate of $45,000 for the partner and the customer revises the estimate to $30,000. There are 2 DOVs for the estimate update.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The partner's estimate is updated with a DOV of 30 March (date of circumstance change) as this is a non-income related change. The partner's estimate was provided only because there was a change in the relationship status</li>
		<li>
The customer's estimate is updated with a DOV of 15 May (date of notification) as this is an income related change</li>
		<li>
For CCS the DOV of the income estimate for the partner will be the date they became partnered&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Any change in entitlement will take effect from the start of the next CCS fortnight (Monday) after the DOV. This means a customer will be treated as single during the CCS fortnight when they became partnered. If the customer becomes partnered on the start of a CCS fortnight, it will take effect from that date</li>
			<li>
<a href="../families/007-17103115-01.html">Activity Test details</a> must be provided for the partner, and customer’s details may also have to be updated where they have had a change in their income estimate</li>			</ul>			</ul>

<p>The DOV of the estimate is the date of notification 1 February 2018.</p>

<p>Jenny's fortnightly payments can resume from the date of confirmation of the ATIs for all outstanding non-lodger decisions (15 January 2018). No arrears are payable for the FTB not received in the current year until the ATI for the current year is confirmed in the next financial year.</p>

<p>Rachel is getting FTB for 2 children. Rachel rings to advise they will be temporarily out of the country to care for a sick parent. Rachel provides a departure date of 5 July 2019 but cannot advise when they will return.</p>

<p>Rachel departs Australia on 5 July 2019.</p>

<p>On 16 August 2019, Rachel has been out of the country for 6 weeks and is therefore no longer eligible for FTB. As a result, FTB cancels FTB CAN-6WK.</p>

<p>Rachel returns to Australia on 1 November 2019 and lodges a new FTB claim on 15 November 2019 (as was outside of Australia for more than 13 weeks).</p>

<p>The date of event (DOV) for the income estimate will be 1 November 2019, the date eligibility has resumed following Rachel (and the 2 children) returning to Australia.</p>

<p>The income estimate DOV, which the system populates in the workflow or online claim, must be manually changed to 1 November 2019.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> in this instance, the income estimate would not be backdated to 1 July 2019 or to a date before Rachel’s return to Australia. That may pay arrears or raise a debt for a period the customer has already been paid.</p>
