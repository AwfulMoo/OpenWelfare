<p>Job seekers participating in NEIS will firstly complete NEIS Training, known also as NEIS pre-training. This accredited training course helps job seekers gain a nationally recognised qualification and is appropriate to starting and running a small business. Depending on the type of proposed new business, the NEIS provider will refer the job seeker to either a&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Certificate III in Micro-Business Operations, or</li>
		<li>
Certificate IV in Small Business Management</li>
		</ul>
<p>During the training, job seekers will develop a NEIS Business Plan, which will need to be approved by their NEIS provider.</p>

<p>When a JobSeeker Payment (JSP), Youth Allowance (YA), or Special Benefit (SpB) job seeker with mutual obligation requirements, or a Parenting Payment Single (PPS) or Disability Support Payment (DSP) job seeker with Compulsory Participation Requirements commences NEIS pre-training, the activity will auto-display on the Activity and Exemption Summary (<strong>AEX</strong>) page with the code '<strong>NEI</strong>'.</p>

<p>The NEIS pre-training activity will be included in the job seeker's Job Plan by their employment services provider, prior to the job seeker's commencement date. Job seekers undertaking NEIS pre-training may be eligible for EdEP. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-08050000-01.html">Education Entry Payment (EdEP)</a> for information on eligibility and coding requirements.</p>

<p>Participation in NEIS pre-training fully satisfies the job seeker's mutual obligation or Compulsory Participation requirements and the job seeker will continue to receive their income support payment for the duration of their NEIS pre-training.</p>

Staff should select this activity and cancel it as no action is required.</p>

<p>These job seekers are not subject to mutual obligation requirements, however they may have the NEIS pre-training activity recorded in a voluntary Job Plan by the employment services provider, prior to the job seeker's NEIS commencement date. Their participation in NEIS pre-training will have no impact on their payment eligibility.</p>

<p>JSP, YA and SpB (under JSP conditions) job seekers participating in NEIS Activity (known as NEIS Assistance), the NEIS Activity will auto-display on both the <strong>AEX</strong> screen and the Other Government Payments (<strong>OGP</strong>) screen with the code '<strong>EIS</strong>', and will include the start date and the expected end date.</p>

<p>JSP, YA and SpB job seekers who are undertaking NEIS Activity and are still eligible for income support payments, will be deemed as fully meeting their mutual obligation requirements. As such, NEIS participants are managed by Services Australia and will be exited from the employment services provider's caseload, as they will not be required to attend any employment services provider appointments. Service Officers must negotiate a Job Plan with the NEIS participant, with NEIS as the approved activity.</p>

If the suspension is due to a medical condition, and it is confirmed that NEIS Allowance is suspended and all other eligibility rules are met, Service Officers can grant an income support payment for the period of the NEIS suspension.</p>

<p>If the suspension is due to other reasons, such as not complying with NEIS program requirements, Service Officers should reject the claim because the job seeker is receiving a precluding payment and refer the job seeker back to their NEIS provider.</p>

<p>Service Officers should document any discussions with NEIS providers and scan any documentation provided by the job seeker which confirms suspension of NEIS.</p>

<p>PPP job seekers must change from income support payment to NEIS Allowance and are not entitled to any partial rate payment from Services Australia. NEIS Allowance, being paid at the 'single, 22 or over, with no children' rate of JobSeeker Payment (JSP), will always be more than the job seeker's former rate of PPP. The NEIS Allowance direct deduction amount applied will always reduce the PPP rate to nil.</p>

<p>Therefore, job seekers in receipt of PPP will be auto-cancelled upon commencement in the NEIS Activity.</p>

<p>PPP job seekers whose income support payment has been cancelled due to transfer to NEIS Allowance may be eligible for an extended concession card entitlement. These job seekers are required to lodge a claim for the LIC in order to receive the LIC.</p>

It is paid to NEIS participants who are receiving RA from Services Australia under their current Allowance/Pension at the date they first start receiving basic NEIS Allowance.</p>

<p>If a NEIS participant is receiving RA because they receive more than the base rate of Family Tax Benefit (FTB), RA will continue to be paid by Services Australia with their FTB for as long as the job seeker is entitled to RA. It is not limited to 26 weeks. The NEIS participant's partner may also be entitled to RA from Services Australia for the same period.</p>

<p>NEIS RA eligibility is confirmed with the Department of Education, Skills and Employment form - Confirmation of Eligibility for NEIS Rental Assistance (P1193 INDD). NEIS Panel Members (NPM) will issue this form to prospective participants who then bring it to Services Australia for completion. The NEIS participant then returns the form to the NPM. NEIS RA is <strong>non-taxable</strong> income.</p>

<p>Department of Education, Skills and Employment NEIS transactions can sometimes result in an overpayment. Started activities will appear on the <strong>AL</strong> screen with the keyword '<strong>OGNEIS</strong>'. Service Officers <strong>must not</strong> delete this activity to finalise another activity, as this could lead to duplicate payments of income support and NEIS. Service Officers must finalise the started activity before any action can be taken on a job seeker's record. Where required, Service Officers should contact their Subject Matter Expert or Participation Programme Support Team following local escalation procedures.</p>

<p>The '<strong>NEI</strong>' (Customer is Self Employed under NEIS) cancellation reason ceased being used<strong> </strong>from 27 April 2020, but may display for some customers prior to this date.</p>

<p>JSP, YA and SpB job seekers have their payment auto-cancelled '<strong>CPP</strong>' (Customer on Precluding Payment) upon commencement in the NEIS Activity, on the basis that they are now receiving NEIS Allowance instead. However, some of these job seekers may be entitled to a higher rate of income support than that paid under NEIS Allowance.</p>

<p>They are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
JSP and SpB job seekers who are single with a dependent child</li>
		<li>
JSP, SpB and YA single principal carers with long term (automatic) exemptions</li>
		<li>
JSP and SpB single job seekers aged 60 and over, who have been in receipt of an income support payment for more than 9 continuous months</li>
		<li>
JSP and SpB job seekers who are assessed as either 'Illness Separated', 'Respite Care Couple', or 'Partner in gaol'</li>
		</ul>
<p>These job seekers, if they have no affecting income, should be eligible to continue to receive a partial rate of their income support payment on top of their NEIS Allowance after the dollar for dollar reduction has been applied.</p>

<p>The partial rate must be calculated manually, taking into account any income being received by the job seeker (including any business income associated with the new business being started under NEIS). The partial rate is then set as a manual rate override. Any changes in income, which affect rate, must be manually calculated and set during this partial rate period until the NEIS Allowance ceases.</p>

<p>If these job seekers also receive employment income, they may be eligible for Working Credit.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Service Officers will need to check any Centrepay deductions and, if necessary, discuss with the job seeker any action required for these deductions.</p>

<p>If this action was instigated internally by Services Australia (e.g. by actioning a list of NEIS commencements who may still be eligible for a partial rate), rather than by the job seeker contacting us, Service Officers must make contact with the job seeker to explain what has happened. Otherwise, they may receive conflicting automatic letters from the agency about the cancellation and then restoration of their payment, which may cause confusion.</p>

<p>The job seeker must also be asked to provide information about any ongoing income and assets, and other circumstances that will factor into a manual rate calculation.</p>

<p>If the contact by phone is not successful, a manual request to contact letter (Q164) should be issued to the job seeker. Regardless of the outcome (contact or no contact, restoration or no restoration), a <strong>DOC</strong> must be created on the record to explain action taken and decisions made on eligibility.</p>

<strong>Yes</strong>, finalise the activity via Assessment Results (<strong>AR</strong>)</li>
		<li>
<strong>No</strong>, on the <strong>RCO</strong> screen code the start date and end dates for the rate. The rate will be the difference between the rate at which NEIS is paid, and the rate of payment the job seeker was in receipt of immediately prior to changing to NEIS Allowance</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> NEIS Allowance will usually run for a maximum period of 39 weeks. Service Officers will need to confirm the start and end dates.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Press [<strong>Enter</strong>]</li>
		<li>
Go the <strong>AEX</strong> screen and code the activity type as '<strong>NES</strong>', with the same dates as the dates on the <strong>RCO</strong> screen</li>

<p>Where a NEIS participant receives NEIS Allowance from their provider, it is paid for the first 39 of the 52 weeks of assistance only. After this time, they can re-test their eligibility for income support payment (if they were cancelled), or have their rate of payment reassessed with no direct deductions due to NEIS Allowance.</p>

<p>These participants will receive a letter from their NEIS provider with details of their final payment of NEIS Allowance. The letter will tell them to contact Centrelink to determine eligibility to any ongoing payments, including reclaiming income support if they were cancelled. The letter advises the participants to show Centrelink this letter as evidence of the cessation of NEIS Allowance. Check that the NEIS participant has uploaded this letter to their record.</p>

<p>As part of their reclaim or reassessment, <a href="../job-seekers/001-09100010-01.html">staff must complete a new Job Plan</a> for the rest of this activity period, with the only compulsory requirement being participating in NEIS. The Job Plan workflow will pre-populate the Activity Status, Start Date and End Date. The Start Date and End Date will auto-align with the <strong>NES</strong> activity on the <strong>AEX</strong> screen. The participant's NEIS provider should be included in the '<strong>Organisation</strong>' field.</p>

<p><strong>Registration and Referral</strong></p>

<p>These job seekers remain ineligible for jobactive participation until they complete NEIS and are exited by their NEIS provider. They <strong>cannot be referred to a jobactive provider</strong> during this period and must be registered as No Stream Services Referral Required (<strong>NSSRR</strong>).</p>

<p>Job seekers can participate in Disability Employment Services (DES) and NEIS concurrently, so these job seekers should still be connected to their DES provider. No referral action is necessary.</p>

<p>NEIS participants still receiving a partial rate of a Pensions System or Parenting System payment, i.e. AGE, PPS, PPP, DSP or CP will have their NEIS Allowance automatically zeroed from the correct date. This is triggered by an electronic advice received from the Department of Education, Skills and Employment system.</p>

<p>NEIS participants claiming a Pension, Parenting or JobSeeker System payment will need to have their NEIS Allowance <strong>manually zeroed by staff</strong> on the <strong>OGP</strong> screen. Otherwise, their claim will reject '<strong>CPP</strong>' (Customer on Precluding Payment).</p>

<p>The letter from the NEIS provider is the only evidence required for staff to manually zero off NEIS Allowance from the date NEIS Allowance ceased.

If necessary, e.g. job seeker has lost their letter, contact the NEIS provider to get confirmation of the NEIS Allowance cessation end date.</p>

<p><strong>Manual Rate on RCO screen</strong></p>

<p>If a JSP, YAL or SpB job seeker was receiving a partial rate of payment via a manual rate override during NEIS participation, staff must <strong>end the manual rate override</strong> from the date payment is being granted or reassessed.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> there are <strong>no special backdating provisions</strong> applying to job seekers claiming or requesting reassessments following NEIS Allowance cessation.</p>

<p>NEIS participants whose rate was reduced by NEIS Allowance, will have this automatically zeroed on the <strong>OGP</strong> screen at 39 weeks. Service Officers will not have to manually zero NEIS Allowance for these customers to restore payment back to full rate.</p>
