<P><STRONG>Job seeker is already connected to a provider (provider managed)</STRONG></P>
<P>Refer the job seeker to their Employment Services Provider for approval. If the full-time short course is approved by the provider, notification that the job seeker is undertaking a full-time short course will be sent to Services Australia automatically from the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations.</P>
<P>Services Australia will receive this short course information and automatically update the Activity and Exemption Summary (<STRONG>AEX</STRONG>) screen with the short course approved requirement code of 'SHD' (Short Course), start and end date. These details can be viewed on the <STRONG>Short Course Details</STRONG> screen. A link to this screen is accessible via the <STRONG>Participation Summary</STRONG> screen.</P>
<P>Services Australia should not be approving and coding a short course for provider managed job seekers in accordance with the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations Short Course Guidelines. The job seeker should be referred to their provider to discuss their participation and approval in any type of full-time or part-time study or training, including a short course. This is important because it may impact on the level of servicing the provider can offer. If the provider approves the short course, they will code the course details in the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations system. However, if the customer is enrolled in a course of study that would make them eligible for a student payment, then this should be discussed with the customer and where necessary a transfer to another more appropriate income support payment done.</P>
<P>However, the provider's decision of whether a job seeker can have their full-time study approved or not, does not determine their qualification for YA as a job seeker.</P>
<P>A job seeker can be determined to not qualify for YA due to their full-time study, <STRONG>only</STRONG> where:</P>
<UL>
<LI>they have been advised (either at grant or at a later time) by their provider that their full-time study will not fully meet their mutual obligation requirements, <STRONG>and</STRONG></LI>
<LI>the job seeker is <STRONG>not</STRONG> willing to satisfy other mutual obligation requirements such as job search</LI></UL>
<P>Otherwise, it is up to the provider to negotiate appropriate activities for the job seeker, and to instigate compliance action as necessary for failure to meet compulsory requirements.</P>

<P>In very limited circumstances, Services Australia can approve full-time short course study for YA job seekers prior to their commencement in employment services.</P>
<P>YA job seekers in employment services who wish to study in a full-time short course are to approach their employment services provider for approval.</P>
<P>Services Australia can only approve full-time study for YA job seekers who are still Centrelink managed and meet all of the conditions:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the course is a full-time vocational short course of less than 12 months, which would improve their short term employment prospects, or</LI>
<LI>if they have exceeded the allowable time for their course under YA (student), but still have less than 12 months of study remaining to complete their course</LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>Full-time study definition</STRONG></P>
<P>For a short course to be an approved requirement it must be full-time and less than 12 months.</P>
<P>For YA purposes, full-time study is defined as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>if the course is a course of study within the meaning of the Higher Education Support Act 2003 - the equivalent for the period of the full-time study-load for that period as determined by the institution in accordance with the Administration Guidelines under that Act, <STRONG>or</STRONG></LI>
<LI>if the course is not such a course and the institution defines an amount of full-time study that a full-time student should typically undertake in respect of the course in the period - the amount so defined, <STRONG>or</STRONG></LI>
<LI>if the institution does not define an amount of full-time study that a full-time student should typically undertake for the course - an amount equivalent to the average amount of full-time study a person would have to undertake to complete the course in the minimum time, <STRONG>or</STRONG></LI>
<LI>if none of the above situations apply, a minimum of 20 contact hours per week, which consists of at least 15 hours in the classroom or other directed activities and up to five hours per week on private study, or courses classified as full-time by the education or training institution</LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>Part-time study</STRONG></P>
<P>For principal carers or job seekers with a partial work capacity receiving YA (such as job seekers with 'part-time' mutual obligation requirements), short courses are under the same guidelines as other YA job seekers. However, the study does not have to be considered 'full-time'. These job seekers can fully meet their requirements through approved study of at least 15 hours per week, or 30 hours per fortnight.</P>
<P>For other job seekers, if the requirement is less than 20 hours per week, job seekers do not need Services Australia's approval, however the study will not count towards their mutual obligation requirements, and they must continue to look for and be willing and able to accept offers of suitable paid employment.</P>
<P>For Services Australia's approval of a short course, issue the 'Request for course approval (SS362) form to the job seeker for completion.</P>
<P>Upon return of the SS362, <A href="../job-seekers/001-09070220-03.html#bp03_tbl_Job_seeker_enqu01_Step04">go to Step 4</A>.</P></DIV>
