<p>The Advance Payments workflow will record a <strong>DOC</strong>. Advise the customer of any remaining balance owing, if applicable. If the customer wishes to make a new advance payment application, this can now be processed following normal procedures. See&#58;</p>

<p>Outstanding advance payment balances will need to be modified using the Advance Payment workflow.</p>

<p>On the Advance Payment Application page&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Select 'Yes' when the workflow asks 'Do you want to change outstanding balance?'</li>
		<li>
Select 'User Error' for the balance change reason. The balance of the advance can now be increased</li>
		<li>
Record the amount of the advance to be repaid. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> this will display as a negative amount. If the current balance is $250.00 and an amount of $-250.00 is entered, the advance balance will increase to $500.00</li>
		<li>
'What is the reason the outstanding balance is being modified?' is a free text field and any details entered here will be populated in a <strong>DOC</strong></li>
		<li>
Once the activity is finalised a <strong>DOC</strong> will automatically be created. The ESSentials receipt number remains the same as originally issued</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the wrong advance has been finalised, the balance transfer and restoration must be actioned in Process Direct as the Customer First workflow cannot restore an advance payment.</p>
