<p><strong>Deaths of both members of a couple advised at the same time</strong></p>

<p>Alfonso died on 9 July 2018.</p>

<p>Alfonso's partner, Elizabeth, died on 12 July 2018.</p>

<p>Advice was received of both deaths on 15 July 2018 and actioned on that day. The couple were receiving maximum rate pension.</p>

<p>Their last payments were made on 14 July 2018, so their EPED was 12 July 2018.</p>

<p>Neither Alfonso's nor Elizabeth's estate is entitled to Alfonso's payment for 14 July 2018.</p>

<p>Elizabeth's estate is entitled to Elizabeth's payment for 14 July 2018 (the first instalment after death). Their member of a couple rate (CMCR) is $658.70 for 14 July 2018.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the single rate is not paid in these circumstances even though the second customer is technically single.</p>

<p>Elizabeth is regarded as the surviving partner.</p>

<p>A LBP is manually calculated and paid to Elizabeth's estate for the entitlement which existed prior to death. The NR used in calculating the LBP is the rate that would have been paid as a surviving single pensioner on 14 July, even though the estate is paid a single bereavement payment for 14 July 2018 at the member of a couple rate for Elizabeth.</p>

<p><strong>Death of a member of an illness separated couple</strong></p>

<p>Joe and Thelma are partnered pensioners.</p>

<p>Joe lives in a nursing home due to ill health.</p>

<p>Thelma still lives in the family home.</p>

<p>Joe died 3 weeks ago.</p>

<p><strong>Example B</strong></p>

<p>Lucinda and Tom are a couple, but are separated due to illness because Lucinda now lives in a nursing home. Tom receives JobSeeker Payment (JSP) and Lucinda received Disability Support Pension (DSP) before Lucinda died a week ago.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> as Tom is the survivor and receives JSP, the illness-separated calculation does not apply.</p>

<p>Lucinda was receiving $873.90 immediately before their death.</p>

<p>Tom receives $604.70.</p>

<p>Lucinda was paid for 1 entitlement period end dates after their death. (NEPED = 1).</p>

<p>Their combined member of a couple rate is $1,478.60.</p>

<p><strong>Death of a care receiver who is single or whose partner is a pensioner for LBP purposes or a long-term Social Security recipient</strong></p>

<p>George has been caring for widowed parent Gladys until Gladys passed away yesterday.</p>

<p>George will continue to be paid Carer Payment during the bereavement period. George will also be paid the lesser of 7 times the actual last instalment received before Gladys died, or 7 times the partnered maximum basic pension rate.</p>

<p>The actual last instalment George received was $429.40.</p>

<p>7 x $429.40 = $3,005.80</p>

<p>During this period, partnered maximum basic pension rate is $599.10.</p>

<p><strong>Calculating the CMCR where 1 member received payment from DVA</strong></p>

<p>Only the following Department of Veteran Affairs (DVA) payments are used when calculating the CMCR&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Age Service Pension</li>
		<li>
Invalidity Service Pension</li>
		<li>
Partner Service Pension</li>
		<li>
Carer Service Pension</li>
		<li>
Veteran Payment</li>
		<li>
Income Support Supplement (ISS)</li>
		<li>
Social Security Age Pension (paid by DVA)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Other DVA payments such as DVA Disability Pension, Defence Force Income Support Allowance (DFISA) and War Widows Pension (WWP) are not included in the CMCR.</p>

<p>When it is the DVA customer who has died, to calculate the LBP the EPED and Entitlement Days refers to the DVA pay cycle.</p>

<p>DVA customers receive a daily rate paid on alternate Thursdays (that is, on the off pay week for the traditional pension payday). The date paid to on their payday is the Monday before that payday.</p>

<p>For example, on Thursday 23 May 2019 DVA customers would be paid up to and including Monday 20 May 2019.</p>

<p><strong>An example of calculating the LBP when a DVA customer dies and their partner is in receipt of a Centrelink payment</strong></p>

<p>Harry, a Department of Veteran Affairs (DVA) recipient dies on 12 July 2018.</p>

<p>The agency and DVA are notified on 13 July 2018.</p>

<p>Harry's partner Cheryl is in receipt of Age Pension from the agency.</p>

<p>Cheryl's rate on the payday before Harry's death was $500 per fortnight.</p>

<p>Harry's rate from DVA immediately before their death was $912.68 which comprised Age Service Pension from DVA of $600 plus General Rate Disability Pension of $312.68.</p>

<p>Only the Age component of the DVA payment is used when calculating the LBP payable to Cheryl. That is, $600.</p>

<p>Harry's last DVA pension payday was 5 July 2018 and on this day they were paid up to and including Monday 2 July 2018.</p>

<p>The end of the DVA entitlement period in which they died was 16 July 2018.</p>

<p>Cheryl's continuing rate is $750 per fortnight.</p>

<p>EPED = 2, as DVA were able to action the death notice on 13 July 2018 and on the DVA payday 19 July 2018 a payment was made up to and including the date before death for the period 12 - 16 July.</p>

<p>NDEP = 6. Number of entitlement days from and including the date of death until and including the end of the entitlement period, in this case 12 - 16 July.</p>

<p><strong>An example of calculating the LBP where the surviving partner's new single rate is nil</strong></p>

<p>Samuel died on 7 July 2018 and is survived by partner John.</p>

<p>John advised of Samuel's death on 12 July 2018.</p>

<p>Due to investment income of $1,000 per week the couple were receiving a reduced rate of pension.</p>

<p>Samuel's last payment was received on 11 July 2018.</p>

<p>The CMCR was $408.60 for 11 July 2018.</p>

<p>John's new single rate is nil and the Age Pension will be automatically cancelled due to John's income. However John is still entitled to an LBP.</p>

<p><strong>LBP</strong> = (<strong>CMCR</strong> - <strong>NR)</strong> x (7 - <strong>NEPED</strong>)</p>

<p> = (408.60 - 0.00) x (7 - 1)</p>

<p> = 408.60 x 6</p>

<p> = $2,451.60</p>

<p><strong>Example of taxation exemption calculation</strong></p>

<p>Age Pensioner couple receiving $393.00 each per fortnight with Energy Supplement of $10.50 and Pension Supplement of $47.40 (includes $29.90 non-taxable components) each per fortnight. No other add-ons received.</p>

<p>To calculate the tax exemption when 1 of the couple dies&#58;</p>

<p><strong>Calculate the LBP</strong></p>

<p>CMCR = $450.90 x 2 x 7 = $6312.60</p>

<p>New Single Rate = $470.70 + $13.90 + $62.90 = $547.50 x 7 = $3,832.50</p>

<p>LBP is $6312.60 - $3832.50 = $2480.10</p>

<p><strong>Calculate the Tax Free Amount (TFE)</strong></p>

<p>Survivor's non-taxable amount if partner had not died is ($10.50 + $29.00) x 7 = $282.80</p>

<p>Deceased partner's gross amount if they had not died is $450.90 x 7 = $3,156.30</p>

<p>TFE is $3,156.30 plus $282.80 = $3,439.10</p>

<p>As the LBP is less than the TFE, the entire LBP is tax free so no tax adjustment is needed.</p>
