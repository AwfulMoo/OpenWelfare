decided by the <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-21080954-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Commonwealth_Ch">Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer</a>, and </li>

not the same as ‘stay at home orders’ which are decided by state/territory governments </li>

<p>Customers claiming the COVID-19 Disaster Payment can claim under 1 of 3 impact reasons. </p>

<p><strong>Impact reason 1 </strong></p>

<p>Customers who <strong>live or work in a relevant area deemed a </strong>COVID-19 hotspot can apply under the following reason if they are <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-21080954-01.html#bp01_L2GT_Unable_to_work_">unable to work and earn their usual income</a>&#58; </p>

		</ul>
<p><strong>Impact reason 3 </strong></p>

<p>In Victoria, customers <strong>not</strong> living or working in a relevant area deemed COVID-19 hotspot can apply under the following third reason if they are <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-21080954-01.html#bp01_L2GT_Unable_to_work_">unable to work and earn their usual income</a>&#58;</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>To receive a payment, customers must be ‘unable to attend work and therefore unable to earn their usual income due to a state public health order for restricted movement’.</p>

<p>This means the customer cannot earn their usual amount of income from any employer (existing or new).</p>

<p>That is, if a customer has lost income from an employer, but is able to regain the same lost income from a new employer, they</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>can</strong> attend work and earn their usual income, <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
<strong>are not</strong> eligible to receive a payment</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Reasons a person may be unable to attend work and earn their usual income</strong></p>

<p>A person may be unable to attend work and earn their usual income for a number of reasons related to the restricted movement conditions. This includes where customers&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
are not permitted or unable to work from home, </li>
		<li>
cannot attend work due to caring responsibilities, </li>
		<li>
are not vaccinated against COVID-19, </li>
		<li>
have an exemption from wearing a mask however cannot work due to a state public health order mandating mask wearing (this must be due to a state public health order and not due to a condition an employer has placed on a person’s employment)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Unable to attend work and therefore unable to earn their usual income means the customer, in the relevant period, must have lost <strong>at least</strong>&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
8 hours of work, <strong>or</strong></li>
		<li>
1 full day of work</li>
		</ul>
<p>A full day of work <strong>does not</strong> need to be at least 8 hours.</p>

<p>For <strong>example</strong>&#58; a customer normally works a 3 hour shift during the relevant period and cannot attend that shift because of the restricted movement. The customer meets the ‘unable to attend work and therefore unable to earn their usual income’ criteria as they have lost 1 full day of work in the relevant period.</p>

<p>If a customer does not lose 1 full day of work, they must lose at least 8 hours of work in the relevant period.</p>

<p>For <strong>example</strong>&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
A customer normally works 1 x 10 hour shift during the relevant period. They work 5 hours of that shift. The customer <strong>does not </strong>meet the ‘unable to attend work and therefore unable to earn their usual income’ criteria as they have not lost at least 8 hours of work or 1 full day of work in the relevant period</li>
		<li>
A customer normally works 2 x 10 hours shifts during the relevant period. They work 5 hours each day of those 2 shifts. The customer <strong>does</strong> meet the ‘unable to attend work and therefore unable to earn their usual income’ criteria as they have lost 10 hours of work in the relevant period</li>
		</ul>
<p>The <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-21080954-01.html#bp01_L2GT_Payment_rates">payment rate</a> the customer receives is based on hours of work <strong>lost</strong> during the relevant period, <strong>not</strong> hours the customer would have worked if the restricted movement did not occur.</p>
