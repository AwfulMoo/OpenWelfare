<p>This page contains scenarios of the Residential Costs Option (RCO). These examples show how the RCO may or may not be advantageous to the student. It also contains examples to assist when determining whether RCO is payable to someone who has already received a Relocation Scholarship for the same period.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>Rent Assistance is only calculated for the time a student is paying residential costs. Therefore, when considering whether the RCO is more beneficial this needs to be taken into account when calculating the entitlements. Generally a student will only pay residential costs for the period of study and not during the vacation periods. Therefore, whilst a student can be paid the away from home rate during the vacation period, they do not continue to receive rent assistance during that period.</p>

<p>Bowie is 18 years old and approved to live away from home. Bowie is in first year of university study. Bowie’s base rate of ABSTUDY Living Allowance is $462.50 per fortnight.

<p>In the first year of study it is more beneficial if Bowie does not claim the RCO.</p>

<p>However, in the <strong>second and subsequent years of study</strong>, the RCO may be more beneficial depending on whether Bowie qualifies for the regional rate of Relocation Scholarship. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> the rate of an Indigenous CAS does not decrease after the first year and is usually more beneficial than the RS.</p>

<p>Using the above figures (<strong>note&#58;</strong> these will change with CPI and other increases) if Bowie is qualified for the regional rate of Relocation Scholarship in the second year of study, the total for No RCO would be $19,135.00. If Bowie is not qualified for the regional rate of Relocation Scholarship, the total for No RCO would be $17,048.80. Let's assume Bowie does not qualify for the regional rate of Relocation Scholarship. As both of the No RCO totals are less than what Bowie would receive under the RCO option, it would be more beneficial if Bowie accepted the RCO in the second and subsequent years of study.</p>

<p><strong>Change of Residential College prior to end of contract</strong></p>

<p>Amy lives in a residential college whilst studying a Bachelor of Engineering at the Australian National University. At the end of Amy’s 3rd year of study, Amy has chosen to complete her studies at another campus closer to home. The charges at the new residential provider overlaps the current one by 4 weeks. The residential college charges a contract break fee of $750 and the remainder of the 4 weeks residential charges of $2300. Amy is unable to pay the whole amount and requests ABSTUDY assistance.

Additional Assistance can be approved as Amy and her family would be placed in significant financial hardship and risk of withdrawing from studies to cover these costs.</p>
