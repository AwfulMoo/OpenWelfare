<p>Generally, the NEF will occur automatically when processing the claim. However, manual coding can be completed in certain circumstances. For example, when information is not provided, it could be appropriate to manually <strong>NEF</strong> the claim <strong>INF </strong>(information not provided).</p>

<p>To manually <strong>NEF</strong> a DAP claim&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>

Finalise the activity on the <strong>ELD</strong> screen</li>

Record details on the Finalisation<strong> Note</strong></li>
		</ul>
<p>Apply the most appropriate NEF code to ensure the correct letter is sent to the customer. In very limited circumstances where the manual reason code is <strong>OTH</strong>, an auto advice will not be sent to the customer. A manual Q999 letter must be issued via Customer First advising their claim is NEF, and the reason.
