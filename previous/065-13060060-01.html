<p>Aged care nominee information is recorded in ACMPS.</p>

<p>A nominee has an individual record in ACMPS that is linked to the care recipient's record</p>

<p>Recording the aged care nominee in both systems assists Service Officers to give information to the aged care nominee. For example, the aged care nominee requests information about the care recipient's home care package but the care recipient is now in residential care.</p>

<p>An aged care nominee <strong>Fast Note</strong> in Customer First assists non-aged care skill tagged Service Officers with enquiries from aged care nominees.</p>

<p>New aged care nominee requests for DVA care recipients or grandfathered aged care nominees replace any existing nominee arrangements, except where the existing nominee is an involuntary arrangement appointed through a tribunal or court, for example, a State Trustee.</p>

<p><strong>Ending a nominee arrangement</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
When a <strong>Centrelink nominee arrangement is ended</strong> for a current aged care customer (RCA/CUR) in Customer First, a message is sent to ACMPS to automatically end the nominee arrangement immediately</li>
		<li>
When an <strong>aged care benefit status is cancelled</strong> (RCA/CAN) in Customer First, a message is sent to ACMPS to automatically end the nominee arrangement&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
40 days after discharge, ensuring the nominee receives the discharge review letters</li>
