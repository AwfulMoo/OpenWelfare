	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care (the Commission), in collaboration with the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP), developed the NGPA Scheme, which commenced on 1 January 2017.</p>

<p>Under the NGPA Scheme, general practices accessing the PIP and/or the WIP – Practice Stream must be assessed by an approved accrediting agency. The approved agencies are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Australian General Practice Accreditation Ltd (AGPAL)</li>
		<li>
Quality Practice Accreditation Pty Ltd (QPA) – formerly General Practice Accreditation Plus (GPA)</li>
		<li>
The Australian Council on Healthcare Standards (ACHS)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Advisories for the NGPA Scheme</strong></p>

<p>An advisory is a formal communication from the Commission to accrediting agencies to provide guidance and direction on the interpretation and/or assessment of the RACGP Standards for general practices. Advisories are periodically reviewed to ensure they remain current. </p>

<p>More information is available on the <a href="../health-professionals/012-10010010-05.html#bp05_L2GT_External_Websit">Commission’s website</a>.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Practices participating in the PIP and/or WIP – Practice Stream must be <strong>accredited or registered for accreditation </strong>to be eligible.</p>

<p><strong>Registered for accreditation</strong> – a practice is registered for accreditation with an accrediting agency and working to meet the requirements of the RACGP Standards for general practices. The practice must achieve accreditation within 12 months since approved to participate in PIP/WIP– Practice Stream to remain eligible for payments.</p>

<p><strong>Accredited</strong> - independent recognition that a practice meets the requirements of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) Standards for general practices.</p>

<p>Accreditation must&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
meet the RACGP Standards for general practices</li>
		<li>
be provided by an approved accrediting agency approved under the <a href="../health-professionals/012-10010010-05.html#bp05_L2GT_External_Websit">National General Practice Accreditation Scheme</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>Once accreditation is achieved, practices must maintain accreditation to be eligible to participate in the PIP and/or the WIP – Practice Stream.</p>

<p>Other types of practice accreditation, such as Medical Deputising Services (MDS) and After Hours Medical Services, are not eligible.</p>

<p>Practices must be accredited for the entire payment quarter to get payments. This includes the point-in-time date. The point-in-time date is the last day of the month before the quarterly payment.</p>

<p><strong>For example&#58;</strong></p>

<p>A practice was approved for the PIP on 29 January 2019. The practice must achieve accreditation within 12 months (29 January 2020) but they did not achieve accreditation until 10 February 2020.</p>

<p>The practice is <strong>not eligible</strong> for the February 2020 or May 2020 quarterly payments. </p>

<p>This is because the&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
reference period for the February 2019 payment quarter is <strong>1 November 2018 to 31 January 2019</strong>. The practice was not accredited during this period </li>
		<li>
reference period for the May 2019 payment quarter is <strong>1 February 2019 to 30 April 2019</strong>. Although the practice achieved accreditation on 10 February 2019, it was not accredited for the entire payment quarter</li>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the accreditation standard for PIP and WIP – Practice Stream <strong>must</strong> be for <strong>general practice</strong>.</p>

<p>Practices do not need to provide evidence of ongoing accreditation unless the agency requests it. </p>

<p>Accreditation data from accrediting agencies will automatically upload into the PIP and the WIP – Practice Stream systems on a monthly basis. This upload does not include registered for accreditation data. The registered for accreditation data is only entered when the practice applies for the program(s).</p>

<p>Practices cannot update their accreditation through <a href="../self-service/133-02050000-01.html">Health Professional Online Services (HPOS)</a>.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
Advise the practice to send an email outlining the reason for the request, providing any supporting documentation </li>

Supporting documentation could include information from their accrediting agency (for example, an email confirming a cancelled assessment)</li>

		<li>
Add a comment to the practice profile</li>

<p>Extensions to registration details that are not recorded by Program Management should be removed and escalated to the PSO via PaNDA for further assessment.</p>

<p>Program Management will&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
co-ordinate the approval process with Department of Health and Aged Care </li>
		<li>
if approved, arrange for any held payments to be released </li>
		<li>
record approved extension to registration dates and add comments to the practice profile.</li>
		</ul>
<p>Eligible practices were granted a 12 month extension to their accreditation in response to the 2020 pandemic. Quality Practice Accreditation (QPA) certificates issued or reissued for relocations will not reflect this extended expiry date.</p>

<p>QPA sends the practice a letter confirming the extended accreditation. The letter&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
is addressed to the practice</li>
		<li>
includes the practice name as a reference, and</li>
		<li>
shows the new expiry date 12 months from the certificate date</li>
		</ul>
<p>Enter the accreditation expiry date from the letter into the relevant system.</p>

<p>If the end date is unclear, escalate to a Programme Support Officer (PSO). Program Management will&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
check the accreditation data received, or</li>
		<li>
make contact with QPA, if needed</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Accredited</strong></p>

<p>Practices can only get extensions to their accreditation in extenuating circumstances. The <a href="../health-professionals/012-10010010-05.html#bp05_L2GT_External_Websit">Resources</a> page has a link to the Commission’s webpage. This contains information about the NGPA Scheme and the latest advisory for extensions to accreditation.</p>

<p>Practices seeking extensions must contact their accrediting agency and provide evidence of their extenuating circumstances for assessment. Accrediting agencies must refer all requests for extensions to the Commission. The agency does not have the authority to grant extensions.</p>

<p>Practices that have not allowed sufficient time to finalise administration of accreditation decisions will not be given an extension to their accreditation. Accrediting agencies cannot backdate or change the date of commencement for the new cycle to maintain continuous accreditation.</p>

<p>If practices are granted an extension to their accreditation, their new accreditation details will be uploaded in the monthly data exchange.</p>

<p>A practice provides a certificate with a start date of 2 November 2021 and the old certificate had an end date of 1 November 2021. This is continuous accreditation. </p>

<p>If gaps in accreditation (where accreditation is not continuous) are identified, escalate to the PSO via PaNDA for further investigation.</p>

<p>Program Management will place the practice payments on hold and contact the practice about their eligibility. Program Management will ask Incentive Programs Delivery to initiate payment recovery if required. Related correspondence and comments will be added to the practice profile.</p>

<p>Practices can apply for an exemption through their accrediting agency as soon as they become aware that there may be a gap in accreditation. Supporting evidence must be provided with their application. Exemptions cannot be backdated. See the <a href="../health-professionals/012-10010010-05.html#bp05_L3TT_Frequently_Aske">Resources</a> page for frequently asked questions about accreditation.</p>

<p>Practices are not eligible for payments if their accreditation status changes from accredited to registered for accreditation. The Service Officer must place the practice payments on hold and the <a target="_blank" href="../health-professionals/012-10010090-01.html#bp01_L2GT_3_quarter_rule">three quarter rule</a> will apply.</p>

<p>For example, this may occur if the practice relocates or changes accrediting agencies.</p>

<p>If a practice then achieves accreditation and remains approved in PIP and/or WIP - Practice Stream&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the practice is not eligible for quarterly payments where they were not accredited for the entire quarter</li>
		<li>
payments will recommence from the next payment quarter where the practice is accredited for the entire quarter</li>
		</ul>
<p>Escalate changes to a practice’s accreditation status to the PSO via PaNDA for further investigation. Program Management will advise Service Officers what the next steps are, such as contact with the practice or recovery of payments.</p>
