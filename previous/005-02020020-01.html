<p>This document explains when customers may be exempt from the Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Period (NARWP) or the qualifying residence period when claiming a payment or concession card. It gives general information about types of exemptions which may be available and how to request manual exemption coding to be completed by Centrelink International Services (CIS) where required.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>New Australian residents who have been granted permanent residence are generally subject to a <a href="../migrants-refugees-and-visitors/005-02020000-01.html">NARWP or a period of qualifying residence</a> before they can access most products and services delivered by Services Australia. The waiting period which applies depends on the payment or concession claimed.</p>

<p>A Qualifying Residence Exemption (QRE) is a provision that exempts a person from having to meet the accumulated qualifying residence period or having to serve a NARWP for certain payments.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> a QRE does not exempt a person from any requirement to be residing in Australia and be an Australian resident for lodgement or ongoing residential qualification.</p>

<p>The rules governing the exemptions applicable to each payment or concession card are complex and vary from payment to payment or card.</p>

<p>To assess whether a customer may qualify for any of the exemptions, use the residence assessment procedure for the relevant payment. See Related links for these procedures.</p>

<p>For more information see <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-06010000-01.html">Australian residence requirements for payment</a>.</p>

<h2 id="_Toc344898764">General exemptions</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A customer is exempt from the NARWP if <strong>any</strong> of the following apply&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they are an Australian citizen</li>
		<li>
they are the holder or former holder of a permanent refugee/humanitarian visa</li>
		<li>
they were a family member of a refugee/humanitarian entrant at the time that person arrived in Australia; and they are the family member of that person when the claim is made, or when that person died (if they have since died)</li>
		<li>
they are the holder of a visa subclass 852 - this applies for all social security benefits except Special Benefit (SpB)</li>
		<li>
they have been issued with a Resolution of Status Visa CD 851 granted on or after 9 August 2008</li>
		<li>
they hold the 2017 NARWP Grandfathering exemption</li>

<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Family member of a refugee or former refugee</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>When a newly arrived resident applies for Services Australia support, particular care must be exercised in establishing whether they have now, or had previously, a family member who arrived in Australia as a refugee.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> claim forms and online claims specifically ask this question.</p>

<p>It may not be immediately apparent that a person was a family member of a refugee or humanitarian entrant at the time the refugee or humanitarian entrant arrived in Australia. It may be that the other person has since died.</p>

<p>The important consideration is that there was a family relationship at the time the refugee or humanitarian entrant arrived in Australia.</p>

<p>Refugee status does not have to be granted at the time of their arrival in Australia. Many refugees arrive on temporary visas or as illegal entrants and are subsequently granted a refugee visa at a later time. For social security purposes, if the refugee visa has been granted, they are considered to have had refugee status on their initial arrival.</p>

<p>Any family relationship which commenced after the refugee or former refugee arrived in Australia (partner or dependent child entering their care) does not meet eligibility for this exemption provision.</p>

<p>To meet this exemption, the customer must have been the family member of the refugee or humanitarian migrant at the time the refugee or humanitarian migrant arrived in Australia; and a family member at one of the following times&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>For Family Tax Benefit (FTB)</strong> - on the earliest date they may be entitled to receive payment (generally this would be the date customer was both physically present and residing in Australia whilst the holder of a qualifying visa), or</li>
		<li>
<strong>For Paid Parent Leave (PPL)</strong> - on the child's date of birth or entry into care, or</li>
		<li>
<strong>For Dad and Partner Pay (DAP)</strong> - on the DAP period start date, or</li>
		<li>
<strong>For Youth Allowance (YA) (student) and Austudy -</strong> from date of claim, or date the customer became a family member of the refugee (if up to 13 weeks after claim date)</li>
		<li>
<strong>For all other payments</strong>, on the date of claim</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Exception&#58;</strong> if the refugee or humanitarian migrant has died since arrival in Australia, the customer must have been a family member of that person when the person arrived and when the person died.</p>

<p>A family member in relation of a person for the purpose of the NARWP exemption includes the following categories of people in accordance with section 7(6D) of the Social Security Act 1991&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a partner of the person</li>
		<li>
a dependent child of the person</li>
		<li>
another person who, in the opinion of the Secretary, can be treated like a partner or dependent child of the person</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the refugee has become an Australian citizen, the person is no longer considered a refugee but a former refugee. The customer can still be covered by this exemption provision.</p>

<p>A person may have been granted this exemption in the past, which they are not entitled to for a subsequent claim. For example, someone who was assessed as a dependent child of a refugee previously, but is no longer a dependent child for most recent claim. In this instance, exemption coding must be ended before assessing the claim.</p>
