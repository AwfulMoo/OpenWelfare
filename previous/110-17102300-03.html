<p>Self service reports can be unsuccessful for various reasons. On sign up for self service reporting, Service Officers should attempt to limit the amount of unsuccessful reports by checking the following on the customer's record&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Discuss with the customer at initial registration contact, the types of questions asked based on the items outlined in the Job Plan and requirements listed on the Activity and Exemption (<strong>AEX</strong>) screen. The customer needs to be aware of their mutual obligation or participation requirements to make sure they understand the questions they may be asked</li>
		<li>
Encourage customers with an <a href="../self-service/133-19061400-03.html">active phone account</a> to register for SMS messaging. This makes sure customers have the correct access to report a change of circumstances</li>
		<li>
Encourage customers to register for Online Letters (OLL). This enables customers to get their mail within 2 days and have quick access to their reporting dates</li>
		<li>
Check customer's Partner Permitted to Enquire (PPE) status. To make sure maximum benefit from self service, reporting customers should be encouraged to have PPE set to 'yes' if they are partnered</li>
		<li>
Use minimal abbreviations when coding an employer's trading name. When coding employment income for customers, make sure minimal abbreviations are used in employer's trading name etc. Make sure the employer's Australian Business Number (ABN) or Withholding Payer Number (WPN) is correct</li>
		<li>
Do not use 'dummy' held stimulus activities. The use of these activities prevents customers from completing their report via self service and creates additional 'drop through' work. These activities also stop transactions from other government departments coming across to the customer's record</li>
		<li>
Check interpreter coding to make sure details are still current. Remove unnecessary interpreter coding if appropriate</li>
		<li>
Make sure self-employment details are coded correctly. Use the Self Employment/Contract script for all updates to ensure appropriate reviews are created. Cease businesses where applicable instead of coding zero for income or percentage owned</li>
		<li>
Make sure apprentice employers have a 'Y' in the <strong>Apprentice Employer</strong> field on the Employment Income Summary (<strong>EANS</strong>) screen. This ensures the employment income coded is recognised correctly and does not 'drop through'</li>
		<li>
Make sure part-time work (PTW) is coded on the Activity and Exemption Summary (<strong>AEX</strong>) screen where appropriate. If PTW is not coded on <strong>AEX</strong>, for customers meeting their participation requirements through part-time work, self service will ask the customer the question about job search. If the customer answers 'No' to meeting job search requirements as they are participating in an activity, a handoff/'drop through' will occur</li>		</ul>
