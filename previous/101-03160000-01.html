<p>ParentsNext is a pre-employment program for Parenting Payment (PP) (single and partnered) customers with children under 6 years of age, which may include grandparents or foster parents receiving PP. The program focuses on offering individual support and referrals to services that can help customers to plan and prepare for work or connect to the workforce when their youngest child turns 6.</p>

<p>ParentsNext participants do not need to look for or take up work. The aim is to encourage customers to think about their future work and study related goals and to support them in achieving these goals by connecting them with appropriate services in their local community. The program offers individualised support that can include help to access secure housing, financial advice, parenting courses, childcare, transport, further study, training or volunteering.</p>

<p>Customers selected for ParentsNext need to attend an initial appointment with Services Australia. They will be referred to a ParentsNext provider if they are eligible.</p>

<p>Compulsory participants must&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
attend an appointment with their ParentsNext provider at least every 3 months</li>
		<li>
develop and sign a Participation Plan and</li>
		<li>
participate in compulsory activities</li>
		</ul>
<p>Customers selected as a compulsory ParentsNext participant will be placed on 2 weekly (fortnightly) reporting initially, but may subsequently change to 12 weekly reporting if they are granted a long term exemption. See <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-18101001-01.html">ParentsNext exits and exemptions</a>.</p>

<p>There are three selection reasons for ParentsNext and eligibility is automatically determined by the system based on the information on the customer's record at the time of the eligibility assessment. A customer's reason for selection into ParentsNext will show on the ParentsNext Summary page within Customer First.</p>

<p>For further information, see <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-18101001-01.html">ParentsNext eligibility and servicing</a>.</p>

<p>Parenting Payment customers who are assessed as eligible for ParentsNext need to attend an appointment with Services Australia. If the customer has a phone contact number recorded, the appointment will be undertaken by phone. If there is no contact phone number on the customer's record, the appointment is undertaken at the customer's local service centre.</p>

<p>If the system identifies a customer is eligible for ParentsNext, a 10 minute appointment will be automatically booked where profiles are available. If the system is unable to automatically book the appointment, a Manual Follow-up (MFU) activity will be created to alert a Service Officer that a ParentsNext appointment must be manually booked.</p>

The message will remind the customer&#58;</p>

of their ParentsNext phone appointment</li>
		<li>
the call will come from a blocked number, and</li>

they need to answer this call</li>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> messages will only be released between 9am and 5pm. Messages sent before 9am will only issue to the customer after 9am the same day. Messages sent after 5pm will only issue after 9am the following day.</p>

<p>ParentsNext eligibility is based on information on the customer's record at the time of the eligibility assessment. For example, the age of the youngest PP child, whether the customer is currently studying or whether the customer has completed Year 12 or an equivalent qualification or higher. Incorrect or out of date information may affect this assessment. The customer may be selected as eligible, but if the information was up to date they would not have been selected, or they would have been selected for a different reason.</p>

<p>In these cases, update the customer's record with the correct information to trigger an eligibility reassessment.</p>

<p>ParentsNext providers will&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
conduct an initial appointment with the customer to develop and complete a Participation Plan</li>
		<li>
inform the customer about locally available services and undertake a referral if appropriate</li>
		<li>
conduct appointments with the customer at least every 3 months</li>

refer the customer to other service providers as outlined in their Participation Plan</li>

		<li>
assess customers' eligibility for an exemption from participation, and</li>
		<li>
notify the agency of non-compliance via the Targeted Compliance Framework</li>
		</ul>
<p>ParentsNext provider appointments <strong>must</strong> be booked within 1 to 5 business days after the customer's next Entitlement Period End Date (EPED).</p>

<p>For example, if conducting a ParentsNext appointment on 9 May and the customer's payment schedule is as follows&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
4 May to 17 May</li>
		<li>
18 May to 31 May</li>
		<li>
1 June to 14 June</li>
		</ul>
<p>The Service Officer must attempt to book the appointment within 1 to 5 business days from 17 May. If this cannot happen, the Service Officer should look at the next EPED. This would be within 1 to 5 business days of 31 May. Appointments must not be booked any later than 1 to 5 business days of the second EPED.</p>

<p>If an interpreter is needed for the provider appointment this should be detailed in the notes field and the appointment must be booked no earlier than 7 days in the future.</p>

<p>If referral options are limited, continue to refer customers to an available provider if they raise concerns about&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
their provider's location</li>
		<li>
attending an appointment in person</li>

<p>As ParentsNext participants are provider managed, ParentsNext Participation Plans are developed and updated by ParentsNext providers only. Service Officers are only able to view ParentsNext Participation Plans. They cannot negotiate or update them. If a customer wishes to update their Participation Plan, refer them to their ParentsNext provider.</p>

<p>Activities for ParentsNext participants depend on their individual goals and circumstances. The activities are intended to support customers to prepare for work in the future, or increase their capacity for work. Activities may include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
locally available parenting services</li>
		<li>
referrals to non-vocational support services such as health care or counselling services</li>
		<li>
work or study</li>
		<li>
referral to employment services, for example, Workforce Australia</li>

<p>Customers will be given tailored support to develop and sign a Participation Plan with their provider. The Participation Plan will have at least one compulsory activity.</p>
