For customers and/or their partners who are working, employment income details will need to be <a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-18120553-01.html">reported every 2 weeks</a></li>
		<li>
If a customer contacts to advise they have started employment and it is <strong>not their reporting day</strong>, employment details must be recorded on a <strong>DOC</strong>. Tell the customer to report hours worked and employment income paid within their reporting period on their reporting day and explain how to do this. If the customer is a variable reporter, ensure the customer's reporting frequency is changed to 2 weekly and tell the customer their next reporting date</li>

<p>Customers should keep their own record of the hours worked and employment income paid so their payment is not delayed while waiting for this information from the employer. Customers can use the Earnings Worksheet (SU505) to keep track of any pay events and hours worked they need to report on their next reporting due date.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> family assistance and income support reporting obligations are different. Income support customers must report actual income paid, not just an estimate. Service Officers must discuss income reporting requirements at every opportunity and ensure actual income and income estimates are both updated when required. If either member of a couple is receiving family assistance, their estimate <strong>must</strong> include income support payments received, Paid Parental Leave, employment income and any other components of Adjusted Taxable Income (received or expected) for the financial year for both members of the couple.</p>

<p>Most customers receiving JSP or YA (job seeker), no longer qualify for payment if they start <a href="../job-seekers/001-03010010-01.html">full-time ongoing work</a>. These job seekers will be able to <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07020000-01.html">deplete their Working Credits</a> before their payment is cancelled. The customer will not be entitled to an <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010160-01.html">employment income nil rate period</a>.</p>

<p>However, certain job seekers receiving JSP or YA (job seeker) who meet sufficient work requirements, where their income is not above the allowance income test cut off limit for the relevant payment, may continue on payment.</p>

<p>The most common examples of full-time workers who might still qualify for JSP without further mutual obligation requirements are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a JSP customer with a pensioner partner&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the income test for these couples results in a cut-out point for JSP which is considerably higher than applies to individuals in couples where both receive a social security benefit such as JSP</li>		</ul>
		<li>
long-term single JSP customers aged 60 or more who receive Rent Assistance (RA)&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the cut-out point for these customers can also exceed full-time minimum wages</li>		</ul>
		<li>
JSP single principal carers in full-time work&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the income test for these customers means they are entitled to part rate of JSP after Working Credits are depleted</li>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> job seekers aged 55 years or over must remain connected with a Workforce Australia provider and must attend any notified appointments.</p>

<p>A person who has reached 60+ years meets their mutual obligation requirements if they satisfy one of the following&#58;</p>
