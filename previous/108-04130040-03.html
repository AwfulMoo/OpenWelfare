<p>If the customer and/or their partner advise they have sold their real estate asset, the disposal or reinvestment of the proceeds can result in changes to the customer's income and assets.</p>

<p>It is important to establish whether there has been any change to the customer's circumstances that may have an impact on their Centrelink entitlement. <strong>However</strong>, it is not appropriate to send a letter to ask the customer how they have disposed of the proceeds. This constitutes an invasion of privacy, because not all of the information would be relevant to Centrelink.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Send an Income and Assets Update (SA220) to the customer to determine their current entitlement. If the Activity Registration (<strong>AYR</strong>) screen is used to issue the SA220, this will set up a review for its return. For help, see <a href="../bereavement/099-11000000-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Manually_issuin">Bereavement reviews</a> (Table 3)</li>
		<li>
Record details on a <strong>DOC</strong></li>
		</ul>
<p>When SA220 is <strong>returned</strong>, see <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-04130040-03.html#bp03_tbl_Improvements_to_3">Step 3 of the Improvements to real estate table</a>.</p>

<p>Where the customer and/or their partner advises of an improvement for example, vacant land is now a holiday home or a change in real estate value when contacted, the Service Officer will update the relevant details.</p>

<p>If the 'type' of real estate has changed e.g. vacant land to house, update the original entry, for example vacant land, with the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Sold/Gifted/Ceased&#58;</strong> field with '<strong>NAA</strong>' no assessable asset value</li>
		<li>
On the Real Estate (<strong>RE</strong>) screen, code the <strong>% Asset Owned&#58;</strong> field as '<strong>0</strong>'. Do not update the value of the property</li>
		<li>
If the customer was receiving income from the property, code the income as zero on the following fields&#58;</li>
		<li>
<strong>Gross Annual Income $&#58;</strong></li>
		<li>
<strong>Allowable Income Dedns $ pa&#58;</strong></li>
		</ul>
<p>Once the vacant land is zeroed out the new 'type' of real estate needs to be recorded using the Real Estate Update script. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07100130-01.html">Assessing and coding the real estate details Mod R</a> for coding instructions.</p>

<p>As the value of the property may have changed significantly due to the improvements a valuation may be required. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-04130010-01.html">Assessment and sale of real estate and timeshare asset</a>.</p>

<p>An urban address identifies, labels or locates real estate such as houses (including rural home sites on less than two hectares), flats, units schools, parks, businesses, reserves, caravan parks, addresses accessed by water, public amenities in urban areas, shopping centres.</p>

<p>Urban areas are traditionally subdivided into lots. Sites within urban areas are usually identified by a site address which has address numbers allocated according to the typical subdivision lot size for that area. Numbers are allocated for anticipated future lots. Lots are combined for large areas hence ranged addresses numbers. A suffix (e.g. A, B) on the address number usually indicates insufficient numbers were available for newly subdivided land, where expected number has been allocated.</p>

<p>While most councils in Australia have adopted national address standards, there is no requirement for councils to renumber existing urban properties and some legacy addresses will present a problem. In addition, for new subdivisions or in other instances where road numbers have not yet been allocated, allowances must be made to record a lot number instead of an address number. For real estate assets, this lot number may be both a lot and plan number/s.</p>

<p>A rural address will most likely be used for real estate which is used for, or intended to be used for primary production purposes. A rural address may also be used for bush blocks.</p>

<p>Rural areas currently use a mixture of property names, lot numbers and delivery points (e.g. Roadside Mail Bag (RMB), Rural Delivery (RD) numbers) as addresses. There is often either a need for local knowledge to locate the property or else the address is for a mail delivery point which may not be on or near the property. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> postal delivery services must <strong>never</strong> be recorded in the address field for a real estate asset e.g. RMB or RD.</p>

<p>In recent years, local, state and federal government authorities have been cooperating to address all rural properties with a unique number determined by the distance of that property's (main) egress from the logical starting point (datum point) of the road, with odd numbers to the left, even to right. Not all states have completed this unique numbering. Customers who own rural properties which have been allocated an address under the Rural Addressing project would have been notified of their new address by their local council or shire authority. The 'new' address would also be included in the rates notices.</p>

<p>This address should be used in preference to all legacy addresses. However, as rural addressing is not yet complete in all states, some allowance has to be made for legacy addresses by allowing for recording of lot numbers for instances where numbers have not yet been allocated. The address field must also allow for lot and plan numbers.</p>

<p>The rural address for a site located in Australia <strong>must</strong> be&#58;</p>

<p>The most common complex sites are industrial parks, caravan parks, shopping centres, universities, major hospitals and larger retirement villages.</p>
