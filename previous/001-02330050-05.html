<p>Karen is 20 years old and has applied for Youth Allowance (YA) as a job seeker after recently becoming unemployed. The reason that Karen has become unemployed is because the law firm where Karen was working as a legal secretary has closed down. As part of the Looking for Work workflow the JSCI has been completed and Karen's response to one of the questions has triggered that an ESAt referral is required.</p>

<p>At the new claim finalisation interview, the Service Officer who is assisting Karen sees the need for an ESAt has been flagged. The Service Officer checks all the responses to the JSCI to see what has triggered the ESAt flag and notices Karen has answered No to the question&#58;</p>

<p>At least one of my parents or legal guardians was regularly in paid employment when I was in my early teens' and this is the only response that would have triggered the ESAt flag.</p>

<p>During the course of the appointment the Service Officer has already learned that Karen had completed Year 12 and had a Certificate III level qualification in legal studies, which was how Karen was able to get work as a legal secretary. Karen had been in full time employment since completing the qualification and had already organised 2 job interviews in the coming week and is confident of getting employment within a short time period.</p>

<p>In this case, the Service Officer has decided that the ESAt referral is not required as it is apparent that Karen does not have significant barriers to employment. The Service Officer withdraws the ESAt flag and then documents on Karen's record the reasons for the decision. The Service Officer then refers Karen to jobactive.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1&#58;</strong></p>

<p>Andrew is 45 years old and is applying for JobSeeker Payment (JSP). Andrew was last on a payment just over 12 months ago. When answering the JSCI questions, as part of the Looking for Work workflow, Andrew advises of&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
only attending school to less than year 10</li>
		<li>
not being able to read or write English well, and</li>
		<li>
having served a custodial sentence</li>
		</ul>
<p>These answers flag the need for an ESAt referral on Andrew's record.</p>

<p>The Service Officer assessing the new claim application checks Andrew's record and sees an ESAt has been conducted in the past 18 months. The Service Officer opens the ESAt report to look at the issues that were covered in this report. All the issues identified in Andrew's most recent JSCI were assessed in the ESAt report. The Service Officer makes a decision the ESAt is current and valid and a new ESAt referral is not warranted in this instance.</p>

<p>As there has been no change since the ESAt was conducted the Service Officer copies the existing ESAt report onto Andrew's record so the JSCI is finalised. The Service Officer documents Andrew's record with this action and then refers Andrew to a jobactive organisation.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2&#58;</strong></p>

<p>Tom has recently stopped working and has been granted JobSeeker Payment (JSP). While receiving JSP less than 12 months ago, an ESAt/ JCA was triggered by Tom's earlier time in prison. Tom has not been to prison again since the assessment and nothing has changed in any other circumstances to trigger an ESAt. Tom is already referred to jobactive Stream C. A new ESAt/JCA is not required. The previous assessment is current and remains valid.</p>

<p>Brendan is applying for JobSeeker Payment (JSP). When the JSCI is conducted as part of the Looking for Work workflow, Brendan advises of having a back condition that will impact on the ability to work for more than 3 months. This raises an ESAt flag on Brendan's record.</p>

<p>When assessing Brendan's new claim the Service Officer notes that an ESAt flag is present on Brendan's record. The Service Officer has a discussion with Brendan about the impacts of the back condition on his ability to work. Brendan advises that the condition is episodic. Brendan completed a Disability Employment Service (DES) program the last time he was on a payment and now manages the condition more effectively and is aware of the type of work that can be safely undertaken.</p>

<p>The Service Officer checks the current ESAt report to see if it should be reapplied to enable the JSCI to be finalised. The referral outcome recommended in the ESAt report is for referral to DES. The Service Officer does not feel that Brendan requires that type of assistance again due to managing the condition well and its impact on Brendan's ability to work are now minimal.</p>

<p>The Service Officer documents Brendan's record, confirming the ESAt is not required. The Service Officer sends a request to mySupport online ICT Service and support portal, requesting the pending JSCI be finalised. The Service Officer advises Brendan of being in contact again in the near future to organise a referral to jobactive.</p>

<p>When confirmation is received from ICT that the JSCI has been finalised the Service Officer contacts Brendan to complete a referral to a jobactive provider.</p>

<p>When JSCI responses indicate possible barriers because of past circumstances, a Service Officer may determine this issue has no significant impact on the jobseeker's ability to work or participate in other activities.</p>

<p>For example, a job seeker aged 21 or younger has answered No to the question&#58;</p>

<p>'At least one of my parents or legal guardians was regularly in paid employment when I was in my early teens' but the Service Officer has determined other factors have overridden the possible barrier of intergenerational disadvantage such as&#58;</p>

<p>Jack is receiving JSP and has a fractured leg. Jack is scheduled for surgery and is expected to make a full recovery. The recovery time may be longer than 3 months. The JSCI triggered an ESAt referral because of Jack's injury. As Jack's injury appears to be temporary, an ESAt is not required.</p>

<p>Jack may be granted a temporary incapacity exemption from the mutual obligation requirements because a medical certificate is lodged that shows Jack is temporarily incapacitated for all work for this period.</p>

<p>If Jack lodges further medical certificates the situation should be reviewed. If Jack has long term limitations as a result of this injury, an ESAt referral may be appropriate to assess ongoing work capacity and support requirements.</p>

<p>If an ESAt is not required, either&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
when running Looking for Work, indicate on the <strong>results</strong> screen that a referral for an ESAt will not be made - this will ensure an ESAt flag is not raised, or</li>
		<li>
if an ESAt flag has already been raised, it may be withdrawn using the <strong>copy/withdraw</strong> workflow on the <strong>Participation Summary</strong> screen</li>		</ul>
