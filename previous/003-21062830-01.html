<p>To receive a payment, customers must be ‘unable to attend work and therefore unable to earn their usual income due to a state public health order for restricted movement’.</p>

<p>This means the customer cannot earn their usual amount of income from any employer (existing or new).</p>

<p>That is, if a customer has lost income from an employer, but is able to regain the same lost income from a new employer, they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>can</strong> attend work and earn their usual income, <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
<strong>are not</strong> eligible to receive a payment</li>

<p>A person may be unable to attend work and earn their usual income for a number of reasons related to the restricted movement conditions. This includes where customers are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
not permitted or unable to work from home, and</li>
		<li>
cannot attend work due to caring responsibilities</li>
		</ul>
<p>Unable to attend work and therefore unable to earn their usual income means the customer must have lost <strong>at least 1 full day of work</strong> in the relevant period.</p>

<p>If a customer was scheduled to work 10 hours and still worked 8 hours of that shift, they do not meet this criteria, as they have not lost at least 1 full day of work.</p>

<p>The payment rate the customer receives is based on hours of work <strong>lost </strong>during the relevant period, <strong>not</strong> hours the customer would have worked if the restricted movement did not occur.</p>

<p><strong>If a customer only works in a relevant area (does not live in a relevant area)</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Hours of work lost must only be included for employers in a <a class="modal-link" href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-21062830-05.html#bp05_L3TT_Sydney_areas">Relevant area in Sydney</a> or <a class="modal-link" href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-21062830-05.html#bp05_L3TT_Greater_Sydney_">Relevant area in Greater Sydney</a></li>

<p>To receive a payment, customers must be ‘unable to attend work and therefore unable to earn their usual income due to a state public health order for restricted movement’.</p>

<p>This means the customer cannot earn their usual amount of income from any employer (existing or new).</p>

<p>That is, if a customer has lost income from an employer, but is able to regain the same lost income from a new employer, they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>can</strong> attend work and earn their usual income, <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
<strong>are not</strong> eligible to receive a payment</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Reasons a person may be unable to attend work and earn their usual income</strong></p>

<p>A person may be unable to attend work and earn their usual income for a number of reasons related to the restricted movement conditions. This includes where customers&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
are not permitted or unable to work from home </li>
		<li>
cannot attend work due to caring responsibilities</li>
		<li>
are not vaccinated against COVID-19 </li>
		<li>
have an exemption from wearing a mask, however, cannot work because of a state public health order mandating mask wearing (this must be because of a state public health order and not because of a condition an employer has placed on a person’s employment) </li>
		</ul>
<p>Unable to attend work and therefore unable to earn their usual income means the customer, in the relevant period, must have lost <strong>at least&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
8 hours of work, <strong>or</strong></li>
		<li>
1 full day of work</li>
		</ul>
<p>A full day of work <strong>does not</strong> need to be at least 8 hours.</p>

<p>For example&#58;</p>

<p>A customer normally works a 3 hour shift during the relevant period and cannot attend that shift because of the restricted movement. The customer meets the 'unable to attend work and therefore unable to earn their usual income' criteria as they have lost 1 full day of work in the relevant period</p>

<p>If a customer does not lose 1 full day of work, they must lose at least 8 hours of work in the relevant period. For example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
A customer normally works 1 x 10 hour shift during the relevant period. They work 5 hours of that shift. The customer <strong>does not</strong> meet the 'unable to attend work and therefore unable to earn their usual income' criteria as they have not lost at least 8 hours of work or 1 full day of work in the relevant period</li>
		<li>
A customer normally works 2 x 10 hours shifts during the relevant period. They work 5 hours each day of those 2 shifts. The customer <strong>does</strong> meet the 'unable to attend work and therefore unable to earn their usual income' criteria as they have lost 10 hours of work in the relevant period</li>
		</ul>
<p>The payment rate the customer receives is based on hours of work <strong>lost </strong>during the relevant period, <strong>not</strong> hours the customer would have worked if the restricted movement did not occur.</p>

another leave type they are not entitled to access, such as paid sick and carer's leave or compassionate leave when they have been stood down without pay by their employer under the Fair Work Act</li>
