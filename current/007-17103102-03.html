<p>For Service officers not trained in CCS, or for customers who are not a family in crisis or a family experiencing financial hardship, Service Officers are to advise&#58;<br>'Please be assured we are processing claims as quickly as possible. We will let you know the outcome as soon as it is complete. If you have been requested to provide information, it is important that you do so as soon as possible so as not to delay your claim. Thank you for your patience.' </p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> staff have no delegation to process Additional Child Care Subsidy (ACCS) claims unless they are members of an ACCSPT (ACCS Processing Team). This includes combined CCS/ACCS claims where the ACCS component is embedded within the CCS claim There is no requirement to reallocate the work item as it will be mapped to appropriately trained staff. Advise the customer that the application will be processed at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<p><strong>Requests for priority processing</strong></p>

<p>CCS claims can be escalated for priority processing when the claim is actionable (i.e. all information and evidence has been provided), <strong>and</strong> the customer meets the definition of a family in crisis or a family experiencing financial hardship.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>CCS only claim</strong>&#58; Non processing Service Officers are to access the record in Customer First. Create a <strong>Fast Note </strong>select<strong> Auto Text</strong> use <strong>Families &gt; Claims &gt; Families Claim Escalation - Hardship</strong> to send a request for urgent processing&#58;</li>

use the service reason <strong>CCP</strong></li>
			<li>
include a summary of why processing is required urgently, including how they meet the definition of in crisis or experiencing financial hardship</li>
			<li>
ensure telephone details are correct should the processing Service Officer need to contact them</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>CCS/ACCS combined claims and ACCS applications</strong>&#58; All ACCS applications (if a combined CCS claim or a standalone application) meet the definition of financial hardship and are prioritised accordingly via Workload Manger, so no additional escalations are needed for this reason.<br>If the customer presents multiple indicators of financial hardship, is in crisis or a repeat caller, the claim/application can be escalated to the ACCS Processing Team for priority processing.<br>Service Officers are to access the record in Customer First. Create a <strong>Fast Note</strong> - select <strong>Auto Text</strong> use <strong>Families &gt; Claims &gt; ACCS Claim Escalation Urgent Processing</strong>&#58;</li>

<p><strong>Customer wishes to withdraw claim</strong></p>

<p>If the customer wishes to withdraw their online claim, <img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> encourage them to withdraw their own claim via online services.</p>

<p>To withdraw a claim on behalf of a customer see <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-03040050-01.html">Withdrawal of claims</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Rejected claim</strong></p>

<p>When the claim has been rejected the customer must be provided an explanation of this decision. It is important the customer understands the reason their claim has been rejected.</p>

<p>There is no backdating provision if the customer provides the additional information to support their claim within 13 weeks of the date a decision was made to reject their claim. Customers will need to submit a new claim for CCS.</p>

<p>If, after a thorough explanation has been provided to the customer, they want to apply for a formal review of the decision, see <a href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/109-03000000-01.html">Review of decision</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Not effective claims</strong></p>

<p>Claims are effective if all the necessary information and/or evidence is provided at the time the claim is lodged. If a claim is not effective, no decision can be made about eligibility so a review of a decision cannot be requested. The claim is taken not to have been made and a new claim will need to be lodged.</p>

<p><strong>CCS and ACCS processing support and escalation process</strong></p>

<p><strong>Check existing resources</strong></p>

<p>When a Process Direct issue is encountered, staff must refer to existing resources prior to escalating&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Digital Assistant (Roxy) for automated response</li>
		<li>
Operational Blueprint and training resources</li>
		<li>
Operational Messaging</li>
		<li>
Network News Updates</li>
		<li>
Child Care Subsidy Technical Support SharePoint resources</li>
		<li>
Child Care Subsidy Subject Matter Expert (SME)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Escalation</strong></p>

<p>If the CCS Subject Matter Expert (SME) identifies that ICT analysis is required, and the issue is encountered within a CCS Claim or an ACCS activity&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Follow the <a target="_blank" class="pdflink" href="/PD/Documents/Generic/expired/Digital%20Assistant%20(Roxy)%20v2%20CPTv3%20Taskcard.pdf">DA Roxy V2 Task card</a> and raise the incident via the Process Direct Digital Assistant (Roxy)</li>
		<li>
When raising the incident, ensure the following information is included in the referral&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Exact error message presented</li>
			<li>
What action was being performed (for example, when/where did the error occur?)</li>
			<li>
Current outcome</li>
			<li>
Expected outcome</li>
			<li>
Action required by ICT</li>
			<li>
What has been checked</li>
			<li>
Steps taken to resolve</li>
			<li>
If the error could be fixed and whether or not the claim could be completed</li>
			<li>
Previous SD/IM numbers relevant to the claim (from ICT Interaction Viewer)</li>
			<li>
Any other relevant information, including SME consulted</li>
			<li>
Complete a note in Process Direct with the following text 'referred to ICT on dd/mm/yyyy’, in addition to the information included in the referral</li>
			<li>
Ensure the claim is assigned to the logon of the employee responsible and the work item is placed on <strong>Hold</strong></li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>When the activity is a Change of Circumstances or if Roxy is not available, staff must escalate using the Child Care Subsidy and Additional Child Care Subsidy Issues webform via mySupport. The <a href="../families/007-17103102-05.html">Resources</a> page contains a link to mySupport. If the escalation relates to a claim activity, the referral must include the reason Roxy was not used to raise the incident.</p>

<p>ICT Referrals that do not contain sufficient information will be returned un-actioned.</p>

<p><strong>Urgent cases</strong></p>

<p>In addition to the escalation process above, Service Officers should determine if one or more of the following circumstances are applicable&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Ombudsman, Ministerial, Member of Parliament (MP), Media and executive enquiry</li>
		<li>
Escalated complaint (Level 2 Customer Relations Unit). See <a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-02040000-01.html">Level 2 complaints</a> for a definition</li>
		<li>
A family in crisis or a family experiencing financial hardship</li>
		</ul>
<p>If any of the above criteria are met, once the issue has been escalated via Roxy or mySupport, contact the ICT Service Desk to escalate. See <a href="../families/007-17103102-05.html">Resources</a> for a link to an article on how to do this.</p>
