<p>For customers calling our MBL’s the Privacy and Conditions of use are provided in the IVR messaging. Should customers be issued a <strong>PIN</strong> by phone or by staff in a Service Centre, the following statements must be read to the customer.</p>

<p><strong>Privacy statement</strong></p>

<p>The privacy and security of your personal information is important to us, and is protected by law. We need to collect this information so we can process and manage your applications and payments, and provide services to you. We only share your information with other parties where you have agreed, or where the law allows or requires it. For more information, go to servicesaustralia.gov.au/privacy.</p>

<p><strong>Self Service conditions of use</strong></p>

<p>Providing you with a voiceprint will assist you to access the agency’s services, including Self Service. Your voiceprint will be securely stored by Telstra on behalf of Services Australia. It will be linked with information about you that is kept by the agency. This will allow you to identify yourself when you call. Using the agency’s Self Service facilities is voluntary. If you have a myGov account, it may be given to your myGov member services so they can identify you. When using your voice or <strong>PIN</strong> to access these services your personal information will be treated as described in the privacy notice.</p>

<p>You can enrol only once. Voiceprints are checked to ensure only one exists per customer. You must not permit any other person to record their voice to access your record. If your access has been misused or you wish to cancel your access, please contact us.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Which government department/agencies are already using Voice Biometrics?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Services Australia Centrelink, Child Support (mutual customers only) and the Australian Taxation Office use a customer’s voiceprint to authenticate and confirm their identity. They use the same software product and the same simple passphrase “<i>in Australia my voice identifies me</i>”. </p>

<p>Please note, voiceprint <strong>enrolment</strong> can only be completed through Centrelink Main Business lines and the Centrelink Express Plus Mobile APP. This is unable to be completed through Child Support at this stage. </p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; How can Voice Biometrics ensure my security?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; All voiceprints are encrypted securely stored, in a database, in a secure data centre. Voice Biometrics security is among the strongest authentication processes, and is more secure than a PIN or password as voiceprints use the individual characteristics in a voice, similar to a fingerprint – no two voiceprints are the same. Services Australia Voice Biometrics technology is able to flag whether the voice coming into the system is recorded, or live, and can identify if the voice has changed after authentication in an attempt to fraudulently access a customer’s information.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Does Voice Biometrics technology support a diverse customer base?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Voice Biometrics is available to all customers. The Common Passphrase (CPP) – (<i>In Australia my voice identifies me</i>) <strong>must be</strong> repeated <strong>in English</strong>. Speaking the CPP in other languages would require an implementation build and ongoing maintenance outside of the current scope of Voice Biometrics. </p>

<p>There has been a recent upgrade to our solution platform, which has demonstrated further increased performance for our Multicultural and Bilingual customers. </p>

<p>Some customers may want to practice the passphrase “In Australia my voice identifies me” prior to creating their voiceprint. </p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Are there Privacy risks using your voice to contact devices around the home?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Home based voice devices are very different to using voice biometrics to identify somebody. Home based devices respond to words or phrases and Voice Biometrics is the measurement of how someone speaks and the characteristics of the human voice, which is unique to an individual. Whilst some home devices might have voice recognition, our technology has strict security measures. This prevents attempts to mislead the technology such as changing your voice, pitch or tone.   </p>

<p>Services Australia adhere to strict Privacy Policy in line with the Privacy Act 1988. All voiceprints are encrypted securely and stored in line with our Privacy Policy. For more information on privacy please visit <a class="extwebsitelink" href="https&#58;//www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/organisations/about-us/our-commitments/policies/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy - Services Australia</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; What if my voice changes e.g. with age or if I have a cold?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; While the technology is very good, there are times where a customer’s voice will simply not match with their voiceprint. This could be due to a variation in the customer’s voice due to gender transitioning, aging or the customer experiencing a major illness. A voiceprint can always be deleted and a new one recorded but remember the customer would need to fully re-verify their identity with Services Australia to do so. Please see <a href="../self-service/133-04160050-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Managing_voicep01">Voiceprints for phone self service</a> (Table 7) for workflow.</p>

<p>There is also the ability for your voiceprint to auto-update over time as your actual voice changes as you age. This is not a feature we have had to use yet but is a capability of the technology we may use to support our customers into the future.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Will customers wearing a mask interfere with their Voiceprint enrolment?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; The Authentication Team has received advice that there has been many types of masks tested such as surgical, 3M Cloth and structured foam and all seemed quite OK. If the customer is finding it difficult to speak with their mask on, you can always offer the Customer a PIN, to convert to a Voiceprint at home.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Do customers use their CAN or CRN?</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
<p>Answer&#58; Customers must use their Customer Access Number (CAN) for voiceprint and all Self Service options. Most customers CAN is the same as their Customer Reference Number (CRN), however for a small portion of our customers it is not the same. Project teams and our telephony stakeholders continue work to make things simple and easy for our customers. For this small portion of customers. Matching their CANs to CRNs is being explored. At this stage, there is no further update as a possible solution is still being scoped.</p></li>		</ul>

<p><strong>Question&#58; I was asked an alternate passphrase to authenticate?</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
<p>Answer&#58; The CPP remains “In Australia, my voice identifies me.” On rare occasions customers may be asked by the IVR to repeat an alternative passphrase, instead of the standard common passphrase. This is part of our expected system design. This is not replacing our common passphrase. This is referenced in <a href="../self-service/133-04160050-03.html#bp03_tbl_How_to_enrol_a_01_Step05">Voiceprints for phone self service </a> Please refer to Process -Table 3 - Step 5</p></li>		</ul>

<p>Answer&#58; A voiceprint enrolment is not complete unless it is confirmed and PoRO (identity confirmed) completed. A provisional voiceprint presenting and not finalised (due to being on the wrong record/not the principal owner/nominee/deceased) will be deleted by the system within 24 hours, if not by the Service Officer and the voiceprint cannot be used outside of the current interaction. The customer will need to complete their voiceprint on their CAN/CRN. The Fast Note needs to be completed on the record the voiceprint attached itself too. Therefore, if you are unable to complete a fast note on the record, this will be highlighted in reporting. We recommend the Services Officer discuss this reason with their Team Leader in coaching to explain why it could not be actioned. It is also paramount that when a caller comes through on a record that is not their own, and they have provided a voiceprint, that the staff member educates the caller on the correct process (to only provide a voiceprint on their own record). The Voice Bio project team continues work to enhance and improve the Voice Authentication system and are exploring the option of non-actionable records being screened in the IVR. At this stage, there is no further update as a possible solution is being scoped.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Outdated or old identity questions when attempting to enrol a customer’s voiceprint </strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; The questions that present for a voiceprint enrolment are dependent on the information available on the customer’s record. Current customers have more up to date information. The system will attempt to authenticate the customer in the quickest way possible which may mean asking questions around outdated or old information. If the customer is unable to correctly answer these questions, due to the information on their record being old, there is the ability to select &quot;<strong>Ask more questions</strong>” however based on their circumstances older/expired documents may still present. Remember a customer’s driver licence may have expired but the licence number will remain the same as long as the State remains the same. &#160;</p>

<p>It is important to remember, voiceprint authentication offers the highest level of security and protects the customer from fraud and unauthorised access, and therefore we need to maintain the integrity of the enrolment process by only confirming what is on record. This may mean a portion of customers will be unable to pass the voiceprint enrolment process required to finalise a voiceprint. If the customer cannot pass the PoRO questions and the Identity documents presenting are old and the customer cannot recall the details, the customer should attend a Service Centre with photo ID and have the details uploaded to their customer record. Appropriate photo ID is an Australian Drivers Licence, Australian Passport, Australian Shooters Licence, Australian Security Licence, Overseas Passport, Student card and Proof of Age card.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Do I still have to ask for their password if they have one on record?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Yes. If the customer has a password on their record, it must still be confirmed.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Is a voiceprint offered on outbound calls?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; No, only inbound calls. The Authentication team receive many suggestions and questions relating to why customers cannot enrol or authenticate using their voiceprint on an outbound call. </p>

<p>Voiceprint authentication on outbound calls is currently out of scope for voice biometrics in Services Australia. Our current Voice Authentication solutions are implemented on our inbound telephony system, and relies on inbound calls and the IVR undertaking a series of complex checks on the customer record, before the customer is authenticated. This provides the highest level of security for phone based interactions and the capability for self-service offers in the IVR.</p>

<p>Centrelink is making customer records even more secure through voiceprint technology. Every customer's voice is unique and cannot be copied. By recording your voiceprint and matching it to your Centrelink record, this makes it fast, easy, and secure for you to authenticate each time you call.</p>

<p>By enrolling in voice biometrics, you won't have to remember a password or any secret questions and answers. You will only need to enter your CAN/CRN and then say 'In Australia my voice identifies me'.</p>

<p>It is more secure. No one can copy your voice. Our technology can tell if it is a recording of your voice.</p></td>

<p>Voice biometrics uses unique characteristics of your voice. It gives you a faster and easier way to authenticate.</p>

<p>You can continue to use phone self service or speak to a Service Officer as you have in the past.</p>

<p>If you do have trouble enrolling in Voice biometrics technology, a good tip is to speak naturally. You don't have to be extra loud or extra slow for the service to understand you.</p>

<p>Voice biometrics checks characteristics of the human voice. These are different from those heard by the human ear. It still works if there is background noise, or if you have a cold or an accent.</p></td>

<p>I initially decided to enrol in voice biometrics technology and have successfully recorded my voiceprint, but I've changed my mind. How do I go back to the way it was before when I used my speaker verification/PIN?</p></td>
<td width="22%">

<p>Upgrading to a voiceprint makes it faster and easier for you to authenticate. Soon it will be the main way customers use phone self service. It is more secure than a <strong>PIN</strong>. It cannot be copied, lost, or stolen.</p>

<p>If you would prefer to use a PIN, we can delete your voiceprint and give you a <strong>PIN</strong>.</p></td>
<td width="19%" colspan="2">

<p>(For Speaker Verification™) Unfortunately, you cannot go back to using Speaker Verification™ once voice biometrics is rolled out. You can use voice biometrics from now on, or I can give you a <strong>PIN</strong>. The next time you call using this <strong>PIN</strong>, you will be asked to enrol in voice biometrics.</p>

<p>While this answer is correct, encourage customers to move forward with the voice biometrics solution.</p></td>
