<p>During the CCS year the exceptional circumstances provision gives families access to additional child care during family crises. This assistance allows children to be safely cared for during exceptional circumstances. Customers experiencing exceptional circumstances may apply to Services Australia to have an increase in their CCS/ACCS entitlement. In some instances their child care service may apply to the Department of Education, Skills and Employment.</p>

<p>If partnered, the CCS customer needs to demonstrate the exceptional circumstance affects both themselves and their partner. If the exceptional circumstance only relates to one member of the couple, the family's result will still be based on the member of the couple with the lowest Activity Test result. For customers receiving ACCS, an exceptional circumstance Activity Test result will apply at the family level.</p>

<p>If two children&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
have the same date of birth (for example, multiple birth such as twins or triplets), and</li>
		<li>
are the eldest children aged 5 or younger</li>
		<li>
the system will determine the Standard Rate Child as the child with the lowest number CRN</li>
		</ul>
<p>Exceptional circumstances will be available to change the Standard Rate Child to another child sharing the same date of birth.</p>

<p>For reconciliation, exceptional circumstance considerations may also be extended to customers who are prevented from meeting CCS reconciliation requirements by the 1st or 2nd deadline due to extreme situations that are beyond their control. Exceptional Circumstances provisions may also be appropriate where CCS reconciliation outcomes are either delayed, or adversely affected by ex-partner inaction or income.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> on 30 June 2020, the Department of Education, Skills and Employment (DESE) announced that the 1st deadline date for 2018-19 financial year would be extended until 31 March 2021. This allowed customers who had not met their CCS reconciliation requirements for 2018-19 to retain their CCS entitlement until 5 April 2021. The 2nd deadline date for 2018-19 remained 1 July 2021.</p>

<p>If a customer is prevented from meeting the CCS reconciliation requirements by the 1st and/or 2nd deadline, they can apply for an extension if they are affected by exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p>Evidence is not required for this application, however staff must be satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist.</p>

<p>CCS customers can apply for&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Additional time to meet the CCS reconciliation income requirements by the 1st deadline to prevent CCS entitlement being reduced to a zero rate</li>
		<li>
Additional time to meet the CCS reconciliation income requirements by the 2nd deadline to prevent CCS entitlement being cancelled and the CCS non-lodger debt being determined for recovery</li>
		</ul>
<p>If an extension is granted from the 1st deadline, the period a customer has to meet the CCS reconciliation income requirements can be extended from the 1st deadline (1 July of the 1st deadline year) until no later than 30 June of the 1st deadline year. Applying this extension will allow the customer to continue to receive the applicable rate of CCS instead of dropping to 0%.</p>

<p>For the 2nd deadline extension, the period a customer has to meet the CCS reconciliation income requirements can be extended indefinitely from the 2nd deadline date, but only can be applied for in 6 month increments. This extension will prevent CCS from cancelling but will not prevent them from reducing to a 0% rate of CCS and the undetermined non-lodger debt from being created. The amount of extension time given will be directly related to the time the customer expects to take to complete the outstanding requirement(s).</p>

<p>If an extension is granted for more than one member of the family unit (for example, the customer and their partner/ex-partner), the extension deadline dates must be the same. This applies to initial or subsequent extensions to the deadline dates.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>If a customer is unable to meet the reconciliation requirements by the 1st deadline because of the <strong>inaction of an ex or previous partner</strong>, the customer can request that the ex/previous-partner's most recent income estimate (MRE) be used for reconciliation to occur.</p>

<p>This is referred to as a Most Recent Estimate (MRE) Exception. No evidence is required for assessment.</p>

<p>If a customer is seeking an MRE Exception, they must be advised that ex/previous partners still have up until the 1<sup>st</sup> deadline date to confirm income before deadline provisions take effect. Coding the MRE Exception before the 1<sup>st</sup> deadline will not force reconciliation to occur immediately. MRE Exceptions are only applied from the 1<sup>st</sup> deadline and therefore the reconciliation process will not occur for the customer until after that date.</p>

<p>Customers should also be warned of the potential for overpayments if the ex/previous partner later lodges a tax return with income higher than the MRE figure coded as part of this exception.</p>

<p>If a customer has separated and/or the partner has died outside of the relevant CCS year (but not from the extended lodgement year), they are also able to apply for the MRE Exception.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>From 1 July 2020, where CCS reconciliation for the relevant year has already occurred, and a CCS customer who was partnered for part of the year incurs an overpayment <strong>due to an ex-partner underestimating their income</strong>, the customer's reconciliation may be re-assessed using the ex-partner's income estimate.</p>

<p>This is referred to as an Ex-partner Debt Exception. No physical evidence is required in order for eligibility to be assessed.</p>

<p>The intent is that this exceptional circumstance exception should only be applied in circumstances where the customer did not know, and had no reason to suspect the underestimation of income by the ex-partner. By being able to override the periods where the underestimation of income by the ex-partner caused or contributed to some or all of the reconciliation debt, the customer will avoid overpayments related specifically to this.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> this exception can only be applied for the 2019-20 reconciliation period and onwards.</p>

<p>Requests to increase subsidised hours or ACCS percentage will be determined by the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Increased hours for CCS and ACCS customers</strong> - after obtaining all relevant information and scanning evidence to the customer's record, Service Officers will refer the request to the Level 2 Policy Helpdesk for a determination. If it is evident that the customer, (their partner) or the child is not subject to an exceptional circumstance such as those provided in the <a href="../families/007-17103144-05.html">Resources</a> page, referral to Level 2 Policy Helpdesk is not required. The process of the customer not experiencing an exceptional circumstance is to be followed</li>
		<li>
<strong>Increased ACCS percentage</strong> - the Department of Education, Skills and Employment will receive the request from the child care service/provider and make the determination. When a decision is made, it will be referred to Services Australia to be applied to the customer's record</li>
		<li>
<strong>Reconciliation - 1st or 2nd deadline extensions</strong> - Staff taking the call from the customer are the decision makers for deadline extensions</li>
		<li>
<strong>Reconciliation - Ex-partner MRE Exception</strong> - Once it is established that the CCS customer may not meet or has not met the relevant year reconciliation requirements by the first deadline due to the inaction of an ex-partner, staff may code this exception at first contact</li>
		<li>
<strong>Reconciliation - Ex-partner Debt Exception</strong> - if the Service Officer is satisfied that the customer had no reason to suspect the ex-partner's income was incorrect and could not reasonably have foreseen the overpayment, the Service Officer will send the request to the Level 2 Policy Helpdesk who will review and send to the Level 3 Helpdesk for coding</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> as increased CCS and ACCS Activity Test results and ACCS percentage increases are recorded in the Exceptional Circumstances (<strong>EXC</strong>) Table in Process Direct, all updates are subject to QMA.</p>
