<p>A job seeker may be Services Australia Managed where they are undertaking sufficient Youth Activities, and will not have to be referred to an Employment Services Provider.</p>

<p>Youth Activities can be approved for any Youth Allowance job seeker, including <a href="../job-seekers/001-09020040-01.html">Early School Leavers (ESLs)</a>. ESLs do not have different activity or hourly requirements under Youth Activities provisions.</p>

<p>If the job seeker has a disability or is incapacitated, or may have barriers to participation, <a href="../job-seekers/001-02330010-01.html">request an Employment Services Assessment (ESAt)</a> - to determine their work capacity and potential entitlement to other income support payments.</p>

<p>If the job seeker has a dependent child under 16 years of age, ensure they are <a href="../job-seekers/001-04030010-01.html">assessed as a Principal Carer</a> if appropriate, and have the necessary coding completed.</p>

<p>Youth Activities hourly requirements are different for YA job seekers who are either Principal Carers or have a <a href="../job-seekers/001-09070180-01.html">Partial Capacity to Work/Temporary Reduced Work Capacity</a>.</p>

<p>There are various activities and combinations of activities that could allow a YA job seeker to meet their <a href="../job-seekers/001-09000000-01.html">mutual obligation requirements</a> through 'Youth Activities', and be managed by the agency.</p>

<p>The primary focus when approving activities as suitable is whether the activity will improve the job seeker's skills, qualifications and their prospects of gaining employment, whilst increasing their social and economic participation.</p>

<p>The minimum hours required for Youth Activities will depend on the job seeker's participation category&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Principal carers - 15 hours week</li>
		<li>
Partial Capacity to Work job seekers - 15 hours per week</li>
		<li>
Other YA job seekers - 25 hours per week</li>
		</ul>
<p>Examples of activities (which can be used alone or in combination to meet the required hours) include, but are not limited to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
part time study - Students who have&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
temporarily decreased their study load to less than 75% of the full time load, and</li>
			<li>
no longer have 'full time student' status, and</li>
			<li>
lose access to the higher income threshold, and</li>
			<li>
lose access to the student income bank</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>If they are participating in 50 to 74 per cent of a full time study load (or meeting the hourly requirement), the part time study will fully satisfy mutual obligation requirements as Youth Activities.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
paid employment (meeting the <a href="../job-seekers/001-09070070-01.html">Sufficient Work Test</a>)</li>
		<li>
paid self-employment (meeting the Sufficient Work Test)</li>
		<li>
a self-employment development opportunity</li>
		<li>
paid work experience</li>
		<li>
programmes or measures designed to eliminate or reduce any disadvantage the person has in the labour market</li>
		<li>
an activity proposed by the person and approved by the Secretary (for example, unpaid voluntary work)</li>
		<li>
training for Aboriginal program placement</li>
		<li>
an approved literacy course through TAFE/Adult Education Providers</li>
		<li>
a rehabilitation program, including a vocational rehabilitation program</li>
		<li>
a state Drug Court program</li>
		<li>
a program of assistance as recommended by an <a href="../job-seekers/001-02330000-01.html">Employment Services Assessment (ESAt)</a> or <a href="../people-with-disability/008-06110000-01.html">Job Capacity Assessment (JCA)</a></li>

		</ul>
<p>If the job seeker is not participating for the minimum hours per week, consider what additional activities may be appropriate for the job seeker to undertake.</p>

<p>If the job seeker needs to undertake job search because they are not participating in sufficient hours of approved activities or programmes, Youth Activities cannot be approved by the agency. These job seekers must be connected to an Employment Services Provider, who will negotiate a Job Plan.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Job seekers may ask whether they can engage in part time study/training which has not been approved as part of the Job Plan. Service officers should advise that while job seekers are not restricted from engaging in other activities, they must not interfere with the activities agreed to in the Job Plan.</p>

<p>Participation in state based Transition to Work or similar post school program can be an approved activity for certain job seekers receiving Youth Allowance (YA) (other) who have mutual obligation requirements. The NSW State Government Transition to Work (NSW TTW) program, the Victorian to Employment (TTE) Initiative and the National Disability Insurance Scheme's SLES initiative are 3 examples. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> this Transition to Work service is different to the national <a href="../job-seekers/001-02290000-01.html">Intensive Support - Transition to Work</a> programme offered by the Department of Education, Skills and Employment</p>

<p>Job seekers who have commenced state based Transition To Work, Victorian Transition to Employment (TTE) Initiative or the National Disability Insurance Scheme's SLES initiative, or are due to commence within 8 weeks of applying for YA, need to have it included as an approved activity in their Job Plan. Job seekers are not required to undertake any other activities prior to commencing these program.</p>

<p>Job seekers must advise the agency of their involvement /upcoming involvement in these program when applying for a payment that has mutual obligation requirements, and provide evidence of acceptance (for example, a confirmation letter).</p>

<p>The Job Plan must include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Youth Activities as the only compulsory activity</li>
		<li>
state based Transition to Work Victorian Transition To Employment (TTE) Initiative or the National Disability Insurance Scheme's SLES initiative in the details of the activity</li>
		<li>
hours per fortnight</li>
		<li>
program provider name</li>
		<li>
program start and end date</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> some of these types of programs are 2 year programs however Youth Activities can only be coded for a maximum of 12 months. YAC must be coded on the <strong>AEX</strong> screen. The job seeker will need to return to Services Australia at the end of the first 12 month period to have Youth Activities coded for a second 12 month period.</p>

<p>Participation in NSW Transition To Work, Victorian Transition To Employment (TTE) Initiative or the National Disability Insurance Scheme's SLES initiative will suspend jobactive, national <a href="../job-seekers/001-02290000-01.html">Intensive Support - Transition to Work</a> or <a href="../job-seekers/001-02140000-01.html">Community Development Program (CDP)</a> employment services.</p>

<p><strong>State or Government programs and Disability Employment Services (DES) Concurrency.</strong></p>

<p>Job seekers cannot participate in both state based Transition To Work, Victorian Transition To Employment (TTE) Initiative or the National Disability Insurance Scheme's SLES initiative programs and <a href="../people-with-disability/008-04030020-01.html">Disability Employment Services (DES)</a> at the same time.</p>

<p>However, job seekers in their final 6 months of participation in either the <strong>NSW State Government Transition to Work program,</strong> the <strong>Victorian Transition To Employment Initiative</strong> or the <strong>National Disability Insurance Scheme's SLES initiative</strong>, can directly register with a DES provider as an eligible school leaver, and start receiving DES assistance while they finalise their participation in the post school program.</p>

<p>All other job seekers are required to exit the program if they want to participate in DES. Once the job seeker has exited the program, they are eligible to commence in DES under eligible school leaver arrangements. They are not required to undertake an <a href="../job-seekers/001-02330000-01.html">Employment Services Assessment (ESAt)</a> for the purpose of accessing DES. Job seekers will be referred to DES by&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the DES provider through direct registration procedures</li>
		<li>
the agency through the Online Diary if they have a current and valid ESAt or <a href="../people-with-disability/008-06110000-01.html">Job Capacity Assessment (JCA)</a> which recommends referral to DES</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> an ESAt is not required in order for Services Australia to approve and record these programs for YA job seekers. However, any job seekers should still be referred to an ESAt if there is a valid reason apart from a DES referral, for example to determine if they have a partial capacity to work.</p>
