<p><strong>Norfolk Island resident's child born before 1 July 2016 and entrusted to care after 1 July 2016</strong></p>

<p>Samantha and partner Gill had always lived on Norfolk Island and were Australian citizens. Samantha and Gill's youngest child James was born in May 2016. On 1 July 2016, Samantha claimed Family Tax Benefit (FTB) and PPL for James.</p>

<p>Samantha was eligible for FTB because of meeting the Australian residence requirements at the date of claim, but was not eligible for PPL as a primary claimant because James was born before 1 July 2016 and Samantha was living on Norfolk Island at the time of birth. Samantha was eligible for Newborn Upfront Payment (NBU) and Newborn Supplement (NBS).</p>

<p>On 5 October 2016, Samantha and partner Gill died in a car accident. James was immediately entrusted to the care of Samantha's sister Jane, who has always lived on Norfolk Island and is an Australian citizen. On 1 November 2016, Jane lodged a claim for PPL for James. Although James was born before 1 July 2016, Jane is residentially qualified for PPL because James was entrusted to Jane's care in exceptional circumstances after 1 July 2016.</p>

<p><strong>New migrant to Australia</strong></p>

<p>Debbie moved to Australia on 5 March 2016 to live with partner Keith and child Roger. Debbie entered the country on a 160 Business Owner (Provisional) visa. Debbie had applied for and was waiting on approval of an application for a 123 Business (General) visa.</p>

<p>On 10 July 2016, Debbie gave birth to child Kiera. The application for a 123 permanent visa was also approved on this day.</p>

<p>As Debbie did not have Australian resident status at the time of lodging the FTB claim, FTB cannot be granted from the date of claim. The earliest grant date that can be used is the date Debbie became an Australian resident.</p>

<p><strong>Holder of a specified visa subclass that qualifies the customer for Special Benefit (SpB)</strong></p>

<p>Mira has lived in Australia since 2013 and holds a 309 Partner Provisional Visa (PPV). On 3rd August 2016, Mira gave birth to child Isaac and claimed FTB and PPL on 1 September 2016. Both claims are granted and Mira elects to be paid PPL from the date of claim.</p>

<p>In October 2016 Mira, Mira's partner and Isaac travelled outside Australia for a 2 week holiday to visit Mira's country of birth and introduce Isaac to extended family. As Mira was on a PPV at the time of departure, PPL and FTB are only portable if the reason for travel is approved. Travel for holiday purposes is not an approved reason for travel; Mira was not entitled to PPL or FTB while outside Australia.</p>

<p>The system reinstated FTB on return to Australia, however as the qualifying residence rules for PPL are that primary claimants must qualify for each day starting from the date of birth of the child until the end of the PPL entitlement period, Mira lost qualification for PPL from the date of departure from Australia.</p>

<p>On the date Mira departed Australia, PPL entitlement was automatically cancelled 'NRQ' (Not Residentially Qualified). Any PPL payments issued from the date of Mira's departure must be raised as an overpayment. Mira was not able to re-claim PPL for Isaac on return to Australia.</p>

<p>Alana is granted a permanent residence visa on 24 April 2019. As the Newly Arrived Residents Waiting Period (NARWP) is applicable, Alana will not be eligible for Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A until 23 April 2020.</p>

<p>On 31 August 2019, Alana travels to New Zealand for 7 days. As Alana was not inside Australia for those 7 days, the NARWP for FTB A is extended and now ends on 30 April 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Income Support Exemption because Special Benefit is granted</strong></p>

<p>Mohammad, Faeza and their 2 children all have permanent residence visas that were granted on 27 May 2019. Faeza applies for FTB, and is only granted FTB Part B.</p>

<p>On 3 April 2019, Faeza is granted Special Benefit (SpB) due to severe financial hardship. As SpB is a social security benefit, social security pension, FHA, PPL or DAP, Faeza is now eligible for FTB Part A.</p>

<p>Faeza has another child on 23 July 2019 and claims Paid Parental Leave (PPL), with a nominated start date of 15 August 2019. The claim is assessed and awaiting start date (ASS-ASD) as Faeza is exempt from the NARWP due to being in receipt of an income support payment.</p>

<p>On 2 August 2019, Mohammad begins fulltime employment and Faeza is no longer eligible for SpB due to Mohammad's income.</p>

<p>From this date, Faeza is also no longer eligible for FTB Part A or PPL, as the NARWP has not been fully served.</p>

<p>If Faeza were to experience severe financial hardship again and be granted SpB, an exemption to the NARWP would apply again for FTB Part A. Faeza would still not be eligible for PPL as Faeza was not in receipt of an income support payment for every day from the child's date of birth until the PPL payment start date.</p>

<p><strong>309 and 820 visas holders</strong></p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>

<p>Michelle applied for a temporary 820 partner visa on 27 July 2018. Michelle's visa was granted on 30 July 2019. Because the permanent visa was granted on or after 1 January 2019, the NARWP applies to Michelle.</p>

<p>On 3 September 2019, Michelle applies for FTB. As the visa application date was prior to 1 January 2019, the NARWP start date for FTB Part A is the application date (27 July 2018) and Michelle can be granted FTB Part A.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>

<p>Abed applied for a 309 visa on 1 August 2018; this was granted on 17 January 2019.</p>

<p>On 3 April 2019, Abed applies for FTB. As the visa application date was prior to 1 January 2019, the start of the NARWP for FTB Part A is the application date (1 August 2018). As Abed will not finish serving the NARWP for FTB Part A until 2 August 2019, this will reject NWA. If Abed is otherwise qualified, Abed could receive FTB Part B.</p>

<p><strong>Example 3</strong></p>

<p>Sebastian applied for an 820 visa on 1 February 2018. Sebastian's visa was granted on 17 December 2018. The NARWP is not applicable for Sebastian as the 820 visa was granted prior to 1 January 2019.</p>

<p>However Sebastian still has to serve the NARWP for payments other than FTB Part A, PPL and DAP as a permanent 801 visa is granted to Sebastian on 27 February 2019.</p>

<p><strong>Stillborn Baby payment - Not subject to the NARWP</strong></p>

<p>Veronika was granted a permanent visa to live in Australia on 25 May 2019. Veronika has a 3 year old child, Oscar and cannot receive FTB Part A as Veronika has not served the NARWP. On the 23 October 2019, Veronika gave birth to a stillborn child Svetlana. As Veronika is eligible for FTB Part A, but does not receive it due to serving the NARWP, Veronika is eligible to receive Stillborn Baby Payment for Svetlana.</p>

<p><strong>Newborn Supplement and Newborn Upfront Payment - Impacts of the NARWP</strong></p>

<p>Mallory arrived in Australia on a permanent visa on 14 April 2019. Mallory has 2 children, Morgan 4 and Indy 2. Mallory is expecting another child on 18 August 2019. Mallory claims FTB for Morgan and Indy, but is not entitled to FTB as Mallory has not served the NARWP. Mallory gives birth to Charlie on the 9 August 2019.</p>

<p>Mallory then claims FTB on 28 September for Morgan, Indy and Charlie. Mallory is not eligible to receive FTB as the NARWP has not been served, and Mallory is not eligible to receive Newborn Supplement (NBS) and Newborn Upfront Payment (NBU) for Charlie.</p>

<p>Mallory subsequently lodges another claim for FTB on 21 April 2020 and is granted FTB Part A as the NARWP has been served. As Charlie is under 1 year old and will be in Mallory's care for over 13 weeks, Mallory will now receive the full 13 weeks of NBS and NBU.</p>

<p><strong>DAP - Serving the NARWP after child is born</strong></p>

<p>Douglas is granted a permanent visa on 12 February 2019 and is subject to the 2 year NARWP for Dad and Partner Pay (DAP). Douglas' child Dawn is born on 3 March 2020. Douglas is not eligible for DAP immediately on Dawn's birth, but as claims for DAP can be submitted 52 weeks after the birth, Douglas will be eligible for DAP when the NARWP has been fully served, in February 2021.</p>

<p><strong>PPL - Income support payment granted after child date of birth</strong></p>

<p>Stefan and Ingrid start living in Australia and are granted permanent visas on the 27 March 2019. They have a child, Chloe, on the 15 December 2019. Neither can claim PPL or DAP as they are still serving the 2 year NARWP.</p>

<p>On 24 December 2019, Stefan and Ingrid break up and Ingrid becomes the lone principal carer for Chloe. This allows an exemption to the NARWP for Parenting Payment (Single), which Ingrid is granted. However Ingrid still cannot claim PPL for Chloe. To be eligible for the exemption to the NARWP for being in receipt of a social security benefit, social security pension, FHA, PPL or DAP, Ingrid had to be in receipt of Parenting Payment (Single) on Chloe's birth date and for each day until the day before the PPL start date.</p>

<p><strong>PPL - Income support payment granted before child DOB but stops after PPL start date</strong></p>

<p>Marco arrives in Australia on 15 August 2019 on a carer subclass 116 visa to look after a critically ill friend Kellie. The subclass 116 visa provides an automatic exemption for Marco from the NARWP for Carer Payment (CP) and Carer Allowance (CA).</p>

<p>On 19 December 2019, Kellie is given just weeks to live and Marco proposes. The couple are married the next day in front of friends and family, including Kellie's 3 year old child Timmy, whom Marco adopts.</p>

<p>Because Marco is in receipt of a social security benefit, social security pension, FHA, PPL or DAP on the 20 December 2019 when Marco adopted Timmy, Marco has an exemption from the NARWP and is able to claim PPL. The PPL start date selected is 24 December 2019.</p>

<p>On 15 January 2020, Kellie passes away and Marco is no longer eligible for CP or CA. However this does not impact the exemption from the NARWP for PPL because the PPL period had started, and Marco is therefore able to receive it for the full 18 week PPL period.</p>

<p>PPL would only be impacted if Marco had not been eligible to receive CA and CP originally, such as a subsequent review being conducted that found Kellie was never a valid care receiver.</p>

<p><strong>PPL primary claimant - NARWP not met at child's DOB</strong></p>

<p>Julie and Robert arrived in Australia on 2 January 2019. They arrived as holders of permanent visa subclass 189. Both visas were granted on 1 January 2019, meaning they are subject to the NARWP for PPL. They commenced residing permanently in Australia on arrival.</p>

<p>On 15 June 2020, Julie gave birth to Grace. Julie lodges a post birth PPL claim, which rejected due to not having served the 2 year NARWP for PPL. The NARWP end date is 29 December 2020. Even if Julie chooses a nominated start date after 29 December 2020, Julie is not eligible to receive PPL for Grace as Julie had not served the NARWP on or before the child's DOB.</p>

<p>If Julie has a child <strong>after</strong> the NARWP is completed, Julie will meet residency requirements for PPL.</p>

<p>Grozdan arrived in Australia from Bulgaria on a permanent visa on 27 July 2019 to live with a new partner Gina who is an Australian citizen. On the 27 June 2021, Gina gives birth to their first child Jason.</p>

<p>Grozdan will have primary care of Jason. Grozdan claims PPL as a secondary claimant. Grozdan's NARWP ends on 23 July 2021 and Grozdan's nominated start date for PPL is 13 August 2021. While Grozdan has not served the NARWP from Jason's date of birth, it will be met by the PPL start date, which is the requirement for secondary claimants. Grozdan is eligible to receive PPL.</p>

<p><strong>PPL and DAP - date of birth exemption for children born or entering care prior to 1 July2019</strong></p>

<p>Martha's first permanent visa is granted on 1 February 2019, meaning Martha would be subject to the 2 year NARWP for PPL and a 1 year NARWP for FTB Part A. However because Martha's child Bruce is born on the 1 March 2019, Martha is exempt from the NARWP for PPL/DAP under the date of birth exemption and is eligible for PPL from Bruce's date of birth.</p>

<p>Because Martha is now in receipt of a social security benefit, social security pension, FHA, PPL or DAP, FTB Part A can be paid while PPL is being paid but will stop when the PPL entitlement ends, as the NARWP for FTB Part A has not been fully served.</p>

<p>Providing Martha does not travel outside Australia (any time outside Australia extends the NARWP end date) the 1 year NARWP for FTB will end on 30 January 2020. Therefore, if the PPL entitlement ends prior to this date, Martha will not be eligible to be paid FTB Part A until 31 January 2020.</p>

<p>Because Beth meets the residence requirements due to an exemption from the NARWP on 29 January, Beth is eligible for the PPL period and for all connected Flexible PPL days.</p>

<p>For the Flexible PPL days not connected to the PPL period, Beth will need to meet residence requirements on each individual day that is selected.</p>

<p>On 18 September 2021, Beth's qualifying income support payment is cancelled, and Beth is no longer exempt from the NARWP.</p>

<p>To claim any unpaid Flexible PPL days, Beth will need to select dates prior to 18 September 2021 otherwise Beth can claim them if residence requirements are met again at a later date.</p>
