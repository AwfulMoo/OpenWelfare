<p><strong>Refugees</strong></p>

<p>Care must be taken when assessing RA eligibility for customers who are refugees.</p>

<p>Some newly arrived refugees may be eligible to receive rent free accommodation for the first 4 weeks after arrival in Australia. After the 4 weeks has elapsed, they may then receive a rent subsidy.</p>

<p>A refugee's RA is assessed on the net rent amount (rent minus any ongoing subsidy).</p>

<p>Consideration should also be given to streaming the customer's query through the Multilingual Phone Service (MPS) if the customer needs assistance in their preferred language.</p>

<p>If the customer is unsure of any assistance they are receiving in respect of their rent then their Humanitarian Settlement Program service provider should be able to assist. For more details see service providers on the <a href="https&#58;//immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/settling-in-australia/humanitarian-settlement-program/service-providers">Department of Home Affairs</a> webpage.</p>

<p>The National Rental Affordability Scheme (NRAS) closed to new entrants in 2014. Grandfathering arrangements are in place for existing customers, however the scheme will completely end in mid-2026. Customers renting their principal home under NRAS may be entitled to RA.</p>

<p>Rent paid to occupy a home built under NRAS is not considered as 'government rent'. NRAS dwellings are owned and managed by financial institutions, non-profit organisations and local councils. They are rented to eligible individuals and families at 20 per cent below the market rate.</p>

<p>Transitional housing is short-term housing for people who are homeless or are at risk of homelessness. Some transitional housing is managed by not for profit organisations including community housing providers. There is also some government agency involvement.</p>

<p>Customers who rent their accommodation from community housing or disability housing organisation (community housing organisation) are <strong>not</strong> considered to be government tenants or sub-tenants.</p>

<p>These community housing organisations may receive state funding or lease houses from the state housing authorities, but this does not mean the customer is a government tenant or sub-tenant for RA purposes. For example, some customers pay rent amounts to the New South Wales Aboriginal Housing Office (AHO). Payments made to the AHO are not government rent for the purposes of assessing eligibility for RA.</p>

<p>Customers who rent in disability housing may have a written agreement such as a lease but may still be considered to be living in exempt accommodation. If they are living in exempt accommodation they do not need to provide verification.</p>
