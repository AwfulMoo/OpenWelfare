<p>From 17 March 2021, Income Management (IM) customers in the NT can consent to transition from IM to the CDC.</p>

<p>Participants can only apply to exit the CDC using a CDC exit application, once they have commenced on the CDC program.</p>

<p><strong>When an NT customer is on the CDC program and no longer on IM</strong></p>

<p>When an NT customer provides consent to transition to CDC, they will be issued a notice. It will then generally take 28 days for them to be a CDC participant, however they can also transition on the day they request to be a CDC participant. The notice will specify a start date that the customer will become a CDC participant. This notice can be viewed on the History Summary (<strong>HS</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>The date a participant is on the CDC program can also be confirmed on the <strong>Q2AS</strong> screen by the <strong>Percentage DOE</strong> field Check the CDCS screen in Process direct to determine the restricted percentage.</p>

<p>The Delegate must consider the impact of a CDC participant’s disability or non-parental caring responsibilities on their ability to <strong>demonstrate</strong> reasonable and responsible management of their affairs, as it relates to the assessment criteria. </p>

<p>If a participant is unable to demonstrate this, the Delegate can still make a determination that the participant is to be exited from the CDC program, if the Delegate is satisfied the participant has reasonable and responsible management of their affairs.</p>

<p>Service Officers will need to clearly document how this provision applies in the Delegate Report.</p>

<p>This provision will be assessed on a case-by-case basis, and will need to be supported by evidence. It is not enough for the participant to be receiving a carer or disability support payment, they will be required to demonstrate how their disability or caring responsibilities impact their <strong>ability to show they can manage their affairs</strong> against each assessment criteria. </p>

<p>This may be through the inability to provide the supporting information required by the form, or where the participant transfers funds to another person to meet their primary needs.</p>

<p>Evidence that could be considered under this provision may include information recorded on the participant’s record including, but not limited to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
assessment and / or receipt of Disability Support Payment, Carers payments, Mobility Allowance, exemption from mutual obligation due to temporary incapacity (including when they have a job to return to)</li>
		<li>
medical documentation confirming the participant or the person the participant has caring responsibility for has a disability or is elderly</li>
		<li>
NDIA assessment and funded supports, including if the participant has a self-managed or agency managed NDIA plan</li>
		<li>
any other evidence that would satisfy the Delegate that the participant’s disability or caring responsibilities has a sufficient impact against the assessment criteria </li>
		</ul>
<p>The Service Officer should&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
check the participant’s record for any disability/carer evidence, including customer summary, DL and documents </li>
		<li>
speak to the participant during the interview about how their disability or carer responsibilities impact their day-to-day life and how they use their card to manage their responsibilities</li>
		<li>
when completing the delegate report, note the disability or carer responsibilities, and how their circumstances support or impact their ability to meet each criteria.</li>

<p><strong>Assessment Criteria 1-3 considerations</strong></p>

<p>The following criteria should be considered when assessing an exit application&#58;</p>

<p><strong>Assessment Criteria 1&#58; The interests of any children</strong> <a title="Read more 15" class="showhead bp03_tbl_Reviewing_the_C_Step03" onclick="erefshow(this)" href="javascript:;"><span class="showhead bp03_tbl_Reviewing_the_C_Step03" onclick="erefshow(this)" href="javascript:;">+</span> Read more ...</a></p>
<div class="showcont">


<p>When considering the interests of children, the participant has responsibility of children if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they are receiving Family Tax Benefit (FTB),</li>
		<li>
their partner is receiving FTB for the family unit,</li>
		<li>
the participant’s care arrangements are more than 35%, if it is less than 35% of care, the level of responsibility will be assessed.</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the care is less than 35%, they will be assessed accordingly against their care arrangements and responsibilities for the children. If the participant’s partner is the receiver of FTB, the interest of any children still needs to be assessed even if the partner pays for all expenses relating to the children. The arrangements should clearly be described in the delegate report.</p>

<p>When considering the interests of children, assess five main components&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Engagement in age appropriate socialisation activities</li>
		<li>
Evidence of Child Protection authority involvement</li>
		<li>
Evidence that finances are directed towards needs of children</li>
		<li>
If in principal care, that dependents meet immunisation requirements</li>
		<li>
Evidence that participant is meeting their Child Support obligations.</li>
		</ul>
<p>The family dynamics and who pays for what need to be considered with regard to the needs of the children. This is particularly important when assessing a partner who does not receive FTB or in shared care arrangements.

<p>The ‘last 12 months’ period should be taken from the Date of the Decision, offence or imprisonment, not the date of Application or Assessment.</p>

<p>Process Direct will identify when a referral must be made for a National police check. This will be completed by the WQPM team. </p>

<p>It is important when checking for Crisis Payments to identify that the payment was made for<strong> PRI</strong> (Prison Release) and not for other circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> for serious offences, it is important to note any convictions and/or imprisonment within the past 5 years. Refer to the Cashless Debit Card Exits Guiding Principles in <a href="../payment-delivery/103-20081031-05.html">Resources</a> for more information.</p>

<p>When considering the participant’s circumstances, look at the previous 12 months and their experience of homelessness or when they may have been at risk of homelessness. </p>

<p>Considerations&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the participant lives with a family member in a stable situation and contributes to housing by paying bills/and or food, then the participant needs to provide evidence of payments being made towards this</li>
		<li>
If the participant transfers funds to another person to meet housing costs, then the participant needs to provide evidence that these costs are being met. For example, rental receipts or rental agreements</li>
		<li>
If the participant is staying with a family member/friend but is sleeping on the couch ('couch surfing') then this would not be considered stable and would weigh negatively on the outcome</li>
		<li>
12 weeks or less, or no agreed time frame would indicate temporary/short term housing, which would weigh negatively on the assessment</li>
		<li>
If the participant says they pay rent in a private arrangement but there is no evidence of regular and consistent payments, this will weigh negatively on their assessment</li>

<p>When assessing the participant’s financial capability, determine if the participant is able to manage and be safe from exploitation in the absence of a CDC.</p>

<p>Process Direct provides guidance via a set of interview questions and evidence based indicators to assess from the participant’s record&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The participant’s money management or budgeting practices</li>
		<li>
Absence of money mismanagement</li>
		<li>
Absence of financial exploitation.</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Money Management</strong></p>

<p>When assessing the participant’s money management strategies and budgeting practices, apply a holistic assessment to their circumstances and ensure they are meeting their and their children’s needs on a regular basis. </p>

<p>The participant should demonstrate they are applying appropriate monetary resources to meet their and their family’s needs as well as having stable or regular patterns of payment. </p>

<p><strong>Financial Capability</strong></p>

<p>To support the delegate in making an informed decision on a participant’s money management or financial capability, an understanding of the discretionary nature of these assessments is required to be made using a broad range of information and evidence available.</p>

<p>The following types of data and supporting documents/evidence are available to analyse and assess&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Bank statements</li>
		<li>
Credit or store statements</li>
		<li>
Card Provider Data</li>
		<li>
Transactions/transfers</li>
		<li>
Declined transactions</li>
		<li>
Cohort percentiles</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Debts</strong></p>

<p>When considering a participant’s debt/s, it is important to consider the affordability of their debts and ability to meet repayments consistently.</p>

<p>If there is a significant pattern of regular access to loans for the purpose of everyday purchases (e.g. groceries), this may indicate financial vulnerability and should be explored during the interview.</p>

<p><strong>Financial Exploitation</strong></p>

<p>Financial exploitation is defined as a person being subject to undue pressure, harassment, violence, abuse, deception or exploitation for resources by another person, or people, including family members and community members.  </p>

<p>If there is evidence of another person frequently taking or requesting money from the participant, this may indicate financial vulnerability and should be explored during the interview.</p>

<p>The Exit Tool will guide the Service Officer through each criteria for consideration under the legislation, when assessing if a participant can demonstrate reasonable and responsible management of their personal affairs (including financial affairs).</p>

<p>Collate the information provided in the participant’s application form, supporting evidence, Services Australia records and interview responses on the financial responsibilities of the participant to assist the Delegate with a broad and holistic understanding of the participant’s ability to demonstrate reasonable and responsible management of their personal affairs (including financial affairs) against the six criteria.</p>

<p>Refer to the participant’s information and evidence and prepare the Delegate report for each of the six criteria. </p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if there is an outstanding police check, do not submit the final Delegate report until information from the police report has been provided, as this needs to be included in the report.

<p><strong>Finalising the Delegate report</strong></p>

<p>Once the Delegate report is completed, review the report for accuracy and ensure an evidence-based decision making approach was used whilst making the recommendations. </p>
