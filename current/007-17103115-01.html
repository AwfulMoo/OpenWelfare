	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The Activity Test is one of 3 factors that determine a customer's CCS entitlement.</p>

<p>The number of hours of subsidised child care per CCS fortnight is determined by the level of recognised activities the customer engages in each fortnight.</p>

<p>The customer, <strong>and</strong> their partner if they have one, must satisfy the Activity Test unless there is an exemption. For partnered customers, the number of subsidised hours is based on the member of the couple with the <strong>lowest</strong> Activity Test result, even when an exemption applies.</p>

<p>If both members of a couple have an exemption, the number of hours subsidised is based on the person with the <strong>lowest</strong> hours of entitlement.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> this does not apply to grandparent principle carers not receiving income support or individuals temporarily outside of Australia. These customers remain eligible for 100 hours regardless of the customer and partner Activity Test result.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the hours of activity do not need to align with the hours of child care.</p>

<p>There are exemptions from the Activity Test for customers (and/or their partner) who legitimately cannot meet the requirements.</p>

<p>The <a href="../families/007-17103115-05.html">Resources</a> page has examples.</p>

<p>Customers are responsible for self-assessing their (and their partner's) hours of recognised activity. In providing this information (during the claim process, change of circumstances, or annual review) they declare the information is true and correct.</p>

<p>Evidence is not required to support the activities or hours of participation. However, customers may need to provide evidence if requested, such as a random sample survey or 'spot check'.</p>

<p>If a Service Officer suspects a customer has provided fraudulent information, they should <a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-09110000-01.html">report the suspected fraud</a> using standard business processes.</p>

<p>Customers with an estimated ATI below the lower income threshold are eligible for 24 hours per fortnight of CCS without having to meet the Activity Test.</p>

<strong>If self-employed</strong> and taking paid or unpaid parental leave, this leave will only be recognised if their business continues to operate and they have an intention to resume work in their business in the foreseeable future</li>

<p><strong>Child Care Subsidy (CCS) customers do not need to pay child care fees from 6 April 2020 until 12 July 2020.</strong></p>

<p>The Government announced no session fees will be charged to families between 6 April 2020 and 12 July 2020. Updates made to Activity Test Details (<strong>ATD</strong>) screen will have no effect on a customer’s Child Care Subsidy entitlement. This is because customers can access child care free of the activity test or means test during the Business Continuity Payment period.</p>

<p><strong>Eased Activity Test requirements from 13 July 2020 until 4 April 2021</strong></p>

<p>From 13 July 2020 until 4 April 2021 the CCS activity test requirements have been eased. This applies for families whose activity test hours have reduced due to COVID-19. Impacted families will get up to 100 hours per fortnight of subsidised care, where they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
had an activity test result of more than 0 before COVID-19 (around 1 March 2020 or before)</li>
		<li>
can no longer engage in the same number of hours of recognised activities, and </li>
		<li>
are currently doing more than 8 hours of recognised activity per fortnight</li>
		</ul>
<p>Customers can apply for extra hours by going online and completing the ‘Apply for extra activity hours (COVID-19)’ service via their MyGov account or Express Plus App.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>Customers (and/or their partners) unable to engage in recognised activities due to exceptional circumstances can be granted an exemption from the Activity Test.</p>

<p>Exemptions are assessed on a case by case basis. When requesting an exemption, customers are to provide&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
details of their (and/or their partner's) circumstances to demonstrate it would be unreasonable for them to satisfy the Activity Test or care for their or their partner's children</li>
		<li>
evidence to support their application</li>
		</ul>
<p>Customers (or their partner) experiencing exceptional circumstances can also request an increase in their assessed subsidised hours, or more than 100 hours per fortnight. They will need to give the reason for an increased Activity Test result, and submit evidence to support their application. Assess these applications to increase subsidised hours on a case by case basis.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> evidence must outline that the customer is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
unable to participate in any recognised activities and </li>
		<li>
provide a safe level of care for the child/ren due to those circumstance/s</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer requests the assessment be backdated up to the eligible 28 days (to the beginning of the CCS fortnight prior to the CCS fortnight in which the request is made), the evidence must cover this period.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Updates to activity details could result in a favourable or unfavourable outcome for the customer. The system determines the date of effect based on the date of notification and the date the change occurred.</p>

<p>If notified <strong>before</strong> the date of change, the date of effect will be the start of the CCS fortnight <strong>after</strong> the change occurred. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> customers can only notify up to 28 days in advance of a change in their activity details.</p>

<p>If the customer notifies a change in their activity <strong>after</strong> it has occurred, and the result is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
favourable (for example, it entitled them to more hours of subsidised care per fortnight), the date of effect is backdated up to 28 days from the date of notification to the start of a CCS fortnight. Any arrears will be paid directly to the customer</li>
		<li>
unfavourable, the date of effect is backdated to the start of the CCS fortnight after the change occurred (no limit). This may result in the customer receiving an overpayment</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Starting or increasing hours of paid work</strong></p>

<p>The date of effect is the first Monday of the CCS fortnight before the fortnight in which the change occurred. This DOE is subject to the customer notifying as soon as possible. For maximum benefit, customers must notify in the CCS fortnight the change occurred.</p>
