			</ul>			</ul>
<p>To meet the definition of â€˜close contactâ€™ a person must&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
usually live in the same household as a positive COVID-19 case during their infectious period<strong>, or</strong></li>
		<li>
have stayed in the same household for more than 4 hours as a positive COVID-19 case during their infectious period</li>
		</ul>
<p>An infectious period may be up to 3 days before a person experiences symptoms of COVID-19.</p>

<p>This definition has been set by the Australian government.</p>

<p><strong>For claims lodged on or after 27 April 2022</strong> </p>

<p>Customers can make a self-declaration that they meet either&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the Australian Government definition of close contact, or</li>
		<li>
the close contact definition in their state or territory</li>
		</ul>
<p>Staff <strong>do not</strong> need to</p>

check which definition is met</li>
		<li>
refer to state or territory close contact definitions, or</li>
		<li>
find out if a customer meets a state or territory close contact definition.   </li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p><strong>For claims lodged on or after 8 May 2022 </strong></p>

<p>The online claim has been updated to direct customers to check their state or territory government requirements regarding self-isolation and quarantine rules. This is due to recent changes some states and territories have made to close contact rules. </p>

<p>Options to select in the online claim around the need to self-isolate for close contact impact reasons have been updated to include </p>
		<ul>		<li>
a personâ€™s state or territory government requires them to isolate, <strong>or</strong></li>
		<li>
a personâ€™s employer has directed them not to attend their workplace even though their state or territory government does not require them to self-isolate.  </li>
		</ul>
<p>Staff <strong>do not</strong> need to </p>
		<ul>		<li>
check state or territory government rules in relation to requirements to self-isolate or quarantine </li>
		<li>
find out if a customer should or should not self-isolate or quarantine </li>
			<ul>			<li>
under their state or territory government rules, or </li>
			<li>
due to being directed by their employer not to attend work</li>
			</ul>			</ul>

While this is one form of evidence a customer may have, and can provide if requested, it is not a requirement to meet the <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-20080418-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Selfisolation03">eligibility criteria</a>.</p>

<p>If the customer <strong>has</strong> received a direct instruction from a <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-20080418-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Selfisolation04">health official</a> to self-isolate or quarantine, this would need to outline that the customer meets the definition of close contact (above) set by the Australian government. A state or territory's definition of â€˜close contactâ€™ may not align with this definition. The customer <strong>will not</strong> be eligible unless they meet the Australian Governmentâ€™s definition of â€˜close contactâ€™.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58; statutory declarations will not be accepted as evidence to support a claim. </strong></p>

<p>A claim can be rejected with no further customer contact if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a customer lodged a fifth or subsequent claim, and</li>
		<li>
an RFI letter was sent requesting evidence to support the claim, and</li>
		<li>
they withdrew the fifth or subsequent claim, <strong>or</strong> that claim was rejected as the customer â€˜Failed to Provide Informationâ€™ (FPI), <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
they then lodged another fifth or subsequent claim without the evidence previously requested</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58; </strong>continue to assess the claim<strong> if</strong> the customer has&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
lodged a fifth or subsequent claim after a previous withdrawal,<strong> and</strong> </li>
		<li>
has provided <strong>all </strong>evidence previously requested to support previous claims paid<strong> and</strong> their current claim</li>
		</ul>
<p>When a customer lodges a fifth or subsequent claim that appears to meet the eligibility criteria and 4 or more claims have already been paid, evidence must be requested to support </p>
		<ul>		<li>
payment of the fifth or subsequent claim, <strong>and</strong> </li>
		<li>
all previous claims already paid </li>
			<ul>			<li>
<strong>Note&#58;</strong> if it is clear the customerâ€™s fifth or subsequent claim does not meet the eligibility criteria, this claim can be rejected without requesting any further evidence </li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>The 4 or more claims already paid do not have to be paid in a row</strong>. For example, the customer may have lodged 8 claims. Every second claim was paid and the other claims rejected.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> to request evidence, staff must follow <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-22011652-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Fifth_or_subseq">Table 7 in Processing Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment claims in Process Direct</a> </p>

<p>Fifth claim </p>
		<ul>		<li>
means <strong>any 5 claims</strong> for the Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment for a self-isolation, quarantine or caring period <strong>that starts on or after 18 January 2022, and</strong></li>
		<li>
is not necessarily a fifth claim for a specific <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-22011652-05.html">event code</a>. For example, a customer may not have reached the maximum amount for any event code as they have lodged claims under the $450 and $750 <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-20080418-03.html#bp03_tbl_Payment_rates_1">rates of payment</a>    </li>
		</ul>
<p>If a customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
has been paid for 5 or more claims, evidence only needs to be requested for claims where evidence has not yet been provided</li>
		<li>
<a href="../initial-contact-general/106-03040050-03.html">withdraws</a> their fifth or subsequent claim, evidence still needs to be requested for the previous claims paid </li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Evidence â€“ all claim reasons</strong></p>

<p>Evidence that shows employment for 4 weeks before the first claim period <strong>and</strong> the self-isolation, quarantine or caring periods claimed such as payslips, letter of employment, letter of offer, contract(s).</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> customers who have casual employment may not have a payslip for periods not worked (the self-isolation, quarantine or caring periods claimed). Checking any Year to Date income figures will help to determine if income may have been received during self-isolation, quarantine or caring periods claimed. For help, contact Technical Peer Support</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Customers should provide payslips for self-isolation, quarantine or caring periods claimed to determine if the customer&#58; </li>
			<ul>			<li>
was eligible for past periods of Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment</li>
			<li>
worked during the claim period</li>
			<li>
was paid leave entitlements during the claim period</li>		</ul>
		<li>
If there is a gap of 7 days or more in between the 7 day claiming periods also request evidence for the period directly before the most recent 7 day claiming period<br><strong>For example</strong>, a customer was paid for the periods </li>
			<ul>			<li>
1 to 7 February </li>
			<li>
8 to 14 February </li>
			<li>
1 to 7 March, <strong>and</strong> </li>
			<li>
8 to 14 March<br>They then lodge a fifth claim for 30 March to 5 April<br>Staff would request evidence for the following periods&#58; </li>
			<li>
4 to 31 January</li>
			<li>
15 to 28 February, <strong>and</strong> </li>
			<li>
15 to 29 March</li>		</ul>
		<li>
If there is a gap in between 7 day claiming periods of more than 4 weeks, also request evidence for the 4 weeks before the relevant 7 day claiming period, and the self-isolation, quarantine or caring periods claimed<br><strong>For example</strong>, a customer was paid for the periods </li>
			<ul>			<li>
1 to 7 February</li>
			<li>
8 to 14 February </li>
			<li>
20 to 26 April, <strong>and</strong> </li>

4 to 31 January </li>
			<li>
23 March to 19 April, <strong>and </strong></li>

Evidence they or the person they are caring for have registered for a positive test result for COVID-19 with a health official, for example Services NSW (that is, evidence they have registered a positive result from a home-administered Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) with their state or territory health authority), and</li>
		<li>
For second or subsequent claims, a medical certificate or letter from an appropriate health professional that outlines the customer or the person they are caring for still needs to isolate in the current period claimed because of the effects of COVID-19 </li>

			<ul>			<li>
20 hours or more, the rate of payment is $750 </li>

less than 8 hours, <strong>no</strong> Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment is payable</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Up to the end of the first 7 days</strong> means where a customer is required to self-isolate, quarantine or care for another person for <strong>less than</strong> 7 days.

paid 1 x 7 day payment of $450, as they have lost between 8 and less than 20 hours of work in their 3 day period of self-isolation</li>
