A violent threat</li>

Danger, or </li>
		<li>
An armed person near the building that  poses a threat to people inside</li>

<p><strong>Staff response</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Stay in the work area and wait for further instructions from the ART</li>

Do not go near windows or doors, into any lift foyers, or near the entrance</li>
		<li>

<p><strong>ART response</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Upon identifying or being notified of the incident assess the risk and confirm what response is required</li>
		<li>
Once it is assessed that a Code Grey response is required, make sure that everyone on the site receives  the Code Grey instruction. For multi-tenanted sites, contact the Chief Warden who will tell other tenants as necessary</li>
		<li>
Tell staff to shelter in place and stay away from the windows and doors</li>
		<li>
Arrange for the police to be called if this has not already happened</li>
		<li>
Advise Agency Security as soon as it is safe and practicable to do so</li>
		<li>
Update staff (as appropriate) on the status of the incident</li>

Continually reassess the risk to ensure that Code Grey remains the appropriate response. For multi-tenanted sites keep in contact with the Chief Warden.</li>

<p>Once the threat has been removed, issue an â€˜all clearâ€™ and resume normal site access.</p>

customer with a firearm</li>
			<li>

<p><strong>Staff response</strong></p>

Activate the duress alarm if it is safe to do so</li>

Tell customers to evacuate through the safest exit</li>

If it is safe to do so, move directly to the Code Black assembly area</li>

If it is not safe to evacuate, find a place to hide out of the aggressor's sight </li>
		<li>
Whenever possible, avoid restricting the option to evacuate</li>
		<li>
If staff choose to hide, they may also need to consider options to disrupt or disable the customer if they are located. Any action should only be taken as a last resort, and to protect the life of the individual or others in the area</li>
		<li>
If staff are unable to evacuate or find a place to hide, comply with the aggressor's instructions. Do only as told and nothing more</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>ART response</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Announce a Code Black </li>
		<li>
Once outside, remain vigilant as the aggressor could move to your location. Be aware of the exit points and watch for any threat coming from inside the site</li>
		<li>
Make sure police have been called and wait for them to arrive</li>
		<li>
Make sure all staff and customers are accounted for. Consider contacting staff who are offsite and to tell them about the Code Black</li>
		<li>
Liaise with the police once they arrive</li>
		<li>
Encourage staff and customers to stay in the Code Black assembly area</li>
		<li>
If other customers on the site refuse to move, staff should not remain with them and must move to the Code Black location</li>
		</ul>
<p>For a very serious firearm or active shooter incident, the ART may instruct staff to disperse from the site. If this happens, staff and site leaders should try to contact one another to confirm their location and safety.</p>

<p>In a non-customer facing environment, a Code Black (evacuation) is a response to an extreme threat in the building which could result in serious injury or death, such as a lethal weapon.</p>

<p><strong>Staff response</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Have an evacuation route in mind. Move away from any sounds of violence and evacuate regardless of whether others agree to follow</li>
		<li>
Look for any threat affecting the nearest evacuation route</li>
		<li>
If it is safe to do so, move away from the building towards the Code Black assembly point.</li>

Do not assemble at the fire evacuation assembly points</li>

If it is not safe to evacuate (for example, if the offender is close by) find a place to hide that&#58;</li>

remains out of the offender's line of sight</li>
			<li>
does not restrict your potential escape route</li>
			<li>
provides cover</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Note&#58;</strong> turn mobile phones to silent and turn off the vibration</li>
		<li>
As a last resort, staff should consider options for arming themselves with improvised weapons for defence in the event they are located by the offender</li>
		<li>
If staff are still in the building when the police arrive, staff should&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
follow police instructions</li>
			<li>
avoid quick movements or shouting and keep their hands in clear view. This is to help the police distinguish staff from the offender</li>

Upon identifying or being notified of the incident assess the risk and confirm what response is required</li>

Once it is assessed that a Code Black response is required, make sure that all people on site receive the Code Black instruction. For multi-tenanted sites, contact the Chief Warden/Emergency Control Organisation as soon as possible so that they can tell other tenants in the building</li>

evacuate the building immediately if it is safe to do so, look for any threat that might affect the nearest evacuation route, and move to the Code Black assembly point</li>

<p>If the risk to the site or staff is considered high or imminent, the decision to lock down should not be delayed.</p>

<p>When making the decision to lock the entrance to a site&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
consider if the customer is known to the site and/or has a history of violence</li>
		<li>
consider the immediate location of the customer (if they are close by and are likely to attend)</li>
		<li>
seek advice from a Regional Security Adviser</li>
		<li>
consider if the police know the customer; does the customer own firearms or do the police think the threat is imminent</li>
		</ul>
<p>A site entrance should not be locked if the customer is inside.</p>

<p>In customer facing sites, signage should be displayed at the main entrance advising customers that the site is closed. Service Centre should contact their Operations Management Team for the approved signage.</p>

<p>If a site is closed due to a safety or security incident, normal business continuity and escalation procedures should be followed, in line with the Escalation Policy and using the escalation template on the Escalation Coordination team page. <a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-07020000-05.html">Resources</a> has a link.</p>
