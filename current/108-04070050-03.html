<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> until a system release is available, the following workaround coding <strong>must be</strong> followed to ensure the proceeds of sale are assessed correctly for residential care assessments.</p>

<p>The amount of the primary sale proceeds that the customer intends to use to purchase, build, rebuild, renovate or repair a new primary residence must <strong>not</strong> be recorded as an asset. The deemed income from this amount needs to be assessed at the lower deeming rate only. To do this, the deemed income must be calculated and recorded manually.</p>

<p><strong>Manual calculation for the deemed income for pensioners, allowees with a pensioner partner or single allowee customers&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
(Intended amount for the new primary residence invested in financial assets) x 0.0025</li>
		<li>
If the customer is partnered, the result must be divided by 2 and the result coded individually on the customer and partner’s records.</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Manual calculation for the deemed income for allowee customers without a pension partner&#58;</strong></p>

<p>Income will need to be split according to the ownership percentage of the financial asset that the funds are invested in.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
(Intended amount for the new primary residence invested in financial assets) x 0.0025</li>
		<li>
Divide the result by the customer and partner’s advised ownership of the funds. EG, if the sale amount intended for the new home is $400,000, the customer advises that they own $300,000 and the partner owns $100,000, their deemed income must be calculated on their share.</li>
		<li>
If the asset is owned 100% by one member of a couple, then all income will be attributed to the owner of the asset.</li>
		</ul>
<p>Refer to the Resources page for a deeming calculator.</p>

<p>The annual deemed income amount must be recorded on the <strong>OINS</strong> screen for the customer, and partner if applicable.</p>

<p>Go to the <strong>OIN</strong> screen, complete the fields as follows</p>

<p>Does the customer intend to use the <strong>entire sale proceeds amount</strong> for their new primary residence?</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes&#58;</strong></li>
		<li>
ask the customer to supply details of where the funds have been placed. If the funds are in a bank account, they can advise verbally. If the customer has invested the funds in another asset, they will need to supply <strong>documentation to verify the update</strong> (for example&#58; share statements, income stream schedule, managed investment statement). For couples, ascertain what portion of the intended amount each person has invested.</li>
		<li>
Issue a Request for Information (RFI) letter, if required</li>
