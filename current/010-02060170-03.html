<P>From 1 January 2019, a secondary school student may be approved for away from home entitlements on the basis of being offered a Boarding School scholarship. To be eligible <STRONG>all</STRONG> the following circumstances must be met:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the school is an approved secondary school offering an approved course of secondary studies, and</LI>
<LI>the boarding arrangement is an integral part of the school, and</LI>
<LI>the amount the school contributes towards the scholarship covers, the greater of either:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>the <A href="../utils/RatesChart/rateschart.html" target=_blank>Boarding School Scholarship Approval Threshold</A> amount, or</LI>
<LI>25% of the school’s annual boarding school and tuition fees </LI></UL></UL>
<P>The school must contribute a financial value of:</P>
<UL>
<LI>at least 25% of their charges where:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>25% of the total board and tuition charge is greater than the <A href="../utils/RatesChart/rateschart.html" target=_blank>Boarding School Scholarship Approval Threshold</A> amount</LI></UL>
<LI>at least the Boarding School Scholarship Approval Threshold amount, where</LI>
<UL>
<LI>the <A href="../utils/RatesChart/rateschart.html" target=_blank>Boarding School Scholarship Approval Threshold</A> amount is greater than 25% of the total board and tuition charge</LI></UL></UL>
<P>See the <A href="../students-and-trainees/010-02060170-05.html">Resources</A> page for examples.</P>
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> the minimum <A href="../utils/RatesChart/rateschart.html" target=_blank>Boarding School Scholarship Approval Threshold</A> amount increases each year in line with CPI. Similarly, a Scholarship Contribution Amount based on 25% of a school’s annual boarding and tuition fees may increase if the school increases the fees. In order to approve a Boarding School Scholarship offered in second and subsequent years, the value of the Scholarship Contribution Amount must continue to meet the scholarship financial contribution requirements. See the <A href="../students-and-trainees/010-02060170-05.html">Resources</A> page for examples.</P>
<P>To calculate which financial contribution requirement is the greater amount:</P>
<UL>
<LI>add the combined total of a school’s board and tuition charges in the year of approval, and</LI>
<LI>divide by 4 to identify 25% of the total charges</LI></UL>
<P>Has the student been granted an approved Boarding School scholarship?</P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Yes</STRONG>, the student is approved for away from home payments. <A href="../students-and-trainees/010-02060170-03.html#bp03_tbl_Assessing_schol_Step05">Go to Step 5</A></LI>

<DIV class=showcont>
<P>Once a Boarding School scholarship is approved in the first year of grant for a student, ongoing eligibility will require the school to continue to contribute to the student’s scholarship under the specific financial contribution criteria that the scholarship was originally approved.</P>
<P>This means a school cannot swap between the financial contribution criteria (minimum <A href="../utils/RatesChart/rateschart.html" target=_blank>Boarding School Scholarship Approval Threshold</A> amount or 25%) after the initial grant for a student, even in circumstances where a change in board or tuition charges at the school affects which criteria may be approved for other new students.</P>
<P>Over time, a school may in fact offer scholarships under either criteria to different students, as long as the grant meets the financial contribution requirements for each individual case.</P>

<P>Students approved for ABSTUDY away from home payments on the basis of accepting an IBS scholarship before 1 January 2019 retain approval for away from home payments. Students are grandfathered for as long as they continue at the same school and continue to meet the criteria under which the IBS scholarship was originally approved (pre 1 January 2019 rules). From 1 January 2019, the scholarship is not required to continue to meet the Indigenous Education Consultative Board criteria.</P>
<P><STRONG>Note: </STRONG>grandfathering provisions do not apply to the Third Party Indigenous Scholarships or Transition School scholarships.</P>
<P>However, if a holder of a grandfathered IBS scholarship does have a break in study, in exceptional circumstances the student can retain the grandfathered status for up to 2 years from the date the student discontinued study.</P>
<P>A beneficial approach is to be taken to assessing whether exceptional circumstances led to the student discontinuing. See <A href="../students-and-trainees/010-02060170-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Scenarios_01">Resources</A> for examples of grandfathered scholarships.</P>

<P>Boarding School scholarships have a mandatory requirement for a school to make a financial contribution to the scholarship for approval of away from home payments.</P>
<P>Many Third Party Indigenous Scholarships, and Transition School Scholarships can also contain a school or provider contribution towards a scholarship’s value; usually as a waiver or reduction in student fees or boarding or lodging costs.</P>
<P>The actual dollar amount of the school financial contribution for the scholarship must be determined and coded at the <STRONG>Scholarship Contribution Amount </STRONG>field on the School Fee and Boarding Detail (<STRONG>EYSB</STRONG>) screen. Code the school or provider contribution amount to the scholarship for each year of the scholarship.</P>
<P>Record details of the particular scholarship on a Display on Access (DOA) DOC using the ABSTUDY Scholarship Information fast note: </P>
<UL>
<LI>select <STRONG>Auto text &gt; Students, ABSTUDY and Apprentices</STRONG> &gt; <STRONG>Update</STRONG> &gt; <STRONG>ABSTUDY Scholarship Information </STRONG></LI>
<LI>select the <STRONG>Display on access</STRONG> tick box, then select <STRONG>Confirm</STRONG></LI>
<LI>the <STRONG>Expiry Date</STRONG> field will default to a date 1 year in the future. If the period covered by the scholarship is known, record an expiry date. If not, leave the Expiry Date field blank</LI>
<LI>there is an automatic review with a due date of 365 days to update scholarship details each year, where:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>the <STRONG>Expiry Date</STRONG> field is blank, or </LI>
<LI>the expiry date is more than 1 year in the future</LI></UL></UL>
<P>In circumstances where a scholarship contains a Scholarship Contribution Amount that waives or reduces their student fees or boarding and lodging costs, the <STRONG>Annual Fees/Tuition Amount</STRONG> and <STRONG>Annual Boarding School/Hostel Amount</STRONG> fields on the <STRONG>EYSB</STRONG> screen must be coded correctly.</P>
<P>See <A href="../students-and-trainees/010-07030070-01.html">Assessing scholarship income</A> for correct coding of board and tuition amounts for students in receipt of a scholarship.</P>
<P>Additional information will also need to be coded on the student's record. See <A href="../students-and-trainees/010-02060030-01.html">Coding away from home rate for ABSTUDY</A>.</P></DIV>
