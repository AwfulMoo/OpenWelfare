<p>A claim or activity must be checked to determine if it can be processed or if further information is needed. This is known as 'streaming'. Streaming includes checking if scanned documents have been provided to support the claim or activity and forms have been signed appropriately. If all required information and/or documents are available then processing can be completed, see <a href="../families/007-17022800-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Processing_a_st">Table 2</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> any claims or activities that require further information are to be placed on hold with sufficient information in the progress <strong>DOC/Note</strong>. When they are 'due' they will be allocated to a Service Officer with the relevant skill tag to be actioned.</p>

<p>If more information is required to make a care decision, all affected parties must be contacted and information obtained/confirmed verbally if possible.</p>

If a customer is<strong> verbally advising a change</strong> in shared care (by phone or at a service centre) or if a <strong>work item is allocated</strong> for processing, make one genuine attempt to contact the other carer unless an exception applies and it is deemed inappropriate or unnecessary to contact</li>
		<li>
When the customer and/or the other carer <strong>cannot be contacted verbally, or disagrees</strong> with the advised care arrangement</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Use the Child - Change in Care Arrangements script to issue requests for evidence of care to each party. This script produces a <strong>DOC</strong> on the customer's record</li>

Keywords '<strong>SHARED</strong>' or '<strong>COCARE</strong>' should be added to all shared care and change of care claims and activities to ensure they are allocated correctly in WLM. Online claims where the customer indicates there is a shared care arrangement and reassessments with the source code <strong>FA012</strong> will automatically have the '<strong>SHARED</strong>' keyword attached to the activity</li>

<p>Using the Child Change in Care Arrangements script</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Select the correct letter code (Q810). If the customer also receives an income support payment (ISP), ensure the <strong>FTB and ISP</strong> radio box is selected within the Q810</li>
		<li>
Ensure the correct child names are listed</li>
		<li>
Select the correct <strong>contact made by</strong> option - <strong>Customer</strong> or <strong>Other party</strong> depending on who the letter is being sent to. This ensures the content is correct</li>
		<li>
Select forms or documents to be enclosed (FA012, Calendar etc.) <strong>Note&#58;</strong> there is an issue with the script when the <strong>None</strong> option is chosen for the <strong>Enclosures</strong> section. This option documents that no information is required from the customer and is creating confusion. Pause the script or annotate the <strong>DOC</strong> to tell other Service Officers what has been requested from the customer. For example, 'Customer has been requested to provide evidence of care'</li>
		<li>
The Details of your child's care arrangements (FA012) form should generally only be sent if shared care information has not been provided within the claim, verbally or in writing. See <a href="../families/007-07040070-01.html">Change of care for FTB</a> </li>
		<li>
If forms are to be enclosed the letter print job must be cancelled on the <strong>HS</strong> screen and changed to local print</li>
		<li>
Once the letter is printed locally, all listed forms/documents must be enclosed along with a reply paid envelope</li>
		<li>
If sending multiple letters, for example <a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-04080010-03.html">Request Documents</a>  is also being issued requesting other information for the claim, letters should be printed locally and sent in the same envelope so the customer receives all requests for information together</li>		</ul>

<p>Use the following tips to minimise errors and rework&#58;</p>

<p><strong>In Customer First</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Complete in order all guided procedures within the claim activity. There are very limited reasons to set any of these guided procedures to <strong>Not required</strong>. Examples are outlined in <a href="../families/007-17100603-01.html">Processing standalone and combined claims for family assistance and/or Paid Parental Leave scheme payments</a></li>
		<li>
Do not set the <strong>Finalise claim </strong>guided procedure to <strong>Not Required</strong>. Only once this has been run will provisional data be loaded into the new claim (NCL) activity</li>
		<li>
Do not exit the claim activity to manually code data into the new claim activity. If there is a valid reason for additional manual coding in the new claim activity, do this after completing the <strong>Finalise Claim</strong> guided procedure but before finalising the activity via the Activity Results (<strong>AR</strong>) screen</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>In Process Direct</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
For PPL and DAP standalone claims - if the customer provides additional information when processing a claim, it can be updated manually on the relevant screen with the claim activity</li>
		<li>
Do not exit the claim activity to manually code data outside the new claim activity in Process Direct. If there is a valid reason for additional coding outside the new claim activity, this is to be completed in Customer First following the relevant process outlined in Operational Blueprint</li>
		<li>
For CCS/ACCS, claims must be selected from the Process Direct Inbox. Do not select the claim from the <strong>Transactions</strong> page in <strong>Customer Summary</strong> of Process Direct. Failure to select claims from the<strong> Inbox</strong> can result in errors and incorrect assessment of CCS</li>

<p>The customer should be contacted by phone in these specific circumstances&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If a customer is claiming Family Tax Benefit (FTB) as a lump sum and their income indicates potential entitlement to FTB for the current financial year, discuss with the customer the advantages of claiming as a current zero rate (CZR) customer</li>
		<li>
If the claim outcome is an unfavourable decision or is not a result the customer is expecting, make genuine attempts to contact the customer to explain the decision. See <a href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/109-03010000-01.html">Advising verbally of an unfavourable decision (CLK)</a>. <strong>DOC</strong> these attempts on the customer's record. The customer can provide further information that may result in the decision being changed. This can reduce additional contacts and possible escalation through the formal review process. If the decision is unchanged, advise the customer of their <a href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/109-03000000-01.html">appeal and review rights</a></li>
		<li>
If it is identified the customer may be eligible for another payment or that another payment would be more appropriate for the customer due to a change in circumstances. For example, benefit transfer from JobSeeker Payment (JSP) to Parenting Payment (PP). For more information, see <a href="../families/007-17022800-03.html#bp03_tbl_Final_records_checks_1">Table 4</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>When successful contact has occurred, advise the customer&#58;</p>

rate of payment (including arrears &amp;/or overpayment)</li>
		<li>
date of effect &amp;/or start date of payment</li>

<p>A thorough check needs to be done to ensure any multiple claims (both online claims and scanned paper claims) are reindexed/regenerated for processing. This includes any Families claims in Process Direct held awaiting the finalisation of the legacy claim in Customer First.</p>

<p>Service Officers must finalise any claims they have been trained in. If any multiple claims cannot be finalised, ensure these claims are re-indexed or unheld after all actionable claims are finalised and/or streamed accordingly. It is crucial that all held families claims in Process Direct are checked to see if they can be actioned to ensure delays in customer outcomes are kept to a minimum.</p>

<p>If the customer has already claimed or received a families payment for the same period and the claim is not adding children, then any additional claims must be made not effective.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> some activities such as ripples may not show immediately on a customer record.

Further, linked records (particularly for shared care claims) need to be checked to ensure relevant ripples are completed.</p>

<p>To force triggered ripples to display&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Go to the Trans/Trigger List (<strong>TTL</strong>) screen via <strong>Nxt&#58;</strong> field</li>
		<li>
Key '<strong>R</strong>' beside the outstanding RIP activity - then exit the record for one minute to wait for the ripple to display</li>

<p>Service Officers can directly refer to a NIRO in the following circumstances&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Record is impacted by a known system issue and an approved resource (NNU, Operational Blueprint etc.) advises that ICT referral is required. These referrals should be made using the 'FCC Direct Known Issue' ICT Referral Request webform</li>

Where it has been identified that a mutual Centrelink and Child Support customer may be impacted by the P24845 step-parent claimant issue, these referrals should be made using the 'P24845 Workaround Request' webform</li>
		</ul>
<p>After checking for resolutions or approved workarounds using relevant resources (NNU, Operational Blueprint, mySupport, NIRO Current Issues page) the Service Officer must refer the case to a Service Support Officer (SSO) (unless a known system issue is impacting) in accordance with existing escalation protocols. Where required, the SSO will then escalate to a NIRO.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the NIRO process <strong>does not</strong> apply to claims processed in Process Direct, as well as Families non-new claim (NNCL) activities, unless otherwise specified. </p>

<p>Known system issues (not including the P24845 step parent claimant issue) can be referred by a Service Officer directly to the NIRO via the 'FCC Direct (Known Issue) ICT Referral Request webform.</p>

<p>For any unknown system issue impacting customer outcomes, the SSO will complete the ICT Referral Request form on the Service Officer's behalf and send an email confirming that the ICT referral has been made.</p>

<p>Notes on the Activity List (<strong>AL</strong>) screen are to include 'referred to FCC NIRO (date), see Progress/ICT Referral doc.'</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if reporting a known issue, include the error code PXXXXX or NNU reference number. If a BUG Error is being reported, include the BUG error code.</p>
