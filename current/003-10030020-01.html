<p>This document explains when and how to deliver immediate payments to customers via an EBT card if an urgent payment is approved. The preferred way to pay customers is into their account by the New Payments Platform (NPP), Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) or Direct Credit.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Preferred_metho">Preferred method</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Having funds deposited directly into a nominated account is more secure and safer for customers. It is the expected way to pay customers (rather than EBTs which should only be a one off, not a regular way to receive payment).</p>

<p><a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-18092746-01.html">NPP</a> enables immediate delivery of payments to customers. Customers will also have the flexibility to access the funds as they need, rather than withdrawing the full amount at an ATM in one transaction.</p>

<p>The <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-10030020-05.html#bp05_L2GT_List_of_financi">Resources</a> page has a list of financial institutions that accept NPP payments.</p>

<p>EBT cards&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
are only to be issued to customers to meet their immediate needs</li>
		<li>
are only payable in multiples of $20 or $50. To ensure the customer can withdraw the full amount from an ATM, do not pay amounts such as $10 or $30, and</li>
		<li>
allow immediate access to cash via the ATM network. If card is lost, any funds withdrawn by a third party are not recoverable.</li>

<p>Most social security pensions and benefits can be paid early when the customer is in severe financial hardship due to exceptional and unforeseen circumstances. An urgent payment can also be made if the customer is in financial hardship due to Centrelink delay or needs help with the expenses related to a funeral.</p>

<p>Family Tax Benefit (FTB) and one-off payments of a significant amount are an example of payments that <strong>cannot</strong> be paid as an urgent payment. Other payment types may be ineligible for an urgent payment.</p>

<p>To determine if the customer is eligible for an urgent payment, see&#58;</p>

		</ul>
<p>If the customer has been assessed and is entitled to an immediate payment, the preferred method of payment is by direct credit, <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-18092746-01.html">NPP</a> or <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-10030040-01.html">RTGS</a> paid directly into the customer's account. This enables the full entitlement amount to be delivered directly to the customer.</p>

<p>In limited circumstances an EBT card can be issued to give the customer access to cash to meet their immediate needs. For urgent payments due to exceptional, unforeseen or extraordinary circumstances, EBT cards can only have a maximum of $200 loaded onto the card. Amounts over $200 should only be paid for situations such as an <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-17040700-01.html">urgent payment due to Centrelink delay</a>.</p>

		<li>
The customer is in the process of getting a bank account. See <a href="../payment-delivery/103-04030000-01.html">Payment destination</a> for what the customer needs to do. EBT cards <strong>must not</strong> be used ongoing in place of a bank account</li>
		<li>
A fee may be charged to get the RTGS payment. Services Australia no longer has access to this information. The customer may need to confirm this with their financial institution</li>
		<li>
The customer's bank account is overdrawn. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> customers should still be able to access at least 90% of their income support payment when sent to an overdrawn account. See <a href="../payment-delivery/103-04050000-01.html">Protection of customer payments</a> for more information</li>
		<li>
For payments other than CrP and disaster assistance. If the customer has not had a regular payment into the account, do not use NPP or RTGS. For example, when reissuing a returned payment or if the customer advised new account details. Use NPP and RTGS only when Services Australia has already issued a regular payment to the account</li>

<p>Make sure the customer record is the correct one by asking authentication questions to verify Proof of Record Ownership (PORO) before assessing or issuing, an immediate payment. See <a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-04110000-01.html">Authenticating a Centrelink customer</a> for a detailed process.</p>

<p>If the customer contacts in person, it is preferable the customer also gives identity documents including 1 photo identity document for a manual-visual comparison. If this is not available and the Service Officer is in doubt they are speaking with the customer, they must ask more authentication questions. Authentication questions must not be limited to details a customer's friends and relatives are aware of such as the customer's date of birth or how many children are in the family. The questions must be searching, but must not be so personal as to be intrusive. If appropriate, it is important to explain to the customer why they are being ask these questions.</p>

<p>If the Service Officer is in doubt they are speaking to the customer, information must not be released and the immediate payment application must be verbally denied.</p>
