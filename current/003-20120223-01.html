<p>To provide a one-off grant payment in the 2020-21 financial year to help travel agents and tour arrangement service providers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic who qualify for the JobKeeper scheme so they can continue to&#58;</p>

a reduction in income, and</li>
		<li>
an increase in consumer refunds as a result of a reduction in international travel</li>

<h2 id="_Toc344898764">How to claim</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Applicants can claim online, on behalf of a business that is a travel agent or tour arrangement service provider. Applicants <strong>cannot</strong> submit a claim over the phone. There is no paper claim form.</p>

<p><strong>Applicants can only claim if they are an ‘eligible associate’ of the business on the Australian Business Register (ABR). </strong></p>

<p>Applicants must read the <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-20120223-05.html#bp05_L2GT_GrantConnect_we">grant guidelines</a> before submitting a claim. </p>

<p>Applicants&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
can access the grant guidelines from the <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-20120223-05.html#bp05_L2GT_GrantConnect_we">GrantConnect</a> website</li>
			<ul>			<li>
can only view the full grant guidelines document by selecting <strong>Go Documents</strong> from the COVID-19 Consumer TSP page. The grant opportunity ID is <strong>GO4562</strong></li>
			<li>
who are not already registered users with GrantConnect will need to set up a new registration to access the guidelines. The Services Australia website also has a link to the GrantConnect website</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>To claim, applicants must, in <a href="../self-service/133-02130000-01.html">Provider Digital Access (PRODA)</a>&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
log onto their personal account <strong>or</strong> register a personal account in their name </li>
		<li>
register the business (if this has not been done before)</li>
		<li>
link the business to <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-20040231-03.html">Business Hub</a> as a Service Provider (if this has not been done before)</li>
		<li>
access the Business Hub</li>
		</ul>
<p>Once the applicant is in Business Hub, they will need to select ‘Apply for Service’ from the landing page. The applicant can then start a claim for the COVID-19 Consumer TSP December 2020 using Business Hub.</p>

<p>If the applicant has problems&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
creating a PRODA account, they can call the PRODA helpdesk</li>
		<li>
with loading the business’ online claim in Business Hub, see the <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-20120223-05.html#bp05_L3TT_Business_Hub_he">Business Hub help</a> table</li>
		</ul>
<p>See the <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-20120223-05.html">Resources</a> page for links that applicants can access from the Services Australia website for&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
PRODA </li>
		<li>
user guides, including ‘How to register your Organisation for Business Hub</li>
		</ul>
<p>Applicants can also search ‘PRODA’ and ‘Business Hub’ using the Services Australia website search function.</p>

<p>The <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-20120223-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Applicant_view_">Resources</a> page has screen shots of the applicant’s view of the online claim.</p>

<p>During the online claim process&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Applicants can make a self-declaration in relation to a business’ annual GST turnover amount if the business</li>
			<ul>			<li>
is <strong>not registered</strong> for GST, <strong>and</strong></li>
			<li>
had a turnover of <strong>less than $75,000</strong> in the 2019 calendar year</li>		</ul>
		<li>
All applicants, regardless of the business’ annual GST turnover, will</li>
			<ul>			<li>
be asked to confirm their business is either a travel agent or tour arrangement service provider, <strong>and</strong></li>
			<li>
need to provide other supporting evidence to support this, see <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-20120223-01.html#bp01_L2GT_Eligibility_req01">Eligibility requirements</a></li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>When an applicant completes the <strong>Review and Hold</strong> step of their claim, the travel agent or tour arrangement service provider’s Australian Business Number (ABN) will be automatically sent to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). </p>

<p>The ATO will then issue the business with a COVID-19 Consumer Travel Support Program certificate of tax information (ATO certificate). </p>

<p>The certificate is sent by&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
priority postage service to the registered address that is listed for the business’ ABN - this may be the address of the business’ tax agent, or </li>
		<li>
electronically for sole traders who have linked their myGov account to their ATO business record</li>
		</ul>
<p>Applicants cannot submit a claim until they have this certificate. When they get it, they must&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
log back into Business Hub</li>
		<li>
go to the document upload step in their claim</li>
		<li>
upload their certificate and any supporting documents</li>
		</ul>
<p>The claim will then be allocated to processing staff to review and finalise.</p>

<p>There is a scaled payment approach based on the business’ annual Goods and Services Tax (GST) turnover  in the <strong>2019 calendar year&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
A one off <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-20120223-01.html#bp01_L2GT_Taxable_payment">taxable payment</a> of $1,500 for a minimum annual turnover of $50,000 up to $99,999, with </li>
		<li>
An additional $2,500 per every $1 to $100,000 increase in annual turnover, starting from an annual turnover amount of $100,000</li>
		<li>
The maximum payment is $100,000 for businesses with a turnover of up to $20 million</li>
		</ul>
<p>All claims for businesses with a GST turnover amount of over $20 million in the 2019 calendar year (or for annual BAS reporters, in the 2018-19 Financial Year) will be escalated to Austrade as an <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-20120223-01.html#bp01_L2GT_Exceptional_cir">Exceptional Circumstance</a> Review. </p>

		<ul>		<li>
eligibility</li>
		<li>
the GST turnover amount to be used to calculate grant entitlement, and</li>
		<li>
the grant amount</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>When processing a claim&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
the system will calculate the business’ payment rate once the ‘calculate’ button is selected</li>
		<li>
for businesses that&#58; </li>
			<ul>			<li>
<strong>need to lodge Business Activity Statements (BAS)</strong>, the business’ turnover amount is as per the ATO certificate to the applicant from the Australian Taxation Office. Code this amount when processing a claim to make sure the correct payment is made</li>
			<li>
<strong>do not need to lodge BAS</strong>, the business’ 2019 calendar year GST turnover amount is as per the applicant’s self-declaration in the online claim process. Staff <strong>do not need to</strong> code this amount when processing a claim</li>
