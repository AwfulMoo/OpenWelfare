<p>Before the agency can enter into a contract with a business it should be confirmed that the business is a legal entity. There are various types of business entities. Some require follow up to ensure the agency is entering into a valid contract.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Business_Applic">Business Application (BA)</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A BA is a formal document (contract/agreement) between the agency and a business to participate in or use the various programmes the agency manages.</p>

<p>A BA can be signed by a director of the company or an Authorised Officer. A BA should never be approved without checking the legal entity. The status of the Australian Business Number (<strong>ABN</strong>) should be ‘Current’. If the ABN is de-registered or cancelled, a new BA needs to be lodged under the current ABN. If there has been a change in ABN and the business has multiple programmes, a new BA is required for all programmes.</p>

<p>Some businesses may not have an ABN and only have an Australian Company Number (ACN). The ASIC website should be checked to ensure the status of the ACN is ‘registered’.</p>

<p>If it is determined that the agency is contracted with an incorrect entity (an entity that requires further information), a Correction of Registration letter, should be issued and a new BA obtained.<strong> </strong>This letter is available on the Third Party Programmes Team 'shared drive'.</p>

<p>For Centrepay it may be more appropriate to issue an Intent to withdraw letter which provides 10 business days for the business to lodge a new BA. See <a href="../payment-delivery/103-09010020-01.html">Withdrawing a business's approval to use a deduction and confirmation service</a>.<strong> </strong></p>

<p>The entity name on ABN Lookup/ASIC website search should match the organisation name on our records. The trading name may not be listed on ABN Lookup or ASIC website. If the business has not provided a trading name on their BA, this will need to be confirmed directly with the business. If the trading name is the same as the business name, ensure this is coded. <strong>Note</strong>&#58; <strong>do not</strong> leave the ‘<strong>Organisation Name</strong>’ field and ‘<strong>Trading Name’</strong> field blank.</p>

<p>Ensure ASIC is checked as well as ABN Lookup to confirm a business's ABN/ACN status (current/de-registered/cancelled). See <a href="../payment-delivery/103-19031344-05.html">Resources</a> for a link to websites.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A company is a separate legal entity from its owners/operators. This means the company itself has the same rights as a natural person and can incur debts, sue, and be sued. When a company is approved for a contract/agreement with the agency, the company is responsible for complying with the relevant programme policy and terms.</p>

<p>A company can be incorporated under the&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), or</li>
		<li>
if owned and controlled by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, the Corporations (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander) Act 2006 (Cth). See <a href="../payment-delivery/103-19031344-04.html">References</a> for a link</li>
		</ul>
<p>A company that is controlled by the Commonwealth and incorporated under the Corporations Act is a Commonwealth company. There are a variety of company structures, indicated by the ending of its name (‘Pty Ltd’, just ‘Pty’, or just ‘Ltd’, or ‘NL’).</p>

<p>Where a company has both an Australian Business Number (<strong>ABN</strong>) and an Australian Company Number (<strong>ACN</strong>), record both on the Business Record. See Australian Business Number (ABN) and other entities.</p>

<p><strong>Who signs the Business Application?</strong></p>

<p>The Business Application (<strong>BA</strong>) can be signed by a director of the company or an Authorised Officer.</p>

<p>The Second Authorised Officer signature can be left blank only if the company’s only Director who is also the only company Secretary signed the BA. Otherwise&#58;</p>

an Authorised Officer can sign </li>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A sole trader is a business owned and run by an individual. There is no legal distinction between the owner and the business. The business owner is legally responsible for all aspects of the business, which means that the person can sue and be sued in their name, and will be liable for debts of the business. Search for a sole trader formally using the person’s name, for example, John Adam Smith. </p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> a sole trader is required to have an Australian Business Number (<strong>ABN</strong>) to be approved for any programme unless its only business is the supply of residential premises as a private landlord.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Incorporated_as">Incorporated associations </h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>An incorporated association has the same characteristics as a company but is incorporated under state/territory legislation rather than the Corporations Act. Like companies, it can sue and be sued in its corporate name and will survive even if its members die or resign. Local charities and recreational/cultural groups that only operate within one state/territory often choose to incorporate this way because it is simpler.</p>

<p>Where an incorporated association is a charity, it may also be registered with the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (<strong>ACNC</strong>), see <a href="../payment-delivery/103-19031344-05.html">Resources</a> for a link. The ACNC register contains useful information about registered charities, including its governing documents and responsible persons.</p>

<p>Australian Business Number (<strong>ABN</strong>) lookup often labels an incorporated association as an Other Incorporated Entity. Refer to incorporated associations formally using their full name and ABN. </p>

<p><strong>Who signs the Business Application?</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
The Business Application (<strong>BA</strong>) must be signed by a person responsible for the association, being the Public Officer or Secretary of the incorporated association, or an Authorised Officer. If it is a charity registered with the ACNC, a person listed on the ACNC register as a responsible person is acceptable. A manager in the relevant part of the business is also generally acceptable as an Authorised Officer</li>

The Second Authorised Officer can be left blank</li>

<p><strong>What is a Co-operative</strong></p>

<p>A Co-operative is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a democratic organisation, owned and controlled by its members for a common benefit</li>
		<li>
governed by the Co-operatives National law and are registered/established under state/territory legislation. Given that Co-operatives are established under a national law, they have the capacity to enter into contracts and undertake business activities across Australia</li>
		<li>
able to sue and be sued in its corporate name and has legal capacity as an individual. </li>
		</ul>
<p>When incorporated, a co-operative is required to be registered with the regulator in its relevant state or territory, as applicable, and will be issued with a certificate of registration. The relevant regulator will have a record of all registered Co-operatives. For example, Consumer Affairs Victoria maintains a public register of Co-operatives and limited partnerships.</p>

<p>The registered name of a co-operative always includes the word 'Co-operative', ‘Co-op’ or 'Coop’ and ends with ‘Limited’ or ‘Ltd’.</p>

<p>ABN LookUp often&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
labels an incorporated association as an ‘Other Incorporated Entity’</li>
		<li>
refers to co-operatives formally using its full name</li>
		</ul>
<p>In addition an ASIC search will&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
record them as 'Associations' </li>
		<li>
demonstrate whether the co-operative is registered and who the regulator is that governs their activities. </li>
		</ul>
<p>Where a co-operative has more than one officer, execution of documents on behalf of a co-operative may be completed by&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
two directors, or </li>
		<li>
one director and company secretary, or</li>
		<li>
by an authorised agent of the co-operative. An authorised agent will be treated as an authorised person for the purposes of the form. </li>
		</ul>
<p>In addition, a cooperative may also execute contracts by affixing its common seal. When a co-operative is approved for a program, it is responsible for complying with the relevant program policy and terms.</p>

<p><strong>How should a co-operative sign a BA</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Authorised officer can be signed by&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
a director and secretary of the co-operative, or</li>
			<li>
an ‘authorised agent’ who will be treated as an ‘Authorised Officer’ for the purposes of the form (see below for how to decide if a person is authorised)</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Second authorised officer can be signed by another ‘authorised officer’ of the co-operative (see below for how to decide if a person is authorised)</li>
		<li>
Witness can be any adult of sound mind, who can be an employee of the business but not an office holder</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Who is an authorised officer</strong></p>

<p>An agent&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
may enter into contract on behalf of a co-operative by exercising an express or implied authority to enter into contracts on behalf of a co-operative</li>
		<li>
can exercise its power without using a common seal (refer to section 50 Co-operatives (Adoption of National Law) Act 2012))</li>
		<li>
will be treated as an 'authorised person' for the purposes of the BA </li>

<p><strong>Corporate vs Non-Corporate Commonwealth Entities</strong></p>

<p>A corporate Commonwealth entity (<strong>CCE</strong>) is a body corporate that is both legally and financially separate from the Commonwealth, and a non-corporate Commonwealth entity (<strong>NCCE</strong>) is not a body corporate because NCCEs are a part of the Commonwealth, both legally and financially.</p>

<p>The agency is an NCCE. The Australian War Memorial is an example of a CCE. A full list of Commonwealth entities can be found on the Department of Finance site, see <a href="../payment-delivery/103-19031344-05.html">Resources</a> for a link.</p>

<p>Public schools and hospitals are usually a part of the relevant State or Territory government, although some are incorporated under a specific piece of legislation (e.g. hospitals incorporated under the Health Care Act 2008 (SA)). </p>

<p>If the business is incorporated under an Act or specific piece of legislation, these businesses usually have a body corporate/board of trustees/board of the agency. </p>

<p><strong>Who signs the Business Application?</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
The Business Application must be signed by a member of the board/body corporate , or an Authorised Officer</li>
		<li>
The Second Authorised Officer can be left blank or signed by another ‘authorised officer’ depending on the preferences of the public school or hospital</li>
		<li>
The Witness can be any adult of sound mind, who can be an employee of the public school or hospital</li>

<p><strong>Unincorporated entities </strong></p>

<p>If a business is not incorporated that does not automatically make it an unincorporated association, and not all entities marked as Other Unincorporated Entity on Australian Business Number (<strong>ABN</strong>) Lookup are unincorporated associations. Contrary to the ordinary meaning of these words&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
unincorporated association</li>
		<li>
an entity that is not incorporated </li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>mean different things</strong>. Not all unincorporated entities are unincorporated associations. See <a href="../payment-delivery/103-19031344-05.html">Resources</a> for examples.</p>

<p><strong>Who signs the Business Application?</strong></p>

<p>A signature from the head of the relevant part of the organisation is generally acceptable as an Authorised Officer for a Business Application (BA). <strong>If you are unsure</strong>, ask the organisation for more information about the person's role in the organisation. </p>
		<ul>		<li>
The BA must be signed by an Authorised Officer</li>
		<li>
Second Authorised Officer can be left blank or signed by another Authorised Officer depending on the preferences of the organisation</li>
		<li>
The Witness can be any adult of sound mind, who can be an employee of the organisation</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Unincorporated Associations</strong></p>

<p>Unincorporated associations are a number of people grouped together by a common purpose with club-like characteristics, for example, a sporting club, social club or trade union. </p>

<p>An unincorporated association cannot enter into contracts in its own name because it is not a legal entity. Instead an individual member needs to accept personal responsibility and liability for the association and needs to provide an individual undertaking. </p>

<p><strong>Who signs the Business Application?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Individual Undertaking&#58;</strong></p>

<p>An individual undertaking is required for an unincorporated association to contract with the agency. The person who signs the individual undertaking enters into the contract in their personal capacity as a representative of the business and becomes liable. If this person changes, a new Business Application (<strong>BA</strong>) needs to be signed.</p>

<p>The Second Authorised Officer can be left blank or signed by another Authorised Officer depending on the preferences of the unincorporated association.</p>

<p>The Witness can be any adult of sound mind, who can be an employee or volunteer of the business but not an office holder.</p>

<p>Other options available for unincorporated entities where an individual undertaking may not be obtainable are&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
For the Third Party Organisation (TPO) to register as an incorporated entity</li>
		<li>
If there is an associated trust, a trustee can lodge an application on behalf of the trust</li>
		<li>
An unincorporated entity can explore having an overarching legal entity take responsibility - such as an umbrella business</li>
		<li>
For Indigenous Businesses check the Office of the Registrar of Indigenous Corporations website. See Resources for a link. Some Indigenous Businesses may be registered under the Corporations (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander) Act (CATSI Act)</li>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Trusts">Trusts and Self-Managed funds</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The agency cannot enter into contracts with Trusts (a trust is not a legal entity). The Trustee of the Trust needs to be established and can be an individual or a company. A contract may be entered into with the trustee on behalf of the trust as long as the trustee is a valid legal entity itself. A trust may have more than one trustee.</p>

<p>Trustees operate the business on behalf of trusts and are also liable for debts of the trust. If the trustee incurs liabilities in the proper exercise of its power, it is entitled to be indemnified out of the assets of the trust.</p>

<p>A trust may have more than one trustee. Trustees are responsible for managing the affairs of the trust and they hold property for the benefit of others (referred to as ‘beneficiaries’ of the trust). For example, the Salvation Army is incorporated by acts of Parliament and has a board of trustees. The trustees need to be recorded on a <strong>DOA DOC</strong> and the Business Application (<strong>BA</strong>) should be signed by one of these trustees. </p>

<p><strong>Who signs the Business Application?</strong></p>

<p>The BA must be signed by the trustee (if the trustee is an individual) or an Authorised Officer of the trustee entity (where the trustee is not an individual).</p>

<p>A Second Authorised Officer is required unless the trust has only one individual trustee (who has already signed) or the trust has only one trustee that is an entity that is able to execute documents with only one signature (for example a sole company director or partnership). For these, see <a href="../payment-delivery/103-19031344-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Searching_and_a">Searching and coding legal entity information</a> table.</p>

<p>Otherwise&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
if the trust has more than one individual trustee, it can be signed by another one of the individual trustees</li>
		<li>
if the trust has a trustee that is an entity that normally executes documents with more than one Authorised Officer (for example, a company with multiple directors), the second person who is authorised to sign should sign. See <a href="../payment-delivery/103-19031344-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Searching_and_a">Searching and coding legal entity information</a> table </li>
		<li>
if the trust normally executes formal documents with more than two authorised officers, there is no need to have a third Authorised Officer sign the BA </li>
		<li>
The Witness can be any adult of sound mind, who can be an employee of the trust or of the trustee</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Other Trusts&#58; Self-Managed Superfunds</strong></p>

<p>Self-Managed Superfunds (SMSF) are a way for saving for retirement whereby the members of the SMSF are also the trustees. A SMSF can be established in either of the following ways&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
operated by individuals who are each a trustee of the SMSF (less than 5 members in total) or </li>
		<li>
as a body corporate where each member of the SMSF is a director</li>
		</ul>
<p>When reviewing an application by a SMSF, Service Officers will need to determine whether the SMSF is a group of individuals or a body corporate. This will determine the manner in which the SMSF is required to execute the BA.</p>

<p>The deed or constitution setting up the SMSF may have restrictions on its ability to undertake certain actions. Evidence/confirmation from the SMSF must be provided to make sure they are able to enter into and apply to be an approved business for the purposes of Centrepay. This can be an email from the trustee/director attesting to the business' ability to make the BA. In addition, the agency may request a copy or confirmation of the Registerable Superannuation Entity (RSE) Licence.</p>

<p>The agency may deal with a SMSF in the same way that it deals with a Trust as set out above.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Partnerships01">Partnerships</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The agency can only enter into a contract with a partner of the partnership who has the authority to do so (which depends on the nature of the partner’s partnership). Partners can be individuals, companies or incorporated associations (such as a body corporate). Generally each partner is personally liable for actions or debts for the partnership, however some partners have limited or no authority to act for the entity.</p>

<p><strong>Who signs the Business Application?</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Only one partner needs to sign the Business Application (<strong>BA</strong>) regardless of how many partners make up the partnership</li>
		<li>
If the partner leaves the partnership, the contract/agreement remains valid as the remaining partners assume all rights and obligations under the contract jointly</li>
		<li>
If the partnership dissolves entirely, a new BA is required</li>
		<li>
The Second Authorised Officer can be left blank or signed by another partner (for example if that partnership prefers two partners to sign)</li>
		<li>
The Witness can be any adult of sound mind, who can be an employee of the partnership but not a partner </li>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Other_entities_">Other entities </h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p><strong>Entities established under specific legislation</strong></p>

<p>Not all entities established by legislation are government entities.</p>

<p>Where this is the case seek advice from the business as to how they normally sign official documents. Obtain a copy of the relevant legislation to show who is authorised to sign contracts. Examples of businesses under this structure could be&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Incorporated by Acts of Parliament</li>
		<li>
Constituted by the Aboriginal Lands Rights Act 1983</li>
		<li>
International Organisations (Privileges and Immunities) Act 1963 (Cth)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Aboriginal Land Councils</strong></p>

<p>Each state and territory has its own system of institutions established under state/territory legislation. For example, in NSW each local Aboriginal land council and the head body that manages them (the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council) are all constituted by the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983 (NSW). However, the former are listed on Australian Business Number (ABN) Lookup as Unincorporated while the latter is listed as Incorporated. </p>

<p><strong>Who signs the Business Application?</strong></p>

<p>Their status on ABN Lookup is irrelevant to how they are to sign documents, however, because section 50 of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW) contains special rules about this depending on the land council’s membership&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
if it has 2 or more members&#58; signed by the president, chairperson or other principal officer or by any member of the staff authorised to do so by the president, chairperson or other principal officer</li>
		<li>
if it has only one member&#58; signed by that person or by any member of the staff of the corporation authorised to do so by that person</li>
		<li>
if it has no members&#58; signed by the person for the time being managing its affairs or by any member of the staff authorised to do so by that person</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>International organisations</strong></p>

<p>Some international organisations are declared under the International Organisations (Privileges and Immunities) Act 1963 (Cth). For example, the International Organization for Migration is an international organisation declared under that Act as a body corporate through the International Organization for Migration (Privileges and Immunities) Regulations 1991 (Cth). It is exempt from the liability to pay or collect certain taxes by legislation and therefore excused from having to have an ABN. It is issued with a Withholding Payer Number by the ATO. Many international organisations that operate in Australia are declared under that Act. </p>

<p><strong>Who signs the Business Application?</strong></p>

<p>The Business Application (BA) should be signed in accordance with the relevant legislation. If the relevant legislation is silent on how the entity should sign but does declare the entity as a body corporate, or if the entity is otherwise incorporated, both the Authorised Officer and Second Authorised Officer can be signed by authorised officers.</p>

<p>If the legislated entity is an unincorporated association, the BA will need an individual undertaking. Refer to <a href="../payment-delivery/103-19031344-01.html#bp01_L2GT_Entities_that_r">unincorporated associations</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Religious organisations</strong></p>

<p>Religious organisations utilise a wide variety of entity types. Typically, these include both incorporated and unincorporated entities (some of which may be established under specific legislation), as well as a variety of trusts.</p>

<p>Ascertaining the correct entity type may be difficult and additional information may need to be requested from the applicant. </p>

<p><strong>Who signs the Business Application and how to code</strong></p>

<p>In order to determine how the BA is signed, determine the entity type and see relevant type in the <a href="../payment-delivery/103-19031344-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Searching_and_a">Searching and coding legal entity information</a> table.</p>

<p><strong>Private landlords</strong></p>

<p>A private landlord is not a type of legal entity, it is a concept developed for GST and refers to entities that supply residential premises for rent. While they are usually individual people, that is not always the case. If the private landlord only provides residential premises, it cannot charge or claim for GST and therefore does not need an Australian Business Number (<strong>ABN</strong>). If it does other business, then it may need an ABN. Usually when a private landlord is an individual person, it does not carry on any other business, that is why most private landlords approved for Centrepay are individuals/sole traders and do not have an ABN. </p>

<p><strong>Who signs the Business Application and how to code </strong></p>

<p>In order to determine how the BA is signed, determine the entity type and see relevant type in the <a href="../payment-delivery/103-19031344-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Searching_and_a">Searching and coding legal entity information</a> table.</p>

<p>A <strong>DOA DOC</strong> should be created on the record explaining either what the entity is or that the Private Landlord does not require an ABN.</p>
