<p>As assurees and assurers are all required to complete quarterly reviews, it is important to determine whether contacting the assurer will place the assuree at risk. Check whether there is a social worker <strong>DOC</strong> on the record before discussing anything with the assurer, and whether there is any debt advices suppressed due to family and domestic violence reasons on the Inhibiting Letters (<strong>AOIL</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>For more on what is disclosed during the AoS interview, see <a href="../migrants-refugees-and-visitors/005-03050020-03.html">Assuree makes a claim for an AoS recoverable payment</a>.</p>

<p>Is there a recommendation from a social worker for contact to be delayed, or coding on the <strong>AOIL</strong> screen?</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>, decide if contacting the assurer will put the assuree at risk. If unsure, lodge a request with the National AoS team using the Helpdesk webform. The <a href="../migrants-refugees-and-visitors/005-03060000-05.html">Resources</a> page contains a link to the form. <a href="../migrants-refugees-and-visitors/005-03060000-03.html#bp03_tbl_01_Step06">Go to Step 6</a></li>

<p>When they are first granted an AoS recoverable payment, an automatic letter issues to the assure telling them Services Australia will begin raising an AoS debt for their assurer to repay.</p>

<p>A similar automatic letter issues to the assurer/s, telling them an AoS debt has started accruing for which they are liable to repay. The only time this letter would be delayed is if a social worker advises in a recommendation that this will put the assuree at risk. Additionally, each quarter the assurer/s and assuree are <a href="../migrants-refugees-and-visitors/005-03070000-01.html">issued a review form for completion</a>. Once completed the assurer's AoS debt is updated and a reminder letter is issued advising the assurer the AoS debt is accruing.</p>

<p>Check the History Summary (<strong>HS</strong>) screen for all letters issued.</p>

<p>Has the assurer been advised there is an AoS debt accruing?</p>

Unless otherwise stated, staff may complete this step if they are trained." /></p>

<p>During new claim processing of the assuree's claim, the assurer should have been contacted and advised of their liability. See <a href="../migrants-refugees-and-visitors/005-03050020-01.html">Assuree makes a claim for an AoS recoverable payment</a> for more information.</p>

<p>If the assurer was not contacted prior to the assuree's new claim being processed, and a MOD AR is not coded on the assuree's record, then a <strong>DOC</strong> should be on the record outlining why a decision was made to grant the payment.</p>

<p>If there is no evidence of a MOD AR being issued to the assurer, or of reasonable attempts made to contact the assurer prior to granting the claim, then refer the case to the relevant processing area for follow up. For example, if the assuree was granted Age Pension without any attempts being made to contact the assurer, refer the case back to the Age Pension processing area so they can follow up.</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of the relevant processing area to contact the assurer and advise them of the claim grant, and the subsequent accruing AoS debt that they are liable to repay. If the assuree was granted a jobseeker payment without the assurer being notified, refer the case to the relevant Service Officer who granted the claim.</p>

<p>Use the Locator to find the appropriate processing site. The <a href="../migrants-refugees-and-visitors/005-03060000-05.html">Resources</a> page contains a link.</p>

<p>Only contact the National AoS team if experiencing difficulties with contacting the assurer.</p>

<p>Has the assurer been advised about the AoS debt that has been accruing?</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>, this case needs to be referred to the National AoS team for further action. Send an <strong>ACTDOC</strong> activity to region code 'AOS' for follow up. Procedure ends here.</li>
		<li>
<strong>No</strong>&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
ensure that 2 genuine attempts to contact the assurer have been made and issue a MOD AR before escalating the matter to the National AoS team</li>
			<li>

<p>Once an assuree is granted a recoverable income support payment, and if they still have more than 4 months remaining on their AoS period, an AOS/RR1 quarterly review activity is set up on an AoS case record Future Activity List (<strong>FAL</strong>) screen to mature in 3 months.</p>

<p>This activity counts the time an assuree has been in receipt of a payment. It will have one of the following keywords and activity notes included&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
AOSQTR1&#58; AoS Review 1st Quarter</li>
		<li>

		<li>

		<li>

		</ul>
<p>The cycle will continue again from AOSQTR1 if the AoS arrangement has not expired by the time AOSQTR4 has matured.</p>

<p>For every RR1 activity that is triggered on the AoS case record, a corresponding activity matures on the assuree's record&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
during the first, second and third reviews, an AOS/RR2 activity displays on the assuree's record</li>

<p>An AoS debt cannot be waived on the following grounds&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
That the assurer did not understand their responsibilities in relation to an assuree receiving an AoS recoverable payment</li>
		<li>
Due to administrative error as s1237A of the Social Security Act 1991 only applies where the payment is received by the debtor (assurer). An assurer does not receive the payment so s1237A does not apply. For instance, where an assuree had received an incorrect rate of recoverable payment, due to an administrative error. Although the error was administrative, the payment was made to the assuree rather than the debtor. As such, the debt cannot be waived due to administrative error as the assuree is not the debtor in the AoS case</li>
		</ul>
<p>However, consider waiver of an AoS debt due to special circumstances. The special circumstances may apply to the assurer and/or the assuree</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the debt is finalised and determined, as the AoS has expired, an AoS debt is <a href="../debts/107-05120000-01.html">waived in the same way as other debts</a>. However&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the debt is still protected (and the case is still current), then the AoS Processing team can only reduce the debt amount by the waived amount before the recovery occurs</li>
		<li>
If it is determined an amount is to be waived and there has already been recovery action, the amount is to be returned to the assurer. This means that if the bank guarantee has been used to recover all or part of the debt, that amount will be returned</li>		</ul>

<p>For example, the assuree claims fraudulently, the assuree incorrectly declares earnings.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Where a recoverable payment is made to an assuree in accordance with social security law during the AoS period, an AoS debt is raised by the AoS Processing team under section 1227 of the Social Security Act 1991. Liability for repayment of an AoS debt rests with the assurer/s</li>
		<li>
If the assuree is paid an amount to which they are not entitled and it is determined this amount is a legally recoverable debt, the debt is raised against the assuree under the relevant legislation (for example, S1223 Social Security Act 1991). The assuree, not the assurer, is liable to repay these amounts. Normal debt raising procedures are to be followed, including consideration of non-recovery (for instance, waiver)</li>		</ul>

<p>An explanation of an AoS debt raised from 15 January 2007 should be provided by the National AoS Team.</p>

<p>Check the date the debt was raised via the General Information (<strong>OPGI</strong>) screen. This is to decide who should provide an explanation, the National AoS Team or the Decision Maker (DM).</p>

<p>For debts raised before 15 January 2007, the DM is the staff member who granted the recoverable payment for the assuree. This is because this staff member held the initial responsibility for&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
establishing that the assurer/s was/were unwilling and/or unable to provide support to the assuree, and</li>
		<li>
ensuring that the assurer/s understood the consequences of the assuree being paid a recoverable payment, that is, that the assurer/s will accrue a debt equal to the amount of the recoverable payments made to an assuree during the AoS period</li>
		</ul>
<p>If a customer applies for a formal review of an AoS debt decision, a review will be undertaken by an Authorised Review Officer (ARO).</p>
