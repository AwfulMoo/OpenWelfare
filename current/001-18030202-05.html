<DIV class=showcont>
<P><STRONG>Answer:</STRONG> A demerit is recorded in the Employment Services System (ESS) when a non-compliance event occurs. The demerit may be removed by the provider if the provider determines the job seeker had a valid reason for the non-compliance event.</P>
<P>Demerits are fully managed by the provider. Job seekers who contact Services Australia to enquire about a demerit should be referred to their provider. If the job seeker is in Workforce Australia Online, they should be referred to the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations Digital Services Contact Centre.</P></DIV>

<DIV class=showcont>
<P><STRONG>Answer:</STRONG> Where the job seeker is in the warning zone and accrues 3 demerits, a Capability Interview is conducted by the provider. If the job seeker accrues a fifth demerit, a Capability Assessment is conducted by Services Australia. Job seekers may be fast tracked to the next assessment point after accruing a demerit for a job interview or job referral failure.</P>
<P>The aim of both a Capability Interview and a Capability Assessment is to determine if the job seeker is capable of meeting their current Job/Participation Plan requirements and they understand the consequences of further non-compliance.</P>
<P>If it is determined that the job seeker is capable of meeting their current Job/Participation Plan requirements the outcome of the:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Capability Interview is that the job seeker remains in the warning zone with 3 demerits accrued</LI>
<LI>Capability Assessment is that the job seeker transitions to the financial penalty zone</LI></UL>
<P>In either assessment, if it is determined that the job seeker is not capable of meeting their current compulsory requirements, then the demerits are removed, the job seeker returns to the green zone and the provider renegotiates their Job/Participation Plan.</P></DIV>

<DIV class=showcont>
<P><STRONG>Answer:</STRONG> Job seekers in the financial penalty zone must have full compliance each fortnight to receive their full entitlement that fortnight.</P>
<P>Where the provider reports a mutual obligation failure and they are not satisfied the job seeker has a valid reason, Services Australia will investigate the non-compliance event. If the job seeker is unable to establish reasonable excuse, the failure will be applied and the job seeker will incur a financial penalty.</P></DIV>

<DIV class=showcont>

<P><STRONG>Answer:</STRONG> No, as payment is cancelled the person may reclaim a participation payment if they require income support again. They are able to make the claim at any time after the cancellation however the post cancellation non-payment period will prevent them from receiving any payment during the preclusion period.</P>
<P>Job seekers who reclaim will be subject to <A href="../job-seekers/001-02030000-01.html">RapidConnect</A> and will return to the zone they were in prior to cancellation.</P></DIV>

<P>Sophia voluntarily left a job and immediately claimed a participation payment. The Service Officer with Unemployment Non-Payment Period (UNPP) security resource assessing the claim conducted an investigation, talking to both Sophia and the previous employer. The Service Officer determined that Sophia did not have a reasonable excuse for voluntarily leaving a job that was suitable and therefore Sophia has an unemployment failure.</P>
<P>The penalty for an unemployment failure is an unemployment preclusion period and Sofia will have to wait 4 weeks before the participation payment starts.</P>

<P>Jack is in the warning zone with one demerit accrued. Jack did not attend a job interview so the provider records the non-compliance and speaks to Jack about the reason for not going. The provider decides that Jack does not have a valid reason and explains to Jack that failing to attend job interview is considered a more serious mutual obligation failure. As a result Jack has been fast-tracked to 3 demerits and must now undertake a Capability Interview. Jack cannot accrue any further demerits until the Capability Interview is completed.</P></DIV>

The Job Seeker Snapshot is also reviewed.</P>

<P>Jack behaved in an inappropriate manner while at a job interview and is fast tracked to the next assessment point - a Capability Assessment conducted by Services Australia. The provider notifies Jack of the requirement to contact Services Australia and participate in a Capability Assessment.</P>
<P>A PST-skilled Service Officer conducts the Capability Assessment. They check that all relevant circumstances have been identified an appropriately verified or assessed through an Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) where this is required. They also make sure that Jack is realistically able to comply with compulsory terms of the Job Plan and that these are in keeping with the relevant legislation and policies.</P>
<P>The Participation Compliance workflow is used to record the Capability Assessment, including any significant and ongoing circumstances that are impacting Jack's capacity to comply with requirements that are not already captured.</P>
<P>If Jack is capable of meeting the current terms of all requirements in the Job Plan Jack will move into the financial penalty zone.</P>
<P>If Jack is not capable of meeting current requirements in the Job Plan due to ongoing circumstances or the Job Plan contains a term that Jack cannot be compelled to meet, Jack will return to the green zone with the demerits reset to zero.

<P>When Jack did not attend a Work for the Dole activity, a mutual obligation failure occurred. This suspends the payment and Jack's provider also sends a Non-Compliance Report to Services Australia.</P>
<P>This report passes through automatic validation processes in both the Employment Services System (ESS) and Services Australia IT system.</P>
<P>Jack receives an SMS advising that if there is a reason for not attending the activity, Jack needs to talk with the provider first before Jack is due to report. If the provider does not accept Jack had a valid reason for not attending, the failure will become active on the Services Australia system on Jack's reporting date.</P>
<P>When Jack reports, if there is no valid reason for failing to attend, Jack can choose to accept the financial penalty for some failures while finalising the reporting without speaking with Services Australia. Jack chose to discuss the failure with Services Australia.</P>
<P>Jack did not establish a reasonable excuse for failing to attend so the PST-skilled Service Officer applied a financial penalty. As this is Jack's first financial penalty, Jack will lose 50% of the fortnight's payment from the current entitlement period. This includes the basic allowance after the application of the income test and any add-ons that are paid with the participation payment, such as Rent Assistance.</P>
<P>The PST-skilled Service Officer explains to Jack that:</P>
<UL>
<LI>they need to meet all their requirements to avoid another penalty</LI>
<LI>a second financial penalty results in a loss of the full fortnight's payment, and</LI>
<LI>a third financial penalty results in payment cancellation. Jack will then need to reclaim a payment if needed and will have to wait 4 weeks before receiving a participation payment again</LI></UL></DIV>

<P>Jack does not have a reasonable excuse for non-attendance at a compulsory activity and incurs another financial penalty.</P>
<P>As this is Jack's third financial penalty, payment is cancelled. You will not be able to receive payment for 4 weeks. Jack can still use their concession card and will still receive the same amount of Family Tax Benefit they are currently getting.</P>
<P>Jack can reapply for payment during their post cancellation non-payment period, however they will have to wait until the end of the 4 week non-payment period before their payment starts again. There are no hardship or waiver provisions during the non-payment period.</P>
<P>If Jack does reclaim for a payment, they will remain in the financial penalty zone. If they have a penalty for a mutual obligation failure, it will be their first penalty in the penalty count this time around, and they will only lose one weeks payment.</P>
<P>When Jack returned to payment, he fully complied with all compulsory requirements for 3 months and was returned to the green zone.</P></DIV>

<P>Jack's provider spoke to Jack about they were supposed to start but never turned up for. As Jack did not have a valid reason and the job suitable, the provider submits a report for Services Australia to investigate a work refusal failure.</P>
<P>The PST-Skilled Officer also determined that the work was suitable and Jack did not have a reasonable excuse for refusing the work. The penalty is a non-compliance cancellation and Jack has to wait 4 weeks before receiving a participation payment again.</P>
<P>Jack re-claims a participation payment after the post cancellation non-payment period. Jack returns to the green zone which is the zone he was in in prior to the non-compliance cancellation.</P>
<P>Where the job seeker returns to the warning zone, the accrued demerits are not reset to zero but may expire after 6 months. Likewise, if they are in the financial penalty zone the penalty count does not re-start from zero but may expire after 3 months.</P>
<P>A work refusal does not accrue a demerit, nor is it included in the penalty count.</P></DIV>
