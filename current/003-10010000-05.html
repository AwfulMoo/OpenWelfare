<p><strong>Payment less than accrued entitlement</strong></p></td>
<td>

<p><strong>The available amount in the script is less than the customer's accrued entitlement&#58; why is this and can I override the amount?</strong></p>

<p>When the system assesses the available amount that can be paid as an urgent payment, it withholds the total value of deductions such as debt repayments, tax, Centrepay, immediate payment indicator etc. This leaves enough funds to meet these commitments. The available amount determined by the system cannot be overridden.</p>

<p><strong>Service centre collection timeframe</strong></p></td>
<td>

<p><strong>When a customer is advised to collect a payment from the service centre, how long will it take from when the customer presents at reception until they walk out the door with the payment?</strong></p>

<p>The time the customer will be at the service centre waiting to collect their payment may vary depending on operational requirements of the service centre on that day.</p>

<p>In general, when the customer presents at reception/to the Customer Liaison Officer (CLO), a walk-in will be booked. At the walk-in, the customer must be authenticated and PORO established and in the case of 'conditional approvals’, documentation will be verified. The payment will then be processed and issued to the customer, with instructions on how the payment is to be withdrawn.</p>

<p>The customer should be advised to attend the service centre during the preferred walk-in times as recorded in Office Locator. Tell the customer that they must attend the service centre on that day to receive their payment. If they do not attend on the day the payment is approved they will need to reapply.</p></td>

<td>

<p><strong>Will a debt be raised if an urgent payment was issued, but due to declared earnings on the Entitlement Period End Date (EPED), it cannot be recovered in full from the payday?</strong></p>

<p>If an immediate payment deduction cannot be recovered in full from the first entitlement period, it will cascade into the next until it has been repaid in full. This could be an urgent payment, anticipated payment or hardship advance etc.<br>Should the customer's payments be cancelled or suspended before the immediate payment deduction is recovered, the system will wait for the customer's payment to restart and then will recover.</p>

<p>If it is unlikely the customer's payment will restart soon, the immediate payment deduction is to be manually converted into a debt.</p></td>

<p><strong>Two working days for payment into bank account</strong></p></td>
<td>

<p><strong>Why does it take 2 working days for a pension or Parenting Payment Partnered payment to be made into the customer's bank account via direct credit?</strong></p>

<p>Due to the large number of payments issued via the Reserve Bank to the various banks, credit unions and building societies across Australia on a daily basis, the banking industry believes that its members do not and would not have the capacity to process and clear all of the payments within one working day.</p>

<p>To manage this capacity and customer expectations, it was negotiated that payments issued by the Newstart System (NSS) would be delivered in one working day. All other income support payments would be delivered in 2 and all other non-income support payments would be delivered in 3 working days.</p></td>

<p><strong>'No more EBT's' or 'face to face only'</strong></p></td>
<td>

<p><strong>What happens if a DOA DOC advises 'No more EBTs' or 'Customer must only be seen face to face'?</strong></p>

<p>To support local arrangements, when a customer is managed by the service centre (for example, some 'at risk' customers are managed by a local community team and/or senior staff members), the Smart Centre Service Officer should not assess the request for an urgent payment. They should instead refer the customer to their local service centre for assessment.</p>

<p>For more about local arrangements, check the service centre's Office Locator page. See Urgent payment request to be assessed at the service centre or by a processing team for more about when not to refer a customer to Smart Centre telephony.</p>

<p><strong>An appropriate Display On Access (DOA) DOC</strong> would state that when/if the customer makes a request for an urgent payment, they are to be referred to the service centre for assessment. It will state the contact details of the staff member to refer the customer to. The <strong>DOC</strong> is also to have a reasonable expiry date or review date depending on the customer's circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>An inappropriate DOA DOC</strong> will ban the customer from applying for an urgent payment, EBT card or service without reason or contact person and have an unreasonable review period. In these cases&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Consider the request based on the merit of&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
information and circumstances provided by the customer, and</li>
			<li>
the historical information recorded on their record (for example, previous urgent payment requests and relevant risk factors)</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Give feedback via the Staff Feedback Tool to the author of the <strong>DOC</strong> to let them know the text is inappropriate and that the <strong>DOC</strong> must be expired or replaced with appropriate text.</li>		</ul></td>

<p><strong>Payment pickup from Medicare</strong></p></td>
<td>

<p><strong>Can a customer pick up an EBT Card at Medicare?</strong></p>

<p>Medicare services and other agencies within Services Australia will not have access to EBT cards and the extension of urgent assistance in Smart Centres will not change this arrangement.</p>

<p><strong>Never refer a customer to a Medicare service or Centrelink to collect a payment.</strong></p></td>

<p><strong>Payment granted inappropriately</strong></p></td>
<td>

<p><strong>What should a staff member do if they identify that a customer has been granted an urgent payment inappropriately?</strong></p>

<p>Unlike most decisions that staff make, urgent payment decisions can be very grey. For example, what one staff member believes could be foreseen, another may not. In addition, due to the sensitive nature of these types of decisions, all staff should support the decision made by the decision maker.</p>

<p>If a customer is unhappy with the decision, follow the <a target="_blank" href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-10010020-01.html">reconsideration of decision process</a>.</p>

<p>However, if a staff member is not complying with the guidelines, or not following Operational Blueprint procedures, feedback should be given to the staff member via the <a target="_blank" href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-24000000-01.html">Staff Feedback Tool</a>.</p></td>

<p>Refer the customer to a social worker if the customer displays suicidal or possible self-harming behaviours, see <a target="_blank" href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-06010040-01.html">Customers talking about suicide or self-harm</a>.</p>

<p>Consider any social worker recommendations recorded on the customer record, however the delegation to grant or reject urgent payments remains with the Service Officer and they must ensure they are following the correct procedures in approving any urgent payment. Approval to grant the payment must still be provided by&#58;</p>

<p>To reduce the risk of the customer having unrealistic expectations when referring the customer to a social worker, be clear with the customer about why they are being referred and the role of the social worker. A social worker cannot change the urgent payment decision, but they can offer support and assistance for customers presenting with highly complex needs.</p>

<p>If a social work referral is appropriate&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
refer the customer to the Social Work Line via a warm handoff</li>

<p><strong>TPS, Team Leader and local Leadership Team role</strong></p>

<p><strong>Approval required - more than 2 urgent payments</strong></p>

<p>Service Officers making a decision to grant a third or subsequent urgent payment to a customer within 12 months must seek approval from Technical Peer Support (TPS), Team Leader or a staff member above this level before recording the decision to approve the payment via the <strong>Immediate Payment requests </strong>script.</p>

<p>TPS and Team Leaders (or above) will make the decision to approve urgent payment if satisfied the customer is experiencing severe financial hardship and the documentary or third party verbal evidence provided supports the customer's claim of extraordinary circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>Other responsibilities</strong></p>

<p>The TPS/Team Leader/local Leadership Team is responsible for any reconsiderations of the original request, when the requested at the time the customer is advised the outcome of their initial request. It <strong>must</strong> take into consideration&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The customer's recent urgent payments, Change Payday and Welfare Referral History (within 12 months)</li>
		<li>
The circumstance of the customer's request</li>
		<li>
Whether all <a target="_blank" href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-17040701-01.html">alternative assistance</a> options have been explored and why they were not appropriate</li>
		<li>
Whether the request is due to exceptional and unforeseen circumstances</li>
		<li>
Whether the amount is the minimum required to meet the customer's immediate need</li>
		<li>
How the customer will meet their regular ongoing expenses like rent, food, utilities on their next payday</li>
		<li>
Whether the circumstances have been verified (if required), and</li>
		<li>
Whether the customer is struggling to meet their regular ongoing expenses or appear to be in a crisis cycle. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> consider a weekly payment assessment with an Authorised Weekly Payment Officer (AWPO) or a referral to a Financial Management Program Support Service for financial counselling or budgeting assistance</li>
		<li>
A social work referral could be considered if aligned with the social work priority groups. These groups include customers at risk of suicide or self-harm, young people without adequate support or customers experiencing family and domestic violence</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> all reconsiderations where the decision is going to be changed <strong>must </strong>have the circumstances verified.</p>

<p>If a customer requests a reconsideration of the outcome of a previous request on the same day, an APS4 can do this as long as they are not the original decision maker and are trained in urgent payment assessments.</p>

<p>The <strong>Immediate Payment requests</strong> script records the approving staff member's User ID on the customer's record as part of the urgent payment decision.</p></td>
