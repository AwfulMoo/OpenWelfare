<p>A customer is assessed as having a TRWC if they have been assessed by an Assessor as being temporarily unable to work for at least 30 hours per week because of a medical condition. The Assessor will use information provided by the Treating Health Professional and gathered in the ESAt interview.</p>

<p>A PCW is decided based on permanent verified medical conditions. The customer is assessed as having a PCW if both 'baseline work capacity' and 'with intervention' work capacity are assessed to be less than 30 hours per week.</p>

<p><strong>Participation</strong></p>

<p>Customers with a PCW or a TRWC of 0-7 or 8-14 hours per week of 12 weeks or more in duration, will be required to attend compulsory quarterly participation interviews with Services Australia to fully meet their requirements, unless they are undertaking paid work or self-employment within their bandwidth, as this will also fully meet their requirements. If a customer fails to attend a compulsory quarterly interview appointment, their payment may be suspended.</p>

<p>Customers with an assessed TRWC of 0-7 or 8-14 hours per week of less than 12 weeks in duration will not have a quarterly interview requirement. Instead, these customers will fully meet their requirements by lodging their Reporting Statement and attending appointments with Services Australia if requested.</p>

<p>Customers with a PCW or TRWC of either 0-7 or 8-14 hours per week are still required to meet mutual obligation requirements&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
while these customers are always encouraged to participate with an Employment Services Provider, they cannot be penalised if they choose not to do so</li>
		<li>
customers with a TRWC of 0-7 hours per week cannot be referred to Disability Employment Services (DES) but can be referred to jobactive, and</li>
		<li>
to fully meet their requirements through paid work instead of attending quarterly interviews, the hours of work must be within their bandwidth (for example, at least 8 hours per week, if they have a PCW of 8-14 hours per week)</li>
		</ul>
<p>A customer who lodges a medical certificate (seeking exemption from mutual obligation requirements) may be referred for an ESAt to assess their PCW or TRWC where there is not already a current and valid assessment of the customer's work capacity. The referral for an ESAt should not delay the decision about the temporary incapacity exemption. In all cases the Service Officer should make the decision about whether to grant an exemption based on available evidence, including the medical certificate completed by the customer's treating doctor.</p>

<p><strong>Continuing Inability to Work (CITW)</strong></p>

<p>CITW is used to assess eligibility for Disability Support Pension (DSP). A customer has a CITW if their impairment alone prevents them from undertaking both of the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
work for 15 or more hours per week where wages are at or above the relevant minimum wage, for at least 2 years</li>
		<li>
educational, pre-vocational, vocational or work related training (including on-the job training) is unlikely (because of the customer's impairment) to enable the customer to do any work for 15 or more hours per week where wages are at or above the relevant minimum wage, within 2 years independently of a program of support</li>
		</ul>
<p>An impairment rating of 20 points or more does not mean the customer will be unable to do any work of at least 15 hours per week in the next 2 years. It means the person's impairment may have a significant functional impact in many work situations but depending on the person's individual circumstances, coping mechanisms and reasonable adjustments, that person may still be able to do work.</p>

<p><strong>Definition and sustainability of work</strong></p>

<p>For the purposes of work capacity, 'work' is considered to be any work. It is not limited by the work the customer usually performs nor work available in the customer's area. It is expected that a person will be capable of reliably performing work on a sustainable basis, that is, for a reasonable period of time without requiring excessive sick leave or work absences. In this context, a reasonable period of time generally means 26 weeks and work means work in open, unsupported employment. Sick leave or absences of 1 month or more (in total) taken in any given 26 week period are considered excessive.</p>

<p><strong>Recording and actioning recommended referrals</strong></p>

<p>A referral recommendation is recorded if a customer has the capacity to work 8 or more hours in open employment.</p>

<p>For job seekers who are working or studying at their assessed capacity, a referral is still recommended and actioned. The Employment Services Provider will decide if the customer is meeting their mutual obligation requirements.</p>

<p>The Assessor's recommendation in relation to the type of Employment Services Provider referral is final. Assessors use their professional qualifications to determine how factors such as a customer's medical conditions, barriers to work, and support requirements affect their capacity to work. These factors inform the decision of which Employment Services Provider will best suit the customer.</p>

<p>An Employment Services Provider may dispute a referral if the provider does not believe that the referral is correct, or that the work capacity and benchmark hours for the customer are correct.</p>

raise this matter with Assessment Services within 28 days of receiving the assessment report</li>

<p><strong>Customer preferences</strong></p>

<p>A referral recommendation should not be changed if the customer refuses to participate in the recommended program, or wishes to be referred to another program. Customers who volunteer for employment assistance but refuse a referral to a specialist Employment Services Provider may be referred to jobactive.</p>

<p>When a customer lives in a Department of Education, Skills and Employment designated remote area, they are referred to a CDP provider.</p>

<p>Customers will generally not be given a choice of service type, however if there is more than 1 Employment Services Provider offering a single service type, the customer may choose their preferred provider, subject to appointments being available.</p>

<p><strong>Referrals to jobactive</strong></p>

<p>Stream Services are delivered by jobactive. In Stream Services, a job seeker's level of disadvantage is assessed and based on this they are placed in Stream A or B. Assessors do not select Streams A or B for the job seeker - this is calculated automatically by Employment Services System (ESSWeb) based on Jobseeker Classification Instrument (JSCI) responses and the ESAt report's general 'Stream Services' referral recommendation.</p>

<p>Servicing is tailored to the individual and jobactive providers will work with the job seeker to negotiate an individually tailored pathway to employment (a Job Plan).</p>

<p>A referral to Stream C can only be made following an ESAt and is designed for those with multiple or complex non-vocational barriers.</p>

<p><strong>Disability employment assistance referrals</strong></p>

<p>Disability Employment Services (DES) and Australian Disability Enterprises (ADE) are specialist services designed for people with disabilities, illness or injury.</p>

<p>Referrals for DES come from the ESAt report and assist the customer to return to or maintain employment.</p>

<p>With some exceptions, from 1 July 2021 DES eligibility is restricted to customers with an assessed current and future work capacity below 30 hours per week and in receipt of a social security payment. For more information, see <a target="_blank" href="../job-seekers/001-02230030-01.html">Direct registration with a provider for disability employment assistance services</a>.</p>

<p>ADE (supported employment) is a 'capped' program for customers with a 'with intervention' work capacity of 0-7 hours per week in open employment. Customers will need to register with the ADE provider directly.</p>
