<p>When a customer lodged an estimate of income between 1 July 2008 and 1 July 2010 Cuba did not automatically apply the estimate to all cases and it was possible to select the estimate to apply to only 1 case. During that period, Cuba prompted the Service Officer to select all cases with the same child support period start date, however this was not a mandatory action and some cases did not have the estimate applied appropriately.</p>

<p>After the processes in <a href="../separated-parents/277-09030000-01.html">Correcting errors on Child Support cases</a> have been completed (as real time processing will never apply to these cases), manual processing is required to correct the error.</p>

<p>A new child support period does not commence just because a parent’s role changes and a reverse case is generated. The child support period start date used in the reverse case is the same as the date used in the existing case, however Cuba does not always apply the original child support period and instead commences a new 1 using the date the roles reversed.</p>

<p>In this instance, a customer may have estimated their income for a child support period that was incorrect. When the child support period is <a href="../separated-parents/277-03020020-03.html#bp03_tbl_System_processi_Step01">aligned</a> the estimate is revoked. This issue only involves estimates that apply from 1 July 2008 to 30 June 2010.</p>

<p>As aligning the child support periods revokes the estimate the customer must apply through the courts to have this changed.</p>

<p>The customer cannot apply through the Change of Assessment process as this period is greater than 18 months.

<p>Duplicate letters may issue to customers who have a reverse case where the customer is recorded as the payee in 1 case and the payer in the other, for example when the customer lodges an estimate of income a letter will issue for each case, even though they are assessed to either pay child support as the ‘overall payer’ or receive child support as the ‘overall payee’.</p>

<p>In some instances, such as when a customer’s Post Separation Income (PSI) is accepted, a letter issues from both cases but without a case number specified.</p>

<p><strong>Agreement suspensions and terminations due to care </strong></p>

<p>If the assessment is based on an agreement and a care change results in the payee ceasing to be an eligible carer for the child (less than 35% care) for more than 28 days, the agreement will end for that child from the date the payee ceased to be an eligible carer. An agreement suspension period may apply for 28 days (or up to 26 weeks in some circumstances). See <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-18061455-01.html">Suspending or ending a Child Support agreement due to care</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Agreement role swap clauses </strong></p>

<p>If the agreement has a clause that allows the roles of the parties to swap when there is a care change and the clause has been activated, the agreement will not be suspended or terminated if the payee ceases to be an eligible carer. Child support as provided by the agreement will become payable to the other party when the specified level of care applies.

<p>Manual processing is required when the children of the case are in shared or divided care and 1 party is assessed to pay in accordance with the child support formula; whereas the other party is assessed to pay in accordance with a departure. This is because Cuba does not automatically offset the 2 amounts and instead creates an annual rate in each of the cases.</p>

<p><strong>Example&#58;</strong> Mike and Fiona have 2 children, John and Travis. Initially both children are in Fiona’s 100% care. Mike is assessed to pay Fiona periodic amounts of $6,000 per child per annum ($12,000 total) in accordance with a change of assessment (COA) decision.</p>

<p>A care change occurs resulting in John moving into Mike’s 100% care (Travis remains in Fiona’s 100% care). Mike is assessed to pay Fiona an amount of $6,000 for Travis (as per the COA decision) and Fiona is assessed to pay Mike a formula amount of $4,904 for Travis.</p>

<p>The net outcome is Mike pays Fiona the difference of $1,096 ($6,000 COA less $4,904 formula = $1,096).</p>

<p>In 1 child support case there may be separate assessments for children, for example the assessment for 1 child may be based on an agreement and the other on the administrative formula. A parent may make an estimate election in the assessment where there is no Income Amount Order (IAO) in place. As Cuba does not recognise that in 1 child support case the assessments for each child are determined independently the estimate cannot be accepted as an IAO is in place, even if it does not apply to all children.</p>

<p>When a parent lodges an estimate of income this is used as their income in any calculation that determines the cost of the child. Where the applicant is a non-parent carer the costs of the child are determined using both parents’ incomes. This means the estimate should be used in the cost of child calculations on all cases where there is a non-parent carer.</p>

<p>As Cuba does not automatically apply a parent’s estimate to all cases manual processing is required.</p>

<p><strong>Example&#58;</strong> Jackie and George have 3 children. Zara lives with Jackie, Peter lives with George and Kara lives with Polly. Cuba represents this scenario in at least 3 cases. If George lodges an estimate it must be applied to all cases. Cuba automatically applies the estimate to some cases, however manual processing is required to ensure the estimate is accurately reflected in all cases.</p>

<p>Where a non-parent carer cares for children from more than 1 assessment case Cuba does not reflect the 2 different incomes that should be used in the assessment. In the below example, the father’s income would be the same for both children but as each child has a different mother their assessments need to be based on their own mother’s income. As Cuba shows both children on 1 case instead of 2, manual processing is required.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>Jane has 100% care of 2 children (Billie and Marley). Billie is the child of Craig and Lisa. Marley is the child of Craig and Sammy. Jane applies for Craig and Lisa to be assessed for child support for Billie and Craig and Sammy to be assessed for child support for Marley. Manual processing is required because Cuba reflects the liability of Craig in a single case when Craig should be assessed in 2 separate cases.</p>

<p>Where a customer has indicated they would like to reapply for Child Support after a care terminating event (care advised 26 weeks or more after event and all carers cease to be eligible), the case should be restarted from the date the request was made.</p>

<p>Online applications, macros and guided processes in Pluto ask customers if they want to apply for a new assessment if their care change causes their assessment to end. The customer’s response to this question will be stored in a notepad. If a customer has asked to reapply for an assessment, the assessment will restart for the date this question was answered. </p>

<p>As the child support assessment will be active until eligibility is run following the acceptance of the care change, the child support assessment can be restarted by the owning officer without the need for a referral to New Customers. Follow the process for <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-03020010-03.html">creating a reverse case</a> with the following exceptions&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
assessment will begin on the day the application was made </li>
		<li>
customers must be contacted to identify what collection method they require </li>
		<li>
child support periods will not be aligned </li>
		<li>
formula departures; most formula departures, that is, change of assessment (COA), agreements (AGR) and court orders (CO) will not survive a terminating event. The <strong>only</strong> exceptions are a non-periodic payments clause in an agreement that does not affect the annual rate and lump sum crediting provisions in a binding agreement. However these will not apply again until the payee named in the agreement again becomes an eligible carer </li>
		<li>
estimates;  if there was an estimate of income in place for either parent prior to the terminating event, contact the estimating parent to discuss their income&#58; </li>
			<ul>			<li>
if the estimate was in place prior to the terminating event and the case is restarted within the same financial year and the parent does not revoke the estimate, the estimate should be used as that parent’s income in the restarted assessment </li>
			<li>
if the estimate election was made during a period when the case had ended, that is after change in care occurred, ask the customer if they wish to lodge a new estimate election</li>			</ul>			</ul>

<p>A customer can apply to have additional income earned after separation excluded from their adjusted taxable income, referred to as post separation income (PSI). See <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-07100000-01.html">Post separation income for Child Support customers</a>.</p>

<p>Where both parents are eligible carers a reverse case will exist. One case may have an annual rate and the other case must have a $0 annual rate. In these circumstances the payee for the overall case is easily identified as they are the parent entitled to receive child support.</p>

<p>However, in cases where both annual rates are $0 for example neither parent is assessed to pay child support because both parents are on a low income it is unclear which parent is the payee when determining who is eligible to elect to end the assessment.</p>

<p>For details on how elections to end can be made in cases where the liability is $0 see <a href="../separated-parents/277-03150000-01.html">Ending a Child Support Assessment</a>. </p>

<p>If a parent elects to end an assessment, this can have Centrelink implications if the other parent (the payer for child support purposes) is in receipt of Family Tax Benefit (FTB) and is still required to take reasonable maintenance action.</p>

<p>If there are reverse cases, Centrelink must be advised both cases have ended and which children the election applies to. Centrelink may need to add coding to reflect that the other parent is taking reasonable maintenance action.</p>

<p>The SSO&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Advises Centrelink that both cases have ended due to a payee election. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-04080000-01.html">Centrelink-Child Support information exchange</a></li>		</ul>

<p>Duplicate letters may issue to customers who have a reverse case where the customer is recorded as the payee in 1 case and the payer in the other, for example when the customer lodges an estimate of income a letter will issue for each case, even though they are assessed to either pay child support as the ‘overall payer’ or receive child support as the ‘overall payee’.</p>

<p>In some instances, such as when a customer’s Post Separation Income (PSI) is accepted, a letter issues from both cases but without a case number specified.</p>

<p>After processing changes to reverse cases check that all letters issuing are appropriate.</p>
