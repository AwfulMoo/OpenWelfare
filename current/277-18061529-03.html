<p>If a payee or their current partner is receiving, or is entitled to receive more than the base rate of Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A, the election to end must be approved by Centrelink. If the payee is not entitled to more than the base rate of FTB Part A, approval is not required.</p>

<p>Although a payee has elected to end an assessment, they may be notifying Child Support of a terminating event or requesting private collection.

<p>When an election to end is received, discuss with the payee the reason they are electing to end.</p>

<p>Common reasons for electing to end an assessment include&#58;</p>

Family and domestic violence, <a href="../separated-parents/277-18061529-03.html#bp03_tbl_Election_to_end_Step04">go to Step 4</a></li>

Reconciliation, <a href="../separated-parents/277-18061529-03.html#bp03_tbl_Election_to_end_Step06">go to Step 6</a></li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the payee may also elect to end the case as a matter of personal choice where none of the above reasons apply. If the payee receives more than the base rate of FTB Part A, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-18061529-03.html#bp03_tbl_Centrelink_and_Step01">Step 1 in Table 2</a> to check if they are in receipt of more than the base rate FTB Part A and seek Centrelink approval.</p>

<p>If Centrelink does not approve the election, contact the payee and advise that the assessment cannot end. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-18061529-03.html#bp03_tbl_Review_and_proc_Step09">Step 9, Table 3</a>.</p>

<div class="showcont">


<p>If a payee elects to end their case because of family and domestic violence, check if they are in receipt of more than the base rate FTB Part A. If the payee is not in receipt of more than the base rate of FTB, see the below information on Processing an election to end for customers affected by family and domestic violence.</p>

<p>If the payee receives more than the base rate of FTB, an election to end can only be actioned after they have obtained an exemption from seeking maintenance from the other parent. Advise them that they need to discuss the exemption with a social worker and offer to warm transfer to Centrelink to make an appointment with a social worker.</p>

<p>If Centrelink approve the election to end, the case will be ended in accordance with the payee's initial election. There is no need for the payee to make a subsequent election.</p>

<p>If there are delays in Centrelink granting the election, when the end election is processed be sure to check for any overpayments. If there is an overpayment then see <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-04260000-01.html">Overpayments and payee debt</a>. If Centrelink does not approve the election, contact the payee and advise that the assessment cannot end. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-18061529-03.html#bp03_tbl_Review_and_proc_Step09">Step 9, Table 3</a>.</p>

<p>See <a target="_blank" href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-15000000-01.html">Family and domestic violence</a> when family and domestic violence is an issue. See also the Child Support Guide 6.10.1&#58; Family Violence for more information. <br><a href="../separated-parents/277-18061529-04.html#bp04_L2LL_Policy">References</a> contains a link.</p>

<p><strong>Centrelink exemption granted prior to payee making an election to end</strong></p>

<p>If a department social worker grants a payee an exemption, the payee must first elect to end the assessment before it can be ended. If the payee has been granted an exemption but has not yet made an election, contact the payee and invite them to make an election.</p>

<p>If no election is made, the assessment will continue.</p>

<p><strong>Processing an election to end for customers affected by family and domestic violence</strong></p>

<p>Payees are not able to request the case to be ended from a past date. This means that after the case has ended, past assessments based on provisional incomes or estimates will be automatically updated by Cuba when tax returns are lodged. This may create arrears or overpayments on the case and trigger letters to the customers. This could place vulnerable payees in unacceptably high risk situations.</p>

<p>Where assessments are based on <strong>provisional incomes or estimates</strong> and the payee requests child support&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
do not collect arrears (for example, they have retrospectively opted out or discharged the arrears), 'Manual periods' can be used to prevent reassessments after the case has ended for family violence reasons. Delete letters produced after the manual formula modification is set in place. This will ensure no letters are issued to the customers after the case has ended</li>
		<li>
continue to collect arrears, 'Manual periods' will not be applied to the assessments as the payee has elected for the arrears to be collected and there is a need to ensure the accuracy of any debts that are pursued</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> ensure that the payee understands that an election to end does not preclude either party from lodging an application for child support assessment in the future. If the payer reapplies for a child support assessment this will reactivate the ended case. This does not prevent the payee from ending the case again based on the Centrelink exemption.</p>

<p>In situations of family and domestic violence and regardless of the payee's Centrelink entitlement, <strong>do not contact the payer</strong>.</p>

The election to end does not stop them applying in the future for an assessment</li>
		<li>
The specified end date must be a date <strong>after</strong> the election to end the assessment is made</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> as an assessment must end on a date after the election is made, the end date in Cuba must be recorded as the day before the intended assessment end date.</p>

<p>When an end date is recorded in Cuba, the assessment will end on the following date. For example, if an end date of '1 June' is keyed in the end date field in Cuba, the assessment will end effective 2 June. <br>The <strong>Notification Date</strong> field must be '1 June' and the <strong>Date Liability Ends On</strong> field also will be '1 June'. This means that if a payee makes an election on 1 June to end their assessment, this will result in the assessment ending effective the following day, that is, 2 June.</p>

<p><strong>International&#58;</strong> if the customer resides overseas in a reciprocating jurisdiction, and the application for the assessment was made by the Central Authority on behalf of that customer, confirm with the Central Authority of that country before the case can be ended. Write a letter to the Central Authority outlining the payee's request, and seek their approval to end the case.</p>

<p>If contact with the customer by telephone has been unsuccessful or they have not responded to the 'please contact letter' and a specific end date cannot be confirmed with either parent, Centrelink or other external sources, do not proceed with the election.

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> from 1 July 2008, in cases of family and domestic violence or other s151 exemptions from Centrelink, it is important to end both cases in Cuba that involve the same payer, payee and child/ren irrespective of the parent's role in each case.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> ensure the payee understands that this does not preclude either party from lodging an application for child support assessment in the future.</p>

<p>If the payer does apply for a child support assessment this will reactivate the ended case. This does not prevent the payee from ending the case again based on the Centrelink exemption.</p>

<p><strong>End for one child of the assessment</strong></p>

<p>If a payee has requested that the assessment end for only one child of the case, record the election to end in the Child Details window in the Terminating Event section. Clearly document the reason for the end.</p>

<p>Document the reasons for the decision and reference the legislation used.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> record the end date as the day before the payee wants the case to end. Cuba ends the assessment on the day after the recorded end date - this accords with current policy.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Example 1&#58;</strong> payee calls on 1 April 2016, and based on current policy payee requests the case to end on 2 April 2016</li>
			<ul>			<li>
The notification date would be keyed as 1 April 2016 and the date liability ends needs to be keyed as 1 April 2016</li>
			<li>
This then achieves the requested outcome, that is, liability will be raised for 1 April 2016 and will cease from 2 April 2016 forward</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Example 2&#58;</strong> payee calls 1 April 2016 and requests the case to end 15 April 2016</li>
			<ul>			<li>
The notification date would be keyed as 1 April 2016 and the date liability ends needs to be keyed as 14 April 2016</li>
			<li>
This then achieves the requested outcome, that is, liability will be raised for 14 April 2016 and will cease from 15 April 2016 forward. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> Cuba will not allow a future end date to be keyed, therefore if a customer requests a date in the future, as outlined in example 2, the Service Officer will need to create a general follow up in-tray with the due date being the day before the payee wishes the case to end. Cuba will then allow the end to be keyed as outlined in example 2</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a payee is entitled to more than the base rate of <a href="../separated-parents/277-18061529-05.html#bp05020002_1">FTB Part A</a>, the date entered in Cuba must be the same or later than the date nominated by Centrelink.</p>
