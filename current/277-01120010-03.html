<P>Proof of death must be obtained before processing the terminating event. The following can be used as proof of death:</P>
<UL>
<LI><A href="../separated-parents/277-04370000-01.html">External Searches Guide</A> - search by the state the customer died in</LI>
<LI>funeral notice from a newspaper - citing the customer's name, date of birth, date of death or other identifying detail</LI>
<LI>confirmation from the Public Trustee, Coroner's office, hospital or Police</LI>
<LI>death certificate from the Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages (BDM), or</LI>
<LI>confirmation from the Department of Foreign Affairs, if the person died overseas</LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> due to the cost involved, obtaining a death certificate from BDM should only be pursued if no other proof can be obtained. BDM take a minimum of 6 weeks (12 weeks where there is a Coroner's enquiry) to produce a death certificate.</P>
<P>Proof of death should generally be in writing. If unable to obtain written evidence, or unable to obtain any proof of death but believe the customer is deceased, escalate the query, via a SSO, to a Program Support Manager to assist in the decision making process. See <A href="../separated-parents/277-09140000-01.html">Technical support in Child Support</A>.</P>
<P>In the event an Indigenous customer passed away in a remote location, the community manager or elder may be able to assist. Contact the local Indigenous Relations Officer who will draw on their networks to progress the matter.</P>
<P>Centrelink notification alone is not sufficient to process a customer's death. Additional proof must be obtained.</P>

<P>If the payee is intestate, there are limited avenues available to finalise any outstanding child support issues as there is no one who can legally make decisions on their behalf.</P>
<P>If no executor details have been provided, attempt to locate an executor before pursuing the options for an intestate payee.</P>
<P>To locate an executor:</P>
<UL>
<LI>contact the payee's next of kin, family or the payer and ask if they are aware of an executor</LI>
<LI>contact Centrelink to find out who reported the death and if they know who the executor is, and</LI>
<LI>contact the Public Trustee in the state where the deceased resided, (unless the deceased resided in Western Australia or Tasmania, where a fee is charged)</LI></UL>
<P>If an executor is located from the above searches, go to <A href="../separated-parents/277-01120010-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Collection_opti">Table 3</A>.</P>
<P>If an executor is not located, consider if there are any possible issues on the case including if child support is owed to payee. When an intestate payee has child support owed to them, the options are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>disbursement, <A href="../separated-parents/277-01120010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Collection_opti01_Step02">go to Step 2</A></LI>

<P>If the customer is intestate, check with the person finalising their affairs if the payee's bank account remains open. If the bank account is open, remove the holds and continue to disburse.</P>
<P>If the payee's bank account has been closed, Child Support has no avenue of disbursement. Suspend collection and explore other options such as Waiver and Non-pursuit.</P>
<P><STRONG>Returned disbursement</STRONG></P>
<P>If a disbursement previously issued to the payee has been returned, check if the payee is still entitled to receive the funds.

See <A href="../separated-parents/277-04350000-01.html">Excess cash on a child support customer's account</A>.</P>
<P>If the payee does not have an overpayment, check with the person finalising the payee's affairs if the payee's bank account remains open. If the bank account remains open remove the holds and re-disburse the funds.</P>
<P>If the payee's bank account has been closed, determine if the funds were paid before the payee's death. Any funds that were paid prior to the payee's death may be paid out to a person the Finance Minister considers appropriate, see <A class=extwebsitelink href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/details/c2013a00123" target=_blank>section 74, Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013</A>. If appropriate, escalate the matter to Program Advice.</P>
<P>If the funds were paid after the payee’s death or their bank account has been closed, Child Support has no avenue of disbursement and the funds will have to remain as 'undisbursed', unless letters of administration are obtained.</P></DIV>
