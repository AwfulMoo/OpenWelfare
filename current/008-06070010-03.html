<p>See the <strong>Medical Conditions</strong> section of the report.</p>

<p><strong>Check for manifest eligibility</strong></p>

<p>When an Assessor recommends a customer is manifestly eligible for Disability Support Pension (DSP), they must record the manifest indicator in the <strong>Medical Conditions</strong> section of the JCA report. This displays in the report as <strong>Customer meets manifest criteria for category</strong> followed by a specific manifest indicator code.</p>

<p>The codes and corresponding categories are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
B - Permanent Blindness (BLI)</li>
		<li>
T - Terminal Illness (TRM)</li>
		<li>
I - Intellectual Disability (INT)</li>
		<li>
N - Nursing home level of care (NHM)</li>
		<li>
H - Category 4 HIV/AIDS (HV4)</li>
		<li>
P - Disability Pension at special rate (TPI)</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the Assessor correctly records the manifest indicator, it pre-fills the Medical Conditions Summary (<strong>MCSS</strong>) screen when the JCA report is accepted.</p>

<p>If the JCA referral was for a DSP new claim, the manifest indicator results in the system attempting the auto-acceptance of the JCA report and the auto-grant of the claim. If the auto-grant fails see Resources page of <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03030130-01.html">Assessing eligibility for DSP after DMA</a>.</p>

<p>If the manifest indicator is not correctly displayed, and the JCA report is accepted by the Service Officer, the customer will be incorrectly assessed. The claim may be rejected or payment may cancel.</p>

<p>Service Officers <strong>must ensure</strong> the manifest indicator displays correctly <strong>before</strong> accepting a JCA report. If the Assessor has recommended manifest eligibility in the body of the report (such as in the <strong>Remarks</strong> or <strong>Assessment Summary</strong> sections) but the manifest indicator is not displayed in the JCA report, the report must be returned to Assessment Services for correction. The JCA report must not be accepted until it correctly reflects the Assessor's recommendation of manifest eligibility.</p>

<p>Check all verified medical conditions have been recorded as detailed on the medical evidence and that the medical evidence supports the assessment of a condition as Temporary, Permanent but not FDTS, Permanent and FDTS, or manifest.</p>

<p>When an Assessor has medical evidence to support manifest eligibility for DSP they need to mark the condition as Permanent and Verified by medical evidence. It is not mandatory to mark the condition as FDTS or enter FDTS work capacities unless the customer has secondary medical conditions assessed.</p>

<p><strong>For a JCA (or an </strong><a href="../job-seekers/001-02320020-01.html">Employment Services Assessment (ESAt)<strong></a> upgraded to a JCA)</strong>, check that all medical conditions are recorded under <strong>Conditions</strong>, including&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
all verified conditions (regardless of whether or not they have a functional impact) and recorded as either 'temporary' or 'permanent'</li>
		<li>
all unverified, self-reported or assessor observed conditions are recorded as 'other'</li>
		<li>
'permanent' conditions that are likely to be ongoing for at least 2 years, should be marked as permanent and verified. The Assessor needs to determine whether any permanent condition is fully diagnosed, fully treated and fully stabilised</li>
		</ul>
<p>Check to identify any significant inconsistency (outside the range of possibility) between medical condition details and the work capacity details.</p>

<p>Check the assessment of the customer's ability to use public transport without substantial help is consistent with report comments about the customer's mobility. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> this is only a prompt to consider inviting a claim for <a href="../people-with-disability/008-05030000-01.html">Mobility Allowance (MOB)</a> and is not a recommendation of eligibility for MOB.</p>

<p><strong>Referral recommendations</strong></p>

<p>The Assessor records recommended referrals to providers and non-providers, (for example, community mental health service) in this section of the report.</p>

<p>There are only limited circumstances in which a referral recommendation may not be stated in the report. This is generally only because the customer has future work capacity (with intervention) of less than 8 hours per week, and is unable to benefit from referral to any program.</p>

<p>Return the report if a referral recommendation is not clearly stated in this section of the report and there is no clear reason. See <a href="../people-with-disability/008-06070010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Accept_or_escal_Step01">Step 1 in Table 4</a>.</p>

if an immediate referral was appropriate, details of the referral, including the service provider and appointment details</li>
		<li>
whether a customer with future work capacity or temporary reduced work capacity of less than 15 hours per week declined the offer of a referral</li>
		<li>
if the Assessor intended the referral to be deferred because of the customer's temporary reduced work capacity - supported by other information in the report</li>

<div class="showcont">


<p>See the Medical Conditions section of the report.</p>

<p><strong>Check for manifest eligibility</strong></p>

<p>When an Assessor recommends a recipient is manifestly eligible for Disability Support Pension (DSP), they must record the manifest indicator in the <strong>Medical Conditions</strong> section of the Job Capacity Assessment (JCA) report. This displays in the report as <strong>Recipient meets manifest criteria for category</strong> followed by a specific manifest indicator code.</p>

<p>The codes and corresponding categories are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
B - Permanent Blindness (BLI)</li>
		<li>
T - Terminal Illness (TRM)</li>
		<li>
I - Intellectual Disability (INT)</li>
		<li>
N - Nursing home level of care (NHM)</li>
		<li>
H - Category 4 HIV/AIDS (HV4)</li>
		<li>
P - Disability Pension at special rate (TPI)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where the Assessor correctly records the manifest indicator, it populates the Medical Conditions Summary Screen (<strong>MCSS</strong>) when the JCA report is accepted.</p>

<p>If the JCA referral was for a DSP new claim, in most cases the manifest indicator also triggers the auto-acceptance of the JCA report and the auto-grant of the claim. If the auto-grant fails, refer to the <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03030130-01.html">Assessing eligibility for DSP after DMA</a> Resources page for action required.</p>

<p>If the manifest indicator is not correctly displayed, and the JCA report is accepted by the Service Officer, the recipient will be incorrectly assessed. The claim may be rejected or payment may cancel.</p>

<p>Service Officers <strong>must ensure</strong> the manifest indicator is displaying correctly <strong>before </strong>accepting a JCA report. Where the Assessor has recommended manifest eligibility in the body of the report (such as in the <strong>Remarks</strong> or <strong>Assessment Summary</strong> sections) but the manifest indicator is not displayed in the JCA report, return the report to Assessment Services for correction. The JCA report <strong>must not</strong> be accepted until it correctly reflects the Assessor's recommendation of manifest eligibility.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when returning the report, Service Officers must include 'No Manifest Indicator coded in JCA Report' in the Return free text field. For further details refer to <a href="../people-with-disability/008-06070010-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Accept_or_escal01">Table 4</a>.</p>

<p>If Service Officers identify a claim rejection or payment cancellation has occurred because the manifest indicator has not been correctly coded and applied in the JCA report, the case <strong>must be urgently escalated to</strong> the DIS Portfolio Operations team for investigation and resolution. The email must be titled&#58;</p>

'URGENT ACTION REQUIRED&#58; INCORRECT CAN/REJ OF RECIPIENT MANIFESTLY ELIGIBLE FOR DSP. CRN&#58; 999 999 999A'</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Check Temporary/Permanent, Fully Diagnosed, Treated and Stabilised (FDTS)</strong></p>

<p>Check all verified medical conditions have been recorded as detailed on the medical evidence and the assessment of a condition as Temporary, Permanent but not FDTS, Permanent and FDTS, or manifest is supported by the medical evidence.</p>

<p>When an Assessor has medical evidence to support manifest eligibility for DSP they need to mark the condition as Permanent and Verified by medical evidence. It is not mandatory to mark the condition as FDTS nor enter FDTS work capacities unless the recipient has secondary medical conditions assessed.</p>

<p><strong>For a JCA (or an ESAt upgraded to a JCA)</strong>, check that all medical conditions are recorded under the <strong>Conditions</strong> including&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
all verified conditions (regardless of whether or not they have a functional impact) and recorded as either 'temporary' or 'permanent'</li>
		<li>
all unverified, self-reported or assessor observed conditions; recorded as 'other'</li>
		<li>
permanent conditions that are likely to be ongoing for at least 2 years, should be marked as permanent and verified. The Assessor needs to determine whether any permanent condition is fully diagnosed, fully treated and fully stabilised</li>
		</ul>
<p>Check to identify any significant inconsistency (outside the range of possibility) between medical condition details and the work capacity details.</p>

<p>Check the assessment of the recipient's ability to use public transport without substantial assistance is consistent with report comments about the recipient's mobility.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> this is only a prompt to consider inviting a claim for Mobility Allowance (MOB) and is not a recommendation of eligibility for MOB.</p>

<p>The Assessor records recommended referrals to providers and non-providers (for example, community mental health service) in this section of the report.</p>

<p>There are only limited circumstances in which a referral recommendation may not be stated in the report. This is generally only because the recipient has future work capacity (with intervention) of less than 8 hours per week, and is unable to benefit from referral to any program.</p>

whether a recipient with future work capacity or temporary reduced work capacity of less than 15 hours per week declined the offer of a referral</li>
