<p>Not all hospitals provide the full range of hospital accommodation services that are available e.g. medical care, surgical care, palliative care, sleep disorder, intensive care, cardiac care, psychiatric care, dialysis care.

<p>If all of the service details have been keyed correctly&#58;</p>

If additional information is available from the account documents, use the DVA Hospital Contracts Enquiry HCVS/VAMM System and the DVA hospital item lists to determine the correct accommodation item</li>

<p>Where the system cannot uniquely match the services being processed to a prior approval record and the date of service involved is prior to an existing prior approval record that has no admission date recorded, the message <strong>1-ADM DATE</strong> is displayed and the first item number involved is highlighted.</p>

<p>Service Officers must check the information held on the patient’s prior approval record (<strong>VEPI</strong>) screen to identify any relevant prior approval records.</p>

<p>When identifying relevant PARS records on the VEPI screen, use the following guidelines&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the claim being processed is a new admission, look for a PARS record that has an effective date that is close to the admission date. Old PARS records that have not had discharge dates inserted do not need to be considered for new admissions.</li>
		<li>
If the claim being processed is a continuation claim, look for a PARS record that has an effective date <strong>close</strong> to the admission date shown on the claim form rather than considering the accommodation From date involved</li>
		<li>
If the patient has been transferred to another hospital, look for the <strong>latest</strong> PARS record into which the dates of service shown on the claim form can fall</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> It is possible for a prior approval record with a <strong>later</strong> effective date to be the relevant PARS record. This can occur when the patient is actually admitted to hospital a few days before the effective date of the PARS record.</p>

<p>If there is no prior approval, record available on the system that relates to the admission claimed&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the dates of service are older than 2 weeks from the date of lodgement, reject the services involved with reason code <strong>279</strong> (prior approval not sought item requires prior approval)</li>
		<li>
If the dates of service are within 2 weeks of the date of lodgement, contact Veterans' Affairs Processing Helpdesk to arrange for a prior approval record to be raised</li>
		</ul>
<p>If an approval record is present, but has been rejected e.g. client not eligible, reject the service/s with reason code <strong>289</strong> - prior approval sought but not approved for this item.</p>

<p>If an approval record is not present, email the claim to the VAP Policy Section - Tier 3 for appropriate PARS action. If after 4 weeks DVA have not made a decision regarding the payment of the claim, the claim should be rejected with reason code <strong>279</strong> - DVA Prior Approval not present - contact DVA. See DVA - Provider enquiries for contact details.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if dates are missing on PARS, Service Officers who have the appropriate access can add the admission date via the VAMM transaction.</p>

<p>When a continuation accommodation line is being processed and the dates of service immediately follow those in a previous period of hospitalisation, which has a discharge disposal code, the error message <strong>1-EXP NEW</strong> is displayed and the system highlights the item number and dates of service involved.</p>

<p>Service Officers must examine the account documents and determine the correct admission indicator that applies. Take the following actions&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the account documents indicate a new admission is involved, key admission indicator <strong>N</strong> (new admission) in the <strong>AD</strong> field and continue processing</li>
		<li>
If the account indicates a readmission is involved, key admission indicator <strong>R</strong>  readmission) in the <strong>AD</strong> field and continue processing</li>
		<li>
If the account indicates that the claim is a continuation claim, key admission indicator <strong>R</strong> (readmission) in the <strong>AD</strong> field and continue processing</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when the account documents indicate that the claim is a continuation of a previous claim, it means that the disposal code keyed for the previous period of hospitalisation was incorrect. Keying <strong>R</strong> (readmission) in the <strong>AD</strong> field in this situation ensures that the bed days involved are included as part of the original stepdown counts.</p>

<p>When identifying the PARS records on the <strong>VEPI </strong>screen that need to be considered for the claim being processed, use the following guidelines&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the claim being processed is a new admission, look for a PARS record that has an effective date which is <strong>close</strong> to the admission date. Old PARS records that have not had discharge dates inserted do not need to be considered for new admissions</li>
		<li>
If the claim being processed is a continuation claim, look for a PARS record that has effective date <strong>close</strong> to the admission date shown on the claim form rather than considering the accommodation from date involved</li>
		<li>
If the patient has been transferred to another hospital, look for the <strong>latest</strong> PARS record into which the dates of service shown on the claim form can fall</li>
		</ul>
<p>If there is no prior approval record available on the system which relates to the admission claimed, reject the service involved with reason code <strong>279</strong> (prior approval not sought - item requires prior approval).</p>

<p>If a relevant PARS record has been identified, it should be accessed and the <strong>Comments </strong>field checked. Pressing the <strong>PF5-ACCEPT</strong> key will display further messages identifying why the services do not uniquely match the PARS record involved. </p>

<p>PAR NMCH messages will also appear if there is an open ended prior approval record. Service Officers, who have the VAMM access, must go into the VAMM transaction to end date any open ended prior approval records.

<h3>Online Claims</h3>


<p>The ECLIPSE Online Claiming facility allows providers of hospital services to send messages that contain claims for payment to private health Funds.</p>

<p>It passes signed encrypted messages in XML format via the Internet between the providers, the ECLIPSE workflow engine (the Hub) and the Private Health Funds.</p>

<p>The IHC DVA Online Hospital claiming system utilizes the ECLIPSE framework. Claims can be submitted 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</p>

<p>The Claim ID is generated by the ECLIPSE Hub and transmitted back to the provider once the claim has been successfully received by the mainframe. In order to retrieve the claim ID, the client must retrieve the status report.</p>

<p>The claims submitted by a Hospital provider to DVA through the ECLIPSE system are transmitted in segments. There are 19 types of segments permitted in the IHC. Each segment is distinguished by a three letter abbreviated segment title.</p>

<p>Online Hospital claims are to be accessed using the State Online Source Office Code.</p>

<p>The state online source office codes to be used to request claims from the other States e.g. CVZY, EVZY, KVZY, IVZY, GVZY.</p>

<p>The only field that cannot be edited for online hospital claims processing is the charge. All other fields may be altered to effect processing of the claim.</p>

<p>Additional lines cannot be inserted into online claims. All lines (excluding Cert lines) cannot be deleted.</p>

<p>No claims submitted online should be paid manually.</p>
