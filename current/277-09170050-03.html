<p><strong>Personalised Services managed customer </strong></p>

<p>Immediately contact the Personalised Services Case Manager (PSCM) and inform them of the likely Objection decision. Determine who will discuss the outcome of the Objection with the customer. It may be necessary for a 3 way conversation to ensure the issue is appropriately and sensitively managed.</p>

<p><strong>All other customers</strong></p>

<p>If the objection is unlikely to result in a contrary decision, contact both customers to advise of the likely outcome. Make 3 contact attempts to each parent within 48 hours on all available numbers at different times of the day prior to finalising the objection,</p>

<p>Explain once the decision has been written and processed, the Statement of Reasons (SoR) will be sent to all parties.</p>

<p>Ask the customer if a post decision call is required, if a change is made. If so, create a <strong>Client Call Back</strong> or <strong>Part 6A Call Back</strong> intray with a notepad detailing the request.</p>

<p>If both customers have already been advised the objection was likely to be disallowed and no further information was provided. Only contact the customers again, if a debt is likely to be raised due to the objection decision.</p>

<p>If a debt is likely to be raised, explain to the customer they will be contacted to negotiate the debt once the decision has been processed.</p>

<p><strong>Contrary outcome</strong></p>

<p>If the objection results in an outcome contrary to that sought by the applicant&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
review objection notes to ensure all relevant information and evidence have been considered, and </li>
		<li>
both parties had an opportunity to comment on the information available. </li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Do not</strong> contact the customers prior to finalising the decision to discuss the likely outcome of the objection. This is to ensure that the decision equally considers both parties’ interests and the applicant is not given an unfair opportunity to withdraw the objection to avoid a contrary decision. In these circumstances both parties will be notified about the outcome of the objection after the decision has been finalised. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-09170050-03.html#bp03_tbl_Finalise_and_pr_Step09">Step 9 in Table 4</a>.</p>

<p>For care percentage decisions made after 1 July 2010 (3 March 2011 for WA ex nup) a new care determination can only be made where the existing determination can be revoked. The new care determination commences the day after the existing care determination is revoked.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
he new care percentage determination would change the cost percentage and any interim care period has ended</li>
		<li>
one of the parents who was previously assessed to have at least regular care of the child is now determined to have less than regular care despite the child being made available by the other parent</li>

<p>If the objection was lodged within 28 days of the person being notified of the care percentage decision, then the objection decision will replace the original care percentage decision.</p>

<p>If the objection was lodged outside the 28 day timeframe (90 days for customers in a reciprocating jurisdiction), the customer may ask Child Support to consider special circumstances that impacted on their ability to lodge the objection earlier. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-09170060-03.html">Child Support objection received out of time - Extension of time and Special Circumstance application, Care decisions.</a></p>

<p>When determining the date&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the customer was notified of the care percentage decision, <strong>generally </strong>use the letter issued by Child Support as the first time the customer is notified, even when Centrelink made the original care decision</li>
		<li>
Centrelink notifies shared care decisions in writing to their customers in very limited situations. They do not always notify the other party of the outcome of an original care decision if that person is not getting FTB for the child or the decision is not changed.</li>
		<li>
Therefore, the first notification of a care decision a customer may receive may be the Child Support letter</li>
		<li>
If the customer indicates that Centrelink notified them of the decision before they got the first letter from Child Support (e.g. they were notified by phone) then that date is the date of notification</li>		</ul>

<p>Where the objection results in a decision that is contrary or adverse to the outcome sought by the applicant, the objection decision must be finalised before the customer is informed of the outcome. This means attempts to contact the parties about the decision should only commence the day after the decision has been processed and the letters issued. All contact attempts should be finalised within 3 days of the decision being finalised.</p>

<p>If either party is being managed by a Personalised Services Case Manager (PSCM), immediately contact the PSCM and inform them about the objection decision. Determine who will discuss the outcome of the objection with the customer. It may be necessary for a three-way conversation to occur with the customer so that the issue is appropriately and sensitively managed. The same notification timeframes apply to customers managed by Personalised Services.</p>

<p>Minimum collection activity must be undertaken if a debt has been raised due to the objection.</p>

<p>Use the Statement of Reasons (SoR) to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
explain the decision</li>
		<li>
address the issues and concerns raised (to prevent subsequent reverse workflow from complaints, appeals to the AAT or lengthy repeat phone calls from customers)</li>
		<li>
ensure customers understand this is not an opportunity to have the decision reviewed or changed</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> an Objections Service Officer is <strong>not required</strong> to send a separate ‘Please Contact’ letter if attempts to contact the customer(s) fail.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Unlock customers after these steps are completed by selecting ' <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-30010630-01.html">Ownership Rules</a> '<strong> </strong>in the Customer Transfer window</li>

<p><strong>Part 6A Objections</strong></p>

<p>Must also discuss&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If a customer has multiple cases and not all have been considered through the Objections process, where their adjusted taxable income is likely to increase, discuss with the customer that a ‘Capacity to Pay’ referral may be made to ensure fairness and equity in child support payments across all active cases</li>
		<li>
If the objection decision is likely to decrease their income, discuss with the customer a COA application or potentially an objection to an existing COA decision will be necessary on each of their other active cases if they want this income reflected in the child support assessment</li>
		</ul>
<p>If further action is required for administrative issues (such as non-agency payments, changes in care and estimates of income) identified during the Objections process and not taken into account in the decision, document in an Objections notepad and create a <strong>Part 6A General Follow Up</strong> intray which auto routes for SAS allocation with a notepad detailing the follow up action(s).</p>

<p>Care percentage objections or review decisions made for mutual customers and other affected parties must be applied to both Child Support and Centrelink records and assessments. When Centrelink makes a review decision for a mutual customer, Child Support must apply that decision to each relevant child support assessment.</p>

<p>When Centrelink has made the decision, a <strong>Care - Review of Decision Rcvd</strong> intray should generate when&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a formal review by a Authorised Review Officer (ARO) or a Secretary initiated review by a Subject Matter Expert (ODM) has been finalised</li>
		<li>
an AAT first review of a Centrelink decision has been finalised</li>
		<li>
an AAT second review of a Centrelink decision has been finalised</li>
		</ul>
<p>There will be times when a <strong>Case Review Required</strong> intray generates instead for these decisions. It may also generate if a Secretary Initiated review of a care percentage decision is made by a Service Officer outside the appeals system.</p>

<p>If Child Support becomes aware that a Centrelink review of a care percentage or an AAT review of a Centrelink decision has been finalised, this should be investigated and the decision applied to the Child Support assessment following the same processing steps.</p>

<p>If a Centrelink formal review by an ARO is in progress before a customer lodges an objection with Child Support for the same care percentage decision and the customer has not withdrawn their Child Support objection, Child Support is still required to make an objection decision.</p>

<p>However, as Child Support is unable to change the care percentage determined by the Centrelink review, it will be appropriate to 'hold' the objection until the outcome of the review is known.</p>

<p>If the customer has requested an <strong>explanation</strong> of a care decision from Centrelink and then lodges an objection for the same care decision with Child Support, the objection will continue and the care decision can be changed if appropriate. Notify the Centrelink Officer that an objection will be undertaken, so the decision should not be changed as a result of the Centrelink explanation process.</p>

<p>When Centrelink has finalised the formal review by an ARO or a Secretary initiated review by a SME, the care percentages determined by the Centrelink review must also apply to the child support assessment (subject to the date of effect requirements above). At the same time, the pending Child Support Objection has to be finalised and both parties informed of the decision.</p>

<p>Inform both parties about the objection outcome by sending an MX14-1 Outcome of objection (non-NAP) letter. In the Statement of Reasons use the standard text available on the Child Support Specialised Assessments (SAMP) page under Objection Tools&gt;Objection Letters&gt;Finalising 'duplicate' objections for care percentage decisions</p>
