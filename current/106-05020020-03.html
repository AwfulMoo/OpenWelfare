<strong>Number of working days covered&#58;</strong> field - this is the number of working days for which the payment has been made. The system will automatically apply a 5 day week.

<p>Where an employer states the <strong>redundancy period in hours</strong>, divide the number of hours by the person's average hours worked per day. For example, an employer states 412 hours of 'Redundancy' on the SU1 and it is found the person worked 7.5 hours per day. This would equate to 54.9 days of 'Rec Leave' (<strong>round down</strong> to 54 days).</p>

<p>By coding the leave details on the <strong>IMP</strong> screen, the length and daily affecting amount of income will be calculated automatically (and can be viewed). See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-05020120-01.html">Interaction between waiting and preclusion periods</a>.</p>

<p>If a customer's or their partner's employment is ongoing and they receive a leave payment for a public holiday, this payment should be recorded as employment income on the Employment Income Summary (<strong>EANS/EAPP</strong>) screen.

<p>In <strong>Customer First</strong></p>

Navigate to the <strong>IMP</strong> screen by typing '<strong>IMP</strong>' in the <strong>Nxt&#58;</strong> field of the customer who was paid the termination payment</li>
		<li>
Enter the name of the employer from whom the leave payment was paid in the <strong>Description&#58;</strong> field</li>
		<li>
If known, enter the employee reference number in the <strong>Reference&#58;</strong> field. (optional)</li>
		<li>
Enter the date the leave payment was paid, in the <strong>Date Payt Received&#58;</strong> field, unless customer or their partner is also serving a Liquid Asset Waiting Period (LAWP). In this case the date of commencement of the IMP is the same as the start date of the LAWP. The date received may be any day of the week including weekends</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if leave payments are not paid at the time the claim is assessed, tell the customer to inform within 14 days of receipt.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Enter the type of leave payment in the <strong>Type&#58;</strong> field. If the actual leave type is not presented as an option, code '<strong>REC</strong>' and indicate the correct leave type on the IMP documentation details <strong>Fast Note</strong></li>
		<li>
Enter the number of working days for each leave type in the <strong>No of Days&#58;</strong> field (rounded down to the nearest day unless less than 1 day then round up to 1). If leave payments are shown in weeks, first determine the number of days the customer worked each week and multiply by the number weeks</li>
		</ul>
<p>For example, if the customer or their partner received 4 weeks leave but only worked 3 days a week, a 12 day IMP (2 weeks and 2 days) would be applied</p>

<p>4 (weeks) X 3 (days) = 12 (days) IMP - applying a 5 day week this equates to a 2 week and 2 day IMP. When an employer states the leave period was for <strong>less</strong> than a day, these are the only instances where the leave is rounded up to a day</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Enter the total gross dollar amount for the leave type in the <strong>$ Amount&#58;</strong> field</li>

		<li>
Only round down to the nearest day where leave payments are paid in a lump sum, that is, 4.5 days leave should be rounded down to 4 days and coded on the <strong>IMP</strong> screen</li>
