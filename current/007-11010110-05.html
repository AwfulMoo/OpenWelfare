<p><strong>Do all tax returns need to be lodged for family assistance purposes?</strong></p>

<p>The customer/partner should be advised to visit the ATO website to obtain more information about their tax lodgement requirements.</p>

<p>If required to lodge a tax return for the previous financial year, they must do so for family assistance purposes within the allowable period for the supplements to be included and for a full top-up to be paid, if entitled. Actual income as assessed by the ATO is used to check correct FTB entitlement for a financial year. If actual income details are required but are not available, the full amount of FTB paid for the financial year will need to be repaid.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> providing financial statements to a tax agent/accountant does not constitute lodgement of tax returns. It is the responsibility of the customer to ensure their tax agent/accountant lodges tax returns with the ATO within the allowed period.</p>

<p><strong>An extension has been granted to lodge a tax return</strong></p>

<p>The ATO advises tax agents and accountants that people who have received FTB in a financial year need to lodge by the end of the lodgement year. In limited situations the ATO may grant a lodgement extension.</p>

<p>If a customer or their partner has been granted a lodgement extension by the ATO, details of the extension are not reported to Services Australia. Customers will need to contact the agency to discuss their circumstances and request an extension of time to meet income confirmation requirements for family assistance purposes. From the <strong>2012-13</strong> and subsequent financial years, a special circumstances income lodgement extension may be granted, extending the income lodgement period.</p>

<p>If an income lodgement extension is granted before the non-lodger debt is raised, debt processing will be delayed until after the extension date.</p>

<p>If an overpayment has been raised before a special circumstances income lodgement extension is granted, repayments will continue to be withheld until actual income details have been received.</p>

<p>For FTB top-ups (including supplements) to be paid, tax returns must be lodged by the special circumstances income lodgement extension date.</p>

<p><strong>Why are FTB entitlements sometimes checked using other ATO information?</strong></p>

<p>The ATO transfers details for mutual customers who indicate they are not required to lodge on their last tax return or by lodging an ATO 'Return Not Necessary (RNN)' form.</p>

<p>The ATO also data matches with the agency to decide if customers are required to lodge or not. If they are not required to lodge a tax return, FTB reconciliation may be based on their income estimate for the relevant financial year.</p>

<p>If the ATO advises they are not required to lodge a tax return, a lodgement exemption reason <strong>ATE</strong> will display on the FAO Non-Lodger Exemption (<strong>FNLE</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>If the customer wishes to update the estimate used in the reconciliation process, the estimate can be <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-05030040-01.html">updated on the FIPY screen</a>. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> the new estimate needs to be reasonable.</p>

<p>If the customer or their partner lodges a tax return after a non-lodger advice has been accepted, they should lodge it within the allowable period. When the income details are transferred from the ATO, FTB entitlement will be checked and a letter will be sent to the customer to advise the result. If the returns are lodged late, the customer may incur a debt.</p>
