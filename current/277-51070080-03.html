<p>The customer needs to satisfy MAT to be entitled to more than the base rate of FTB Part A for the child.</p>

<p>The MAT code for the child will automatically update to '<strong>DMA</strong>' (deciding maintenance action) from the date the actual level of care increased to 35% or more.</p>

<p>For retrospective assessments outside the 13 week (91 day) auto processing will register a '<strong>NMA</strong>' (no maintenance action) status from day 92 limiting FTB part A to the base rate. Manual updating of the MAT codes will be required for any periods after day 91 if appropriate maintenance action was in progress or an exemption was applicable.</p>

<p><strong>Child Support care terminating event&#58;</strong> If a care change is advised outside of 26 weeks, the child support assessment may end retrospectively from the day before the care changed under the Child Support care date of effect rules.</p>

<p>If the customer who is now caring for the child claims FTB, they will need to apply for a child support assessment within the 13 week Deciding Maintenance Action (DMA) period if they wish to meet MAT, unless an exemption applies. </p>

<p>For example, Mum and dad have 1 child Charlie. Charlie is in mum’s 100% care. Charlie moves to dad’s 100% care on the 1 March. Dad contacts on 5 October to advise of the care change and to claim FTB. Charlie’s child support assessment is ended from 28 February. A DMA period applies from 1 March for 13 weeks. After the DMA period ends, dad will only meet MAT if he makes an application for a child support assessment. A child support assessment will only begin from the date of application. If dad made an application on 5 October, he will meet MAT from this day but will have failed MAT from the 1 June until the 4 October.</p>

<p>Customers need to contact Child Support to apply for a child support assessment.</p>

<p><img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> Customers may make an application for a child support assessment online via the Services Australia website. Online is the preferred option for child support applications. </p>

<p><strong>Does the customer want to apply right now?</strong></p>

<p>Customers can be warm transferred to Child Support directly via Interaction Workspace (iWS) Softphone. Warm transfer may be a more appropriate action when the customer has no immediate online access and is already receiving FTB A at base rate due to no maintenance action.

<p>From 1 July 2008, where the care of the child is shared, or where the care of the children of the case is split, Child Support will register only 1 child support case instead of two. Both parents will be linked to the case, and Child Support will determine the 'payee' and 'payer'. Even though 1 party may have more than 35% care of a child, they will not need to apply for child support if they are the 'payer' to the case.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the payee requests an end to the child support assessment, the <a href="../separated-parents/277-51130050-03.html#bp03000000_Process">payer may need to apply for a new assessment</a>. If the payee's child support case is ended due to an exemption, e.g. due to family and domestic violence, the payer will not be required to apply for a new child support assessment. The Resources page of <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-51070090-01.html">Exemptions from seeking child support for Family Tax Benefit (FTB) customers</a> has family and domestic violence examples where customers share the care of a child, or have one or more child each in care, and there is only one child support case rather than two.</p>

<p>If both parties have had their circumstances taken in to account for a child support case, both parties are considered to have met the Maintenance Action Test (MAT) for the relevant child/ren. However, there is currently no data electronically received from Child Support to indicate that the child/ren in the paying parent's care are meeting the MAT.</p>

<p><strong>Exception&#58;</strong> if the customer has not taken reasonable steps to change from being the payer under a child support agreement to the payee following a significant change in care, they will fail the MAT. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-51070000-01.html">Maintenance Action Test (MAT) for Family Tax Benefit (FTB) customers</a> for further details on reasonable MAT requirements for these cases.</p>

<p>In the customer's record, update the MAT code to <strong>NMA</strong> from the date it is determined the customer is not taking reasonable action. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-51070030-01.html">Maintenance Action Test (MAT) codes</a> for further details.</p>

<p>As part of their normal 'In Scope' work, the Integrated Care team and Child Support Unit will apply the 'MWP' workaround code for customers impacted by the 'one child support case' issue.</p>

<p>Where it is determined that the Integrated Care Team has recently updated the customer's record and have not updated the MAT details to apply the 'MWP' workaround; send an ACTDOC with relevant information to the Integrated Care Team (region code 'INC') to investigate.</p>

<p>In all other cases, send a <strong>Fast Note</strong> with relevant information to the Child Support Unit. Run the Fast Note application and use the <strong>'CSU update to MAT required</strong>' template. (Fast Note &gt; Families &gt; Update &gt; CSU update to MAT required.)</p>

<p><strong>Keywords</strong>&#58; The 'CSU update to MAT required' template automatically includes the relevant '<strong>ACTCSU</strong>' keyword. If the request is urgent, the '<strong>URGENT</strong>' keyword must be manually added to the Fast Note.</p>

<p>The CSU and Integrated Care Team will investigate each case with Child Support to confirm the customer's details.</p>

<p>Once it has been confirmed with Child Support that the customer and the relevant child/ren have been taken into account for child support purposes, the following workaround is required to increase the paying customer's FTB Part A to more than base rate.</p>

<p>For FTB instalment customers, arrears resulting from a review are limited to the start of the previous financial year.</p>

<p>From March 2012, the automated '<strong>PPW</strong>' code will result in Payers to a child support case automatically passing the Maintenance Action Test (MAT) for their child/ren <strong>in limited circumstances</strong>.</p>

<p>The introduction of the '<strong>PPW</strong>' code will (<strong>in limited circumstances</strong>) result in the 'payer' of a child support case automatically passing the MAT for their child/ren where their FTB claim is finalised <strong>within</strong> the 91 day (13 week) 'Deciding Maintenance Action' (DMA) period and where an active child support case is already in place for the 'payee' of the child support case for the respective child/ren.</p>

<p>A consequential reassessment resulting from a Child Support data load can result in the removal of the 'PPW' code. Once removed, the code cannot be manually reinstated. Where 1 of these records is identified and the customer remains 'payer' to a child support case, the 'MWP' code (Manual workaround - Pass MAT test) will need to be applied in these cases by either the Child Support Unit (CSJ) or the Integrated Care Team (INC).</p>

<p>A long term solution is not yet available.</p>

<p>If the customer cannot be identified as Payer to the child support case at the time their FTB claim is finalised, they will continue to have the '<strong>DMA</strong>' applied for 91 days (13wks) commencing from the later of&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
date the child was born</li>
		<li>
date the care of the child increased to 35% or more</li>
		<li>
date of separation from the child's other parent</li>
		<li>
date the child entered their care</li>
		</ul>
<p>At the end of the '<strong>DMA</strong>' period, the customer will automatically fail the MAT.</p>

<p>As part of their normal 'In Scope' work, the Integrated Care team and Child Support Unit will apply the 'MWP' workaround code for customer's identified as impacted by the '1 child support case' issue.</p>

<p>Where it is determined that the Integrated Care Team has recently updated the customer's record and have not updated the MAT details to apply the 'MWP' workaround; send an ACTDOC with relevant information to the Integrated Care Team (region code 'INC') to investigate.</p>

<p>In all other cases, send a <strong>Fast Note</strong> with relevant information to the Child Support Unit. Run the Fast Note application and use the <strong>'CSU update to MAT required</strong>' template.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
Update the maintenance action code for the relevant child/ren to '<strong>MWP</strong>' (Manual workaround - Pass MAT test) from the relevant date. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> the date generally should not be any earlier than 1 July of the previous financial year. However, if the customer previously met the MAT due to ‘<strong>PPW</strong>’ and this code was retrospectively deleted, FTB re-reconciliation debts may result due to the customer failing the MAT. In this case, commence a refresh activity on the BA screen and code ‘<strong>MWP</strong>’ from the original ‘<strong>PPW</strong>’ date. This should resolve the re-reconciliation debts due to the MAT failure</li>
		<li>
To ensure the '<strong>MWP</strong>' exemption code is not applied indefinitely, the <strong>MWP</strong> must be reviewed. A review must be set for 12 months from the date '<strong>MWP</strong>' is coded. Upon expiry of the 12 month review, if the use of the '<strong>MWP</strong>' code is still appropriate, a further 12 monthly review must be coded</li>
		<li>
If the group does not show Payer details, update the Find Payer (<strong>MNFP</strong>) screen with the other parent's CRN</li>

<p>If a customer who is a payer under an initiating binding child support agreement has an FTB child and their level of care increases to more than 65%, the agreement may end or be suspended for a period. In these cases, the customer will need to take reasonable maintenance action.</p>

When an initiating agreement is suspended for a child, the parent with increased care (above 65%) of the child is unable to apply to receive child support until the current agreement based assessment ends.

When an initiating agreement is ended for a child, the case for the child will end. The parent with increased care (above 65%) of the child must apply for an administrative assessment (or an exemption, if applicable) in order to satisfy the MAT</li>
