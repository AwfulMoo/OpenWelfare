funds have been sent to an incorrect TPO</li>

the customer is no longer able to access the TPO, for example has had a change of address which no longer makes the TPO accessible</li>

the good/services required by the customer are no longer available from the TPO</li>

<p>Determine whether the customer meets the criteria for an urgent re-credit of their Income Management funds.</p>

<p>Income Management funds can be re-credited immediately in the following limited circumstances&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
administrative error for example sent to incorrect TPO or system fault for example duplicate payments, or</li>
		<li>
the customer needs to meet priority expenses because of a relocation which has been caused by exceptional and unforeseen circumstances, for example, care of ill or disabled relative, family and domestic violence and all of the following are met to show that the customer has no funds available to meet the immediate priority need&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
there are no unallocated Income Management balance that can be used to meet the immediate priority need</li>
			<li>
the BasicsCard balance is not sufficient to meet the immediate priority need</li>
			<li>
no access to existing discretionary fund allocations (check the customer's payment delivery date, for example have they just received a payment, or are they due to receive one?)</li>
			<li>
the expense cannot be met through a referral to an external service</li>
			<li>
they do not have a partner with an unallocated Income Management balance or BasicsCard balance sufficient to meet the immediate priority need</li>
			<li>
there is no history of requesting immediate re-credits</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>Does the customer meet the criteria for an immediate re-crediting of funds?</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>, advise customer&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
There <strong>may</strong> be grounds for an immediate re-crediting of the funds and their request will be referred for assessment. They will be contacted once a decision has been made. Ensure the customer's contact details are up to date. Assessments for urgent recoveries are completed by APS6 Team Leaders or higher in National Business Gateway (NBGRT) Recoveries and Debt Team</li>
			<li>
Ensure any other business or referrals the customer requires are completed prior to commencing this process</li>

		<li>
<strong>No</strong>, advise customer&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
An immediate re-crediting cannot be done</li>

If the customer still requires the funds to be recalled, ensure any other business or referrals the customer requires are completed prior to commencing this process.
