<P><STRONG>Employers querying multiple claims during outbound calls</STRONG></P>
<P>The purpose of an outbound call to an employer is to inform or remind them about information required for a specific BAC or CAC claim. Apply discretion, when providing further assistance to an employer asking them about other claims.</P>
<P>Where the employer asks about multiple claims, they should be advised that each claim will be reviewed on its own merits and that they will be contacted where more information is required.</P>
<P>If they feel that they have made an error with multiple claims, they should be encouraged to contact the Apprenticeship Wage Subsidy line to discuss these circumstances further.</P>
<P>Multiple claims for the same employer may be allocated together to staff for action. Each claim will need to be individually reviewed on its own merits, and actions taken must be recorded in the <STRONG>Service Notes</STRONG>.</P>
<P>The Work Allocation list will identify employers that have submitted multiple claims. This is known as a bundle. When staff are allocated a bundle:</P>
<UL>
<LI>assign your logon ID against the employer for up to a maximum of 10 claims</LI>
<LI>make one outbound call to the employer to cover all of the claims requiring outbound contact</LI>
<LI>action these claims as per normal processes, and</LI>
<LI>indicate on the Work Allocation list the outcome against each individual claim</LI></UL>

<P>On 2 April 2022, Jeremy submitted a BAC claim for wages paid to an apprentice employed in their business during the 1 January 2022 to 31 March 2022 claiming period.</P>
<P>Jeremy attaches a wage report as wage evidence. The wage report shows $5000 in gross wages paid from 25 December 2021 to 24 April 2022. Jeremy completes the wage evidence section of the claim form, advising:</P>

<LI><STRONG>date to:</STRONG> 24 April 2022</LI>

<P>As training evidence does not need to be attached, Jeremy completes the rest of the BAC claim form and submits the claim. The claim is not automated and is allocated to a Service Officer to verify the evidence.</P>
<P>The Service Officer correctly marks the claim <STRONG>Eligible</STRONG> because the <STRONG>Date from</STRONG>, <STRONG>Date to</STRONG> and gross <STRONG>Amount</STRONG> contained in the wage evidence match the information in the BAC claim, in addition to matching the apprentice name, business name and ABN.</P>
