	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Section 87A of the National Health Act 1953 sets out the circumstances in which a person is entitled to claim a refund for PBS medicines from Services Australia.</p>

<p>A person can request a PBS patient refund if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they did not show their Medicare card or concession card when they purchased the medicine at the pharmacy</li>
		<li>
they spent over their yearly PBS Safety Net threshold and have continued to pay more for their medicine than they are required to, or</li>
		<li>
they were entitled to receive their medicine at a discounted rate as an eligible patient under the Closing the Gap (CTG) – PBS Co-payment Measure</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> all eligible visitors covered under the Reciprocal Health Care Agreements (RHCA) are entitled to PBS patient refunds</p>

<p>In some situations, patient refunds have to be processed manually. For example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
refunds outside the current PBS Safety Net year where a safety net card has not been issued</li>
		<li>
refunds for RHCA visitors from New Zealand or the Republic of Ireland (Southern Ireland), where a Medicare card cannot be issued</li>
		</ul>
<p>For information on how to process a PBS patient refund manually, see <a href="../your-health/011-60020060-01.html">Manually process a claim for PBS patient refund</a>.</p>

<p>RHCA visitors are not entitled to claim section 100 In-Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) medicines, with a date of supply on or after 1 November 2017, unless the patient has made an ‘exceptional circumstances’ application to the Department of Health and Aged Care.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Calculating_the">Calculating the refundable amount</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Section 87A of the National Health Act 1953 states the refundable amount is the difference between the patient's contribution and the Commonwealth dispensed price, as listed in the Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits.</p>

<p>When calculating the amount to refund for a claim with expenses over 2 years old, the Service Officer will need to email PBS Helpdesk and request confirmation whether a previous refund was processed for the expenses. This is because data is only visible for Service Officers for the current 2 year period.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the 'duplicate claim' message displays while processing the patient refund, the Service Officer must review the possible duplicate claim prior to closing the message.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Patients applying for a refund are not reimbursed for any of the following charges (or any part of these charges) which were included in the price that they paid for their PBS/Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (RPBS) medicine, as they do not form part of the Commonwealth price&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Additional ready prepared (RP) fee</li>
		<li>
Additional extemporaneously prepared (EP) fee</li>
		<li>
Allowable extra fee</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the above charges are allowable fees that the pharmacist can charge general patients paying up to the general patient contribution.</p>

<p><strong>Brand price premium (price depends on the individual medicine)</strong></p>

<p>Some brands of medicine cost more than others. When the patient receives a more expensive brand, the refund is based on the price of the cheapest brand, and the difference is <strong>not refundable</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Therapeutic premium (price depends on the individual medicine)</strong></p>

<p>Some brands of medicine cost more than others. When the patient receives the more expensive medicine, the refund is based on the price of the cheapest similar medicine, and is <strong>not refundable</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Special patient contribution (SPC)</strong></p>

<p>Selected PBS items attract a SPC that is payable by all patients in addition to the relevant patient contribution and is not refundable.</p>

<p>The <a href="../your-health/011-60020010-04.html">References</a> page contains legislation relevant to calculating the refundable amount for PBS.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Patients who submit a PBS refund and receive a discount on their co-payment, will have their refund calculated using the discount co-payment amount.</p>

<p>For example, when a concessional patient does not have their concessional card at the pharmacy and the pharmacist then charges the patient the general contribution rate minus the allowable discount of $1.00, based on 2020 figures this would mean the patient paid $5.60 including the $1.00 discount. The patient is then entitled to a patient refund from Services Australia for the actual contribution paid by the patient being the discounted amount of $5.60 (less any premiums).</p>

<p>When a patient cannot satisfy a pharmacist of their eligibility, they may be charged the full price of the medicine including allowable pharmacy fees, which are non-refundable. The patient can then apply to Services Australia, through a Medicare Service Centre or Smart Centre, for a refund of the difference between the patient contribution amount that they should have paid and the subsidy, or Commonwealth price of the medicine (less any brand price or therapeutic group premium).</p>

<p>Services Australia can only pay refunds for PBS items supplied through approved suppliers. Refunds for hospital supplied items should be referred to the relevant State or Territory hospital or health department.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p><strong>Power of Attorney (POA)</strong></p>

<p>POA, Guardianship Orders and Administration Orders give people the legal authority to act on behalf of someone else. The difference between these types of documents is the way in which a person has been appointed to act on behalf of another individual.</p>

<p><strong>Type of appointments</strong></p>

<p>An <strong>individual</strong> can appoint someone as a <strong>POA</strong> to act on their behalf in specified circumstances.</p>

<p>A <strong>court or tribunal</strong> can appoint someone to act as the <strong>legal guardian or administrator</strong> of an individual who is unable to manage all or some of their affairs due to accident, illness, disability or mental incapacity.</p>

<p>POA, Guardianship Orders and Administration Orders will vary on a case by case basis. This means each new document needs to be considered in order to determine whether it allows a person to do business with Services Australia on behalf of someone else.</p>

<p>Where documents for POA, Guardianship Order or Administration Order are presented at a Services Australia for Medicare purposes, the details are recorded in the POA details section in Consumer Directory Maintenance System (CDMS). If the claimant has given permission to use this information it can be used to confirm the POA arrangement. Only PBS Service Officers with the established or experiences skill tag can add, amend, or alter POA details in CDMS.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> POA documents sighted must be original or a certified copy of an original.</p>

<p>A POA drawn up in one state is acceptable nationwide for the purposes of a PBS patient refund, unless it is set out in the POA that it is restricted to the state of origin.</p>

<p>If a POA has been drafted in another country, it must be verified and confirmed by an Australian legal entity (lawyer, solicitor etc.). Written advice by the legal entity must state that the POA is acceptable in Australia and must accompany the POA document.</p>

<p><strong>Executor</strong></p>

<p>The Executor is a person or a company that has been appointed within the terms of the patient’s last Will and Testament.</p>

<p>If the Executor provides the correct documentation with the claim, check CDMS to see if the banking details match. If they match, process the claim and it will be paid into the bank account details recorded with Medicare.  If the banking details are different, and the identity of the executor has been confirmed (see <a href="../your-health/011-60020010-01.html#bp01_L2GT_Claiming_for_a_">Claiming for a deceased person</a>), proficient Service Officers who have the experienced or established skill tag will add the details in CDMS. </p>

<p>Service Officers not trained in this process should <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-06060000-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Managing_work_u">unassign the work item</a> with the reason Proficiency Raised so that trained Service Officers can update the CDMS record.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Executor documents sighted must be original or a certified copy of an original.</p>

<p><strong>Definitions of terms</strong></p>

<p>The following is a list of definitions related to POA, Guardianship Orders, Administration Orders&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>POA</strong>&#58; a written document given by one person to another authorising them to act for him/her on their behalf</li>
		<li>
<strong>Executor&#58;</strong> the role of the executor is to manage the estate within the terms of the Last Will and Testament, and protect the assets of the estate</li>
		<li>
<strong>Guardianship and Administration Orders</strong>&#58; a written document given by a court or tribunal appointing a legal guardian or administrator to act on behalf of an individual</li>
		<li>
<strong>Attorney</strong>&#58; the person authorised to act (also called donee)</li>
		<li>
<strong>Donor</strong>&#58; the person who has given the POA, that is, the person for whom another person is acting</li>
		<li>
<strong>Donee</strong>&#58; the person authorised to act (also called attorney)</li>
		<li>
<strong>Jointly and severally</strong>&#58; the attorneys can make decisions together or separately</li>
		<li>
<strong>Severally</strong>&#58; any one of the attorneys can make decisions independently of the other attorneys</li>
		<li>
<strong>Jointly</strong>&#58; the attorneys must agree on all decisions</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>New POA</strong></p>

<p>A certified copy of a POA is acceptable.</p>

<p>Where a person presents a POA to Services Australia, Service Officers must examine the document to determine that the&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
POA is not for a specific purpose, such as&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Health - this refers to medical treatment or a decision made in relation to medical treatment. This does not authorise a person to interact with Services Australia</li>
			<li>
Conveyancing - this refers to the sale, purchase or rental of a property. This does not authorise a person to interact with Services Australia</li>		</ul>
		<li>
POA is enduring (permanent), general, financial or limited - usually found on the front of the document</li>
			<ul>			<li>
A general POA may be for specific periods or events and usually have an end date</li>
			<li>
Financial POA allows interaction with Services Australia</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Donee&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Has expressly consented to act and accepts appointment as attorney. This is found in a signed statement, usually at the back of the POA</li>
			<li>
Signature is witnessed by a third party. In some cases, 2 independent witnesses (cannot be witnessed by the donor)</li>
			<li>
Cannot witness the donor's signature</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Donor's signature requires 2 independent witnesses. If there is only 1 witness and the form allows for 1 witness, this is acceptable to Services Australia</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> where the power has been given to more than one donee, these details must be recorded in the <strong>POA</strong> field in CDMS for Services Australia. A <strong>POA</strong> is not valid when the donor is deceased. Where a POA states or indicates that it only becomes valid where the donor has become incapacitated contact Health Service Delivery (HSD) Eligibility for assistance. It is necessary to sight a letter from a medical practitioner which attests to this fact. Where a letter is not provided, the POA details will not be included on the donor's record in the Consumer Directory Maintenance System (CDMS).</p>

<p><strong>Guardianship and Administration Orders</strong></p>

<p>A certified copy of a Guardianship Order or an Administration Order is acceptable.</p>

<p>Guardianship and Administration Orders must be noted under POA in the Consumer Directory Maintenance System (CDMS).</p>

<p>Where an individual is unable to manage all or some of their affairs a court or tribunal can make orders appointing a legal guardian or administrator to manage all or some of their affairs.</p>

<p>A person who has been appointed an administrator under a Guardianship Order or an Administration Order is treated in the same manner as a person appointed under a POA.</p>

<p>The legal guardian, administrator or manager may be either&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
an individual</li>
		<li>
two or more people appointed together or separately</li>
		<li>
a legal entity such as the Public Trustee</li>
		</ul>
<p>Service Officers must examine documentation to determine&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
whether the order is not for a specific purpose. If the order is for a specific purpose, then it does not affect Services Australia</li>
		<li>
if the order specifies a time period, limitation or conditions</li>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A claim for PBS patient refund can be made on behalf of a deceased person where the appropriate documentation can be provided. Service Officers must check the deceased’s personal comments in CDMS to see if confirmation of identity for the executor or appointed administrator have been previously provided.</p>

<p>If CDMS does not confirm this information then appropriate documentation must be provided with the claim form. The person needs to prove their identity and provide documentation showing they are the executor or the appointed administrator for the deceased, such as&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the Last Will and Testament naming the Executor of the estate, or</li>
		<li>
the Letter of Administration naming the Appointed Administrator</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> executor documents sighted must be original or a certified true copy of an original.</p>

<p>When updating POA details in CDMS, Service Officers must add a comment on the deceased’s record in CDMS to record notification of documentation by the executor or appointed administrator. The executor, or the appointed administrator, is not required to provide a certified true copy of the Last Will and Testament or the Letter of Administration each time they claim.</p>

<p>For more information about executors, see <a href="../your-health/011-60020010-01.html#bp01_L2GT_Power_of_Attorn">Power of Attorney, Guardianship, Administrative Orders, Executor</a>.</p>

<p>Where a request is made to use the deceased’s bank account details, Service Officers should inform the executor or the appointed administrator that if the bank account has been closed by the financial institution the electronic funds transfer (EFT) payment will automatically be rejected. If the deceased’s bank account has not been closed, the Medicare benefit may be paid into the bank account. However, the executor or the appointed administrator should check with the financial institution to confirm access to the funds will be possible.</p>

<p>When processing a PBS patient refund and the executor or appointed administrator advises to use the nominated bank account stored in CDMS for the deceased, proceed with the refund steps as normal.</p>

<p>If the banking details provided by the executor or appointed administrator differ from those recorded in CDMS, proficient Service Officers who have the experienced or established skill tag will add/amend the details in CDMS. </p>

<p>Service Officers not trained in this process should <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-06060000-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Managing_work_u">unassign the work item</a> with the reason <strong>Proficiency Raised</strong> so that trained Service Officers can update the CDMS record.</p>

<p><strong>Missing entitlement identification (ID)</strong></p>

<p>When the entitlement ID is missing from a line entry on the claim form, and when another entry on the form for the same patient has an entitlement ID, the Service Officer can assume that ID relates to the other entries.
