<p>Complaints Officers may receive correspondence or phone calls from customers who have been placed on restricted service by Personalised Service (PS). See <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-17021300-03.html#bp03_L3ST_Proposingrevie">Personalised Services</a>. Check the Profile window for the restriction detail for advice on managing these cases.</p>

<p>All communication with the customer must adhere to the restricted service arrangements. If the customer has not made contact in accordance with the restriction, remind the customer of the decision as outlined in correspondence sent to them. For example, if a customer who is restricted to 'write only’ is transferred to the Specialised Complaints queue, advise them they need to raise any issues in writing. Tell the customer the call will be ended, no further discussion should be entered into. End the call.</p>

<p>Document the call in the PS stacking document in the Communication window. Use after call work so this is done immediately and advise the Personalised Services Service Officer (PSSO) of the customer contact.</p>

<p><strong>PS managed case</strong> <strong>-</strong> If a customer lodges a complaint within their service restriction requirements, check the Restricted Services Agreement as there may be certain issues the customer has been instructed that they cannot re-raise.</p>

<p>If the customer is raising issues that have previously been addressed, remind them of the restriction on that particular issue. Any new issues raised should be managed by the PSSO to as a Level 1 complaint.</p>

<p>If a customer lodges a complaint regarding the decision to restrict their service&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The customer needs to adhere to their restriction in lodging the complaint for example if the restriction is 'write only’, the complaint must be in writing</li>
		<li>
If a complaint has already been lodged regarding the restriction before loading the complaint. Do not load another level 2 complaint if there is an open complaint about the same issue</li>
		<li>
If this is the first complaint regarding the restriction, liaise with the PS SSM regarding the reasons for the restriction and the agreed complaint outcome</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> a customer with a restricted servicing arrangement can make a request for the restriction to be reviewed at any time. The request for a review of the decision must be in writing and addressed to the National Manager, Customer Service.</p>

<p>Contact the Personalised Services Service Officer (PSSO) before recording the complaint to determine how the customer’s issues will be managed. It is important to consider the PS approach when managing complaints from a PS customer.</p>

<p>If the PSSO is to manage the customer’s issues, then record the customer’s call in the PS Stacking document or record a Level 1 complaint for the PSSO. Include in the document that the matter has been referred to PS for management.</p>

<p>If the complaint is to be managed as a Level 2 complaint by a Complaints Officer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Discuss any proposed actions with the PSSO to ensure they are consistent with the existing Managed Service Plan (MSP)/Personalised Services Plan (PSP)</li>
		<li>
Any written responses to the customer must be reviewed by the PSSO prior to sending. Email a copy of the letter to the PSSO and copy in the relevant PS SSM requesting approval of the letter within 2 working days. If approval is not received within 2 working days, follow up with the PS SSM</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Repeat calls from PS Customers</strong></p>

<p>For repeat callers, Complaints and PS leadership staff will liaise to develop a customer management strategy. A PS SSM will send an email to the Complaints teams advising of the agreed strategy for the customer and any specific message to be relayed to the customer. For example 'their PSSO is investigating the issues raised and will provide an outcome by a determined day/time'. Specific details will also be recorded in the Profile window.</p>

<p>Follow the agreed strategy as outlined in the email and profile window. If the instructions state the customer is to be immediately transferred to the PSSO or PS SSM do not engage in lengthy discussions with the customer – refer them straight to their PSSO.</p>

<p>Discuss the call with the Complaints SSM to enable PS and Complaints to work collaboratively and determine if a new Level 2 complaint will be taken. </p>

<p>Staff behaviour complaints specifically relate to the way a staff member interacted with the customer, for example a staff member was rude, aggressive, or made inappropriate comments. Ask clarifying questions and confirm the complaint is about the Service Officer’s behaviour as opposed to their actions or process.</p>

<p>There are instances where a Level 2 Complaints Officer investigates a behavioural complaint. This may occur in where sensitivity or complexity apply. In these circumstances the Complaints Officer will listen to the call recording.  All other behaviour complaints should be referred to the Service Officer’s Team Leader.</p>

<p>Assertive behaviour may be perceived by the customer as threatening. For example, a customer may state a Service Officer was threatening in their behaviour because they said they were going to take enforcement action. An explanation of Child Support collection and enforcement policy and the reason enforcement action would be taken, may be an appropriate way to resolve the issue.</p>

<p>Level 2 behavioural complaints are recorded using either of the following category and complaint issues.</p>

<p><strong>Quality of Service  - Bias</strong></p>

<p><strong>Lack of courtesy - Perception of bias</strong></p>

<p>When a customer makes a behavioural complaint&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
consider a well-placed and appropriate apology. An apology should be timed appropriately - not delayed where possible and appropriate, sympathy and an explanation may be more appropriate. The <a href="../separated-parents/277-09020030-05.html">Resources</a> page contains a link to the NSW Ombudsman guide to an apology</li>
		<li>
document sufficient specific information to enable the behavioural complaint to be investigated, but minimal information about the Service Officer (first name, team and site only)</li>
		<li>
explain to the customer that the complaint about behaviour will be referred to the relevant staff member’s Team Leader. The complaint will be managed internally and no further feedback will be provided to the customer. If the customer does not accept this remedy the Level 2 Officer is then responsible for updating the customer about the behavioural complaint outcome</li>
		</ul>
<p>Contact the Services Officer’s Team Leader to advise of the complaint, discuss the complaint issues and timeframes for resolution. Create a complaint follow up intray and route to the relevant staff member’s Team Leader for management of the behavioural aspect of the customer complaint. Record in the complaint notes the actions taken. The Level 2 Officer will not finalise the Level 2 complaint until the Team Leader has actioned the behavioural aspect of the customer’s complaint.</p>

<p>The Team Leader review must include listening to the relevant call recordings, providing feedback to their staff as appropriate and documenting action taken into the complaint notepad.</p>

<p>The Team Leader will record the following information in the Level 2 complaint notepad&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Date call recording reviewed – date call recording listened to by the Team Leader</li>
		<li>
Officer completing – Team Leader’s first name/team/site</li>
		<li>
Outcome summary – upheld/not upheld, any comments</li>
		</ul>
<p>When finalising the complaint, record the remedy of the behavioural complaint as 'REFER TO OWNING TEAM TO ACTION' and the outcome is to be recorded by the Level 2 Service Officer after the Team Leader has documented their findings. Continue to manage all other complaint issues raised by the customer to resolution.</p>

<p><strong>Feedback for behavioural complaints</strong></p>

<p>Team leaders who manage behavioural complaints about their staff provide feedback as appropriate. Documentation in Cuba should only reflect that the customer’s behavioural complaint has been actioned. The Team Leader processes the behavioural complaint outcome in Cuba without finalising the complaint. The Level 2 officer will finalise the complaint in Cuba.</p>

<p>If a customer or staff member’s privacy may have been compromised by unauthorised access to information or other fraudulent activity see <a target="_blank" href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-09110000-01.html">Report Suspected Fraud and Corruption</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the complaint issues relate to an allegation of staff fraud, the Complaints Officer must advise the Team Leader of the complaint details. The Team Leader will evaluate if further escalation is needed.</p>

<p>If a customer lodges a complaint about a DPO clarify if the customer is requesting for the DPO to be revoked or if they are applying for a Departure Authorisation Certificate (DAC). Refer all requests to the DPO Team Leader. The Team Leader will allocate within the DPO team to prepare a submission recommending the revocation the DPO or issuing of a DAC where the conditions have been met, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-04130000-01.html">Departure Prohibition Orders (DPO) for Child Support customers</a>. Liaise with the DPO Team Leader through this period.</p>

<p>If the customer is subject to a DPO but is not managed by a DPO Team for example the customer is being managed in PS, refer the request to the Program Manager - DPO, Child Support Intensive Collection Services. For more information see <a href="../separated-parents/277-04130000-01.html">Departure Prohibition Orders (DPO) for Child Support customers</a>.</p>

<p>The Child Support Indigenous Team provides access to Child Support services for Indigenous customers needing extra support. The team assists Indigenous customers resolve complex Child Support enquiries in real time or by accessing digital services. The team focuses on&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
supporting customers in applying for Child Support who may or have had difficulty doing so, that is failing the Maintenance Action Test</li>
		<li>
negotiating payment arrangements and collection activities</li>
		<li>
achieving accurate assessments by updating care or income details</li>
		</ul>
<p>Generally, customers are referred to the Child Support Indigenous Team when there are language, accessibility barriers or complex matters requiring an assisted level of service. Multiple refused applications for Child Support may be an indicator for a referral.</p>

<p><strong>How can customers be referred to this team?</strong></p>

<p>Service Officers, Social Workers and Remote Service Teams are able to refer an Indigenous customer, see Complaints - Level 2 Complaints for contact details.</p>

<p>The Australian Government guidelines on the recognition of Sex and Gender apply to all Australian Government departments and agencies that maintain personal records (including employee records) and collect sex or gender information. </p>

<p>The guidelines outline a consistent standard of evidence when gender is being verified or changed. The guidelines also define the gender classifications of male (m), female (f) and non-binary (x). A person of non-binary gender does not exclusively identify as either male or female. </p>

<p><strong>Assisting transgender, intersex and non-binary customers</strong></p>

<p>People who identify with a gender other than the sex they were assigned at birth or who do not identify exclusively with 1 sex, can request to have this reflected on their records. The <a target="_blank" class="extwebsitelink" href="https&#58;//www.ag.gov.au/Publications/Documents/AustralianGovernmentGuidelinesontheRecognitionofSexandGender/AustralianGovernmentGuidelinesontheRecognitionofSexandGender.PDF">Australian Government Guidelines on the Recognition of Sex and Gender</a> have standardised the evidence required for a person to change their sex/gender in personal records held by Australian Government departments and agencies. </p>

<p>When assisting customers to update their gender details, be aware of issues that may include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
identification difficulties</li>
		<li>
the need to address the customer by their preferred name and title in line with Our Service Commitments </li>
		</ul>
<p>Level 2 Complaints Officers&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Receive complaints from customers who raise concerns about gender issues via warm transfer from Level 1 staff if they have been unable to resolve the matter at first contact</li>
		<li>
May be required to consider gender in relation to complaints, see the Intranet page Gender Guidelines. The <a href="../separated-parents/277-09020030-05.html">Resources</a> page has a link to Gender Guidelines</li>
		<li>
Offer to have the customer's details updated in all service brands (Centrelink, Medicare and Child Support). If accepted by the customer, the Complaints Officer notifies their Manager who will liaise with their equivalent in the other service brands to ensure the update is completed</li>
		<li>
Offer a <a target="_blank" href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-12000000-01.html">referral to a social worker</a> if appropriate</li>

<p>Complaints are escalated to Level 2 when they are about Australian Taxation Office (ATO) issues or there is a need to collaborate with the ATO about a complaint for the benefit of mutual customers. When the ATO issue cannot be resolved administratively the complaint is escalated by&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Level 1 staff, under escalation reason 5 – Complex, cross programme or multiple issues</li>
		<li>
Personalised Services Service Officers or External Complaints – Child Support (ExCCS) Service Officers, via the Agency/ATO Complaint Support Template, the <a href="../separated-parents/277-09020030-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Template">Resources</a> page includes a link to the template</li>
		</ul>
<p>Liaison with the ATO is managed by the escalated complaints team. This ensures customers are given correct and consistent advice, administrative options are considered and customers are only required to liaise with 1 department to have their issues resolved.</p>

<p><strong>Explore administrative options</strong></p>

<p>Complaint Officers must attempt to resolve an ATO complaint using administrative options, current complaint handling procedures and protocols and by seeking technical advice where appropriate.</p>

<p>This includes reviewing the status of the 'Client of Interest' indicator on the customer’s income screen, to ensure the indicator is set correctly. Client of Interest indicator options are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
0 – No information is required from the ATO</li>
		<li>
1 – Refund and income information is required from the ATO</li>
		<li>
2 – Income information only is required from the ATO</li>
		</ul>
<p>Use the ATO system, ICP, to gather all relevant information prior to engaging with the ATO for additional support. For information about ICP searches see&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
ICP Manual link on the Business Systems Interface (BSI) Section HSI page</li>
		<li>
<a href="../separated-parents/277-04370010-03.html">External searches guide - General searches Level 1 - ICP search</a></li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Check for Systemic Issues</strong></p>

<p>Check Network News Update (NNU) for issues associated with ATO income transfers and whether any bulk fixes or workarounds will be implemented.  The Technical Support Team can also provide information and assistance on systemic issues. Systemic issues have the potential to impact large groups of customers and may create financial hardship.</p>

<p><strong>Implement resolution</strong></p>

<p>An administrative resolution to a complaint will be possible in some circumstances, such as when an amended adjusted taxable income (ATI) is due in whole or in part to a change to at least 1 of the 'other income components' of a parent’s ATI. For child support purposes these include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
reportable fringe benefits</li>
		<li>
target foreign income</li>
		<li>
total net investment loss</li>
		<li>
specified tax free pensions or benefits</li>
		<li>
reportable superannuation contributions</li>
		</ul>
<p>Services Australia can amend a child support assessment to use the amended other income components of the parent’s ATI, such as where the ATO amends the parent’s reportable fringe benefits amount. See <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-07010010-01.html">Australian Tax Office (ATO) income for Child Support customers</a> for information about ATO amended incomes.</p>

<p>If an amendment of a parent’s income is due in whole or part to a change to at least 1 of the other income components a correcting errors submission and Cuba Incident Form (CIF) is required, see <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-09030020-01.html">Correcting a complex Child Support error</a>.</p>

<p>To update a customer's ATI, including another income component, see&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-07010010-01.html">Australian Tax Office (ATO) income for Child Support customers</a> for information about the date of effect of an amended income</li>

		</ul>
<p><strong>Referral to Personalised Services</strong></p>

<p>While the ATO complaint issue is investigated and an outcome provided, the correction to the customer’s assessment may take some time. In the interim refer the customer to Personalised Services for ongoing management and support.</p>

<p><strong>Personalised Services and ExCCS referral for ATO liaison</strong></p>

<p>Personalised Services Service Officers and ExCCS Service Officers request contact with the ATO by emailing the <a href="../separated-parents/277-09020030-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Template">Agency/ATO Complaint Support Template</a> to ATO complaints, see Complaints - Level 2 Complaints. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between Services Australia and the ATO makes provision for urgent enquiries, including sensitive complaints from vulnerable customers. If a request is urgent the Personalised Services Service Officer or ExCCS Service Officer will forward the template and phone the Complaints Program Manager to request a more immediate response. The Complaints Program Manager will liaise directly with the ATO liaison officer if required.</p>

<p>The Personalised Services Service Officer or ExCCS Service Officer will obtain permission from the customer for Services Australia to contact the ATO, <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/expired/277-09070000-expired-27032017-03.html#bp03070000_Customer_contact_for">see Personalised Services - Customer contact for Personalised services table</a> - Step titled Discussion points.</p>

<p><strong>Approval required before ATO contact</strong></p>

<p>If unable to resolve the complaint administratively the Complaints Officer must obtain written approval from the Complaints Service Support Manager (SSM) and approval from the customer before requesting information from the ATO.</p>

<p>To seek approval from the customer for Services Australia to contact the ATO&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>

<p>A Service Officer does not have authorisation or delegation to override the decision of the original decision maker. However, it may be appropriate to make a new decision, for example negotiate a new payment arrangement or correct an error to resolve the complaint. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-09030000-01.html">Correcting errors on Child Support cases</a>.</p>

<p>Where a decision has been made to uphold a complaint issue on the basis that an inappropriate decision has been made, for example inappropriate payment arrangement, EW not implemented, s72A notice issued prematurely, discuss the original decision with the relevant Team Leader and negotiate a new arrangement where appropriate. If unable to reach agreement with the decision maker’s Team Leader, refer the matter to the Team Leader who will manage the issue.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Team Leader consultation is important when managing complaints from specialist business areas such as Child Support Intensive Collection Services or PS. If the matter is urgent for example the customer advises garnishee notice issued is causing extreme financial hardship and the Team Leader is unavailable, make a decision based on the available information and advise the Team Leader as soon as practicable.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Where a decision has been made to uphold a complaint issue on the basis that an incorrect decision has been made for example care levels incorrectly calculated) consider if it is appropriate to correct the error through an administrative process, see Correcting errors on Child Support cases for more information.
