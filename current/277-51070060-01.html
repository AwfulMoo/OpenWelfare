	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Customers should apply for Child Support collection within 3 months (up to nine months in special circumstances) of not receiving their full child support entitlement. The 3 month period allows the customer time to decide if the shortfall in their child support payments will continue and is also the period of arrears that Child Support is able to collect. Child Support will automatically advise Centrelink of any change in collection method, reporting the date the customer requested Child Support collection.</p>

<p>If a customer asks Child Support to collect any unpaid arrears owed for a private collect period, the arrears date is <strong>not</strong> automatically reported to Centrelink.</p>

<p>If Child Support advises the customer that they will collect arrears for a private collect period, the customer should contact Centrelink so the arrears period can be manually updated to show it is a Child Support collect period. This will prevent child support from being 'double counted' for the arrears period. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-51040030-01.html">Centrelink action when a Child Support collection customer is owed or receives child support arrears</a>.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Where a retrospective assessment is received from Child Support for private collect customers, the customer will have their FTB reassessed based on the new assessment details.</p>

<p>If the customer is owed child support arrears as a result of an increased <a href="../separated-parents/277-51130010-01.html">retrospective child support assessment</a>, they are not obliged to apply for Child Support collection if they are privately collecting their full ongoing entitlement amount. The customer may wish to register for Child Support collection (including collection of unpaid arrears) if they are experiencing difficulties privately collecting their child support.</p>

<p>If the retrospective assessment applies to 2012/2013 or a later financial year and that year has already been reconciled, the retrospective change may result in re-reconciliation occurring. If the child support assessment has&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
decreased, this may result in a top-up of FTB</li>
		<li>
increased, this may result in a reconciliation overpayment. In this scenario, the customer can appeal the FTB reconciliation debt with Centrelink</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer wants to discuss or appeal the retrospective change to their child support assessment, refer them to Child Support.</p>

<p>Either the paying or receiving parent can ask Child Support to reassess the amount of child support payable if their income has reduced. If a parent's income has reduced, Child Support may use an estimate of their current income to reassess their child support liability. Centrelink will use the current child support assessment until new assessment details are reported via the data exchange.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Discharged_chil">Discharged child support arrears</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A Child Support collect customer may elect to change to private collection, even if they have arrears outstanding from the child support collect period. If a Child Support collect customer changes to private collection and at the same time, or at a later date, discharges Child Support from the responsibility of collecting some or all of the outstanding arrears, the customer is taking responsibility for collecting the arrears themselves.</p>

<p>When a customer contacts to discuss the implications of changing their collection method, the customer should be advised that if they ask Child Support not to pursue collections of outstanding amounts (that is, they choose to discharge them), the amount/s may impact on the rate of FTB Part A they will receive.</p>

<p>Unless the customer is granted an exemption, the non-paid arrears amounts will be included in the MIT in addition to the customer's ongoing child support entitlement from the date of the decision until the end of the financial year, regardless of the period to which the amount relates.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> discharged child support arrears relating to a child who is no longer an FTB child, should not be included in the MIT. This is because the child support is not for the maintenance of an FTB child. If there are other remaining FTB children, only the portion of the discharged arrears relating to the current FTB children should be included in the MIT.</p>

<p>The non-paid amount is not automatically reported to Centrelink via the data exchange. The customer will need to self-identify and advise any non-paid arrears amounts.</p>

<p>From 1 July 2012, customers will continue to pass the MAT regardless of whether they are successful in privately collecting the arrears amount.</p>

<p>Prior to 1 July 2012, customers who asked Child Support not to pursue collection of outstanding arrears would continue to pass the Maintenance Action Test (MAT) as long as they attempted to collect the outstanding amount privately. If the customer advised that they intended to privately collect the arrears but were then unsuccessful in collecting some or all of the arrears, the non-paid amounts would not be included in the maintenance income assessment. If after asking Child Support not to pursue collection of outstanding arrears, the customer advised that they did not intend to attempt to collect the arrears, they would fail the MAT from the date of the decision and for the remainder of the financial year unless they were granted an exemption from seeking child support.</p>
