<p>All Child Support customers who are parents should lodge a tax return unless special circumstances apply. </p>

<p>An ATO issued taxable income is considered to be the most accurate income and parents should be encouraged to lodge their tax returns on time each year.</p>

<p>When the ATO issues a tax assessment the relevant income information transfers to the customer’s Cuba record automatically via the data exchange. ATO incomes received in the data exchange will automatically have amounts released under the First Home Super Saver (FHSS) Scheme excluded. These amounts do not form part of a customer’s adjusted taxable income (ATI) for child support purposes. </p>

<p><strong>Two taxable incomes – same lodgement date</strong></p>

<p>When the ATO loads the customer’s tax return details into Integrated Core Processing (ICP), an income message is sent to Child Support. A taxable Income is recorded in Cuba which may be used in an assessment. </p>

<p>Sometimes the ATO makes adjustments to returns when they have selected a customer’s tax return for additional analysis. When the ATO reprocesses the tax return, they may add income that was not initially declared by the customer.</p>

<p>When the income is reprocessed, a second income message is sent to Child Support. This results in an additional taxable income (not an Amended Taxable Income) for the same financial year being loaded in Cuba. </p>

<p>As the first and second incomes loaded in Cuba relate to the same tax return, the lodgement dates will be the same on both incomes. The second taxable income is the <strong>correct income for Child Support</strong> to use in the assessment. It represents the final amount as assessed by the ATO. </p>

<p><strong>Two taxable incomes – different lodgement dates</strong></p>

<p>A second taxable income may also be received when the ATO have completely cancelled the first tax return and replaced it with a re-lodged return. The 2 incomes loaded in Cuba may often have different lodgement dates.</p>

<p>Before 15 June 2019 Cuba did not automatically apply the second income to assessments. The Child Support Solutions Gateway Team (SGT) and the Business Systems Interface (BSI) team, identified and corrected affected assessments. </p>

<p>Cuba will now give effect to the second income where appropriate and the first income will have a status of <strong>CANCEL SYSTEM</strong>. This income is only visible in the income history. </p>

<p>In some cases, the incorrect first income results in letters being issued to customers. Where the second correct income results in a reassessment, a second set of letters will be issued.</p>

<p><strong>Do not take any action.</strong> Explain to the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the reason for the 2 sets of letters and </li>
		<li>
the correct income is currently being used in the assessment</li>
		</ul>
<p>If customers have concerns about their Income Tax Lodgement, refer them to the <a href="../separated-parents/277-07010010-05.html#bp05_L2GT_External_websit">ATO</a>.</p>

<p>A child support customer may not be required to lodge a tax return but may be required to lodge a Non-lodgement advice with the ATO if their only income was from certain Government payments, allowances and pensions.</p>

<p>In limited circumstances the customer <strong>may not</strong> be required to lodge a Non-lodgement advice if they meet the exemption requirements set out by the <a href="../separated-parents/277-07010010-05.html#bp05_L2GT_External_websit">ATO</a>.</p>

<p>Customers who have completed a non-lodgement advice with the ATO will have  ‘Return not Necessary’ (RNN) recorded against the lodgement status if the relevant income tax year/s on their ATO income tax records. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-07010010-05.html#bp05_L2GT_External_websit">ATO Lodgement program framework</a>.</p>

<p>If unable to confirm the lodgement status with the ATO by using ICP, ask the customer to contact child support when they have lodged the advice. This will allow the RNN status to be confirmed and the relevant RNN deemed income loaded to the <strong>Client income</strong> window for the relevant financial year. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-07010030-01.html">Deemed and Default income for child support customers</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> loading an RNN deemed income in the Client income window will not always result in a change to the child support assessment. The RNN deemed income <strong>must </strong>still be loaded to ensure the RNN status is recorded and the customer’s Client of Interest (COI) indicator is updated. Otherwise Cuba will not recognise the mutual customer has met lodgement compliance for the relevant year.</p>

<p>If the customer has not lodged their tax return and there is no <strong>Return not Necessary</strong> indicator present on the customer's ATO records, obtain an ITD from the customer and advise the customer to discuss their lodgement requirements with the ATO or a Tax agent.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58; NOTNEC</strong> and <strong>NRL</strong> are historical codes no longer used by the ATO.</p>

<p>When the customer in receipt of certain tax free pensions or payments lodges their tax return and incorrectly includes the tax free pension or benefit as an income for taxation purposes, Cuba will include this income twice in the customer’s ATI.</p>

<p>Cuba records the taxable income from the ATO, and also separately records the tax free pension or benefit amount from Centrelink or Department of Veteran’s Affairs as a tax free pension or payments other component amount.</p>

<p>In calculating the customer’s ATI, both of the above amounts are included. This is the correct application of the law and <strong>is not considered</strong> to be an error. However, given the tax free pension or benefit has been accounted for twice in the ATI, the customer’s child support assessment may not accurately reflect their actual capacity to pay.</p>

<p>If the customer raises concern about the tax free pension or benefit being included twice, discuss appropriate options depending on the circumstances of the case. Examples of some of the options that may be available include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<a href="../separated-parents/277-07040000-01.html">estimate of income</a> if the affected income is being used in the current assessment, or</li>

<p>From 23 May 2018, if the ATO amends a person’s tax assessment, Child Support can use the amended income to amend their child support assessment in most circumstances. Whether the amended tax assessment will be used retrospectively or prospectively will depend on a number of factors, <a href="../separated-parents/277-07010010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Processing_or_a_Step08">go to Step 8</a>.

<p>In most instances, ATO issued incomes will be retrieved and loaded into Cuba automatically. For details on how to retrieve ATO issued income details manually see <a href="../separated-parents/277-04370000-01.html">External searches guide (CS)</a>.</p>

<p>To load an amended ATO issued income manually, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-30010360-01.html">Income Cuba Process Help</a>.</p>

<p>An amended ATO income will not be loaded correctly for a small number of customers if 3 or more amended ATO incomes and 1 of the later amended incomes is the same amount as an earlier amended income. </p>

<p>Cuba does not receive the later amended income. It treats it as a duplicate of the earlier one. </p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>Taxable income $50,000, first amended $75,000, second amended $25,000, third amended $75,000. The third amended is incorrectly viewed as a duplicate of the first amended and no income record is created.</p>

<p>BSI will correct impacted cases manually. If a case is identified that has not been corrected and the customer has made a request to apply the ATO issued income, email a request to BSI Issue Management to correct the case. </p>

<p>If a customer makes a complaint about an ATO Amended Income, consider escalation to Level 2 via <a target="_blank" href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-02000000-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Customer_compla">escalation reason 5 - Complex, cross programme or multiple issues</a>. </p>

<p>If the ATO issues an amended taxable income&#58;</p>

<p>Where the ATO initiated the amendment, the lodgement date is the date ATO decided to review the income. However, this is not always the date that is used. For example, ATO may not change the lodgement date from that of the original tax assessment, despite the amended income issuing years later.

<p>Where a component of the customer's adjusted taxable income is amended as a result of an amendment to the customer's tax assessment, <strong>do not amend</strong> the child support assessment.</p>

<p>If there is a change to the other components of the customer's adjusted taxable income, the department’s policy is to amend the child support assessment for all the days in the child support period the ATI is relevant. This is regardless of whether the income increased or decreased. The amended ATI will replace the original ATI in its entirety. If there is a provisional income in place prior to the application of the original ATI, the rules of section 58A are relevant. If the amended ATI is greater than the provisional income, the provisional income will be replaced. The <a href="../separated-parents/277-07010010-05.html">Resources</a> page has examples.</p>

<p>Customers are required to have the other components of their ATI amended by the ATO, DVA or Centrelink before the department can amend the assessment. If there is going to be a delay in the amendment or an amendment is not possible, the ATI used in the assessment can be amended if sufficient evidence or information is provided which shows the original ATI component is incorrect, and the correct component amount can be determined. <strong>Do not manually amend</strong> the income on the customer's verbal claim.</p>

<p><strong>Amending using the Correcting errors and Cuba Incident Form macros </strong></p>

<p>If there is a change to the other components of a customer's adjusted taxable income, not the result of an ATO amendment of the customer's taxable income component of the assessment, Service Officers may update the 'other components' field in Cuba to reflect the change.</p>

<p>If the original ATI has been used to reconcile an estimate, consider if the estimate should be re-reconciled using the amended ATI. Include the considerations in the correcting errors submission before forwarding to an EL2 for approval.</p>

<p>In some circumstances a tax assessment may issue for only part of a financial year. For example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the customer leaves Australia permanently before the end of the financial year, they may be able to lodge their tax return early. The tax return will include their income for the period starting on the first day of the financial year up to the date they depart. For more information about calculating ATI for parents who change residency, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-07030000-01.html">Income processing for Child Support customers (International parents)</a> </li>
		<li>
If the customer dies during a financial year, a tax return may be lodged for the period from the start of the financial year up to the date of death. A second, separate tax return may also need to be lodged for the deceased estate for the period from the parent’s date of death until the end of the financial year. The estate is considered a separate entity to the parent and so the tax return for the deceased estate is not included in the parent’s ATI for that financial year</li>
		<li>
If the customer declares bankruptcy, they may lodge a tax return for the period from the start of the financial year up to the date of sequestration. A second tax return may also need to be lodged for the period from the date of sequestration until the end of the financial year. This is referred to as a split assessment.<br>Where a split assessment occurs for a parent who became bankrupt, the 2 amounts must be added together to calculate the customer’s correct ATI for the full financial year. This total does not always transfer to Cuba automatically through the data exchange</li>
		<li>
BSI Issue Management will correct impacted cases manually. If a case is identified that has <strong>not been</strong> corrected, email a request to correct the case to BSI Issue Management </li>		</ul>

<p>There are situations where the ATO cancel customer incomes and Cuba is not automatically updated. If a customer questions the ATO income being used in their assessment, staff should immediately conduct an ICP search and confirm the income being questioned is showing as cancelled in the <strong>Received Lodgements</strong> section of ICP. </p>

<p>If the income is cancelled in Received Lodgements in ICP, email BSI Issue Management to request this income be removed from Cuba. The email should include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Customer Name&#58;</li>
		<li>
CSID&#58; </li>
		<li>
TFN&#58; </li>
		<li>
Financial year of cancelled ITR&#58;</li>
		<li>
Lodgement Date&#58; </li>
		<li>
Income Figure&#58;</li>
		<li>
Is the cancelled income an original or amended ITR&#58;</li>
		<li>
Additional information (where necessary)&#58;</li>
		<li>
I have confirmed income is cancelled in Received Lodgements in ICP&#58; YES/NO</li>
		</ul>
<p>BSI will remove the cancelled income and notify the referring officer, who will be required to review the case in detail prior to running eligibility and managing any other issues, for example, error correction if an income has deemed off the cancelled income. </p>

<p>Staff should lock and monitor the customer until the income is deleted and the case is using correct incomes. </p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>A customer calls and advises their Tax File Number has been compromised and an Income Tax Return (ITR) has been lodged fraudulently. The customer advises the ATO have been advised and have confirmed this was not a legitimate taxable income. The income is showing as cancelled in ICP. Staff member escalates to BSI and has incomes removed from Cuba.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>ATO Cancelled income applied after the child support period (CSP) commenced</strong></p>

<p>If the cancelled income is for the LRYI in the current CSP and was applied to the assessment after the CSP was created, remove the income from the customer’s record. Replace the cancelled income with the income amount that would have applied if the cancelled income had not been available at the time the assessment was made. If a new income determination can be made based on income information that was available on the day from which the assessment is being amended, the date of effect of the new income determination is based on the current date of effect rules.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>The assessment commenced 1 September 2017 using a provisional income of $60,000. On 12 December 2017, the 2016/17 ATO taxable income of $55,000 was applied to the assessment. On 3 February 2018, the ATO advise that the income has been cancelled. There is no other ATO taxable income for the same financial year and the customer has not provided any other income information or lodged an Estimate of Income.</p>

<p>If the ATO cancelled income had not been applied to the assessment on 12 December 2017, the provisional income of $60,000 would have remained in use. Searches conducted on 3 February 2018 determine the customer’s income is $50,000. As the ATI based on this income would be less than the provisional income and has been determined after the lodgement due date, a derived ATI of $50,000 is applied to the assessment from 3 February 2018. If the customer’s derived ATI was $61,000 (greater than the provisional income), it would be applied to the assessment from 12 December 2017.</p>

<p><strong>Cancelled income triggered a new CSP</strong></p>

<p>If the cancelled income was the trigger for starting a new CSP, consider what effect removing the income might have on the case before any error correction occurs. Use the <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/elements/macros/PSMEmailEnquiry.html">PSM enquiry</a> macro to escalate the case to a PSM if&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
the cancelled income caused the CSP to start more than 6 months ago</li>
		<li>
the cancelled income has a financial impact that is greater than 6 month’s liability</li>
		<li>
error correction will create an overpayment</li>
		<li>
the correction results in a role reversal (backdating 3 months or more)</li>
		<li>
there is a family violence indicator</li>
		<li>
replacing the cancelled income with an updated income will have no financial impact on the assessment, this includes both collect and private collect cases</li>
		<li>
there is an income amount order setting either the customer's income or the annual rate for the whole assessment period that would otherwise use the LRYI income, for example court order, COA, agreement</li>
		<li>
the case has ended</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Estimate Election made with reference to the ATO cancelled income </strong></p>

<p>If the customer has made an estimate election and the estimate was compared to (for the purposes of the 85% validity test) the now-cancelled income, cancel the estimate unless the estimate meets the 85% test in relation to the original non-cancelled taxable income. If you cancel the estimate, contact the customer to discuss their options. </p>

<p>If a reverse case exists, a new ATO income may not trigger a new child support period in the reverse case. The child support periods in all Cuba cases must be aligned.</p>

<p>See <a href="../separated-parents/277-30010120-01.html">Child Support Period Processing Help</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> any adjustment of a child support period can have considerable effects on a case and any related cases, <a href="../separated-parents/277-09140000-03.html">seek technical support from a Service Support Officer</a>.</p>
