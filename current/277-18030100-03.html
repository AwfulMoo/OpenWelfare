<p>There is no standard format to a care change clause, the wording of each particular agreement will determine what event or circumstances will cause a care change clause to be activated.</p>

<p>Read the whole agreement as there may be multiple clauses that combine to affect the child support agreement. </p>

<p>An agreement may have clauses on how care is assessed for the purposes of administrating the agreement care change clause. If the agreement has no such clauses, apply the standard Assessment Act provisions to assess the level of care. See <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-03040000-01.html">Change in child support care levels (post 1 July 2010)</a>.</p>

<p>An agreement can include provisions covering what the date of effect of the agreement rate change will be, either by referring to the standard Assessment Act rules about the date of effect of care changes or by specifying its own requirements, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-03040000-01.html">Change in child support care levels (post 1 July 2010)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> an agreement cannot change the ordinary operation of the Child Support (Assessment) Act (1989) but can specify how and when the agreement rate changes. In some circumstances, the Assessment Act rules for care changes will always apply even if the agreement specifies its own requirements. For example, an agreement will end or may be suspended for a period if the payee under the agreement has less than 35% care. The date of effect will always be the date the  change in care percentage applies in the assessment as determined by the Assessment Act, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-18061455-01.html">Suspending or ending a Child Support agreement due to care</a>.</p>

<p>After a care change decision has been made for a child who is covered by a child support agreement, the Agreements / Court Order team will manage all customer contact and any processing required to give effect to the impact of the care change on the agreement and the assessment.</p>

<p>If a care change decision has not yet been made, refer case back to the appropriate area. For example, to Mainstream / Integrated care if the care change is disputed). See <a target="_blank" href="../utils/CustomerReferralGuidelines/Customer-Referral-Guidelines.html?disputed-care.html">Customer referral guidelines for Child Support staff</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> even if the care change does not affect the agreement rate, any changes to actual care levels must still be recorded on Cuba so that they are available the next time a provisional notional assessment (PNA) is generated, and the correct care percentages are used by Centrelink/FAO to calculate Family Tax Benefit (FTB) entitlements.</p>

<p>An agreement may have a clause that allows the roles of payee and payer to swap when a childâ€™s care changes. The role swap clause will be activated when the level of care (as specified in the agreement) is applied in the assessment. This could be when the payee ceases to be an eligible carer or when they have a care percentage below a certain level. Child support as specified by the agreement will then become payable to the other parent.</p>

<p>A role swap clause can only specify that it will apply if the payee has a care percentage at 65% or lower. For example, the agreement cannot provide that the roles will swap if the payee has a care percentage at or below 80% as this would mean the other parent could have 20% care and they would not be an eligible carer of the child.</p>

<p>If the payee ceases to be an eligible carer and a role swap clause is activated, the agreement will not be suspended or terminated, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-18061455-01.html">Suspending or Ending a Child Support agreement due to care</a>.</p>

<p>Due to the operation of the care date of effect rules, a role swap clause may not always be activated from the date of care change, for example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The clause will be activated on the date that the original payee has a care percentage below that specified in the agreement and the other parent is an eligible carer</li>
		<li>
For any period when the other parent is not an eligible carer, the agreement rate will continue to be paid to the original payee if they are an eligible carer</li>
		<li>
For any period when both the original payee and other parent are not eligible carers and a care suspension period applies, the relevant agreement rate is not payable by either parent</li>
		</ul>
<p>See <a href="../separated-parents/277-03040000-01.html">Change in child support care levels (post 1 July 2010)</a> for more information.</p>

<p>When a role swap clause is recorded in Cuba and the clause is activated, an intray will route to the Agreements/Court Order team for action. This team will manage all customer contact and any manual processing associated with activating and administering a role swap clause, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-03020020-01.html">Complex system processing for reverse child support cases</a>.</p>

<p>Send a <strong>MSE1-6 Agreement Role Swap</strong> letter to the customers. See <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-30010400-01.html">Letters Cuba Process Help</a>. If multiple care changes are being processed at the same time, a manual UQ120.08 Role Swap letter may need to be sent.</p>

<p>An agreement may have a clause that states the agreement liability will cease to be payable for a child when the payee has a specified level of care. This could be when the payee ceases to be an eligible carer or when they have a care percentage below a certain level as set out in the agreement.</p>

<p>If the agreement clause states that the agreement will end when a specified level of care applies (and the payee is still an eligible carer), then end the agreement in Cuba for the child when the specified level of care applies in the assessment.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the payee is not an eligible carer on or after 1 July 2018 or 15 May 2019 for WA Ex-nuptial cases, the legislation requires that the agreement will end for the child or it will be suspended for a period. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-18061455-01.html">Suspending or ending a Child Support agreement due to care</a>.</p>

<p>If the agreement has a clause that it will end when the payee ceases to be an eligible carer, the option for requesting a longer agreement suspension period of up to 26 weeks will not be available for the customers as the agreement terms will take precedence.</p>

<p>If an agreement has a clause that it will be suspended for a longer period if the payee ceases to be an eligible carer but it specifies a suspension period of less than 26 weeks (for example 12 weeks), the agreement will be suspended for 26 weeks. However, if the agreement also includes a clause that it will end after the 12 week suspension period, end the agreement in Cuba from that date.</p>

<p>Check that the assessment has updated to the correct agreement rate or the correct assessment rate if the agreement has been ended or no longer has effect.</p>

<p>If the agreement rate has changed by more than 15% a new provisional notional assessment (PNA) will be issued by the system.</p>

<p>If no new PNA is issued, because the agreement rate has not changed by more than 15%, customers on limited agreements may request a new PNA if they want to. Generate a new PNA if a customer with a limited agreement requests a new PNA.  See <a href="../separated-parents/277-02020000-01.html">Notional assessment relating to child support agreements</a> for further information.</p>

<p>If a PNA has issued while either customer has an estimate of income in place, the system will use this income when eligibility is run and the PNA is created. This is not correct as the PNA must be based on the adjusted taxable income for the last relevant year of income for the child support period. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-02020000-01.html">Notional Assessments, Generating a PNA in Cuba</a> for information on how to correct the PNA before it is sent to the customers.</p>

<p><br>Once a PNA has issued, customers may then apply (if they wish) to vary the PNA by estimating their income (or by requesting any of the other 4 types of possible PNA variations). See <a href="../separated-parents/277-02020000-01.html">Notional Assessments, Varying a Provisional Notional Assessment</a>.<br></p>

<p>When the PNA converts to a notional assessment the parentsâ€™ FTB Part A will be calculated on the amount of child support that would have been payable if the agreement was not in place. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-02020000-01.html">Notional assessment relating to child support agreements</a>.<br></p>

<p>Alternatively, if the effect of a clause is to suspend or end the agreement, so that the child support will now be based on the formula, the customer may be able to make an estimate of income. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-07040000-01.html">Child support estimates (post 1 July 2010)</a>.</p>
