<p>The last section of the claim is the <strong>Next Steps</strong> page which advises the customer of any documents they need to provide and tasks they or any applying partner, need to complete before submitting their claim.</p>

<p>The partner must complete their tasks in their own Centrelink online account within 21 days.</p>

<p>Tasks may be <strong>supplementary</strong> or <strong>required</strong>. The claim cannot be submitted until all required tasks are completed.</p>

<p>Once submitted, a message will display to the customer to confirm their claim for the Scheme has been successfully submitted and the following information is displayed to the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Claim <strong>submission</strong> date</li>

<p>Once a claim has been submitted, the customer cannot update the online claim details. They will need to contact Services Australia if they want to provide information in relation to their claim.</p>

<p>Customers can withdraw their online claim at any time after it has been submitted via <strong>My online claims</strong>. Once a claim has been withdrawn it cannot be reinstated. The customer can apply again by starting a new online claim at any time.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> customers who apply for a loan using the SA310/SA496 are <strong>always</strong> required to complete at least Part A and Part B of the form.

<p>Where a paper form has been lodged, Service Officers should scan the form and ensure all mandatory questions have been answered and the supporting documentation provided. Scan the form and documents to <strong>Document Tools</strong> on the customer’s record on Day 1 for action by processing staff.</p>

<p>Once the SA310/SA496 has been scanned, a Work Item for a claim will be automatically created and allocated to the Home Equity Access Scheme National team for assessment and processing.</p>

<p>The purpose of Part A to Part F of the Home Equity Access Scheme application form (SA310 partnered or SA496 single) is to obtain signed authorities and declarations for the loan from the applicant and any other party who has a registered interest in the real estate offered as security for the loan. This may include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer’s partner, if they are a member of a couple</li>

		<li>
individual or corporate trustees where the real estate is the asset of a trust</li>
		<li>

		</ul>
<p>An applicant may be required to provide one or more parts with their application. Some applicants may not be required to provide any parts at all, for example single customers who apply online and offer real estate that they have 100% ownership of.</p>

<p>Parts A-F may be required regardless of which lodgement channel an applicant uses. Whether they apply using an online claim, ACC or the SA310/SA496, the applicant will be advised at the <strong>Next Steps</strong> section which parts, if any, they are required to provide.</p>

<p>Where an applicant is required to provide Part A – Part F, they should keep a copy of the signed pages for their own records.</p>

<p>It is the applicant’s responsibility to arrange and obtain the signed declarations and authorities to provide with their application. Services Australia do not issue written requests to third parties to seek their consent to the Scheme loan, however upon receiving all supporting documentation may make verbal contact with the impacted parties prior to granting the Scheme loan to ensure they understand the Scheme and possible impacts for the property.</p>
