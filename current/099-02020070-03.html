<p>When a person contacts to advise about the death of a customer, staff must offer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
A <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-12000000-01.html">social worker referral</a> in the first instance or at any time the notifier becomes or shows signs of distress during the contact. See <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-12000000-01.html">Referring customers to a social worker</a> for more information</li>
		<li>
The '<a href="../bereavement/099-02020070-05.html#bp05_L2LL_Publications">Needing help after someone has died? (HD001)</a>' pamphlet. Issue if accepted</li>
		</ul>
<p>Consider and respect the following cultural issues when being advised of the death of an <strong>Indigenous</strong> customer.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The <strong>name of the deceased person cannot be mentioned</strong> by immediate family members. This means immediate family members may have to ask other relatives/friends to call on their behalf or attend the interview with the notifier, because they cannot say the name of the deceased</li>
		<li>
In this situation, it may also be offensive to the person for the Service Officer to say the name of the deceased customer, if unsure, Service Officers should sensitively ask the person if it is all right for them to use the deceased customer's name. If the person is not comfortable with this, avoid using the deceased customer's name wherever possible. See <a href="../bereavement/099-01040000-01.html">Cultural Considerations when someone dies</a></li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Does the customer's record indicate that they were income managed, as shown by INM on the benefit status line?</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>, follow process to update record for <a href="../payment-delivery/103-01060010-01.html">death of an income managed customer</a>. Return to this procedure and <a href="../bereavement/099-02020070-03.html#bp03_tbl_Actioning_the_d_Step02">go to Step 2</a></li>

<p>Run the <strong>Notification of death</strong> guided procedure in the deceased customer's record to determine if death can be confirmed.</p>

<p>Confirmation of death can be accepted where the customer's full name is provided together with <strong>2</strong> of the following items&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
deceased customer's last address in full</li>
		<li>
date of birth and age at death</li>
		<li>
Customer Reference Number (CRN)</li>
		<li>
name of partner</li>
		</ul>
<p>Confirm if the person notifying of the death is the executor of the estate. If the informant is not the executor, but knows the executor details, obtain the&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
name and address of the executor, and</li>
		<li>
name of the funeral director or hospital</li>
		</ul>
<p>See <a href="../bereavement/099-02010000-01.html">Confirmation of the death of an adult or child</a>.</p>

<p>Nominee arrangements and Power of Attorney (POA) stop at the time of death. Any correspondence, including the payment summary and possible debt recovery action from a deceased estate, will be sent to the&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
executor, or</li>
		<li>
administrator of an estate</li>
		</ul>
<p>Services Australia's ability to finalise any outstanding matters will be impacted if executor or administrator details are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
incorrectly recorded, or</li>
		<li>
not recorded when details have been provided</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where executor details are not known at the time of death notification, leave the executor details fields in the <strong>Notification of death</strong> guided procedure blank.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> executor details can be recorded manually on the Death/Executor (<strong>DEA</strong>) screen if details become known later.</p>

<p>Can informant supply enough information to confirm death?</p>

<p>If the death cannot be confirmed&#58;</p>

use the <strong>Notification of death</strong> guided procedure to obtain and record all relevant information from the informant including their own name, address, contact number and relationship to the deceased, and if known, details of the executor, the name of the funeral director, and the name of the hospital</li>
		<li>
the guided procedure will not record the death, but will record details on a <strong>DOC</strong> which creates an open work item to be allocated to a Service Officer with the required skill set to confirm the death</li>
		<li>
if the guided procedure is not available, create an open work item. Use <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-05050020-01.html">Fast note</a> - select <strong>Auto text</strong>, use <strong>Generic</strong> &gt; <strong>Update</strong> &gt; <strong>Death Notification (Adult) - ACTION REQUIRED</strong></li>
		</ul>
<p>Where multiple notifications are received in relation to the death of the same person do not re-run the guided procedure. Check the record and annotate the original <strong>DOC</strong> to state details are correct and who advised.</p>

<p>If there is doubt about the identity of the deceased, contact the funeral director or the hospital where the deceased passed away. If this is not an option and contact with relatives is proposed, social worker involvement may be necessary. Where appropriate, send Request for Verification (SS257) form.</p>

<p>Where death cannot be confirmed and the customer's whereabouts cannot be established, payment is to be <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-10030000-01.html">suspended</a> until the death can be confirmed. The suspension date of event should be the unconfirmed date of death or the date paid to plus one (DPT + 1), whichever is the later&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
select the suspension option in the <strong>Notification of death</strong> guided procedure, or</li>
		<li>
manually code the suspension for reason '<strong>OTH</strong>' (Other)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Record a <strong>DOC</strong> on the customer's record, ensuring that it meets <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-15000000-01.html">GIR DOC Minimum Standards</a> for significant decisions and include what action is required to confirm the death.</p>

<p>Do <strong>not issue</strong> a suspension letter. Cancel the advice activity on the <strong>AL</strong> screen triggered by the '<strong>OTH</strong>' suspension.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> confirm and action the death as a matter of urgency.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
they will need to apply for a payment in their own right, before the end of the bereavement period</li>
		<li>
if the customer starts work, or is currently working, working credits may enable the customer to keep some of their income support payment while they are working</li>
		<li>
if the customer's income reduces their fortnightly rate to nil and some of that income is employment income, the customer may remain current at nil rate for up to 6 fortnights and retain certain benefits. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the customer's deceased partner had any working credits, these credits cannot be transferred to the customer</li>
		<li>
if the customer was a joint owner of any assets with their late partner, full ownership of the assets legally transfers to the surviving partner following the death of their partner. However, for Social Security purposes, if assets are owned in joint names with the deceased partner, the surviving partner is only assessed as owning 50%, unless the surviving partner advises that the assets have been transferred to them</li>
		<li>
if the surviving partner is granted a reversionary income stream, then it is to be assessed from the date that it is first <strong>entitled to be received</strong>. A lump sum arrears payment received by the reversionary beneficiary, accrued between the death of the primary beneficiary and when the reversionary beneficiary commences to receive regular payments, is assessed as income from the income stream. This means the income is assessed over the period to which it relates and may result in a debt for that period if the customer has been in receipt of an income support payment. Effective from 9 May 2018, where the assessment of the lump sum arrears result in a debt during the bereavement period for the surviving spouse, consideration should be given to waiver provisions contained under Class of Debt, Section 1237AB(1) of the Social Security Act 1991. The legislative instrument &quot;Social Security (Waiver of Debts - Bereavement Period) Specification 2017&quot; permits this action if all provisions are satisfied. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> any debt outside the 14 week bereavement period cannot be waived under the legislative instrument. The legislative instrument is not retrospective. This means that any of these debts that occur before 9 May 2018 cannot be waived under class of debt waiver provisions</li>

<p>A PA customer must both be qualified for a LBP and an LBP must be payable.</p>

<p>The PA customer is qualified for an LBP if the deceased partner was a long-term social security recipient.
