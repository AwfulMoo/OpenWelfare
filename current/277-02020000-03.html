<p>A PNA only exists until a Notional assessment (NA) is made, usually 23 days after the PNA generated, a customer can apply to vary the PNA during this period. Occasionally, the PNA will not become an NA for an extended period for example, whilst a variation such as a Change of Assessment is being finalised.</p>

<p>When the PNA becomes a NA, the parents’ FTB will be calculated on the NA, this is the amount of child support that would have been payable if the agreement was not in place.</p>

<p>After the PNA becomes an NA, an NA letter and notice off assessment is sent to both customers.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when a customer contacts Child Support to discuss PNAs or NAs, they may actually want information on how to elect to end their limited agreement if the NA has changed. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-02010040-01.html">Ending a Child Support agreement</a> and the <a href="../separated-parents/277-02010000-05.html">Resources</a> page for a Summary of typical process for electing to terminate a limited agreement. </p>

<p>If the customer has an NA in place but requests the generation of a new PNA, the rules for generating a new PNA differ depending on the type of agreement.</p>

<p><strong>Limited Agreement</strong></p>

<p>If the agreement is a limited agreement, in addition to the times a PNA will be automatically generated, either customer can request a PNA at any time. Service Officers must check that the assessment is as accurate as possible by amending any details that require updating such as care details and incomes before generating a PNA. This allows Child Support to provide customers with the most up to date and accurate PNA possible. </p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> a PNA may only be varied in 5 ways, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-02020000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Varying_a_PNA_i_Step01">step 1 in the Varying a PNA</a> table. It is important the case is updated prior to the PNA being issued as the customer may not be able to update PNA to reflect certain changes to their circumstances. For example, if the customer advises of a relevant dependent child after their PNA has already been issued, the PNA cannot be updated to include the relevant dependent child. </p>

<p>Customers have 23 days from the date the PNA generates to consider their options to apply to vary the PNA before it becomes a NA.</p>

<p>Customers will generally need to ask for a new PNA when their circumstances change and they want these reflected in the NA for FTB purposes, or as a means of ending their limited agreement, if they expect the new NA will change by more than 15% from the previous NA.</p>

<p>If a customer with a limited agreement has a recently issued, check whether they actually want to elect to end their limited agreement before generating a new PNA. If so, the recently issued NA may already meet their needs. For example, if that recent NA is a change of more than 15% compared to the previous NA, and the recent NA issued less than 60 days ago, they may already be able to make a written election to end the limited agreement, and they may not need another new PNA.</p>

<p>If a customer requests a new PNA, document the details of the request for a new NA in the Provisional Notional Assessment Detail window notepad. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-01030000-01.html">Documenting Child Support information</a>.</p>

<p>See <a href="../separated-parents/277-02020000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Generate_a_PNA_Step01">step 1 in the Generate a PNA</a> table.</p>

<p><strong>Binding Agreement</strong></p>

<p>Customers who have a binding agreement <strong>cannot</strong> request a new PNA. PNAs are only automatically generated when any of the following occur&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
on the initial acceptance of the agreement</li>
		<li>
at the end of 3 years after the most recent NA was generated, or</li>
		<li>
if the child support rate payable under the agreement changes by more than 15%</li>
		</ul>
<p>It is important to record all changes to individual circumstances, even if the change does not affect the existing NA. When the future PNA automatically generates, it will accurately reflect the circumstances of the case. For example, a PNA cannot be varied to reflect changes to relevant dependent details so it is important to record such changes before a PNA generates.</p>

<p>If a customer has asked for a new PNA but this is not possible because they have a binding agreement, discuss the reasons that the application for a new PNA cannot be accepted.</p>

<p>Discuss the customer’s situation and available options that may assist them. If the customer actually want to end their agreement, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-02010040-01.html">Ending a Child Support agreement</a>. </p>

<p>If the customer advised they are concerned about the impact the current NA is having on their FTB, consider whether an objection to the current NA may assist them. An application for an extension of time to the object may be needed.</p>

<p>If a customer is a party to a limited agreement, it is possible for more than 1 PNA to be un-finalised at the 1 time. This might happen where it is taking a long time to finalise a variation, such as COA, and where a customer's circumstances change that they want taken into consideration. Once 23 days pass any new applications for variation cannot be accepted on the original PNA and therefore a new PNA may be generated to allow for a new variation.</p>

<p>Where multiple PNAs are not finalised, all previous variations are taken to be made against the most recent PNA. Therefore, when the most recent PNA is finalised all PNAs result in a single NA.</p>

<p>For example, a PNA issues on 20 July 2008 and a customer applies to have their PNA varied by lodging a COA application on 1 August 2008. On 17 September, the care of the child of the agreement changes from regular/primary to shared care. The customer(s) contact Child Support to advise of the care change but they are unable to make a variation to the PNA as more than 23 days have passed. As the customers have a limited agreement they can request a new PNA and then vary that PNA by advising of the care change. The application to vary the original PNA, that is COA application, is taken to be made against the second PNA. When all variations to the second PNA are finalised both PNAs will be finalised, resulting in the 1 NA.</p>

<p>A PNA will be calculated using the income and care details available in Cuba on the day the PNA is generated. For this reason, when a PNA is generated it is important to ensure that the details of the case are as accurate as possible before the PNA is generated. Check&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the percentage of care recorded for each child</li>
		<li>
the income record for the last relevant year of income</li>
		<li>
that relevant dependent children are recorded on the case</li>
		</ul>
<p>Service Officers should clarify these details with the customers if possible and may need to contact 1 or both customers if the request to generate the PNA was made in writing or referred via an intray.</p>

<p>If the Service Officer who receives the request to generate a PNA is not at the SO4 level, create a <strong>Pending Approval</strong> intray (adjust the due date to 2 working days from the date the request was received) and route to a SO4. </p>

<p>The SO4 will update the previous note documenting why a new PNA is being issued </p>

<p>The SO4 will generate the new PNA and will be responsible for any variations to the PNA by locking both customers until the finalisation of the NA. A PNA letter and notice issues to both customers. The 23 day period to vary the PNA commences from the date the PNA is generated. For assistance on manually generating a PNA, see Notional Assessment Detail Window Help.</p>

<p>If the customer has an estimate of income in place when the PNA is generated, see Agreements Cuba Process Help, <a href="../separated-parents/277-30010030-03.html#bp03_tbl_Steps_to_record03_Step10">Step 10 in the Steps for recording, updating and deleting a provisional notional assessment modification</a> table.</p>

<p>Complete this process on the day the PNA is generated to ensure the customer letters are accurate. If the PNA is generated without following this process the customer’s estimate of income will be incorrectly applied in the PNA, instead of the adjusted taxable income (ATI) for the last relevant year of income for the current child support period which should be used in the PNA. After the PNA has issued using the correct ATI, the customer will still be able to apply to vary the PNA by making a PNA estimate.</p>

<p>When a PNA is issued, the customer has 14 days after receiving notification to request a variation to the PNA. Child Support allows a total of 23 days from the day the PNA is generated and issued (14 days plus 9 days for postage) to receive applications for variations to the PNA. These timeframes can be extended for international cases. This is determined on a case by case basis depending on the arrangements with each jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Applications for a variation received outside of the 23 day period are not valid. If an application for a variation is received after 23 days and the customer is on a limited agreement, the customer can request that a new PNA be generated. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-02020000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Generate_a_PNA_Step01">step 1 in the Generating a PNA</a> table. The application for a variation can then be considered on the new PNA. </p>

<p>A customer on a binding agreement cannot request a new PNA if an application for a variation is received outside of the 23 day period. There is no option for an extension of time for exceptional circumstances. They may object to the NA.

<p>Either parent can estimate their adjusted taxable income for use in the PNA. An estimate can only be made where the income used in the PNA is a taxable income as assessed by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) or an income tax declaration (ITD). See <a href="../separated-parents/277-07010020-01.html">Derived income for Child Support customers</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> accepting an agreement will create a new child support period. This may result in the PNA using a new last relevant year of income.</p>

<p>An estimate for a PNA can be lodged verbally or in writing and must meet the following criteria&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a parent may make an election if they estimate that their adjusted taxable income for the 12 months from the date of the PNA will not be more than 85% of their adjusted taxable income based on their ATO income or ITD for the last relevant year of income for the child support period</li>
		<li>
a PNA estimate cannot be lodged when the underlying assessment is based on an income amount order (other than the child support agreement) which is in force (applies) on the day the PNA was made, and</li>
		<li>
a PNA estimate must be authorised by a SO5 or above</li>
		</ul>
<p>A Year to Date (YTD) income is not required for a PNA estimate as it is not aligned to a financial year.</p>

<p>An estimate on a PNA will not be reviewed or reconciled at a later date. SO5 must ensure they are satisfied of the accuracy of the estimate before accepting it. An estimate on a PNA can be refused but this must be done before the PNA becomes an NA.</p>

<p>A customer can choose to revoke their estimate and lodge a new estimate before the PNA becomes an NA.</p>

<p><strong>Estimated adjusted taxable income</strong></p>

<p>When a customer is estimating their adjusted taxable income they must include their&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
taxable income (including overseas income if the parent is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction)</li>
		<li>
reportable fringe benefits</li>
		<li>
target foreign income</li>
		<li>
net investment loss</li>
		<li>
specified tax free pensions or benefits</li>
		<li>
reportable superannuation contributions</li>
		</ul>
<p>Payments (either ongoing or as a lump sum) received by customers under the <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-02020000-05.html#bp05_L2GT_External_websit">National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS)</a> or the <a target="_blank" href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-18050700-01.html">National Redress Scheme</a> are not considered income for Child Support purposes. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-02020000-04.html#bp04_L2GT_Policy">References</a> for a link to The Child Support Guide 2.4.4&#58; Child support income. If a customer provides NDIS or National Redress Scheme payment(s) as an income source or it is established the customer is receiving these payments, document it for information only. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-01030000-01.html">Documenting Child Support information</a>. Do not include it in any income calculations. For more information, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-02020000-05.html#bp05_L2GT_External_websit">Resources</a> for links to National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) and the National Redress Scheme.</p>

<p>Be aware that when a customer states the amount of their taxable income, it may already include an adjustment for net rental property losses and/or investment losses (such as share trading, managed funds, margin lending and share market speculation). If a customer provides a figure for rental and/or investment losses, Service Officers should clarify whether the figure they have provided for their taxable income includes any adjustments for the income or expenses attributed to the rental properties. If so, you should request that the customer provide you with separate figures for their rental and investment income/expenses and all their other income and expenses</p>

<p>For further information about adjusted taxable incomes, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-02020000-04.html#bp04_L2GT_Policy">References</a> for a link to The Child Support Guide 2.4.4&#58; Child support income.</p>

<p><strong>85% test</strong></p>

<p>When testing a customer's estimated adjusted taxable income, Service Officers must identify the adjusted taxable income in the Client Income window that was ATO issued or client supplied for the last relevant year of income for the child support period. Then multiply this income x 0.85 (or 85%). The customer's estimated adjusted taxable income must be for this amount or lower before it can be accepted.</p>

<p>For example&#58; A customer's ATO issued adjusted taxable income, as listed in the Client Income window is $43 000. $43 000 x 85% = $36 550. Therefore, the customers estimated adjusted taxable income must be $36 550 or less to be accepted.</p>

<p><strong>Is additional investigation/information required?</strong></p>

<p>As the customer's PNA estimate will never be reviewed or reconciled, Child Support must be sure that it is accurate when it is accepted. Check the parent's estimate history and any relevant information in Cuba, ATO systems and external information for&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
previous estimates of income. If these estimates have been reviewed or reconciled check the reasons for this, and</li>
		<li>
any information that may contradict that supplied by the parent</li>
		</ul>
<p>If there is an indication that a parent has knowingly underestimated their income in the past, or Service Officers become aware of contradictory information, they must ensure that they are satisfied the customer's current estimate is accurate before approving it.</p>

<p>Use the information available to you such as&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Client Benefits window</li>
		<li>
External Information window</li>
		<li>
other information in Cuba</li>
		<li>
ATO systems, that is check for employment declarations, investment income information and pay as you go (PAYG) information</li>
		</ul>
<p>to attempt to confirm the information the parent supplied regarding their estimate of income, that is the reason for the estimate and the amount estimated.</p>

<p>If&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the parent has a history that indicates they have knowingly underestimated in the past and Service Officers have been unable to confirm the information they have supplied, or</li>
		<li>
Service Officers have located any information that contradicts that supplied by the parent</li>
		</ul>
<p>More information may need to be requested. If no additional information is required <a href="../separated-parents/277-02020000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Varying_a_PNA_i_Step07">go to Step 7</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Request further information</strong></p>

<p>If Service Officers identify information that contradicts that supplied by the parent discuss this with them. Provide the parent with the opportunity to explain why the information differs and if it is appropriate to amend or withdraw their estimate.</p>

<p>Whilst it is not a legal requirement for parents to provide documentary evidence of their claims, Service Officers must be satisfied that the customer's actual income will not be higher than their estimated income.</p>

<p>Documentary evidence Service Officers may request includes&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
an employment termination certificate</li>
		<li>
payslips</li>
		<li>
a statement of benefit from Centrelink (if this information is not available on the Client Benefits window)</li>
		<li>
a provisional profit and loss statement</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the parent refuses to provide evidence, Service Officers must decide if they are satisfied that the actual income is likely to be the same as or lower than the estimated income. To assist, Service Officers can request information from third parties such as an employer. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-04210000-01.html">Child Support's information gathering powers</a>.</p>

<p>If Service Officers are satisfied that a parent has underestimated, they must obtain approved from a SO5 or above to refuse the election. For example, there is no apparent change in income and no reason is provided for lodging the estimate.</p>

<p>If Service Officers are satisfied that the parent's estimate of income is accurate, they obtain approved from a SO5 or above to accept the estimate.

<p>If the customer has lodged an estimate of income and an ITD is used in the PNA the estimate must be processed as a COA to ensure the correct income is used in the assessment. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-30010030-01.html">Agreements Cuba Process Help</a>, <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-30010030-03.html">Record a modification to a provisional notional assessment</a>, <a href="../separated-parents/277-30010030-03.html#bp03_L2GT_Record_a_modifi">Modify a provisional notional assessment where an estimate is in place</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Processing an estimate election to vary a PNA when an estimate was removed from the initial PNA</strong></p>

<p>If the customer had an estimate in place at the time the PNA was generated, the PNA should have been modified to remove the estimate and use the income from the last relevant year of income (LRYI). If the customer later elects to estimate their income for the purposes of the PNA, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-30010030-01.html">Agreements Cuba Process Help</a>, <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-30010030-03.html#bp03_L2GT_Record_a_modifi">Record a modification to a provisional notional assessment</a>.</p>

<p>A customer with a limited agreement who is dissatisfied with the new NA can ask for a new PNA at any time. But objecting to the NA may be the better option for the customer, as Child Support can then give effect to any changes from the date of the original NA. </p>

<p>If a NA is being reviewed as part of the objection or AAT process, it will be updated in the Notional Assessment Modification window. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-30010030-01.html">Agreements Cuba Process Help</a>, <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-30010030-03.html#bp03_L2GT_Record_a_modifi">Record a modification to a provisional notional assessment</a>.</p>

<p>There is a separate window for NAs that can be updated on objections or AAT decisions. This will flow from the Additional Registration window and maintain the details of the NA. It will work exactly the same except the drop down status will state allowed/disallowed. The actual objection/AAT will be processed on the Objection/SSAT window. A modification to the NA will need to be made, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-30010030-01.html">Agreements Cuba Process Help</a>, <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-30010030-03.html#bp03_L2GT_Record_a_modifi">Record a modification to a provisional notional assessment</a>.</p>
