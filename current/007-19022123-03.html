<p>All CCS customers must meet reconciliation requirements by confirming income. This includes confirming income for any partners or ex-partners they may have had during the relevant year.</p>

<p>Income can be confirmed in the following ways&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
lodging an Income Tax Return with the Australian Tax Office (ATO), or</li>
		<li>
advising Services Australia they are not required to lodge an Income Tax Return and providing their actual income, or</li>
		<li>
submitting a non-lodgement advice to the ATO, <strong>and</strong> advising actual income to Services Australia even where the income is $0.</li>
		</ul>
<p>The income confirmation requirements apply to <strong>ALL</strong> CCS customers and their partners/ex-partners. Even customers who have received an Income Support Payment (ISP) for the full CCS year must still confirm their income with Services Australia before reconciliation can occur.</p>

<p>When a customer advises they are not required to lodge an income tax return, this information must be updated in the system for income requirements to be met for the individual. Customers can notify that they or their current partner are not required to lodge using Centrelink online account or Express Plus Centrelink mobile app.</p>

<p>Customers cannot advise their ex-partner is not required to lodge via online services; Service Officers must record on behalf of the customer. </p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; CCS <strong>only</strong> customers are unable to advise they are not required to lodge an income tax return via their Centrelink online account or Express Plus Centrelink mobile app until after the end of the relevant CCS year, for example&#58; after 12 July 2020 for the 19/20 financial year. Service Officers can record this on behalf of the customer between 01 July and the end of the relevant CCS year where required.</p>

<p>CCS reconciliation covers all customers who had at least one day of CCS entitlement (including 0%) in the relevant year.</p>

<p>If the customer lodged a CCS claim within 28 days of child care starting, all child care attendance should be included, as the 28 day backdating provisions will apply.</p>

<p>CCS is based on Monday to Sunday childcare fortnights, the CCS year ends on the Sunday of the fortnight containing 30 June.</p>

<p>For example&#58; CCS for 2018-19 covered the period 2 July 2018 to 30 June 2019.</p>

<p>Service Officers must check&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the <strong>CCS reconciliation</strong> dashboard in <strong>Process Direct</strong> and select the applicable year</li>
		<li>
Check adequate income details have been received by selecting &gt; Reconciliation History then &gt; Tax return Status</li>
		<li>
Compare those periods with child care attendance details by selecting ‘Provider Payments’ tab</li>
		<li>
The customer is liable for any child care fees for attendance prior to the 28 day CCS backdated start date</li>
		<li>
If all periods are paid for in the CCS claim but the customer indicates the child has attended care for periods child care attendance has not been received, advise the customer to discuss the issue with their child care provider</li>
		<li>
If a child care provider has missed submitting child care attendance for a period outside of 28 days, they will need to seek approval from the Department of Education, Skills and Employment to submit late attendance</li>
		<li>
If attendance is submitted outside of 28 days, the system will automatically re-reconcile any previous CCS assessments for that relevant year</li>
		<li>
Record details on a DOC of any advice given or action taken</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; in response to coronavirus (COVID-19), a $0 session fee was recorded on every current CCS enrolment on 6 April 2020 and 12 July 2020. Further updates were made on 12 October 2020 with $0 session fees recorded for children in Victoria only, who had active enrolments and had not attended child care for at least 10 weeks.</p>

<p>A late lodger process applies to CCS reconciliation. Any customer who does not meet CCS reconciliation requirements by certain deadlines will be penalised.</p>

<p><strong>1st Deadline</strong></p>

<p>Customers must meet reconciliation requirements by midnight 30 June of the year following the one being reconciled.</p>

<p>If they do not meet the requirements by this time, their CCS and ACCS entitlement (except ACCS (Child Wellbeing) will be reduced to 0% from the first CCS Monday after the 1st deadline date.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> on 30 June 2020, the Department of Education, Skills and Employment (DESE) announced that the 1st deadline date for 2018-19 financial year would be extended until 31 March 2021. This is to allow customers who have not met their CCS reconciliation requirements for 2018-19 to retain their CCS entitlement until 5 April 2021, the first CCS Monday in the fortnight following 31 March 2021.</p>

<p>This means that for the 2018-19 financial year, customers have until 31 March 2021 to meet their reconciliation requirements for CCS. This extension only applies to CCS and does not apply to FTB or for ATO lodgement requirements for the 2018-19 financial year.</p>

<p>If income requirements have not been met, a non-lodger undetermined debt will be raised which totals all CCS amounts paid during the relevant year. The customer will not have to pay the debt at this point.</p>

<p>For information on identifying whether a customer is affected by the 1st deadline, see <a href="../families/007-20090908-01.html">What to check when CCS rate has changed</a>.</p>

<p><strong>2nd Deadline</strong></p>

<p>If customers do not meet the requirements by midnight 30 June of the year following the 1st deadline, or by the 2<sup>nd</sup> deadline extension, CCS eligibility will be cancelled from the following CCS Monday. The undetermined non-lodger debt which was raised at the 1st deadline now becomes determined. The customer is required to repay the non-lodger debt amount until they confirm their family income for the relevant outstanding year.</p>

<p>If relevant year income is confirmed after the 2nd deadline&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the determined non lodger debt status is changed to Finalised-No Debt (FND) and recovery ceases</li>
		<li>
Reconciliation is completed for the outstanding year which may result in&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
A nil adjustment – the customer has received correct entitlement, or</li>
			<li>
A debt, or</li>
			<li>
A top up amount, which will not be paid to the customer. </li>
			<li>
Any withholding amounts will also not be paid. However, the withholding amounts may be used to offset the current year reconciliation debt. </li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>With reconciliation completed, the customer can reclaim CCS but a claim will only be deemed effective if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
there are no outstanding CCS debt amounts, or </li>
		<li>
if the customer has an adequate repayment plan in place</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the customer will enter an automatic repayment arrangement through the granting of the new CCS claim which will meet this requirement.</p>

actual adjusted taxable income details are transferred from the ATO. <a href="../families/007-19022123-03.html#bp03_tbl_Rereconciliati_3">See Item 3</a></li>
			<li>
new or corrected child care details are received. <a href="../families/007-19022123-03.html#bp03_tbl_Rereconciliati_4">See Item 4</a>. <strong>Note</strong>&#58; when attendance is amended, the system waits three days before re-reconciliation occurs</li>
			<li>
Other details are updated. <a href="../families/007-19022123-03.html#bp03_tbl_Rereconciliati_5">See Item 5</a></li>		</ul>
		<li>
the system recalculates the customer's CCS entitlements using the new information and compares this with the result of the most recent reconciliation. The result will either be a top up, overpayment or nil adjustment</li>
		<li>
ACCS periods are excluded from reconciliation. For re-reconciliation to occur for these periods, entitlement to ACCS would have ceased which would then require the CCS entitlement to be re-reconciled</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>CCS reconciliation letters</strong> (top up, nil adjustment or overpayment) include total amounts of ‘Child Care Subsidy entitlement’</p>

<p>Revised actual income can be transferred by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) at any time to trigger re-reconciliation. This depends on whether the link established through Mutual Customer Identification still exists with the ATO. The link with ATO is ended after three years, for example after 30 June 2009 for 2005-06 unless the customer has an outstanding FTB non-lodger debt for the financial year.</p>

<p>If the link is closed, further investigation may be required. See <a href="../families/007-13020010-01.html#bp03000000_Process">Mutual Customer Identification (MCI) process for family assistance customers.</a></p>

revised estimated adjusted taxable income is recorded (for example, non-lodger update) for the customer, current partner or previous partner</li>
		<li>
TFN details are recorded for the customer, current partner or previous partner</li>
		<li>
customer is recorded as deceased. Re-reconciliation will result in an overpayment for any CCS entitlement previously calculated for the period from the Monday of the CCS fortnight following the date of death</li>
		<li>
child is recorded as deceased. Re-reconciliation will include all child care attendance recorded for the child and any fee reduction that applied after the child's death, or</li>
		<li>
income support payment is retrospectively cancelled for the customer, current partner or a previous partner (for reasons other than compensation - '<strong>CMP</strong>'). CCS will be income tested from the Monday of the CCS fortnight following the date of effect of the cancellation and an overpayment may result. For reason '<strong>CMP</strong>', the customer is still entitled to CCS as if income support payment was not cancelled</li>
		<li>
immunisation details are updated</li>

child in Child Care Details updated (child entered or left customer's care). At reconciliation, the system uses child care details reported in the customer's name to determine eligibility rather than child in customer care details</li>
