<p><strong>I</strong>nterventions will have a keyword of <strong>Tier 1</strong> or <strong>Tier 2</strong> added to the IRS review. This keyword will help identify the tiered amount of JobKeeper Payment received.</p>

<p>Discuss the match data details with the customer to confirm a link between the customer and the employer details listed in the match data.</p>

<p>Check if the&#58;</p>

customer is or was receiving income from the matched employer, (wage or salary earner), or</li>

match data relates to self-employment. This could include sole trader, member of a partnership or through a private trust or private company</li>

check if the Legal Name/Trading Name on the <strong>IRMD</strong> screen matches the customer's name, or the business address is the same as the customer's</li>
		<li>
some sole traders do not register under a Trading Name and will have the match data showing the ABN only. If the details on the <strong>IRMD</strong> screen have an ABN but no Legal/Trading name, the customer is likely to be a sole trader</li>

<p>If the customer has said they are self-employed, use the following information to help decide the type of self-employment.</p>

<p>Check the Match data&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the Trading Name displays 2 names (e.g. Jane Citizen and John Citizen) this can indicate that the customer is involved in a <strong>partnership</strong></li>
		<li>
Involvement in a <strong>private trust</strong> can be identified by the Legal Name or Trading Names including the words Family Trust, The Trustee for, Unit Trust or As Trustee for (ATF), or</li>
		<li>
For a <strong>private company</strong>, the Legal Name or Trading Name can include the words Proprietary Limited, PTY LTD or P/L at the end of the name</li>
		</ul>
<p>Check the following screens to see what has been coded&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
For an <strong>employee</strong>, check <strong>EAN/EANS</strong> screen</li>
		<li>
For <strong>self-employed</strong> as&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
a <strong>sole trade</strong>, check Real Estate and Business Summary (<strong>REBS</strong>) screen</li>
			<li>
member of a business <strong>partnership</strong>, check <strong>REBS</strong> screen</li>
			<li>
<strong>private trust</strong> or <strong>private company</strong>, check both the Link Summary (<strong>LS</strong>) and Trust/Company/Income/Assets Summary (<strong>TRCIAS</strong>) screens</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>Although a customer may run a business as a sole trader, they may be working as an employee and not self-employed. For example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a contractor can be considered self-employed or an employee depending on their circumstances</li>
		<li>
if the customer receives group certificates, they are generally considered an employee</li>
		</ul>
<p><a target="_blank" href="../business-and-employers/043-03030000-05.html">The Decision Support Tool (DST</a>) helps to decide the customer's employment status. Only use it for customers who identify as a sole trader or member of a partnership. <strong>Do not</strong> use it for customers involved in private trusts or private companies.

<p>From 7 December 2020, employment income is assessed once it is paid by an employer to their employee. This is the 'Pay Date' or 'Date Paid' on the customer's payslip.</p>

<p>If the customer does not get a payslip, they would need to confirm this information with their employer. Even if there is a delay between when an employer pays their employee and when the employee receives the pay, (due to the time it takes to transfer funds between banks), employment income is still considered paid on the date it is disbursed by the employer.</p>

<p>Note the following JobKeeper Payments as per the ATO&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
before 28 September 2020, minimum $1,500 pf</li>
		<li>
from 28 September 2020 until 3 January 2021&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Tier 1&#58; minimum $1,200 pf</li>

Tier 2&#58; minimum $750 pf</li>		</ul>

from 4 January 2021 until 28 March 2021&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Tier 1 minimum $1,000 pf</li>
			<li>
Tier 2 minimum $650 pf</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the employer determines the Tier rate and notifies the ATO.</p>

<p>If required, place the customer on fortnightly reporting. See <a href="../job-seekers/001-18120536-01.html">Reporting requirements for job seekers</a>.</p>

<p>The customer may not be able to provide all the employment income information at the time of the call. They may be away from their home and can provide the information later. In this scenario, consider sending a QSS32 to the customer.</p>

<p>As stated above, the customer must be advised that the request was issued under section 63/64 of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 and that their payments may be suspended and/or cancelled if they do not respond. This must be documented on the customer record.</p>

<p>The customer can call back to provide updates after getting the required information.</p>

<p>Procedure ends here until the customer calls back or the review comes DUE.</p>

<p>If the required information is not supplied by the due date, there is no need to try to contact the customer before manual suspension. This is because they have been advised the request is issued under section 63/64 of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 and this is clearly documented on the customer's record.</p>
