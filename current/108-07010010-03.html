<p>All employment income paid must be reported. This includes employment income that is paid when the customer and/or partner is travelling overseas. Customers should advise this income before leaving Australia to ensure their income is assessed correctly.</p>

<p>If a statement reporter leaves Australia, they are re-profiled as a notification reporter from the date the customer leaves Australia. Notification reporter provisions apply and the customer must still advise of changes within the required timeframe. For information about payment specific portability rules, see <a href="../australians-overseas/061-02000000-01.html">Leaving Australia</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Customers who are not payable outside Australia</strong></p>

<p>Customers who are not payable outside Australia but are paid employment income whilst overseas must still report this income.</p>

<p>The system will profile statement reporters to a notification reporter when payment is suspended due to an overseas departure.</p>

<p>If the customer is a statement reporter and will be paid employment income on or after their departure, they must report their income on the business day before departure to ensure they do not incur an overpayment. The date of event (DOV) for income will be the date paid. The income is still apportioned across the full entitlement period.</p>

<p>If the customer is partnered and their partner will leave on a different date or is not going with them, any employment income paid to either member of the couple must be coded on the earliest departure date.</p>

<p>If a customer fails to advise employment income before departure, the customer may incur an overpayment.</p>

<p>Do not change the Entitlement Period End Day (EPED) to an earlier date prior to departure; the system will issue any entitlement after departure.</p>

<p><strong>Customers who continue to be payable and receive employment income while overseas</strong></p>

<p>Customers who are statement reporters in the fortnight of departure must report before departure for the correct payment to be made. The date of event (DOV) for income in the period will be the date the employment income is paid. The income is still apportioned across the full entitlement period.</p>

<p>If they are partnered and their partner will leave on a different date or is not going with them, any employment income paid for either member of the couple must be coded on the earliest departure date.</p>

<p>For customers receiving employment income (i.e. leave payments) while overseas due to a temporary absence from employment, their income will continue to be assessed.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Is the customer or their partner required to report employment income prior to departure?</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>, where a customer is advising their income early because they are departing overseas, use the <strong>Earnings and Reporting Workflow</strong>, which will update the Employment Income Paid Details (<strong>EAPP</strong>) screen. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010010-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Employment_inco01">Table 3</a></li>

Begin the restoration on the Benefit Action (<strong>BA</strong>) screen and then manually code the employment income on the <strong>EAPP</strong> screen and finalise</li>

If the customer has an outstanding report, manually release the payment on the <strong>RR</strong> screen. See <a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-18120555-03.html">Reporting screens</a></li>

<p>Due to system limitations, Parenting Payment (PP) will not always cancel automatically at the end of an employment income nil rate period. For manual coding, see <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010160-01.html">Employment income nil rate period</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the customer is a job seeker with a cancellation status of <strong>CAN-FTE</strong> and this status is incorrect as the customer only worked casually/part-time, investigation is required. Check the <strong>EAPP</strong> screen for previous 'Full Time On-going (<strong>FTO</strong>)' status coding.</p>

<p>If an <strong>FTO</strong> status was previously coded on <strong>EAPP</strong> and another employer has since been coded, the system may have recognised the <strong>FTO</strong> coding on the previous employer and updated the Customer Employment Status Update (<strong>EAES</strong>) screen. To correct this, code the following on <strong>EAPP</strong> for the previous employer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>

<p>There are system limitations relating to PPP customers when their partner's payment is suspended.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If an NSS partner of a PPP customer is suspended, any income recorded on the NSS partner record may not give the correct rate for the PPP customer. This is because no excess partner income can be calculated</li>
		<li>
If a PEN partner of a PPP customer is suspended, including Returned To Work (RTW), any income recorded on the PEN partner's record is incorrectly assessed using the pension Income Test. The correct Income Test used for the PPP customer must be the <a href="../utils/RatesChart/rateschart.html">partner not on pension, Austudy or YA</a> Income Test</li>
		</ul>
<p>In both the above circumstances, do not restore the partner's record. Apply a manual rate for the PPP customer. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-08180000-01.html">Coding a manual rate of payment</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Smart Centre staff must contact Technical Peer Support (TPS) who will forward this information to their Service Support Officer (SSO) to calculate the rate and forward an <strong>ACTDOC</strong> to the appropriate service centre to code. If an overpayment occurs, send an <strong>ACTDOC</strong> to the local Debt Raising Team to investigate.</p>

<p>Continuous income frequencies (<strong>1WE</strong>, <strong>2WE</strong> and <strong>MTE</strong>) can only be recorded in limited circumstances. Customers cannot select a continuous frequency through self-service channels and must contact to determine eligibility (with the exception of customers whose records are in Environment I with an overseas address).</p>

<p>It is the Service Officer's responsibility to determine if the customer is eligible to have a continuous income frequency applied. Where a continuous income frequency is recorded, the Service Officer must include how the customer has met the exception criteria in the Finalisation notes or in a separate <strong>DOC</strong>.</p>

<p>Check if the customer is paid regular income and meets either the 1WE or 2WE exception or the Pension Monthly Exception Rule.</p>

<p><strong>If the customer is paid irregular income or does not meet either exception</strong>, they must be placed onto statement reporting and income will be recorded with a non-continuous frequency (<strong>IOP/LOP</strong>).</p>

<p><strong>If a continuous frequency is already recorded, or one is being recorded within a retrospective update</strong>, staff should ensure that the exception criteria are still met. If not, the exemption should be ceased and the customer (and/or their partner) must be placed onto statement reporting, if applicable and income will be recorded with a non-continuous frequency (<strong>IOP/LOP</strong>).

<p>All employment income paid must be reported. This includes employment income that is paid when the customer and/or partner is travelling overseas. Customer should advise this income before leaving Australia to ensure their income is assessed correctly.</p>

<p>If a statement reporter leaves Australia, they are re-profiled as a notification reporter from the date the customer leaves Australia. Notification reporter provisions do apply and the customer must still advise of changes within the required timeframe. For information about payment specific portability rules, see <a href="../australians-overseas/061-02000000-01.html">Leaving Australia</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Customers who are not payable outside Australia</strong></p>

<p>Customers who are not payable outside Australia but are paid employment income whilst overseas must still report this income.</p>

<p>The system will profile statement reporters to a notification reporter when payment is suspended due to an overseas departure.</p>

<p>If the customer is a statement reporter and will be paid <strong>employment income on or after their departure</strong>, they must report their income on the business day before departure to ensure they do not incur an overpayment. The date of event (DOV) for income will be the date paid. The income is still apportioned across the full entitlement period.</p>

<p>If the customer is partnered and their partner will leave on a different date or is not going with them, any employment income for either member of the couple must be coded on the earliest departure date.</p>

<p>If a customer fails to advise employment income before departure, the customer may incur an overpayment.</p>

<p>Do not change the Entitlement Period End Day (EPED) to an earlier date prior to departure; the system will issue any entitlement after departure.</p>

<p><strong>Customers who continue to be payable and receive employment income while overseas</strong></p>

<p>Customers who are statement reporters in the fortnight of departure must report before departure for the correct payment to be made. The date of event (DOV) for income in the period will be the date the employment income is paid. The income is still apportioned across the full entitlement period.</p>

<p>If they are partnered and their partner will leave on a different date or is not going with them, any employment income paid for either member of the couple must be coded on the earliest departure date.</p>

<p>For customers receiving employment income (that is, leave payments) while overseas due to a temporary absence from employment, their income will continue to be assessed.</p>

<p>There are system limitations relating to PPP customers when their partner's payment is suspended.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If an NSS partner of a PPP customer is suspended, any income recorded on the NSS partner record may not give the correct rate for the PPP customer. This is because no excess partner income can be calculated</li>
		<li>
If a PEN partner of a PPP customer is suspended, including Returned To Work (RTW), any income recorded on the PEN partner's record is incorrectly assessed using the pension Income Test. The correct Income Test used for the PPP customer must be the <a href="../utils/RatesChart/rateschart.html">partner not on pension, Austudy or YA</a> Income Test</li>
		</ul>
<p>In both the above circumstances, do not restore the partner's record. Apply a manual rate for the PPP customer. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-08180000-01.html">Coding a manual rate of payment</a>. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> Smart Centre staff must contact Technical Peer Support (TPS), who will forward this information to their Service Support Officer (SSO) to calculate the rate and forward an <strong>ACTDOC</strong> to the appropriate service centre to code.
