<p><strong>Generate report</strong></p>

<p>To request customer incomes, generate an Income request report in Cuba.</p>

<p>Go to the CSA Main Menu/Management/International Request Report.</p>

<p>In the International Request Find window, select the <strong>Income Request</strong> transaction type and choose the dates. As the report is sent each Friday, the dates will be the previous Friday to the current Friday.</p>

<p>Select the Excel icon on the top left of the screen to generate the Income Request Report as an Excel spreadsheet.</p>

<p><strong>Save spreadsheet</strong></p>

<p>Save the spreadsheet in the share drive G/Int/NZ/YYYY/PP NZ – OUTs/Incomes requested and name the spreadsheet 'Income Requests sent to NZ ddmmyy (include the number of actual requests).</p>

<p>Correct any obvious errors in the spreadsheet.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when generating this report in Cuba save the report immediately. Once the report is generated, the data is erased from Cuba and cannot be recovered as a subsequent report.</p>

<p><strong>Modify spreadsheet</strong></p>

<p>Add 'Y' to each entry in column G 'Current Benefit Income Y/N', and add 'Date Benefit Started if Y'. Remove 'Paying Parents (PP) Name' from column F and replace with 'Customers Name'.</p>

<p>Where an Inland Revenue Department number (IRD) has not been populated on the spreadsheet, check the customer details in Cuba and include the customer’s DOB in the IRD field as&#58; 'DOB DD/MM/YY'.</p>

<p>Save and close the spreadsheet and attach into the weekly exchange.</p>

<p><strong>Income Requests for Ended Cases</strong></p>

<p>If a Service Officer has to request an income on an ended case, they complete the template saved in G/Int/NZ/Income requests to NZ with the relevant data.</p>

<p>Copy and paste this information on to the bottom of the Income Request spreadsheet to NZIR for the current week.</p>

<p>Child Support requests customers’ residency details and associated information from NZIR. There is a limit of 70 customer location requests per week. Requests for other information do not form part of the limit of 70.</p>

<p><strong>Generate report</strong></p>

<p>To collate the tracing request information, generate a Tracing Request report in Cuba.</p>

<p>Go to the CSA Main Menu/Management/International Request Report.</p>

<p>In the International Request Find window, select the Tracing Request transaction type and choose the dates. As the report is sent each Friday, the dates will be the previous Friday to the current Friday.</p>

<p>Select the Excel icon on the top left of the screen. This will generate the Tracing Request Report as an Excel spreadsheet.</p>

<p><strong>Save spreadsheet</strong></p>

<p>Save the spreadsheet in the share drive G/Int/NZ/YYYY/PP NZ – OUTs/Tracing Sent and name the spreadsheet Tracing Requests sent to NZ ddmmyy (include the number of actual requests).</p>

<p>Correct any obvious errors in the spreadsheet.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when generating this report in Cuba, save the report immediately. Once the report is generated, the data is erased from Cuba and cannot be recovered as a subsequent report.</p>

<p><strong>Request second report</strong></p>

<p>If there are 70 requests in the first report, generate another Tracing Request report (after saving the first one) for the same dates. Copy and paste any extra requests into a new spreadsheet. Save this spreadsheet in the share drive G/Int/NZ/YYYY/PP NZ – OUTs/Tracing Sent choosing the next Friday’s date. Ensure these are added to the following week’s spreadsheet.</p>

<p><strong>Apply filter</strong></p>

<p>Before sending the tracing request to New Zealand, identify each request that is an additional request for payee incomes. Apply a filter to identify blanks in the Primary Customer Surname column. The cases displayed should only be payee income requests. Update the additional comments column with 'RP income please'. Remove all future years of income from the sheet.</p>

<p>Re-format all dates in the spreadsheet as some may be in American format. To do this, highlight the first column of dates (date sent) select the 'Data' tab in excel and choose 'text to columns' option. Select 'next', 'next', change the selection to 'MDY' and select finish. Follow the same process for the data in the Primary Customer’s DOB and the Other Party’s DOB.</p>

<p>The Taxable income year of 2012 is duplicated so the 2<sup>nd</sup> 2012 year must be changed to 2013. The following years must be updated so they run in sequential order without any duplications</p>

<p>Add 2 columns to the end of the existing template and give them headings of “NZIR Comments” and &quot;NZIR Positive / Negative Result&quot;.</p>

<p>A maximum of 35 transmittals can be sent to NZIR each week. These are sent via the secure mailbox on Friday as an attachment to the Weekly Exchange Out information transfer.</p>

<p><strong>Create new spreadsheet</strong></p>

<p>Create a new (blank) spreadsheet and open the ‘Transmittal OUT.xls’ spreadsheet from the share drive G/Int/NZ. Copy all of the data from the Transmittal Out spreadsheet and paste it into the newly created spreadsheet.</p>

<p>Save this spreadsheet in the share drive G/Int/NZ/YYYY/PP NZ – OUTs/Transmittals sent with the file name ‘Transmittals sent to NZ ddmmyy.xls (xx)’ include the number of transmittals included on the sheet in brackets after the date. Check there is no missing data in the IRD column as a case cannot be transmitted without this.</p>

<p><strong>Modify spreadsheet</strong></p>

<p>Correct any obvious errors in the spreadsheet such as keying errors in the actual exchange rate or the exchange rate &amp; exchange rate date in the wrong columns. Ensure children’s last names are included. Send an email to the Service Officer identifying the customer, CSID and the error advising their transaction has been removed from the spreadsheet and they must re-submit the transmittal.</p>

<p>Delete any blank rows. Make a note of the number of transmittals to be sent thus far, remembering there is a maximum of 35 per week. If there are more than 35, only send the bottom 35 rows and save the excess separately to be sent the following week.</p>

<p>Apply the following formula to calculate the $NZ amount for the last ongoing monthly amount&#58; '=' click on the mthly amount in $AUD, then '*' then click on the exchange rate. Hit enter. This will calculate the conversion from AUD to NZD. Copy the formula down the page, then copy and paste values into the same cells to over-ride the formula calculations, but retain the data. This ensures the figures will not be adjusted or compromised if any of the other data is changed. Save the spreadsheet.</p>

<p>Close the saved spreadsheet, which will return to the master workbook. In the master workbook highlight rows from row 3 down to the end of the data. Once the sheet is highlighted select ‘Edit’ from the menu tool bar, select ‘Clear’ and ‘Contents’. This clears the data being sent to NZ from the workbook.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> do not select Delete to remove the data as formulas are linked to row 3 which create the notepad for Cuba.</p>

<p>The Senior Service Officer must ensure staff have not used the previous day’s exchange rate on the 1st day of a new month. This is critical if there is an ongoing liability</p>

<p>Where the end of the month occurs mid-week, separate the data in the spreadsheets sent in the following weekly exchange. Enter the data for the first month as usual. Copy the row containing the headings and insert below the last entry from the first month so the two batches of data have separate headings to indicate a change of months.</p>

<p><strong>Payments received from NZIR</strong></p>

<p>On approximately the 22nd of each month, payments from NZ are applied to paying parents accounts.

For example, cases processed that include payments from the schedule received in the previous month&#58; “includes payments from your MM (previous month) payment schedule or cases processed that include payments from the schedule received in the current month&#58; “includes payments from your MM (current month) payment schedule.</p>
