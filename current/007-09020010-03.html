<p>To be eligible for PPL, a customer must be the primary carer of a PPL child.</p>

<p>The primary claimant can receive up to 18 weeks of PPL. This is 90 Payable days.</p>

<p>Primary claimants can claim the full amount for themselves or choose to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
transfer some or all of their PPL period to another person</li>
		<li>
give permission for another person to claim some or all of their Flexible PPL days, if their child is born or entrusted to their primary care on or after 1 July 2020</li>
		</ul>
<p>The other person must claim, have primary care of the child and be an eligible <a href="../families/007-09020020-01.html">secondary/tertiary claimant</a>.</p>

<p>Most often, the primary claimant will be the birth mother or the initial primary carer of an adopted child. Another person may be eligible as a primary claimant only if exceptional circumstances eligibility criteria are met. For example, the birth mother is incapable of caring for the child. </p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> primary claimants in exceptional circumstances can claim up to the full amount of PPL if they are eligible. Secondary claimants who become the primary carer in exceptional circumstances are only eligible for up to the remainder of the PPL that is not claimed by the primary claimant. It will depend on how much PPL was paid to the primary claimant.</p>

<p>If the customer is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the birth mother of a newborn child or the initial primary carer of an adopted child, see <a href="../families/007-09020010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Eligibility_req_Step01">Step 1, Table 2</a></li>

<p>If customer is claiming PPL in exceptional circumstances, evidence to support the circumstance is required as part of their claim. For example, proof of the&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
surrogacy arrangements, or </li>
		<li>
condition resulting in the birth mother (and partner) being incapable of caring for the child for at least 26 weeks</li>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> pre-birth claims for primary claimants in exceptional circumstances will display as ASS-PCB. If the exceptional circumstance criteria is not met, the post birth/add newborn claim activity will finalise with a PPL claim status of REJ-ACN.</p>

<p>If PPL claimants in exceptional circumstances meet all eligibility for PPL including the PPL work and income test, they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
can be eligible for PPL as a primary claimant, and </li>
		<li>
claim the full amount of PPL</li>
		</ul>
<p>However, if a customer claims PPL and meets the exceptional circumstances criteria, but have not met the work and income test, they may still be eligible to claim the remainder of the PPL which was not paid to the initial primary claimant. See <a href="../families/007-09020020-01.html">Eligibility for Parental Leave Pay (PPL) as a secondary or tertiary claimant</a>.</p>

If the <strong>birth mother no longer provides care</strong>, they are only eligible for PPL in the first 18 weeks after birth if they no longer provide care because the child&#58;</li>

			<li>
due to a surrogacy arrangement</li>
			<li>
is removed from care by a state or territory child protection authority, acting under child protection legislation</li>		</ul>

If the <strong>birth mother is in prison</strong> they can meet the primary carer rule if they gave birth in prison and can care for their child in prison or, if imprisoned after the birth, they continue to care for the child in prison</li>

If the <strong>primary carer is temporarily unable to care for the child</strong>, they may remain eligible if it is due to circumstances beyond their control and the period is expected to be less than 26 weeks</li>

care is lost without legal authority, or</li>
			<li>
care is disputed, and the customer takes reasonable steps to have the child returned to their care. This includes periods before a claim has been made</li>		</ul>

<strong>Adoptive and commissioning parents</strong> can be eligible for the full 18 weeks of PPL as the primary claimant regardless of any period the birth mother received PPL. </li>

<p>Primary claimants can give permission for another person to claim some or all of their 30 Flexible PPL days.</p>

<p>This can be done when they claim PPL or later.</p>

<p>If a customer grants permission for another person to claim their Flexible PPL, the secondary claimant needs to submit a claim and be found eligible for PPL. The primary claimant’s claim must be assessed before the secondary claimant’s claim.</p>

<p>The customer can remove permission at any time before the secondary claimant has claimed and nominated dates for the Flexible PPL days.</p>

<p><strong>PPL claim status</strong></p>

<p>The primary claimant’s PPL claim level status will be <strong>CZR-FLX</strong> until all Flexible PPL days have been claimed by an eligible secondary claimant. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> this includes where the primary claimant has transferred their full entitlement.</p>

<p>This allows the primary claimant access to remove permission to claim Flexible PPL days up to when they have been claimed by a secondary claimant.</p>

<p>A customer cannot receive JobKeeper Payment for the same period they receive PPL. It is the customer’s responsibility to advise their employer the <strong>start date</strong> and <strong>end date </strong>of their <strong>PPL period</strong> (not the dates PPL was received).</p>

<p>A customer can select a NSD for their PPL period that is after their JobKeeper Payment period <strong>only</strong> where they have not returned to work.

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> FTB Part B is not payable at the same time as PPL.

<p>Advise the customer they must provide <a href="../families/007-03010030-01.html">proof of the child's birth</a> or verification of the child entering the customer's care if this has not already been given to Services Australia. This includes proof of a stillborn child.</p>

<p><strong>Proof of entry to care for surrogacy</strong></p>

<p>For children who have entered the customer's care as a part of a surrogacy arrangement, the surrogacy agreement should be provided to confirm the surrogacy arrangement between the birth mother and the commissioning parents and include the care arrangements of the child.</p>

<p>The agreement should specify who will care for the child and the date the child will enter the care of the commissioning parent. The document should also establish whether the birth mother has relinquished care of the child.</p>

<p>If a determination cannot be made using the information provided, refer the case to the Service Support Officer (SSO) via the Direct Referral to SSO webform. The SSO may then determine a referral to the Level 2 Policy Helpdesk via the Online Form is required.</p>

<p>Before staff complete a referral they must ensure it contains all details of the surrogacy arrangement with any relevant documentation provided by the customer.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> surrogacy agreement referrals are only required as part of the post-birth claim process.</p>

<p>The <a href="../families/007-09020010-05.html">Resources</a> page contains links to the Direct Referral to SSO webform and the Level 2 Policy Helpdesk Online Query form.</p>

<p><strong>Multiple birth</strong></p>

<p>PPL can only be paid for one child in a multiple birth.</p>

<p><strong>Exception&#58;</strong> PPL can be paid if there is a significant delay (e.g. 5 days or more) between the separate birth events for each child.</p>

<p>In these cases&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer must provide a letter from the doctor/midwife who attended the births confirming that the children were&#58; </li>
			<ul>			<li>
of the same pregnancy and </li>
			<li>
born in separate birthing events</li>		</ul>
		<li>
use the Direct Referral to SSO webform and the Level 2 Policy Helpdesk Online Query form with the letter from the doctor/midwife to refer the case. The <a href="../families/007-09020010-05.html">Resources</a> page contains links</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p>The separate birthing events could be less than 5 days apart, but this would be confirmed by the doctor/midwife.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Birth registration</strong></p>

<p>To be eligible for a newborn child, parent(s)/guardian(s) must notify the department that they have registered or applied to register the child's birth with the State/Territory Births registry. Customers may notify this verbally.</p>

<p><strong>Exception&#58;</strong> This does not apply to stillborn children, adoptions or children born overseas.</p>
