<p>This document outlines information about the Defence Force Income Support Allowance (DFISA) and how it supplemented income support payments affected by Adjusted Disability Pension from DVA.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Defence_Force_I">Defence Force Income Support Allowance (DFISA)</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>DFISA was an income support payment paid by the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) to customers whose social security pension or benefit was reduced (including to nil) because of the inclusion of Adjusted Disability Pension from DVA as assessable income.</p>

<p>DFISA was introduced on 20 September 2004 and ceased on 1 January 2022, when Adjusted Disability Pension became exempt income under the Social Security Act 1991. Retrospective DFISA assessments and payments may still occur for periods prior to 1 January 2022.</p>

<p>Payments made under other Commonwealth Acts and regulations were not covered by the DFISA legislation however the Veterans' Entitlements (DFISA-like Payment) Regulations 2005 provides for DFISA-like payments.  Customers paid under these acts and regulations received DFISA-like payments identical to DFISA payments, rather than DFISA, and unless specified in this document, the term ‘DFISA’ covers ‘DFISA-like’ also. These payments commenced on 20 September 2004 and ceased no later than 1 January 2022.</p>

<p>Where a customer's Adjusted Disability Pension from DVA affected their partner's rate of social security pension or benefit, the partner may have also been entitled to receive DFISA payments.</p>

<p>DFISA was also paid where there was a reduction in rate because of the inclusion of Adjusted Disability Pension from DVA in the assessment of Lump Sum Bereavement Payment, Pension Bonus Scheme and Home Equity Access Scheme.</p>

<p>There was no claim form or claim process for DFISA. Eligibility is automatically assessed by the Services Australia system for all customers who are paid Adjusted Disability Pension from DVA.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Calculation_of_">Calculation of DFISA for periods before 1 January 2022</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A person's rate of DFISA is equal to the difference between the <strong>actual rate</strong> of social security pension or benefit the person receives, and their <strong>notional rate</strong>, which is the rate they would receive if Adjusted Disability Pension from DVA&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
was excluded from income in the assessment of the person's actual rate, but</li>
		<li>
included in the calculation of rent assistance (for example, the DVA disability income rent test is applied)</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p><strong>DFISA = notional rate minus actual rate</strong></p>

<p></p>

<p>The amount of DFISA will be automatically recalculated at each rate reassessment for periods before 1 January 2022, and transmission of new DFISA information will be sent to DVA at the end of every business day. DVA will generally pay DFISA fortnightly on the DVA payday.</p>

<p>A manual DFISA calculation will be needed for customers who are on a <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-08180000-01.html">manual rate of payment</a> for their pension or benefit, or where the system cannot perform an automatic rate calculation. Manual DFISA calculations are done by the DVA Clearance Team.</p>

<p>If the customer was being paid their social security pension or benefit under the <strong>Assets Test</strong>, they will not attract DFISA payments as the Adjusted Disability Pension from DVA did not reduce their payment rate. If their assessment method subsequently changes from the Assets Test to the Income Test, the system will automatically calculate whether the customer is entitled to DFISA for past periods.</p>

<p>See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-03060000-03.html">Process</a> for information on how to calculate DFISA.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>When a customer's income precludes entitlement to their income support payment, their pension or benefit is usually rejected or cancelled. Before 1 January 2022, customers who were paid an Adjusted Disability Pension from DVA would have a DFISA calculation done before this occurred. If DFISA was greater than zero, their pension or benefit status was held as Current Zero Rate (CZR-DFISA). These customers were regarded as receiving the pension or benefit for which they qualify and entitled to the associated benefits and concessions relevant to their payment.</p>

<p>CZR-DFISA customers must have continued to qualify for their pension or benefit, and meet the obligations associated with their particular payment. </p>

<p>Under family assistance law, CZR-DFISA customers were taken to be receiving the social security pension or benefit which was supplemented by their DFISA payment. They would therefore be exempt from the FTB Part A income test.</p>

<p>Customers ceased to be CZR-DFISA from 1 January 2022 as Adjusted Disability Pension from DVA was no longer assessed under the income test for income support payments.            </p>

<p>DFISA payments for stimulus reporters were calculated and transmitted to DVA when the customer reported their income at the end of every entitlement period up until 1 January 2022. This was to ensure all income was taken into account when DFISA was calculated, and reduced the risk of overpayment. DVA paid DFISA retrospectively for the entitlement period.</p>

These rules remain unchanged with DFISA, meaning half the total combined DVA Adjusted Disability Pension was assessed as income against each customer for periods before 1 January 2022.</p>

<p><strong>For pension/allowance couples with Rent Assistance (RA)</strong>, the RA is paid to the pension customer. To establish the amount of DFISA payable, the notional rate of pension and notional RA were added together to obtain the pension customer’s total notional rate. The notional RA amount was calculated using the DVA disability income rent test, in which the couple’s combined Adjusted Disability Pension income was halved in order to obtain the RA reduction amount used in the calculation.</p>

<p>When a partner’s <strong>ordinary income</strong> exceeds the Partner Income Free Area (which is the cut-out point where the partner’s benefit is no longer payable), it reduces the rate of allowance payable to the customer. To calculate the amount of partner excess income to deduct from the customer’s fortnightly payment, the Partner Income Free Area is deducted from the partner's income and multiplied by 0.6. See the <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-03060000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Manual_calculat01_Step05">Process</a> page for further information.</p>

<p>A partner’s <strong>compensation direct deduction excess income</strong> is treated as ordinary income for the customer.</p>

<p>For the calculation of DFISA, all steps in the calculation of a customer’s rate must be mirrored in the <strong>notional rate calculation</strong>, for example, if there is compensation direct deduction excess in the actual calculation, this must be included in the notional calculation.</p>

<p>Partner Adjusted Disability Pension from DVA excess income is obtained by subtracting notional partner excess income from the actual partner excess income.</p>

<p>The resulting amount is subtracted from the customer’s notional RA as a final step in the DVA disability income rent test.</p>

<p><strong>Historical Note&#58;</strong></p>

<p>The DFISA-attracting payment Community Development Employment Project Scheme Participation Supplement ceased on 30 June 2015. In respect of Newstart system (NSS), a customer partnered with Parenting system (PGA) customer, or both NSS customers, or partnered to an ABSTUDY customer, excess wages were treated as ordinary income or employment income for the partner, not as direct deductions.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>From 20 September 2009 changes to the pension income test were made as a result of the Pension Reform. As part of this reform, <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-03010070-01.html">transitional rules</a> were put in place to ensure no pension customer was worse off following the introduction of the new income test.</p>

<p>To qualify for their payment to be calculated under the transitional rules, a customer must have been on a relevant pension payment and been payable as at 19 September 2009, and have had no break in entitlement. They will continue to be paid under <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-03010070-01.html">transitional rules</a> until they are entitled to an equal or higher rate under the new rules implemented on 20 September 2009. Once this occurs they move to the new income test rules permanently.</p>

<p><strong>The DFISA rate must be included when the comparison is conducted</strong> between the rate payable under transitional rules and the rate payable under the new rules (that is, the current income test), as DFISA is part of the total income support payment received by the customer.</p>

<p>These rate comparisons will be made by the system. Where an automatic calculation cannot occur a manual rate calculation will be completed by a Service Officer within the DVA Clearance Team.</p>
