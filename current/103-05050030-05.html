<p><strong>Offering a standard advance of a person's social security entitlement rather than a SEA</strong></p>

<p>It is easier for a customer to qualify for a standard advance of their social security entitlement payment rather than the SEA, however providing a standard advance may not always be the best solution for a customer and could limit the availability of future standard advances. Service Officers are to assess the customer's eligibility for the SEA and discuss this option with the customer.</p>

<p>If a customer is likely to go off payment, the outstanding balance of the advance is converted to a debt and the appropriate recovery action is taken. If the customer is likely to continue on payment, processing a SEA might allow them to keep the standard advance 'in reserve'. A standard advance can be offered as an alternative to an SEA if this is unavailable or the customer prefers. It is not mandatory to utilise the standard advance options before applying for an SEA.</p>

In the first fortnight that the customer is affected, follow the usual verification procedure for unreceived earnings. Essentially, this means verifying when the customer is going to be paid. SEA for unreceived earnings can only be considered when the customer has declared their earnings and their Centrelink payment is reduced by at least 50%</li>
		</ul>
<p>The amount of SEA payable will be the smallest of&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the amount requested</li>
		<li>
the effect of unreceived income on the customer's entitlement</li>
		<li>
the remaining SEA balance available</li>
		</ul>
<p>For subsequent requests, the outstanding balance of an earlier SEA will reduce the amount of the SEA. This will make sure that the $500 SEA limit is not exceeded.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a new SEA application is needed for each subsequent unreceived earnings affected fortnight</li>
		<li>
information required in these applications will only need to satisfy Centrelink that the customer's circumstances will still allow them to qualify for SEA</li>
		<li>
it is most unlikely that it would be necessary to carry out new verifications</li>		</ul>

<p><strong>How early can a customer apply for SEA for a return to work?</strong></p>

<p>Customers applying for an SEA because of unreceived casual earnings cannot 'apply' until the payday that the unreceived earnings affects their rate of payment.</p>

<p>A customer who needs help to return to work can put in the application any time before they return to work.</p>

<p>It is still necessary to check that the customer meets all the necessary verification requirements (harder if this is a long time before the job is to start). In addition, the SEA payment should not be made until the customer needs to incur the costs of starting the job.</p>

<p>For example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
A Tasmanian customer has been offered a job on the mainland and is due to start in several weeks' time. SEA is sought to help primarily with the cost of getting to the job location. If the customer is eligible for the SEA, it should be paid as soon as the customer needs the money to pay for their transport. If the customer wants to reduce their costs by way of 'advance purchase' of a ticket, the SEA would need to be paid in time to allow this</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> it is not up to Centrelink to decide what mode of transport the customer should use.</p>
