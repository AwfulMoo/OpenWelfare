<p>Load care objections into the Objection Maintenance window while the customer is on the phone. Document the information in real time using the <a href="../separated-parents/elements/macros/ObjectionsFirstContact.html">First contact macro</a>.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
the relevant care percentage decision to which they are objecting</li>
		<li>
their concerns about the original decision and what they hope to achieve by lodging an objection</li>
		<li>
clarification of information previously discussed with the decision maker or other Service Officer</li>
		<li>
confirmation of their intention to lodge an objection</li>
		<li>
the objections process, including Child Support open exchange of information policy. </li>
		<li>
administrative options available to resolve their concerns</li>
		<li>
evidence that can be used to establish the claims must be factual and helpful</li>
		<li>
only ask for evidence relevant to the decision being objected to, which may include&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
day care sign in sheets,</li>
			<li>
appointments or events the parent attended with the child,</li>
			<li>
calendar entries showing care details,</li>
			<li>
statements from third party individuals confirming dates and times of care<br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> The applicant should have sought permission from that third party before sending these to child support.</li>		</ul>
		<li>
If Centrelink made the care decision, gather and review the evidence used in the decision </li>
		<li>
possible outcomes, including potential contrary or adverse decision</li>
		<li>
the option to withdraw the objection at any time before the decision has been finalised. If the applicant wants to withdraw the objection, explain&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
it is their choice to withdraw the objection</li>
			<li>
they cannot request an AAT review of a withdrawn objection as no decision has been made</li>
			<li>
the other party may lodge their own objection. If the other parent has already lodged their own objection and does not want to withdraw, the objection will continue</li>
			<li>
there is a cooling off period of 48 hours before finalising the application as ’withdrawn’ in Cuba</li>
			<li>
they must contact the Objections Service Officer within 48 hours to change their decision about withdrawing their objection</li>
			<li>
they can re-object at any time if objecting to a care percentage decision. This includes the date of event of a care change. However, if the respondent objects outside the relevant timeframe any change to the care percentage will only apply to the assessment from the date the customer lodged the objection. This is unless there were special circumstances making the respondent unable to lodge an objection earlier</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>When recording an objection to a care decision over the phone&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
read the summarised information back to the customer</li>
		<li>
ask if they agree this reflects the grounds of their objection</li>
		<li>
ask if they would like to receive a copy of the grounds of their objection in writing</li>
		<li>
do not add additional content not relevant to the objection unless the customer provides this content</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer lodges the objection outside the relevant timeframe, ask them if any special circumstances made them unable to lodge an objection earlier.</p>

<p>If special circumstances exist, ask for evidence to support their claims. This will help determine the date of effect should the objection be successful. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-09170060-01.html">Child Support objection received out of time – Extension of time and Special Circumstance application</a>.</p>

<p>If the customer has not given enough evidence during the discussion, ask them to provide more information or documentation. Set a timeframe for them to provide the information. Ensure the customer has the correct fax number and/or address. Ensure they know they can provide supporting documentation using the <img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="Self service option is available" title="A self service option is available" /> myGov online service.</p>

<p>Taking a Care Objection by phone results in real-time redaction. The Service Officer taking the objection can decide not to record possible FDV content. This is not a decision that the objection is not properly made. For example, if a customer used obscene language that was deemed offensive while lodging an objection, the Service Officer is unlikely to document that content as part of the objection.</p>

<p>Use judgement while taking a Care Objection by phone to identify possible FDV content. Focus on the grounds relevant to the decision, filtering out irrelevant content.</p>

<p>Reading the grounds of their objection back to the customer ensures all the necessary and relevant content is recorded before it is accepted.</p>
