<div class="showcont">


<p>Job seeker compliance decisions are evidence-based decisions. This means the decision must be based on relevant facts.</p>

<p>All compliance investigations include evidence from both the person who reported the failure or generated the investigation, and the job seeker. Whether any further evidence is required to reach a decision, will depend on the clarity and consistency of these two forms of primary evidence.</p>

<p>The decision maker must be confident they have sufficient evidence to establish the facts relevant to the reported failure to make an informed decision.</p>

<p>Any evidence collected as part of a compliance investigation should&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
be specific to the reported non-compliance incident </li>
		<li>
focus on the issues that must be considered under the applicable legislation and policy. For example, the nature of the non-compliance event, whether the requirement was reasonable based on the job seeker's individual circumstances, the job seeker's capacity to comply and to make prior contact (when relevant to the decision)</li>
		</ul>
<p>The Participation Solutions Team (PST)-skilled Service Officer or Service Officers with UNPP security resource should attempt to gather sufficient evidence, complete the investigation and make a decision during the initial contact with the job seeker.</p>

<div class="showcont">


<p>Additional evidence is only required when there is insufficient evidence to reach a decision without it and where the additional information is likely to influence the outcome of the decision.</p>

<p>When additional evidence is required, the decision maker should explore whether this information already exists on the job seeker's record (for example, on the <strong>Circumstances Impacting Compliance</strong> screen) or if the job seeker can upload it during the conversation using <a href="../self-service/133-04060000-01.html">Upload documents</a>.</p>

<p>Additional verbal statements should also be gathered as a part of the initial job seeker contact when it will impact the outcome of the decision. For example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
additional supporting documentation does not exist on the job seeker’s record, or it would be unreasonable for the job seeker to supply it as a part of the conversation, or</li>
		<li>
the job seeker’s version of events is significantly different to the information supplied by the person reporting the non-compliance </li>		</ul>

<div class="showcont">


<p>When a mutual obligation failure is being considered, if additional information cannot be obtained during the job seeker's initial contact, a decision must be made based on the available evidence. </p>

<p>This is because the determination of a mutual obligation failure may result in a financial penalty which impacts the job seeker's entitlement to payments for their reporting period.</p>

<p>The <strong>Participation Compliance</strong> workflow does not permit a mutual obligation failure penalty investigation to be held pending the return of evidence, nor can the job seeker's payment be released for the relevant entitlement period until the compliance determination has been finalised.</p>

<p>PST-skilled Service Officers must consider what is likely, or more likely, to have occurred for the reported instance of non-compliance by considering factors like&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
exacerbation of previously declared and evidenced circumstances </li>
		<li>
declared natural disasters</li>
		<li>
if the circumstances disclosed as having impacted compliance in this instance were unforeseen or exceptional in nature</li>		</ul>

<div class="showcont">


<p>When the job seeker requires time to source and supply additional evidence, for an unemployment or work refusal failure, or for a failure under the Job Seeker Compliance Framework, they must be given reasonable opportunity to provide this before a decision is made. The PST-skilled Service Officer or Service Officer with UNPP security resource negotiates this timeframe with the job seeker. There is no mandatory timeframe for evidence to be supplied, however the timeframe should be appropriate for the job seeker's needs. Two working days is generally considered appropriate if the job seeker is unable to offer a reasonable timeframe to supply the evidence.</p>

<p>The Service Officer must&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
explain the benefits of providing the evidence in the agreed timeframe and the impact that failing to provide the evidence may have on the decision</li>
		<li>
document in the <strong>Further Evidence</strong> section&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
what evidence was requested </li>
			<li>
why and how this is likely to influence the outcome of the decision</li>
			<li>
when it is due, and</li>
			<li>
the job seeker is aware a decision about the failure will be made based on the available evidence if nothing additional is provided by the due date</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>The workflow will go to the <strong>Save and Exit</strong> page and automatically select the appropriate save and exit option to temporarily remove the contact trigger pending the return of evidence. </p>

<p>For Job Seeker Compliance Framework investigations, the system will auto restore payment if it is currently suspended 'DNA participation appointment' (APA).</p>

<p>On the Activity List (<strong>AL</strong>) screen, ensure the activity has been held with an appropriate due date, generally this will be the 'Due date given + 1'.</p>

<p>If the job seeker does not provide the requested evidence by the required date the contact trigger will be reinstated and the job seeker will not be able to complete their report until they have spoken to the PST. A decision should be made based on the available information. Facts that cannot be substantiated with evidence may either be given lesser weight, or be disregarded.</p>

<p>A job seeker's statement is considered primary evidence in the investigation and must always be considered when investigating a reported non-compliance event. Compliance action is not applied without first giving the job seeker an opportunity to explain the circumstances that led to the reported incident of non-compliance.</p>

<p>Under the principles of natural justice, all job seekers have a right to give their version of events when an incident of non-compliance is reported. This includes providing an opportunity to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
explain the circumstances that led to the alleged failure to comply, and</li>
		<li>
explain how their circumstances impacted their capacity to comply or ability to make prior contact (if relevant)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Generally this evidence can be collected verbally. A factual summary of the conversation must be recorded by the PST-skilled Service Officer or Service Officer with UNPP security resource.</p>

<p>When collecting a job seeker's statement the Service Officer is responsible for leading the discussion using&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
open questions to encourage the job seeker to give their version of events and explain any factors they believed impacted compliance</li>
		<li>
specific questions if further clarification is required or to resolve inconsistencies</li>
		<li>
strong call-handling skills to make sure the conversation remains focused on the specific non-compliance event as reported</li>
		</ul>
<p>The Service Officer records a concise and factual summary of the job seeker's statement in the <strong>Compliance Investigation</strong> workflow. Any additional evidence the job seeker would be willing to provide to support their statements should be recorded as part of this statement. The Service Officer should always encourage the job seeker to supply any additional, supporting documentation, even for Mutual Obligation Failure investigations. Whilst the Mutual Obligation Failure cannot be held pending this evidence being supplied, the documentation may be relevant if they wish to appeal the original decision once their evidence is lodged.</p>

<p>Ongoing job seeker circumstances may have a direct and significant impact on their ability to comply with their mutual obligation requirements and can play an important part in making a compliance decision.</p>

<p>When a job seeker is claiming an ongoing/intermittent circumstance directly contributed to non-compliance, check if the circumstance, impact and sufficient evidence are currently documented on the <strong>Circumstances Impacting Compliance</strong> screen.</p>

<p>Where a circumstance impacting compliance exists and has been confirmed previously, this can be used as evidence for the compliance investigation, particularly where the job seeker is stating a known circumstance has worsened.</p>

<p>If a job seeker's circumstances impacting compliance are not recorded, or there is insufficient information/evidence for the purposes of a compliance investigation, it must be gathered and documented on this screen during the investigation. Information recorded or updated on this screen during the investigation forms part of the evidence base for the investigation and can be viewed later as part of the completed summary for the compliance investigation.</p>

<p>When there are discrepancies between a provider's statement and the job seeker's statement which would influence the decision, additional information/evidence may need to be considered.</p>

<p>The provider should always be offered the opportunity to respond to the job seeker's statement when it conflicts with theirs. A telephone conversation at the job seeker's initial point of contact is generally the most effective method to help substantiate one singular version of events and make sure relevant information has not been missed.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
Targeted Compliance Framework decisions are made based on the available information</li>

Job Seeker Compliance Framework reports should be returned to the provider. Use an appropriate 'returned report' rejection reason on the <strong>Decision and Penalty</strong> page in the <strong>Compliance Investigation</strong> workflow and include specific information in the free text to the provider to clearly explain the discrepancy/disputed information that requires further clarification. Providers have 5 days to resubmit the report with the required information if they still wish to pursue compliance action under the Job Seeker Compliance Framework</li>		</ul>

Services Australia assessors or the job seeker's treating health care professionals to gather information about how their medical condition(s) impact(s) on capacity</li>

<p>It is preferable that evidence of this nature is gathered verbally while the job seeker is on the phone. This allows follow up questions, quicker decision making and if required, appropriate interventions to support the job seeker. However, evidence from third parties may also include written statements or other supporting documents.</p>

<p>Contact with specialists in regards to understanding the impact of job seeker's circumstances on capacity to comply are recorded on the <strong>Circumstances Impacting Compliance</strong> screen.</p>

<p>PST-skilled Service Officers are not required to source additional written evidence to verify the professional advice given by a Services Australia social worker in relation to making a compliance decision. For example, when a PST-skilled social worker provides guidance about the impact of a mental health condition on the job seeker's capacity to comply, a PST-skilled Service Officer should not seek to source a medical certificate verifying the same information.</p>

<p>The Report Assessment Summary of certain ESAts incorporates a 'risk of non-compliance' rating and details of specific vulnerabilities the job seeker has or barriers that may affect their capacity to comply. This rating may be used to inform a compliance decision.</p>

<p>When investigating an unemployment failure, work refusal failure or Job Seeker Compliance Framework compliance action, an ESAt may be initiated if the Service Officer determines assessment of a possible medical condition would benefit the job seeker. This may include circumstances where the job seeker is not certain how their condition may impact their compliance more broadly, or when their responses to the Job Seeker Snapshot do not trigger an ESAt.</p>

<p>When a Participation Solutions Team (PST)-skilled Service Officer determines an ESAt is required and the ESAt is not triggered by the Job Seeker Snapshot (or a Job Seeker Snapshot cannot be run), a referral using the referral reason of Participation Failure Pending (PFP) should be made.

<p>Evidence is weighted, or considered, to form an opinion about the most likely version of events. </p>

<p>Information that cannot be substantiated with evidence should either be given lesser weight or may need to be disregarded to form a decision.</p>

<p>When a claim is made that may affect the outcome of an investigation, several lesser weighted pieces of evidence may together result in an assessment this was the more probable version of events.</p>

<p>Evidence about a job seeker's circumstances around the time of the non-compliance event where the job seeker's circumstances do not directly relate to the incident under investigation may help establish the context in which the non-compliance event occurred, however, would not have the same weight as evidence that specifically relates to the non-compliance event.</p>

<p>If conflicting evidence cannot be resolved, or there is insufficient evidence available, weighing the evidence can assist in reaching a decision based on the 'balance of probability', such as, what is more likely to have occurred.</p>
