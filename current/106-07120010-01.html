<p class="info-box warning">This is a Family and Domestic Violence Intervention Point. If the customer is with another person, on speakerphone, or already identified with family and domestic violence concerns, continue with the current business conversation. Otherwise, go to the <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-15000000-01.html">Family and domestic violence</a> procedure to conduct the risk identification and referral process.</p>

<p>This document outlines how to complete a MoC or SUOR assessment. This includes assessing a customer's living arrangements to decide if they are a member of a couple under the relevant law. This ensures they receive the correct payment type and rate.</p>

<p>Under associated law/policy, a person is a member of a couple if they are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
legally married</li>
		<li>
in a registered relationship</li>
		<li>
in a de facto relationship, and</li>
			<ul>			<li>
not in a prohibited relationship</li>
			<li>
both over the age of consent in the state or territory where they live</li>		</ul>
		<li>
not living separately and apart on a permanent or indefinite basis</li>
		</ul>
<p>Two people can still be members of a couple if they do not live at the same address, for example for work or economic reasons.</p>

<p>The associated law/policy outlines that 'a person is not considered to be in a member of a couple relationship if the person is living separately and apart from their partner on a permanent or indefinite basis'. Living separately and apart generally means both physical and emotional separation has occurred.</p>

<p>For example, living away solely for employment is not generally considered as ‘living separately and apart’.</p>

		<div class="block">
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L3GT_MoC_assessments"></a>
<h3>MoC assessments</h3>


<p>MoC assessments are done through the Relationship Details (SS284) form/s.</p>

<p>A MoC assessment can occur when a single customer advises they are sharing accommodation with another person and there is a risk they may be in an undisclosed member of a couple relationship.</p>
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L3GT_SUOR_assessment"></a>
<h3>SUOR assessments</h3>


<p>SUOR assessments are done through the Relationship details - Separated under one roof (SS293) form/s.</p>

<p>SUOR assessments can occur when a relationship has broken down and the parties are 'living separately and apart' on a permanent or indefinite basis, but remain residing under the same roof. Sharing may be temporary or permanent for a variety of reasons.</p>

<p>For SUOR assessments, each party will need to explain why they continue to share or resume living under the same roof. They must show how the relationship breakdown supports a conclusion that a genuine separation has occurred and there are no plans to resume the relationship.</p>
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L3GT_Boyfriends_gir"></a>
<h3>Boyfriends, girlfriends and non-binary relationships</h3>


<p>If a customer has a boyfriend, girlfriend or non-binary relationship, it does not immediately mean they are assessed as a MoC. They may be considered to be in a de facto relationship. It depends on the individual circumstances of each case. If a customer in this type of relationship does not believe they are partnered, where a MoC assessment is required, under the associated law/policy (see <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07120010-04.html">References</a>), regard must be given to all circumstances of the relationship against the 5 factors which must be assessed to decide if they are in a MoC relationship.</p>

<p>If a customer has stated they are single and a MoC assessment is triggered, the assessment must be conducted. They must not be assessed as a MoC simply because of their advice that they have a boyfriend/girlfriend/non-binary relationship.</p>
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L3GT_Information_for"></a>
<h3>Information for a MoC/SUOR assessment</h3>


<p>To decide whether the customer and other person are a member of a couple, use the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
for customers sharing with another person who is <strong>not their ex-partner</strong>, use the SS284 form/s. This form is required from both parties unless there is a risk of family and domestic violence. Forms must be issued (or stopped) via the <a target="_blank" href="../ongoing-contact/102-05030000-01.html">Living Arrangements question set</a></li>
		<li>
for customers sharing <strong>with their ex-partner</strong>, use the SS293 form/s. This form is required from both parties unless there is a risk of family and domestic violence. Forms must be issued (or stopped) via the <a target="_blank" href="../ongoing-contact/102-05030000-01.html">Living Arrangements question set</a></li>
		<li>
information already available on customer records</li>
		<li>
interviews with the customer, the other person/ex-partner and third parties if appropriate. Use discretion when deciding whether to interview the other person/ex-partner. Do <strong>not</strong> contact the other person/ex-partner if the customer has identified safety concerns against the person for whom the assessment is being conducted</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where safety concerns have been identified, see <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07120010-01.html#bp01_L2GT_Living_separate">Family and domestic violence section</a>.</p>

<p>Compliance interventions are conducted by phone if possible. Forms are not used.</p>
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L3GT_Requesting_info"></a>
<h3>Requesting information from a referee</h3>


<p>Contacting a referee should be the last resort in MoC decision-making process. It should only be necessary to contact a referee&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
after contact with the customer has been made, and</li>
		<li>
more verification is required.</li>
		</ul>
<p>Obtaining information from a referee must be made in writing using a Q270 Online Advice.</p>

<p>If the referee contacts in regard to a Q270 Online Advice, their response to the questions can be taken over the phone.</p>
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L3GT_Factors_to_cons"></a>
<h3>Factors to consider</h3>


<p>When forming an opinion about whether the customer is a MoC<strong> </strong>consider<strong> all</strong> of 5 factors&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
financial aspects of the relationship</li>
		<li>
nature of the household</li>
		<li>
social aspects of the relationship</li>
		<li>
any sexual relationship</li>
		<li>
nature of commitment</li>
		</ul>
<p>Also consider sensitivities around sexual orientation, cultural issues, ethnicity, religious beliefs and other vulnerable groups.</p>

<p>It is also important to consider if there is a presence of family and domestic violence within the relationship. <strong>The presence of family and domestic violence may indicate a person is not a member of a couple and this must be considered when making a decision about a customer’s relationship status.</strong></p>

<p>For both MoC and SUOR assessments, if one party lives alone in a self-contained dwelling on the same property as the other person/ex-partner, it is more likely they are living separately and apart and there is no need for an assessment. A self-contained area is a one that includes separate or private sleeping, cooking and bathroom facilities.</p>

<p>See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07120010-04.html#bp04_L2GT_Policy01">References</a> for links to the Social Security Guide for verifying membership of a couple and living separately and apart.</p>

<p>If a MoC/SUOR assessment is required, MoC processing staff use the risk-based MoC assessment exemption process when the customer and other person/ex-partner tell us they meet one of the following low risk categories&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they are partnered with each other within 13 weeks of initial MoC trigger</li>
		<li>
they are no longer residing together within 13 weeks of initial MoC trigger</li>

a referee has completed Section 2 of the Separation details (MOD S) form, confirming the customer has separated from their partner</li>
		<li>
they are separating for the first time but continue to live together as indicated by the triggering of the SS293 form through a new claim, change of circumstances, or via notification of separation through the <a target="_blank" href="../self-service/133-21012715-01.html">Update Relationship details online</a> service</li>

<p>If one of the low risk categories exists, the record <strong>must be</strong> checked for strong indications about a Member of a Couple relationship.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>There are procedures to follow for a customer who is affected by <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-15000000-01.html">family and domestic violence</a>. <strong>Never</strong> contact the other person. With customer consent, <a target="_blank" href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-07030010-01.html">refer the matter to a social worker</a>. They will assess the situation and offer support.</p>

<p><strong>The presence of family and domestic violence may indicate a person is not a member of a couple and this must be considered when making a decision about a customer’s relationship status.</strong></p>

<p>Family and domestic violence is not just the presence of violence in a relationship. It can be any conduct that is violent, threatening, coercive or controlling.</p>

<p>Evidence of family and domestic violence can be identified in a number of ways&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
A customer discloses family and domestic violence during contact</li>
		<li>
‘Family violence indicated’ messaging on the <strong>Customer Overview</strong> screen</li>
		<li>
The customer has identified safety concerns in the <a target="_blank" href="../ongoing-contact/102-05030000-01.html">Living Arrangements question set</a>, the MOD S or <a target="_blank" href="../self-service/133-21012715-01.html">Update Relationship details online</a> service (against the person for whom the assessment is being conducted)</li>
		<li>
<strong>DOCs</strong> on a customer’s record (including social worker <strong>DOC</strong>s)</li>
		<li>
Current or previous claims for <a target="_blank" href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-07030010-01.html">Crisis Payment extreme circumstances family and domestic violence</a> (EXV)</li>
		<li>
documents lodged by a customer (uploaded or scanned). For example, copy of a restraining order (for example, AVO, ADVO, DVO), legal documentation, relevant medical evidence</li>
		</ul>
<p>A customer on the single rate claiming Crisis Payment (CrP) due to family and domestic violence may advise they separated from the alleged perpetrator of family and domestic violence or person who experienced the violence. In these cases&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
After the CrP, conduct a MoC/SUOR assessment for the past period</li>
		<li>
Do <strong>not</strong> contact the alleged perpetrator of family and domestic violence. If that is the customer, do not contact the person who experienced the violence. Use other evidence to support the decision. For example, evidence from third parties. Consulting a social worker may also be appropriate. See <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-15000000-01.html">Family and domestic violence</a></li>
		<li>
If the customer was a member of a couple before separation, their past rate of income support payment will need reassessment, noting the presence of family and domestic violence may indicate the customer was not a MoC during the retrospective period. The retrospective assessment could lead to a debt if the customer is assessed as a MoC for that period.

	<div class="collapsible_container">

<p><strong>Undisclosed MoC relationships</strong></p>

<p>If there is evidence of a previously undisclosed MoC relationship that is recognised by either MoC processing staff or any another Service Officer. The assessment must be escalated using the <a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-09110000-01.html">Report Suspected Fraud and Corruption</a> system, MoC processing staff <strong>must not</strong> undertake the retrospective MoC assessment. An Intelligence Analysis Unit, will assess the customer’s past entitlement.</p>

<p><strong>Disclosed MoC relationships</strong></p>

<p>If there is a change in circumstances since the initial trigger of the MoC assessment (form issued), MoC processing staff must still undertake an assessment to decide if the customer was in a MoC relationship for a past period. This is to make sure the correct entitlement has been paid. For example, a customer self-declares they are now partnered to the person for whom the MoC assessment was triggered.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; if a customer self-declares they are in a relationship that started on a date in the past, there is no need to report suspected fraud or conduct a MoC assessment. Staff must issue a MOD P. See <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-05010000-01.html">Change in relationship status from single to partnered</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Disclosed relationships during Crisis Payment claims involving family and domestic violence (FDV)</strong></p>

<p>If a customer self-declares they are or were partnered during a claim for CrP, even though they are single on their record and are paid the single rate. CrP eligibility is not affected by relationship status, the claim for CrP can be assessed before a MoC/SUOR assessment.</p>

<p>Whether the CrP is granted, a MoC/SUOR assessment is needed for the past period if they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
are currently in a relationship not yet disclosed and recorded, or</li>
		<li>
were in an undisclosed relationship for more than 14 days before lodging the CrP claim</li>
