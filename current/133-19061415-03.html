This prevents tasks from showing on the homepage and instead provides a link to the My tasks page.

<p><strong>What are push notifications?</strong></p>

<p>Push notifications are short messages from a mobile app that tell a user there is something that needs to be done. These notifications&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
show on a mobile device's lock screen</li>
		<li>
can be turned off in the device settings if the customer does not want to get them</li>
		</ul>
<p>In Express Plus, push notifications tell customers about a task they need to complete.</p>

<p>If the customer selects the notification on their mobile device, it opens the app, asks them to sign in and then takes them straight to the task. This helps customers complete tasks quickly and efficiently.</p>

<p>A Service Officer can find out if a customer has been sent a push notification&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
In Customer First&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
select the 'Outbound correspondence' guided procedure</li>
			<li>
enter the customer's CRN in the recipient CRN field and select Search</li>
			<li>
the customer's correspondence shows</li>
			<li>
if the customer has been sent a <strong>push notification</strong> it shows under 'Distribution channel'</li>		</ul>
		<li>
In Process Direct&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
enter 'Corro' in the Super Key field</li>
			<li>
the Correspondence History screen shows</li>
			<li>
if the customer has been sent a <strong>Push Notification</strong>, it shows under 'Channel type'</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>Multiple entries for the same push notification may show in customer First and Process Direct. Each time a customer downloads the app, it creates an installation ID. Customers may install the app many times. For example if they use multiple devices or upgrade their phone.</p>

<p>A push notification is sent to any active installation ID. Customers do not get multiple notifications on the same device.</p>
