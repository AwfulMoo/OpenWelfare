<p>Determine the likely care period. A care period is generally the 12 month period starting from the <a href="../separated-parents/277-03060010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Gather_informat_Step03">date of event</a>.</p>

<p>In some circumstances, a shorter or longer care period may be appropriate. Assess each case on its own merits.</p>

<p><strong>Care periods longer than 12 months  </strong></p>

<p>A care period of more than 12 months may be appropriate where there is a care arrangement in place that follows a cycle over a period greater than 12 months, for example every 2 years. For more information see the <a href="../separated-parents/277-03060000-04.html">References</a> page in Integrated Care for a link to the Child Support Guide 2.2.1&#58; Basics of care and <a href="../separated-parents/277-03040010-05.html#bp05_L3TT_Care_period_12_">Example - Calculate care period 12 months and over</a> table in Notification of change in child support care (post 1 July 2010). </p>

<p>A care period of less than 12 months may be appropriate where&#58;</p>

the pattern of care will gradually change over definable periods in a specific and measurable way.

		<li>
a carer has unexpectedly gained 100% care of a child for a temporary period (generally 4 weeks minimum). The agency will determine the care over a short care period related to the unexpected circumstance and make a one-off block of 100% care determination. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-03040010-05.html#bp05_L3TT_Care_period_sho01">Example - Calculate care period shorter than 12 months - one-off block of 100% care</a> table in Notification of change in child support care (post 1 July 2010).

<p>Ask the customer for the pattern of care based on what they expect to occur during the care period. In most cases, the actual care each parent has determines the percentage of care. If satisfied a pattern established in the past will continue, use that pattern to determine care for the care period.</p>

<p>Questions that may assist in determining the likely percentage of care include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Have they and the other parent established a pattern of care for the child?</li>
		<li>
Is the other carer likely to agree that these are the new care arrangements?</li>
		<li>
How many nights do they and the other carer expect to care for their child during the care period?</li>
		<li>
How did they calculate the expected care?</li>
		<li>
Do they or the other carer provide care other than in nights? For example, are they a shift worker or do they provide extensive care during the day but little or no overnight care?

		<li>
What arrangement is the current care based on?</li>
		<li>
Is the care set out in a written care arrangement? For example court order, parenting plan or written agreements, which may be a co-signed FA012 form. If so, what is the commencement date of the written care arrangement?</li>
		<li>
Do they have a co-signed FA012 form? If so, and no details/discrepancies need clarification and the signatures can be verified accept the form without any pre-decision contact as care is considered to be agreed. </li>
		<li>
If care is not occurring in accordance with a written care arrangement, are either they or the other parent trying to enforce the care set out in the care arrangement?  </li>

If so, what actions have been taken to enforce this to date?</li>		</ul>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; if a Centrelink or mutual customer reports a reduced level of care for themselves action immediately in Customer First. Create a ‘preliminary care’ record to prevent the customer from accumulating an overpayment, See <a href="../families/007-02040020-01.html">Notification and Assessment of shared care arrangements for Family Tax Benefit (FTB)</a>. The change of care can only be finalised in Cuba once the change in care determination process is finalised and processed in Customer First.</p>

<p><strong>Special rounding rules </strong></p>

<p>Special rounding rules apply to the calculation of care percentages. To manually calculate the percentage of care divide the number of nights the parent has care of the child in the care period by the total number of nights in the care period and multiply by 100. For example, if the care period is 12 months, divide the number of nights of care by 365 and multiply by 100. To ensure the total care percentage equals 100%, if the final percentage of care figure is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
below 50%, round the number down to the next whole percentage</li>
		<li>
50% or more, round the number up to the next whole percentage</li>

<p>To apply the special rounding rules&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
in Cuba, enter the number of nights into the Care window to automatically calculate the percentage of care used in the assessment. For customers with a care percentage of 50% each, record the payee as having 50% care, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-30010060-01.html">Care Cuba Process Help</a>. Do not record as a number of nights. Where care is entered as 50% to the payee, Cuba will automatically change payee to 51% care and the other party to 49% care. The 'Care Reported as 50%' checkbox will be automatically ticked and a care percentage of 50% will be transferred to mutual customer family assistance assessments</li>

for Customer First, see <a href="../families/007-02040020-01.html">Notification and assessment of shared care arrangements for Family Tax Benefit (FTB)</a> to code the care change</li>

for principal carer assessment purposes only percentages between 45.1 and 45.9 should all be rounded up to 46%. See <a href="../families/007-02050000-01.html">Shared care for social security payments</a></li>
