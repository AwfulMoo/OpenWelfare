<p>This document explains details about when a ParentsNext participant may be exited or exempted from the ParentsNext program. Eligibility for ParentsNext is automatically determined by the system.

<p>Once a customer has been selected for ParentsNext, a change of circumstances may result in them being automatically exited from the program. This is because they no longer meet the eligibility criteria.</p>

<p>ParentsNext participants will be automatically exited from the program by the system when one of the following occurs&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
their youngest Parenting Payment (PP) child turns 6 years of age</li>
		<li>
their PP cancels for any reason, including cancelling for failing to report (FRP)</li>
		<li>
a Service Officer records one of the following on the customer's record&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
current study</li>
			<li>
maternity/paternity leave</li>
			<li>
leave with a job to return to</li>		</ul>
		<li>
the customer turns 55 years of age</li>
		<li>
the customer passes away</li>
		<li>
a provider exits a ParentsNext participant due to stabilised earnings</li>
		<li>
the customer relocates to a Community Development Program (CDP) area or Norfolk Island</li>
		<li>
they start (have been recorded as attending an appointment) in Disability Employment Services (DES) after being selected for ParentsNext</li>
		<li>
retrospective updates are made to the customer's record, which determine the customer is no longer eligible for ParentsNext. That is, updating information for circumstances which were present from a date before their selection into ParentsNext</li>

<p>ParentsNext eligibility is determined using information on the customer's record at the time of the eligibility assessment. For example, the age of the youngest PP child, or whether the customer has completed Year 12 or an equivalent qualification or higher. Incorrect or out of date information may affect this assessment. The customer may be selected as eligible, when they otherwise would not be.</p>

<p>In these cases, the customer's record must be updated with the correct information. The date of event must be before the date of selection for ParentsNext to invoke a reassessment of eligibility.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Retrospective child</strong> - The customer had a PP child younger than 9 months of age in their care before their selection date however, it was either not recorded, or was not correctly coded on the customer's record. Once the child's details are updated (with a date of event before the customer's selection date in ParentsNext), the system will automatically reassesses eligibility and exit the customer</li>
		<li>
<strong>Retrospective Year 12 or equivalent qualification</strong> - The customer was selected for the reason of Early School Leaver or 2 Years or more on Income Support but they provide evidence of achieving Year 12 or an equivalent qualification before their ParentsNext selection date. Once the education details are recorded as verified, with a date of event before the selection date, the customer will be automatically exited</li>
		<li>
<strong>Retrospective study</strong> - The customer started studying before selection for ParentsNext but they are not receiving Pensioner Education Supplement (PES). Once the customer provides evidence of meeting the minimum ParentsNext study requirements, and the ParentsNext Study Guided Procedure is completed with a study start date before the ParentsNext selection date, the customer will be automatically exited</li>
		<li>
<strong>Retrospective PES</strong> - The customer lodged a claim for PES, which is granted with a start date before the ParentsNext selection date. Once the claim is granted the customer will be automatically exited</li>

<p>Customers who are studying (full or part time) and are receiving PES will not be selected for ParentsNext if their record is up to date and reflects their current study.</p>

<p>Customers not receiving PES who started study before selection into ParentsNext but do not yet have the current study recorded on their Centrelink record for ParentsNext purposes will be selected for ParentsNext in the first instance. If the customer provides evidence of undertaking a course that started before their ParentsNext selection date and meets the minimum ParentsNext study requirements, they will be exited for the duration of the course once the study is recorded.</p>

<p>Customers who start studying after they have been selected for ParentsNext will continue to remain eligible for ParentsNext and cannot be exited for retrospective study.</p>

<p><strong>Evidence of current study</strong></p>

<p>Proof of Enrolment documents verifying the study is for at least 4 hours per week for a duration of at least six weeks must be provided and may include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the institution's enrolment advice to the student</li>
		<li>
an enrolment fee receipt</li>
		<li>
Mainstream Enrolments Via the Internet (MEVI) receipts - (for TAFE courses only, and can only be accepted if the nominal course hours are on the receipt)</li>

a Commonwealth Assistance Notice (this document shows enrolment in subjects at census date, subjects may have different census dates and customers will receive a separate Commonwealth Assistance Notice for each census date)</li>

a student identification card (where period of enrolment is specified on the card)</li>

a statement from the institution advising acceptance into the course</li>

Productivity Places Programme letter of notification</li>
		<li>
electronic confirmation of a placement in Skills for Education and Employment (SEE)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Review of study</strong></p>

<p>If the duration of the study is more than 12 months, service officers will be required to create a <a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-06090030-01.html">manual review</a> to reassess at the 12 month point that the customer is still currently studying and meeting the minimum requirements.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_MaternityPater">Maternity/Paternity leave and leave with a job to return to</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>There is generally no requirement to record maternity/paternity leave or leave with a job to return to for a PP customer. Therefore, customers are unlikely to have these details recorded on their Centrelink record before selection for ParentsNext.</p>

<p>There is no minimum duration of leave for it to be coded on the customer's record providing they are returning to work at the end of the leave period.</p>

<p><strong>Evidence of leave</strong></p>

<p>Customers who have been selected for ParentsNext who are on maternity/paternity leave or leave with a job to return to must provide evidence from their employer.</p>

<p>This evidence must include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
customer's name</li>
		<li>
employer name and phone number</li>
		<li>
employer's Australian Business Number (ABN)</li>
		<li>
start and end date of leave</li>
		<li>
confirmation there is a job to return to when the leave ends</li>
		</ul>
<p>Once verified, and the relevant guided procedure has been completed, the customer will be automatically exited from ParentsNext. The customer's eligibility will be automatically reassessed 4 weeks after the end date of the leave, (if they are still receiving Parenting Payment). This 4 week period allows the customer time to record income if they have returned to their employment.</p>

<p><strong>Review of leave</strong></p>

<p>If the duration of the leave is more than 12 months, service officers will be required to create a <a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-06090030-01.html">manual review</a> to reassess at the 12 month point that the customer is still currently on leave and still has a job to return to.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Only ParentsNext providers have the delegation to exit a ParentsNext participant where they are satisfied their employment is 'stabilised'. Stabilised earnings are defined as an average of at least 15 hours of paid employment per week that is expected to be ongoing. This can include self-employment.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when a provider records an exit due to stabilised earnings, a review is automatically created on the customer's record within the Services Australia system. This review will mature 14 days after the exit and will determine whether the customer is declaring income. If no income has been declared to the agency within 14 days of the exit, the customer will be automatically re-selected as a compulsory ParentsNext participant. In this scenario, an alert notification is sent to their provider to re-engage with the customer, as they are not declaring income.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>The exit reason 'No Longer Eligible' was a 'one off' exit reason which identifies those customers who were compulsory ParentsNext participants in the previous model of ParentsNext as at 30 June 2021 however, they did not meet the new eligibility criteria on 1 July 2021.</p>

<p>Once a customer has been selected for ParentsNext, a new child entering care does not impact on eligibility and they will remain as a compulsory ParentsNext participant.

<p>All eligibility for ParentsNext is automatically assessed by the system. When a customer no longer meets the eligibility criteria, the system will automatically exit them from the program.</p>

<p>If a Service Officer believes that a customer no longer meets the eligibility criteria for ParentsNext but they have not been automatically exited, they must lodge an incident via <a href="https&#58;//mysupport.csda.gov.au/saw/ess?AUTH=SAML&amp;TENANTID=678820121">mySupport</a>.</p>

<p>Service Officers <strong>do not have the discretion or delegation</strong> to apply a manual exit, and <strong>do not</strong> have the required access to do so.</p>

<p>If a customer is experiencing ongoing personal issues that are impacting on their ability to participate, they can discuss their eligibility for an exemption with their ParentsNext provider or the agency. In the case of future study or employment, the provider will determine if this should be included as an activity within their participation plan. For employment, the customer's <strong>ParentsNext provider</strong> can also determine if they may be exited due to stabilised earnings.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_ParentsNext_exe">Exemptions</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The majority of <a href="../job-seekers/001-09120000-01.html">mutual obligation requirements exemptions</a> are also applicable for ParentsNext participants however, there are some circumstances where the exemption type and coding differ for ParentsNext participants.</p>

<p>There are two ParentsNext specific exemptions&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Temporary Period of Confinement exemption</li>
		<li>
Bereavement exemption</li>
		</ul>
<p>ParentsNext exemptions can be recorded by either the agency or the ParentsNext provider. This will exempt the customer from the requirement to participate in ParentsNext (for the duration of the exemption). The customer is not subject to the Targeted Compliance Framework during the exemption period. The exemption also results in the suspension of provider servicing.</p>

<p>The granting of an exemption does not change a ParentsNext participant's eligibility status or their reason for selection. Exemptions applied by the agency or a ParentsNext provider, will display on the <strong>ParentsNext Summary page</strong>, under the heading of Current Exemptions and on the Activities and Exemption (<strong>AEX</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>See the <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-18041800-05.html">Resources</a> page for a list of all the available exemptions that can be applied to ParentsNext participants by the agency and by ParentsNext providers including the duration of each exemption type.</p>

<p><strong>Family and domestic violence</strong></p>

<p>This is a Family and Domestic Violence Interaction Point. If the customer is with another person, on speaker phone or has already identified family and domestic violence concerns, continue with the current business conversation. Otherwise, go to the <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-15000000-01.html">Family and domestic violence procedure</a> to conduct the risk identification and referral process.</p>

<p>In cases of family and domestic violence, the customer should be referred to a Services Australia social worker. Consideration should be given to the assessment made by the social worker as to whether an exemption should apply and the appropriate length of the exemption. The initial exemption must be for the maximum 16 week period. This may be extended for one or more further periods of up to 16 weeks if appropriate. The duration of the further periods of exemption will again be determined by the social worker's assessment, as part of their review of the customer's circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>Action at the end of an exemption</strong></p>

<p>If a customer was not yet referred to a ParentsNext provider at the time the exemption was recorded by the agency, the system will automatically book an appointment with the agency for a time after the exemption has ended. Exemptions recorded by the agency will be automatically end dated if a customer exits the program.</p>

<p>If an exemption is applied after the customer has already been referred to a ParentsNext provider, it will be the responsibility of the ParentsNext provider to re-engage with the customer at the end of the exemption. The agency does not need to undertake any follow up at the end of the exemption period in this instance.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> some exemptions may need social work intervention and recommendation (for example, in the situation where a customer is experiencing extreme stress, or homelessness because of a relationship breakdown). The social worker may make an assessment and provide a recommendation about whether an exemption should be granted. Any Service Officer (APS 3 and above) can assess and grant Service Australia exemptions available for ParentsNext participants. Service Officers <strong>must not</strong> send a referral to the social work team to code a ParentsNext exemption.</p>

<p><strong>ParentsNext Temporary Period of Confinement exemption</strong></p>

<p>The Temporary Period of Confinement (PTC) exemption is specific to the ParentsNext program and applies where&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer is pregnant and within 6 weeks of their expected date of confinement, or</li>
		<li>
a new child under the age of 9 months enters the customer's care</li>
		</ul>
<p>Customers are required to provide evidence of the expected date of birth/child entered care. Evidence of the expected date of delivery can include a letter from a doctor or registered midwife. It does not need to be a Services Australia medical certificate.</p>

<p><strong>ParentsNext Bereavement exemption</strong></p>

<p>The bereavement exemption may be granted for ParentsNext participants for a maximum period of 16 weeks and is specific to ParentsNext. It is relevant to the following circumstances&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Death of a partner</li>
			<ul>			<li>
When a ParentsNext participant's partner passes away, they may be considered for a Bereavement exemption (different to the Bereavement Mutual Obligation exemption) of up to 16 weeks</li>
			<li>
If the Miscellaneous Update Details (<strong>NMIS</strong>) screen is coded in relation to the partner's death a Mutual Obligation Bereavement Period - Partner exemption will be automatically granted for a maximum of 14 weeks</li>
			<li>
The manual Bereavement exemption should still be coded to make sure the customer is granted the maximum period of 16 weeks allowable for PP customers</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Death of an immediate family member - When a ParentsNext participant has an immediate family member pass away, a Bereavement exemption (different to the Bereavement Mutual Obligation exemption) should be coded</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Customer is pregnant when partner passes away</strong></p>

<p>If the customer is pregnant at the time their partner passes away, they will be exempt for a period of 16 weeks from the date of death or to the end of the pregnancy, whichever is longer. The <a href="../job-seekers/001-09120030-01.html">Bereavement Period - Pregnant Partner</a> exemption is automatically coded based on coding of the partner's death on the Miscellaneous Update Details (<strong>NMIS</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>If the customer is still a compulsory ParentsNext participant when the expected date of confinement is reached the system will automatically apply a ParentsNext temporary period of confinement exemption.</p>

<p><strong>Caring Responsibilities</strong></p>

<p>If a ParentsNext participant has caring responsibilities, the Special Family Circumstances exemption can be applied for up to 16 weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the specific caring exemption is not available for ParentsNext participants as the maximum duration is limited to 14 weeks (applicable to job seekers).</p>

<p>If the customer has long term caring responsibilities (foster carer, non-parent carer, home schooling), see <a href="../job-seekers/001-09120030-01.html">Exempting a job seeker from mutual obligation requirements due to special circumstances</a>.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>In the majority of cases, customers will still be required to report fortnightly during an exemption period. They may need to declare income and confirm the circumstances remain current and therefore that they are still eligible for the exemption.</p>

<p>If a ParentsNext participant is granted a 'long term' exemption, they will be automatically assessed for eligibility for variable 12 weekly reporting. If the customer or their partner (where partnered) are declaring income when the long term exemption is granted or start declaring income during the exemption period or have a current debt they will either remain on or be reverted to 2 weekly (fortnightly) reporting.</p>

<p>Exemptions that are considered long term for ParentsNext variable reporting purposes are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Caring for a child not eligible for CP</li>
		<li>
Carer Non-Parent State/Terr Care Plan</li>
		<li>
Carer Non-Parent Fam Law Court</li>
		<li>
Distance Education Child</li>
		<li>
Home Schooling</li>
		<li>
Foster Carer</li>
		<li>
Large Family</li>
		<li>
Temp Incap - Serious Illness</li>
		</ul>
<p>If a customer on a long term exemption stops to declare income for a period of 12 weeks, they will be reassessed for eligibility for variable, 12 weekly reporting.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> all reporting requirements for ParentsNext are automatically determined by the system. Service Officers do not have the ability to manually update reporting requirements for ParentsNext participants.</p>
