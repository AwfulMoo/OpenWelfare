<p>A Capability Assessment is triggered by the Department of Education, Skills and Employment (DESE) Employment Services System (ESSweb).</p>

<p>Employment Services Providers and ParentsNext Providers are responsible for notifying job seekers when they are required to contact Services Australia to complete a Capability Assessment. They are also required to advise the job seeker that the assessment takes approximately 30 minutes.</p>

<p>The date the provider has this conversation with the job seeker becomes the deemed date of notification.</p>

<p>Providers issue this notification verbally, job seekers do not receive an SMS or other outbound contact from Services Australia to prompt contact for the Capability Assessment.</p>

<p>The job seeker's payment remains suspended (SUS/TCF - did not meet provider requirement) until they contact Services Australia and complete the Capability Assessment.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> once the Capability Assessment is complete, the other <a href="../job-seekers/001-18030205-01.html">reconnection requirements for mutual obligation failures</a> committed while the Capability Assessment was pending may impact when payment can restart.</p>

<p>Participation payments are automatically cancelled for reason failure to re-engage (CAN/CDR) if a job seeker does not arrange a Capability Assessment within 4 weeks of the deemed date of notification. Job seeker payments cannot be restored following cancellation, but the job seeker may reclaim payment. If the job seeker returns to payment within 6 months, a Capability Assessment will be retriggered and must be completed before the job seeker can start reporting.</p>

<p>Most Capability Assessments will be completed the day the job seeker contacts Services Australia using evidence available on the record.</p>

<p>If the job seeker advises there are circumstances impacting their ability to meet the compulsory requirements in their Job Plan, PST-skilled Service Officers should first check the record for any evidence that can be used to substantiate their claims.</p>

<p>If evidence does not exist, PST-skilled Service Officers can request suitable evidence from the job seeker to support their circumstances.</p>

<p>If evidence (such as medical evidence that has been lodged in the last two years) already exists on the record, and supports the job seeker's disclosed circumstances impacting compliance, this should be used. The Capability Assessment outcome should not be delayed by seeking further evidence unnecessarily. If evidence is requested from the job seeker, the Capability Assessment should be held for no more than 2 days (this can be longer if required and should be assessed on a case by case basis).</p>

<p>Where the job seeker contacts to provide the evidence Services Australia has requested&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
check the Participation Compliance summary to confirm if a Capability Assessment is pending</li>
		<li>
advise the job seeker to <a href="../self-service/133-04060000-01.html">upload evidence</a> or <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-10010030-01.html">scan documents</a> as appropriate</li>

		<ul>		<li>
check the Participation Compliance summary to confirm if a Capability Assessment is pending</li>
		<li>
refer the job seeker to the Participation Solutions Team (PST)</li>

<p>This will generally mean that unsubstantiated circumstances cannot be taken into account. This will likely result in an outcome of <strong>capable,</strong> meaning the job seeker is capable to meet the compulsory requirements in their current Job Plan and will move to the financial penalty zone.</p>

<p>If the job seeker provides evidence after the Capability Assessment is completed, Services Australia cannot reassess the Capability Assessment.</p>

<p>The job seeker will need to be referred back to their provider to discuss the circumstances that have been impacting their compliance and the evidence they are now able to supply.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Services Australia staff are still required to take all appropriate action for the evidence that has been supplied – i.e. coding a medical certificate, updating the Job Seeker Classification Instrument (JSCI) and/or referring a job seeker for an Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) as needed.</p>

<p>Assessing and identifying the impact of job seeker circumstances is a key part of the Capability Assessment.</p>

<p>If a job seeker presents with family and domestic violence, or have a Family relationships/Domestic violence circumstance (FDV), the Service Officer <strong>must</strong> consult with a PST-skilled social worker during the Capability Assessment. See, <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-12080010-03.html">Accessing a PST-skilled social worker</a>.</p>

<p>If the job seeker discloses a circumstance (not FDV), and help is needed to assess the impact of that circumstance upon their ability to comply with their current compulsory requirements, PST-skilled Service Officers should consult with a PST-skilled SO5, social worker or other specialists. These consults can also be used as evidence to support the addition or validation of most circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58; only circumstances with a minimum level of evidence can be used to determine a job seekers capability during the assessment.</strong> Circumstances that do not meet the minimum level of evidence should result in either the job seeker being given an opportunity to supply evidence to support the circumstance, or the circumstance is ended as evidence does not exist to support the impacts.</p>

<p>Contact with the job seeker's provider or other third parties may also be required. Any contact with a specialist provider, or third party should be used as evidence and must be recorded on the <strong>Circumstances Impacting Compliance</strong> page.</p>

<p>For more information see the Resources page of <a href="../job-seekers/001-10050000-05.html">Circumstances impacting capacity to comply with compulsory requirement</a>.</p>
