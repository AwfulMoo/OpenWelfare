<p>An online claim will expire after 13 weeks if it has not been submitted. The customer must then submit a new claim. In some cases the claim can be assessed from the original start date, see <a target="_blank" href="../self-service/133-02160000-01.html">Circumstance Change Monitor</a>. If further assistance is required, for example, there has been a system error, refer to the Retirements Helpdesk.</p>

<p>Check the customer or nominee is registered with an <a target="_blank" href="../self-service/133-19061400-03.html">active Centrelink online account</a>. Organisation nominees must be registered for <a target="_blank" href="../self-service/133-08010000-01.html">nominee organisation online services</a>.</p>

<p>If they do not have an active account they must confirm their identity at their local service centre to register for a Centrelink online account.</p>

<p>Advise the customer how they can <a target="_blank" href="../self-service/133-02010020-03.html">create a myGov account and link it to Centrelink</a>. This will also enable them to receive Centrelink mail online through the myGov Inbox.</p>

<p>If the customer is partnered, consider whether their partner may also be eligible for Age Pension or another service offer. If the customer has permission to enquire on their partner’s behalf or their partner is present, discuss whether they would also like to lodge a claim.</p>

<p>Service centre staff can help customers with their online claim through self service terminals. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> service centre staff must remind customers to submit their claim once all required tasks are completed. Alternatively, if the customer is unable to access their online account, the Service Officer can scan and upload the documents for them.</p>

<p>Customers can access the <strong>Payment and Service Finder</strong> on the website to check if Age Pension is an appropriate payment for them, and to start their claim.</p>

<p>Record the claim contact in a <strong>DOC</strong> and advise the customer to start and submit a claim as soon as possible to be paid from the earliest possible date. Advise the customer if they are having difficulty submitting the claim to contact Services Australia for assistance.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> different processes apply for customers in vulnerable circumstances, see <a target="_blank" href="../initial-contact-general/106-18032700-01.html">Intent to claim and vulnerable customers</a>.</p>

<p>A claim started using ACC will expire after 13 weeks if not submitted. The customer must then start a new claim. In some cases the claim can be assessed from the original start date, see <a target="_blank" href="../self-service/133-02160000-01.html">Circumstance Change Monitor</a>. If further assistance is required, for example, there has been a system error, refer to the Retirements Helpdesk.</p>

<p>Check the Document List (<strong>DL</strong>) screen for any <strong>DOC</strong>s relevant to a claim for Age Pension.</p>

<p>Customers will not be able to submit their claim until all required tasks are completed, unless an exemption applies. Tell the customer that for claims commenced online or via ACC, required tasks to submit or additional tasks to complete the claim, will be presented in the online claim. Remind them to submit their claim to be paid as soon as possible. Alternatively, if the customer is unable to access their online account, the Service Officer can scan and upload the documents for them.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when a customer has provided all required documentation, submit the claim on their behalf to prevent the claim staying in draft mode and auto expiring.</p>

<p><strong>Electronic messaging</strong></p>

<p>Customers who provide a mobile phone number or email address should be advised that they will automatically be subscribed to Electronic Messaging (EM) services unless they have previously declined EM. They will be asked to nominate a preferred contact method (SMS or email) for electronic messages. They will receive messages via their preferred contact method to complete all Required tasks, see <a target="_blank" href="../self-service/133-02160000-03.html">Electronic Messaging (EM) - Targeted notifications</a>.</p>

<p>Update the customer's personal details via <strong>Customer Summary</strong>, using the <strong>Task Selector</strong> in Process Direct, the <strong>Change in Contact Details</strong> workflow and, if required, update their contact and interpreter details via the Other Contact Details (<strong>OCD</strong>) screen in Customer First, as these questions are no longer asked in ACC.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> establish whether the customer has a partner. If partner is eligible, clarify the partner’s intent, see <a href="../older-australians/065-03010000-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Lodgement_of_cl">Table 4</a>. If all requirements are met, an <a target="_blank" href="../older-australians/065-19012550-01.html">Age Pension combined partner online claim</a> can be completed. Alternatively, and if partner is</p>
		<ul>		<li>
available, a separate ACC can be started with the partner</li>
		<li>
unavailable, use the FCCCS workflow to issue the appropriate claim for Age Pension form to the partner</li>

<p>If <strong>ACC</strong> was started before the updates were made, the claim can be exited and the updates made outside the claim before submitting it. The updates will appear on the <strong>Review </strong>page in ACC.</p>

<p>A Claim for Age Pension and Pension Bonus (SA002) or the pre-populated Claim for Age Pension (SA412) has been lodged.</p>

<p>Most current income support payment recipients can be transferred to Age Pension when they reach Age Pension age. This includes where a customer's income support payment was cancelled on the date they turned Age Pension age and they lodge a paper claim within 13 weeks of turning Age Pension age. See <a target="_blank" href="../older-australians/065-03010020-03.html">Transfers to Age Pension</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Partnered customers</strong></p>

<p>If an SA002 or SA412 has been lodged with the details for the customer and their partner (who is also Age Pension age within the <a target="_blank" href="../initial-contact-general/106-03040020-01.html">early claim period</a>), check the following details.</p>

<p><strong>In the SA002&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Question 1 - Do you have a partner</li>
		<li>
Question 2 - Is your partner also claiming Age Pension?</li>
		<li>
Question 3 - Indicate if your partner is using this form or a separate form for a claim or to provide their details</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>In the SA412&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Questions 2 and 3 from the SA002 will appear in the first section of the SA412 if the partner is within 13 weeks or over Age Pension age and not paid an income support payment, or if a new partner has been advised via FCCCS</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer answered <strong>Yes</strong> to questions 1 and 2 on the SA002 (question 2 on SA412), or if both have lodged separate claims, see <a href="../older-australians/065-03010000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Lodgement_of_cl_5">Item 5</a>.</p>

If the SA002 or SA412 has been lodged for both customer and partner and both wish to claim Age Pension, record a <strong>DOC</strong> on the partner's record.<br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> for customers in vulnerable circumstances, see <a target="_blank" href="../initial-contact-general/106-18032700-01.html">Intent to claim and vulnerable customers</a></li>
		<li>
If the partner wishes to claim but has not signed the form, follow the process as outlined in <a target="_blank" href="../initial-contact-general/106-03020060-01.html">Claims received that are incomplete or incorrect</a></li>
		<li>
If claim is lodged either online or via paper by one member of the couple and</li>
			<ul>			<li>
it is obvious that their partner would also be eligible, or</li>
			<li>
their partner is also claiming Age Pension, but they wish to provide their details separately, attempt to contact the partner by phone and ask them to complete an online claim or ACC. If the partner is unavailable issue a Q164 and <strong>DOC</strong> their record that if they contact, they should be invited to complete an online claim or have ACC run with them</li>		</ul>
		<li>
If only the customer is claiming, record this information on their record in a closed <strong>DOC</strong></li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> it is also acceptable to ask the Person Permitted to Enquire (PPE) question when talking to the partner and to record their response on the Marital Status (<strong>MS</strong>) screen (if linked), or send an Authorising a person or organisation to enquire or act on your behalf (SS313) form for them to complete and return.</p>

<a target="_blank" href="../initial-contact-general/106-09010000-01.html">Confirmation of identity</a> is required for Age Pension.

Proof of age</li>

		</ul>
<p>Ensure Identity and proof of age is also provided for the partner if they are claiming Age Pension on the same claim form.</p>

<p>If required, code the customer's and partner's identity details using the <strong>Identity Confirmation Dashboard</strong> in Process Direct. For more information, see <a target="_blank" href="../initial-contact-general/106-09010010-01.html">Coding identity documents</a>.</p>

<p>Check that all forms issued via FCCCS and relevant supporting documents have been lodged. A letter is sent with the forms advising the customer of documents required to support their claim.</p>

<p>If there are discrepancies between the documentation supplied and the record, these must be addressed, resolved and documented prior to coding.</p>

<p>If the proof of age document cannot be coded (for example, due to system limitations), or the customer advises they are unable to provide one, include all necessary details on the <strong>DOC</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Scanning</strong></p>

<p>Identity documents should only be scanned if they are required for <a target="_blank" href="../initial-contact-general/106-07060010-01.html">verification purposes other than identity assurance</a>.</p>

Upon receipt of an Age Pension paper claim, scan the paper claim together with any supporting documents to the customer’s record</li>
		<li>
If documentation is provided separately, for example, after an online claim has been submitted&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Run the <strong>Request and Manage Customer Task</strong> guided procedure in Customer First. For an online claim or ACC, the <strong>Summary</strong> page will display Tasks (documents) requested at <strong>Next steps</strong>. Mark the corresponding Task as '<strong>Provided'</strong></li>
