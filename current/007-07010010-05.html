<p><strong>Overseas surrogacy arrangement</strong></p>

<p><strong>Claim for Family Tax Benefit (FTB) and Parental Leave Pay (PPL)</strong></p>

<p>Joanne and Phil are claiming FTB and PPL for a surrogate child. On 20 December, Joanne lodges a claim for FTB and PPL for child Liam.</p>

<p>Liam was born 12 November to an overseas surrogate birth mother. Joanne and partner Phil are to become Liam's legal parents, with Phil being the biological parent. On 10 November both Joanne and Phil travelled overseas, to have Liam entrusted into their care immediately after birth. Joanne, Phil and Liam returned to Australia on 15 December once Liam's passport was complete.</p>

<p>Liam was born overseas to a non-Australian resident, entrusted to Joanne's care from birth so Joanne is eligible to FTB from this date. As the claim for PPL was lodged more than 28 days after Liam's birth, the PPL period commenced from the date of claim, 20 December.</p>

<p>If Joanne is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
not eligible for PPL and</li>
		<li>
found eligible for FTB Part A for Liam, Joanne is assessed under the entrustment to care criteria to determine eligibility to receive NBS/NBU</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Joanne will need to provide the full surrogacy agreement to verify the legal arrangement/care.</p>

<p><strong>Couple claiming PPL for separate surrogate children</strong></p>

<p>On 20 September, Graeme and Lindsay each lodge claims for PPL for their respective children under the surrogacy rules.</p>

<p>Graeme and Lindsay, a couple, both contracted overseas surrogates to carry their children.</p>

<p>Graeme contracted Preah and Lindsay contracted Sanjam as surrogates to carry their respective biological child. Each party completed a surrogacy agreement confirming Graeme and Lindsay are to be the legal parents of the children immediately after the births.</p>

<p>On 15 July both babies are born and Graeme and Lindsay take on primary care as outlined in the surrogacy agreements. On 29 August, once the children's passports were finalised the family return to Australia.</p>

<p>In this situation, each member of the couple may be eligible for PPL, providing they meet all other eligibility criteria. This is because both Graeme and Lindsay are the commissioning parents of their respective children, and the children are not part of a multiple birth.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Graeme and Lindsay will each need to provide the surrogacy agreements to verify&#58;</p>

<p>On 18 July, Paul lodges a claim for PPL for a child coming into care as a part of an overseas surrogacy agreement.</p>

<p>Jack, the biological father of the child is in a relationship with Paul.</p>

<p>Jack entered into a surrogacy agreement with birth mother Hansa. Jack will be the biological and legal parent of the child immediately following the birth.</p>

<p>On 25 August, Hansa delivered the baby. Hansa relinquishes care of the baby to Jack and Paul immediately. On 29 September Jack, Paul and baby, named Olivia, returned to Australia once Olivia's passport was finalised.</p>

<p>Although Paul is a commissioning parent in the surrogacy agreement, it does not mean Paul cannot claim PPL as a primary claimant. If Paul is Olivia's initial primary carer and meets all eligibility criteria, PPL may be payable if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Paul is expecting to have care of Olivia for at least 26 weeks, and</li>
		<li>
it is in the interest of the child for Paul to provide care</li>

<p><strong>Local (in Australia) surrogacy arrangement</strong></p>

<p><strong>Claiming PPL and Dad and Partner Pay (DAP) for surrogate child</strong></p>

<p>Sarah and Mike have a surrogacy agreement with Sarah's sibling, Anna, to be a surrogate mother for them. Both Sarah and Mike are the biological parents of the child. Anna is the birth mother on the birth certificate and Mike the father.</p>

<p>As part of the surrogacy agreement Anna will have care of the child for one month after the birth. This is for breast-feeding before being permanently entrusted to the care of Sarah and Mike.</p>

<p>On 10 May, Anna gives birth to baby Jane.</p>

<p>On 15 May&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
Sarah submits an online claim for PPL, and </li>
		<li>
Mike submits a claim for DAP</li>
		</ul>
<p>As outlined in the surrogacy agreement, on 10 June Anna relinquished care of Jane to Sarah and Mike.</p>

<p>In this situation, Sarah could receive PPL and Mike could receive DAP if all other eligibility requirements are met.</p>

<p>To receive PPL from the date Jane was entrusted to Sarah's care (10 June), an effective claim must be lodged within 28 days.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Sarah or Mike need to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
provide the surrogacy arrangement to verify details, and </li>
		<li>
confirm Anna has relinquished care of Jane</li>
		</ul>
<p>Anna (the surrogate mother) may also be eligible for PPL. See <a href="../families/007-02010010-01.html">Claiming payments for children leaving care as part of the process of adoption or a surrogacy arrangement</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Couple claiming PPL and DAP for surrogate child</strong></p>

<p>On 22 October, Steven submits an online claim for PPL. Matthew submits a claim for DAP the same day.</p>

<p>Steven and Matthew had a surrogacy agreement with their friend Jenny to carry a child for them. Steven is a biological parent of the child and will be listed as the child's father on the Australian birth certificate.</p>

<p>The surrogacy agreement confirms that Steven and Matthew will have legal care and responsibility immediately after the birth.</p>

<p>On 16 September, Jenny gives birth and the child is immediately entrusted to Steven and Matthew's care.</p>

<p><strong>Overseas adoptions</strong></p>

<p><strong>Grandchildren adopted from overseas</strong></p>

<p>Elena legally adopted Elena's two grandchildren that were living in Samoa. The adoption process was finalised in 2014. Elena's grandchildren remain in Samoa with their biological parents until their Australian passports are finalised and air flights could be paid.</p>

<p>On 20 February 2016, Elena travelled to Samoa to have the children entrusted into care as part of the process of adoption.</p>

<p>On 15 March 2016, Elena lodges a claim for PPL and FTB.</p>

<p>Although finalised in 2014, February 2016 is when the children were entrusted to Elena's care for the purpose of adoption. Elena may be eligible for FTB from 20 February 2016 and PPL all other eligibility requirements are met.</p>

<p><strong>Timing of payments for a child adopted from overseas</strong></p>

<p>On 15 July, Liz and Oscar travel to Kenya to start the adoption process for Pili. Pili is a 5 year old orphaned child. While the process is being finalised Liz and Oscar returned to Australia.</p>

<p>On 28 February, the adoption process for Pili is complete.</p>

<p>Liz and Oscar return to Kenya to have Pili entrusted to their care as part of the process of adoption.</p>

<p>On 3 March, Pili is entrusted by the authorised adoption agency into Liz and Oscar's care.</p>

<p>On 2 April, Liz, Oscar and Pili return to Australia.</p>

<p>On 1 June, Liz lodges a claim for PPL and FTB. Oscar lodges a claim for DAP on the same day.</p>

<p>The PPL period could start&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
as early as 1 June, the date the claim and all of the required documentation was lodged, or</li>
		<li>
from a nominated PPL period start date in the future</li>
		</ul>
<p>If Liz meets eligibility requirements for FTB, it would be payable from 3 March. This is when Pili was entrusted as part of the process of adoption. Although Pili had not entered Australia, eligibility for FTB can commence because Pili was entrusted to the care of permanent Australian residents Liz and Oscar who were only temporarily out of Australia.</p>

<p>If Liz was not eligible for PPL, NBS and NBU would be automatically assessed with the eligibility for FTB Part A. If Liz becomes eligible or elects to change to PPL, any NBS and NBU paid will be a recoverable debt.</p>

<p>Oscar's DAP would also be payable from 3 March or a start date Oscar has nominated in the claim.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> to ensure the maximum PPL and DAP entitlements can be made&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the claim must be made, and </li>
		<li>
the PPL period start date must be within&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the time limits for claiming the maximum PPL period</li>
			<li>
50 weeks of entry into care for DAP</li>			</ul>			</ul>

<p>On 28 May, Vikki lodges a claim for FTB for Vikki's sibling's baby, Camira, who is one week old.</p>

<p>Camira entered Vikki and Russell's care permanently on 27 May.</p>

<p>Camira's parent is caring for five other children. There is an agreement that Camira would live permanently with relatives, Vikki and Russell.</p>

<p>The elders of their community accept this decision.</p>

<p>Based on Indigenous culture, Vikki and Russell are the primary carer of Camira under kinship care.</p>

<p>Provided they meet all other eligibility requirements for FTB, Vikki is eligible for payment for Camira from 27 May. Vikki may also be eligible for NBS/NBU with the FTB Part A for Camira.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> had Vikki claimed PPL, Vikki would not have been eligible because of the kinship care arrangement for Camira.</p>

<p>To be eligible for PPL under the adoption rules, Camira must have been placed in Vikki's care by an authorised party for the purpose of adoption.</p>

<p>Joy and Darel decide they wish to adopt their Joy's sibling's child Cobar using an adoption agency.</p>

<p>On 24 February, 3 year old Cobar entrusted into Joy and Darel's care by an adoption agency. Cobar is placed in care as part of the process of adoption.</p>

Joy would be eligible to receive FTB (including NBS/NBU) for this child and Darel eligible for DAP, provided all other eligibility requirements are met.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> had Joy lodged a claim for PPL, and met eligibility requirements, Joy may have been eligible for PPL rather than NBS/NBU.</p>

<p><strong>Claiming PPL and DAP for long term foster care child being adopted</strong></p>

<p>On 10 February Tracey submits a claim for PPL and Dennis a claim for DAP for Sam. Sam is a foster care child they are now adopting.</p>

<p>Sam is 12 years old and was entrusted to Tracey and Dennis' care as a long term foster care child seven years ago. During this time, Sam has been solely in their care. Tracey and Dennis decided to adopt Sam legally and commenced the process of adoption.</p>

<p>Sam was already entrusted to Tracey and Dennis' care under a foster care arrangement. This means that Sam was not placed by an authorised party as part of the process of adoption. As such, neither Tracey nor Dennis are eligible to receive PPL or DAP for Sam.</p>

<p><strong>Permanent carer - not eligible for PPL</strong></p>

<p>On 6 April, Alison gave birth to Ebony. The following day Alison's parent Peta contacted child protection due to concerns regarding Alison's ability to care for Ebony. On 10 April, child protection completed an investigation and assessment regarding the care concerns for Ebony. The result of this investigation found Ebony's parents were unable to provide an appropriate level of care. Child protection applied for and obtained an interim care order from the court. The court then entrusts Ebony to the child protection agency's care temporarily. This is pending the outcome of an application for a 'permanent care' order. Child protection then placed Ebony in the care of Ebony's grandparent Peta.</p>

<p>On 5 August, the court entrusted Ebony to Peta's care under a permanent care order.</p>

<p>Although a court has entrusted Ebony under a 'permanent care' order Peta is not eligible for PPL. This is because Ebony was initially to Peta's care due to a decision made by the child protection agency.</p>

<p>On 12 November Louise and Samuel, who both have severe physical disabilities welcomed their third child Jett. Louise's parent Jill has care of the couple's older two children and expects to take primary care of Jett.</p>

<p>On 15 November Louise and Samuel voluntarily place Jett in Jill's care. The following day Louise's case worker comes to the hospital to discuss the care arrangements of Jett. They decide that Jett will Stay with Jill 'permanently'.</p>

<p>Jill commences an application to the court to have Jett remain in Jill's care under a 'permanent care' order.</p>

<p>On 10 February the court grants 'permanent care' of Jett to Jill's care.</p>

<p>If Jill meets all PPL eligibility, including the PPL work test, Jill would be eligible for PPL for Jett. This is because&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Jett's birth mother (Louise) and partner (Samuel) are incapable of caring for Jett</li>
		<li>
a court has made a permanent care order saying the child is in Jill's care, and</li>

Jett was not placed in Jill's care as part of a decision by a state/territory child protection agency</li>		</ul>
