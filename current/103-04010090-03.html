<p>A student may wish to discontinue RCO over a vacation period in which they temporarily leave the residential college, and continue with RCO upon recommencing at the college in the following semester. The student must be asked whether they plan to return to the residential accommodation.</p>

<p>For the periods the student temporarily returns home during their scheduled vacation period, the <strong>AC</strong> screen must be updated so the student's normal rate for ABSTUDY Living Allowance at the away from home rate or independent rate, or the normal rate of ABSTUDY PES, is payable for the periods during which residential fees are not being charged.</p>

<p>The dates of these periods can be provided by the student, or alternatively can be provided by the college or hostel in respect to each term/semester. If exact dates are unavailable, use the formal semester commencement/end dates for the courses at the student's education provider.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a student opts to remain in their residential college or in a hostel during semester breaks, RCO can continue to be paid. Living Allowance and ABSTUDY PES will continue to be payable at the appropriate reduced or nil rate, and a <strong>DOC</strong> with relevant details must be placed on the student record.</p>

<p>The <strong>AC</strong> screen must be updated to reflect each of these periods, and there may be several through the period of study, as&#58;</p>

<p>As the student has ceased the RCO prior to the end of studies for the current year, there may be excess Residential Costs Payments which must be recovered from the accommodation provider.</p>

<p>The accommodation provider can retain any payments which have been charged for the accommodation. This includes any period after the student ceases to qualify for RCO. Some examples of ceasing to qualify for RCO include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
ceasing study</li>
		<li>
changing from full-time to part-time</li>
		<li>
no longer boarding with the accommodation provider</li>
		</ul>
<p>The accommodation provider may have a refund policy for when a student leaves early. Refunds must be recovered.</p>

<p>To determine the coding required, check the <strong>EPSP</strong> screen, contact the accommodation provider and confirm the payments are correct, taking into account any refund. This includes charges for a period after they ceased to qualify for RCO.</p>

<p>Adjust the <strong>Amount paid&#58;</strong> field on each screen to reflect updated charges/refunds. Any periods not already coded may require an additional <strong>EPSP</strong> screen to be coded.</p>

<p>If a new <strong>EPSP</strong> screen must be coded, see <a href="../payment-delivery/103-04010090-03.html#bp03_tbl_System_coding_f01_Step01">Step 1 in Table 3.</a></p>

<p>The student may apply for RCO. While this option will be financially advantageous to many students, it will not be a benefit to all, particularly those on the maximum rate. The following must be considered&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Where eligible Living Allowance recipients take up the RCO, they will receive the lesser of&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
$41.60 per fortnight, <strong>or</strong></li>
			<li>
The student's normal fortnightly Living Allowance entitlement, including any amounts of Rent Assistance, Pharmaceutical Allowance or Energy Supplement (that is, the amount they would receive after the application of the personal, partner and parental income tests). A student receiving ABSTUDY PES will forfeit their ABSTUDY PES payments entirely for the period when their residential costs are being met by ABSTUDY. Their pension payment is not affected by this arrangement</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the residential fees component of the RCO is not subject to a means test.</p>

<p><strong>Non-refundable deposits</strong></p>

<p>To secure accommodation some Residential Colleges or Hostels will require a student to pay a deposit in advance. These are deemed as non-refundable deposits. They can be paid prior to the RCO payments commencing. Students must be advised if they do not take up accommodation with the college or hostel, an overpayment would be raised that the student would have to pay back. See <a href="../debts/107-02020040-01.html">Create a new debt record manually on the Debt Management and Information System (DMIS)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>A student whose residential costs are higher than their loss of entitlement would benefit financially if they take RCO.</strong></p>

<p>The amount a student may receive for a <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-07030010-01.html">Relocation Scholarship</a>, ISSP for relocation and/or accommodation costs or an Indigenous CAS must also be considered when looking at the total payable to the student.</p>
