<P>CDP providers are responsible for managing mutual obligation requirements for <STRONG>provider managed</STRONG> participants in remote servicing regions.</P>
<P>From 12 May 2021, CDP activities which were previously compulsory requirements are now voluntary. This includes:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Work for the Dole</LI>
<LI>training</LI>
<LI>work experience</LI></UL>
<P>CDP participants are not penalised if they fail to attend these activities. If they cease Work for the Dole, and the CDP provider notifies Services Australia that the participant has exited the activity, their Approved Program of Work Supplement (APWS) of $20.80 per fortnight will stop.</P>
<P>CDP participants still need to meet other compulsory mutual obligation requirements such as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>agreeing to a Job Plan</LI>
<LI>attending provider and third party appointments when notified</LI>
<LI>attending job interviews</LI>

<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Participants who are provider managed will have a Job Plan negotiated with their CDP provider.</P>
<P>In negotiating Job Plans with CDP participants, providers consider each participant's assessed capacity and individual circumstances.</P>
<P>For 'assessed capacity', see <A href="../job-seekers/001-09070180-01.html">Job seekers with a partial capacity to work or a temporary reduced work capacity</A>.</P>
<P>There are no specific requirements for CDP participants according to their age group or participant category, e.g. for principal carer parents or participants aged over 55.</P>
<P>Minimum hourly requirements do not apply for CDP participants. If a CDP participant elects to participate in an activity such as Work for the Dole, the provider records in the Job Plan the number of hours the participant has volunteered to undertake. If the participant does not participate in the activity for the elected number of hours, penalties will not apply, as their participation is voluntary.</P>
<P>If a participant does not elect to participate in an activity, the hourly requirements in their Job Plan are zero.</P>
<P>CDP participants who are Centrelink managed will have a Job Plan negotiated by Services Australia. The type of plan to be negotiated will be determined automatically by the system, based on information sent by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations IT system, and will depend on whether a CDP provider referral is in place or not.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<P>CDP participants who approach Services Australia about a breakdown in their relationship with their CDP provider organisation should be advised to discuss their situation with their provider in the first instance.
