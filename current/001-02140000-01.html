	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Job seekers who are provider managed will have a Job Plan negotiated with their CDP provider.</p>

<p>In negotiating Job Plans with CDP job seekers, providers consider each job seeker’s assessed capacity and individual circumstances.</p>

<p>For 'assessed capacity' see <a href="../job-seekers/001-09070180-01.html">Job seekers with a partial capacity to work or a temporary reduced work capacity</a>.</p>

<p>There are no specific requirements for CDP job seekers according to their age group or job seeker category, e.g. for principal carer parents or job seekers aged over 55.</p>

<p>Minimum hourly requirements do not apply for CDP job seekers. If a CDP job seeker elects to participate in an activity such as Work for the Dole, the provider records in the Job Plan the number of hours the job seeker has volunteered to undertake. If the job seeker does not participate in the activity for the elected number of hours, penalties will not apply, as their participation is voluntary.</p>

<p>If a job seeker does not elect to participate in an activity, the hourly requirements in their Job Plan are zero.</p>

<p>Job seekers who are Centrelink managed will have a Job Plan negotiated by Services Australia. The type of plan to be negotiated will be determined automatically by the system, based on information sent by the Department of Education, Skills and Employment IT system, and will depend on whether a CDP provider referral is in place or not.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Transition_to_t">Transition to the Remote Engagement Program</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A new Remote Engagement Program will replace the CDP in 2024. The new program aims to improve employment pathways and economic opportunities for people in remote communities.</p>

<p>From 2022, trials are commencing in 5 remote regions to co-design and test elements of the new Remote Engagement Program. The 5 trial regions are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Mid West/West region in Western Australia (CDP Region 5)</li>
		<li>
Ngaanyatjarra Lands in Western Australia (CDP Region 3)</li>
		<li>
Eyre in South Australia (CDP Region 17)</li>
		<li>
Barkly (incorporating South East Barkly and North Barkly) in the Northern Territory; (CDP Regions 26 &amp; 28) and</li>
		<li>
Palm Island in Queensland (CDP Region 50)</li>
		</ul>
<p>To inform the development of the new program, the trial regions will trial different approaches to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
engaging job seekers</li>
		<li>
mutual obligation requirements</li>
		<li>
job seeker compliance</li>
		<li>
training and skill development,</li>
		<li>
non-vocational support </li>
		</ul>
<p>Lessons learned from the trials will inform the design of the new Remote Engagement Program.</p>

<p><strong>Trial phases&#58; co-design, transition and implementation</strong></p>

<p>The trials will be implemented in three phases&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
A&#58; Co-design</li>
		<li>
B&#58; Transition</li>
		<li>
C&#58; Implementation</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>A&#58; Co-design</strong></p>

<p>The National Indigenous Australians Agency (NIAA) will work with stakeholders, including community representatives, to co-design the Remote Engagement Program. This phase will involve a series of workshops and activities in each of the five trial regions. These will design the specific details for the REP trial in their region.</p>

<p><strong>B&#58; Transition</strong></p>

<p>Following the co-design phase, a short transition phase will involve&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
communicating about the trial to stakeholders, including job seekers</li>
		<li>
updating CDP provider contracts to deliver the REP trial </li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>C&#58; Implementation</strong></p>

<p>All job seekers living in a trial region will participate in the trial. They will remain linked with and serviced by the REP trial provider, which was previously their CDP provider.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Remote_Engageme">Remote Engagement Placements</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The REP trials will include voluntary opportunities for up to 150 eligible job seekers to participate in Remote Engagement Placements that are like having a job.</p>

<p>Eligible job seekers will voluntarily participate in a placement for between 15 and 18 hours per week with a host organisation. Job seekers will build skills and experience in roles that deliver goods or services to benefit local communities. These placements will provide a pathway to employment.</p>

<p>Job seekers are eligible to participate in a Remote Engagement Placement if they are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
living in a trial region</li>
		<li>
registered with the CDP or REP provider in the region</li>
		<li>
currently on a qualifying income support payment of&#58; </li>
			<ul>			<li>
JobSeeker Payment (JSP) </li>
			<li>
Youth Allowance (jobseeker) (YA(o))</li>
			<li>
Parenting Payment Single (PPS) with mutual obligation requirements </li>
			<li>
Disability Support Pension (DSP) with participation requirements</li>		</ul>
		<li>
not undertaking full-time study</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; for the purposes of REP, currently means any of the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
current (CUR)</li>
		<li>
cancelled next pay (CNP)</li>
		<li>
current zero rate (CZR)</li>
		<li>
suspended (SUS)</li>
		</ul>
<p>During the placement, participants will receive the new Remote Engagement Program (REP) Payment of between $100 and $190 per fortnight,  as well as their usual income support payments and supplementary benefits.</p>

<p>The amount of the REP Payment is determined by each trial region through the co-design process. Each job seeker in an individual trial region will receive the same REP Payment amount.</p>

<p>Remote Engagement Placements may start at any time from 26 &#160;March &#160;2022. However, a system implementation for the payment will not be released until 3 &#160;September 2022.  Until 3 September 2022, the REP Payment will be delivered manually and is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
taxable</li>
		<li>
recoverable</li>
		<li>
available for other debt raising and recovery action</li>
		</ul>
<p>It is <strong>not</strong>&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
included in any job seeker compliance penalty calculations</li>
		<li>
reportable income for income tests (personal, partner or parental)</li>
		<li>
affected by compensation </li>
		<li>
included in Income Management </li>
		<li>
available for Centrepay </li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Manual payments</strong></p>

<p>The National Indigenous Australians Agency (NIAA) will provide the participant’s details to the Participation Programmes Team. The Participation Programmes team will quality-check the data and pass the cleared file to Service Operations.</p>

<p>Service Operations will allocate this work to Service Officers who have <a href="../payment-delivery/103-04040080-01.html">access to the Payment Adjustment (PYAJ) screen</a> for manual coding.</p>

<p>Service Officers making REP Payments via PYAJ do not have to assess a customer's participation in a Remote Engagement Placement. However, if they note a change to eligibility, or have a payment query, they must email &#160;PROGRAMME.MUTUAL.OBLIGATION with the details.</p>

<p><strong>Automatic payments</strong></p>

<p>After the system release on 3 &#160;September 2022, the REP Payment is paid automatically and will be&#58;</p>
