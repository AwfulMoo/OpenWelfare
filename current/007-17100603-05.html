<p>Undertake further investigations and record the appropriate PPL income verification outcome for the customer.</p>

<p>Determine whether the customer has provided the verification documents and whether these are acceptable to meet their PPL income eligibility requirements.</p>

<p>Certain <strong>income test determinations</strong> cannot be changed on review. Once a person has provided their adjusted taxable income (ATI) and it is decided PPL is payable, this decision should not be overturned if later the person's ATI exceeds the income limit.</p>

<p>Changes to PPL income details must only be processed to rectify incorrect coding by customers and staff</p>

<p>Check if the new income estimate is reasonable and within relevant tolerances for eligibility and income limit. Contact the customer if any further details (for example, evidence) are required for the correct income estimate</p>

<p>As a consequence, a <strong>debt</strong> would generally not be raised following updates to the PPL income details. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> an exception would be if the income determination resulted from the person knowingly making false or misleading representations or providing false or misleading information or documents, the person is taken not to have satisfied the income test. Such debts are recoverable and will be investigated.</p>

<p>Reconciliation or re-reconciliation of FTB Part A for the 2012-13, 2013-14, 2014-15 or 2015-16 financial years may result in a Schoolkids Bonus arrears payment or overpayment.</p>

<p>The gross FTB Part A rate shown is after any income and maintenance income reductions have been applied, but before any withholdings.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> an issue (PR18793) has been identified when a child/case end for a 'Child Support Collect' customer is processed by Child Support. The FTB assessment may incorrectly read the case as being a 'Private Collect' case for periods prior to the date the case was ended. The resultant outcome is an FTB A rate reassessment (to a lower rate in most cases) on the basis of an incorrect Entitlement Method calculation. All identified cases are to be referred to the Level 2 Policy Helpdesk</p>

<p><strong>FTB Part B Explanation (REXFTBB)</strong></p>

		<li>
The maximum Part B rate (and Energy Supplement Part B rate) is based on the age of the youngest child. A higher rate is paid if the youngest child is aged under 5 years. Shared care may also affect the maximum rate payable</li>
		<li>
The gross FTB Part B rate shown is after any income reductions have been applied, but before any withholdings</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>FTB Notional Explanation (REXFTBC)</strong></p>

<p><strong>FTB claim for newborn child</strong></p>

<p>Peter and partner lodge an FTB new claim for their newborn child Sarah. This is the first time Peter has claimed FTB so Sarah is added to the system. As Sarah is in the care of parents only, the FTB Shared Care (<strong>FSC</strong>) screen must be coded to reflect 100% care.</p>

<p>The intent of this requirement is to have a percentage of care for the child coded at all times.

<p>For the purpose of this instruction it is not a requirement to review and code retrospective information for children who are already on the system. It is to ensure the quality of ongoing data is correct in order to limit the use of incorrect care dates which causes information to ripple across to Child Support creating reassessments.</p>
