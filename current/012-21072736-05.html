<p>Answer&#58; No, but the following criteria apply&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the assessment services must be billed at the same practice</li>
		<li>
the GPs must be registered on the PIP profile with a start date before the date of the first service</li>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Will the practice get a payment if they are approved for the PIP after the first-dose assessment service is billed?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; My practice did not get a payment for some of the second dose assessment items provided this quarter. Can you check if the service/s was processed by the point-in-time date?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; In accordance with Services Australia’s privacy policy, we cannot investigate services provided to individuals to determine the eligibility or timing of payments. Where all the requirements for payment have been met, payments will be made with the next PIP quarterly payment after successful processing of the second-dose assessment service.</p>

<p>8</p></td>
<td>

<p><strong>Question&#58; My practice billed both MBS items correctly. Why have I not received a payment for some patients?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Payments may be impacted by a patient’s decision to visit more than one general practice for vaccination services. In accordance with Services Australia’s privacy policy, we are unable to provide advice on the payment recipient of individual payments, or on how services provided to the patient by other practices may have impacted a practice meeting the requirements to receive the $10 payment for that patient. Where all the requirements for payment have been met, payments will be made with the next PIP quarterly payment after successful processing of the second-dose assessment service.</p>
