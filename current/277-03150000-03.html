outstanding incomes will continue to update and reconcile the past periods, despite the current status of the case. This may result in retrospective variations to past assessments. Both parties will be notified of the variations in writing</li>

retrospective variations to past assessments during periods of Child Support collect may change what the account balance was when the assessment was ended, and </li>

arrears could accrue for the payer or a liability reduction could cause a payee overpayment. Child Support may contact the parties to discuss the collection of the retrospective variations</li>

check if the part month’s liability has been applied to the account.  Discuss with the customer the amount of liability that has not yet been raised on the ended case.

Discuss the amount of liability for May that will become due in June (for the period the case was still active in May) </li>

discuss the option to manually calculate the remaining liability and do a partial refund (leaving enough to cover the liability when it does raise) or offer to process the refund after the liability raises which would not require manual calculation</li>

<p>If the customer requests a full refund, Services Australia cannot keep the funds. Explain to the payer there will be 1 more payment due and payable the following month.

<p>Where there are family and domestic violence concerns and the payee requests that <a href="../separated-parents/277-04090000-01.html">arrears be discharged</a>, it is <strong>critical</strong> that the UQ13.00 payee pre-discharge cooling off letter <strong>is only sent to the payee</strong>. <strong>Under no circumstances is the payer to be contacted about the potential discharge</strong>. An immediate discharge can be processed if the payee&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
has a Centrelink exemption/already spoken to Centrelink about how the discharge will affect their benefits, or</li>
		<li>
insists the discharge is actioned immediately due to family and domestic violence concerns and confirms they understand the decision cannot be reversed and it may impact their Centrelink benefits/cause an FTB overpayment, or</li>
		<li>
is not a mutual customer and has FDV concerns (they are not a Centrelink customer and do not receive any FTB or benefit payments)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where the discharge request is part of an election to end, do not delay processing the end because of the cooling off period. Process the end and discharge separately.</p>

<p>Process discharge&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
discharge arrears by amount in the Discharge arrears window</li>
		<li>
select the reason for discharge as <strong>END - PYE ELECT</strong></li>
		<li>
check the Eligibility window and only save the decision if satisfied the results are accurate</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; do <strong>not</strong> apply the 'opt out' date from a date in the past. Retrospectively changing the collection method to private collect means the full Child Support assessment will be deemed as received for FTB purposes and this will generate FTB debts.</p>

<p>Post-discharge notification and action&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>do not</strong> issue any system-generated letters to notify parties of the discharge. Issue the following letters to notify each party of the outcome&#58; </li>
		<li>
UQ13.01 (Post discharge arrears – Payee), and </li>
		<li>
UQ13.02 (Post discharge of arrears – Payer)</li>
		<li>
check if post-decision action is required. For instance, if payment of arrears was via <a href="../separated-parents/277-04140010-01.html">Employer Withholding Arrears (EWA)</a>, consider if the payer needs to be delinked</li>		</ul>

<p>If the payee has indicated that generating letters may cause difficulties, discuss strategies for managing this with an SSO, such as issuing a manual unique letter rather than the following system generated letters. </p>

<p>Otherwise, once the application to end the assessment is accepted and processed in Cuba, the following letters are automatically created&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
MEA1-2 - Advise payee accepted application to end assessment</li>
		<li>
MEA1-3 - Advise payer accepted application to end assessment</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the election to end the assessment has been <strong>rejected</strong> as it was made by the payer and an agreement suspension period for an initiating agreement is not applicable, tell the payer of the decision verbally. No letter will be issued.</p>

<p>If a child support agreement initiated the child support case and there is an <a href="../separated-parents/277-18061455-01.html">agreement suspension</a> period in effect, the payer may elect to end the assessment. Where these circumstances apply, transfer the customer to the <a target="_blank" href="../utils/CustomerReferralGuidelines/Customer-Referral-Guidelines.html?agreement-court-order-received-or-variation.html">Agreements and Court Order team</a> to process and discuss the impact of making the election. Manual letters will also be issued to the customers when an election is accepted.</p>
