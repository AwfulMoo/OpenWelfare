Q40 defines the tax year and the income terms used in this form</li>
		<li>
At Q41, the care receiver (and their partner if they have one) must provide details of their taxable income for the base tax year using the details from the tax Notice of Assessment (NOA). A copy of the NOA is also required<br>If a person has accessed superannuation under the First Home Super Saver (FHSS) Scheme these withdrawals will contain some portion that the ATO will determine as taxable and this will be reflected on an individual’s NOA. However, for Services Australia purposes, FHSS Scheme withdrawals are not counted towards taxable income. If referring to a person’s NOA who has accessed superannuation under this scheme, any taxable income must be excluded that is attributed to the FHSS Scheme. Advice from the individual on the value to be excluded should be obtained as this detail will not be included on the NOA but is expected to be information the individual has access to from their FHSS Scheme submission and approval paperwork.</li>
		<li>
If the care receiver is unable to provide details from the NOA, an estimate can be provided of the base year taxable income by completing Question 42</li>
		<li>
Q43 asks for an estimate of taxable income for the current financial year. If the base tax year income is over the income threshold but the current financial year income is below the threshold, then the current tax year income can be used</li>
		</ul>
<p>The current year estimate can also be used when the care receiver’s assets are in the medium or high range and an asset exemption needs to be assessed, see <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-03020040-01.html">Assets test exemptions for the non-customer Care Receiver Income and Assets (CRIA) test</a>.</p>

<p>This section requires the personal details of the parent or legal guardian and their partner, and personal and income details of their Family Tax Benefit (FTB) children.</p>

<p>The <strong>parent or legal guardian of the child being cared for</strong> must supply details in this section, such as&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
their personal details and their partner's personal details (if applicable)</li>
		<li>
whether the partner (where applicable) has permission to enquire</li>
		<li>
contact (address and phone number) details</li>
		<li>
names of FTB children/students - details should only be given if the children are FTB children and should <strong>exclude</strong> the child or children for whom the parent is claiming/receiving Carer Payment (CP). For a definition of 'FTB child' see <a href="../families/007-07040050-01.html">Family Tax Benefit (FTB) child of a person</a></li>
		<li>
details of any income received by the children and/or students, including Government assistance because receipt of a disqualifying payment would mean they are not an FTB child</li>
		<li>
if the children/students are full time students - a full time student up to the age of 24 may be an FTB child</li>
		<li>
the number of FTB children advised on the Carer Payment Income and Assets details - child or children being cared for - under 16 years (SA304(C)) form is only required if the family assets are Medium or High</li>
		<li>
information about the child care receiver must be completed at Part B. If there is more than one child care receiver, Part B should be photocopied or an additional SA304(C) issued</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> there is space for the details of 2 FTB children only. If any of the children lodge a tax return their Notice of Assessment must be provided (if available) for the base tax year, in order to apply the care receiver income test.</p>

<p>To pass the income test, the combined taxable income of the care receiver and all assessable persons for either the base tax year or current tax year must be under the income limit. See <a target="_blank" href="../utils/RatesChart/rateschart.html">Rates and thresholds</a> &gt; Pensions &gt; Other Pension related rates &gt; Table 5&#58; Carer Payment - Care Receiver Income and Asset Limits.</p>

<p>If the assets are in the Medium range the care receiver may be exempted from the assets test. If the assets are High the care receiver must pass the liquid asset test and the special income test for the current tax year estimate. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-03020040-01.html">Assets test exemptions for the non-customer Care Receiver Income and Assets (CRIA) test</a> </p>

<p>Question 39 defines the tax year and explains the income terms used in this form.</p>

<p>To meet the income test, the combined taxable income of the care receiver and all assessable persons for either the base tax year or current tax year must be under the income limit. See <a target="_blank" href="../utils/RatesChart/rateschart.html">Rates and thresholds</a> &gt; Pensions &gt; Other Pension related rates &gt; Table 5&#58; Carer Payment - Care Receiver Income and Asset Limits.</p>

<p>If the assets are in the Medium range, the care receiver may be exempted from the assets test. If the assets are High, the care receiver must meet the liquid asset test and the special income test for the current tax year estimate.</p>

<p>So that the care receiver income test can be applied&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the parent or legal guardian of the child being cared for (and their partner) needs to provide details of their own taxable income for the base tax year</li>
		<li>
to assess whether this income is below the allowable limit, Q40 in this section must be completed by using the details from the tax Notice of Assessment (NOA) or a tax return. A copy of the NOA or tax return is also required <br>If a person has accessed superannuation under the First Home Super Saver (FHSS) Scheme these withdrawals will contain some portion that the ATO will determine as taxable and this will be reflected on an individual’s NOA. However, for Services Australia purposes, FHSS Scheme withdrawals are not counted towards taxable income. If referring to a person’s NOA who has accessed superannuation under this scheme, exclude any taxable income attributed to the FHSS Scheme. Advice from the individual on the value to be excluded should be obtained as this detail will not be included on the NOA but is expected to be information the individual has access to from their FHSS Scheme submission and approval paperwork</li>
		<li>
if the parent or legal guardian is unable to provide details from the NOA or tax return, they can provide an estimate of their income for the base tax year by completing Q41</li>
		<li>
Q42 asks for an estimate of taxable income for the current financial year. If the base tax year income is over the income threshold but the current financial year income is below the threshold, then the current tax year income can be used</li>
		<li>
the current year estimate can also be used when the care receiver's assets are in the medium or high range and an asset exemption needs to be assessed</li>
		</ul>

<p>This part must be completed in relation to the child being cared for. If there is more than one child care receiver, an additional Part B should be completed for each care receiver.</p>

<p>Part B asks for information about the care receiver's income and assets, similar to Part A.</p>

<p>To pass the income test, the combined taxable income of the care receiver and all assessable persons for either the base tax year or current tax year must be under the income limit. See <a target="_blank" href="../utils/RatesChart/rateschart.html">Rates and thresholds</a> &gt; Pensions &gt; Other Pension related rates &gt; Table 5&#58; Carer Payment - Care Receiver Income and Asset Limits.</p>

<p>If the assets are in the Medium range then the care receiver may be exempted from the assets test. If the assets are High the care receiver must pass the liquid asset test and the special income test for the current tax year estimate.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Q43 prompts for the person handling the financial affairs of the care receiver to complete Parts B and C</li>
		<li>
Q44 asks for the care receiver's name, date of birth, gender, their relationship with the person completing this part of the form, whether the care receiver lives with them, and whether the care receiver has any income from government sources or is a full time student</li>
		<li>
So that the care receiver income test can be applied, Q45 asks for the care receiver’s taxable income for the base tax year, using the details from the tax Notice of Assessment (NOA) or a tax return. A copy of the NOA or tax return is also required <br>If a person has accessed superannuation under the First Home Super Saver (FHSS) Scheme these withdrawals will contain some portion that the ATO will determine as taxable and this will be reflected on an individual’s NOA.

		<li>
If taxable income for the base tax year cannot be provided from an NOA or tax return, Q46 requests an estimate of the care receiver’s income for the base tax year</li>
		<li>
Q47 asks for an estimate of the care receiver’s taxable income for the current financial year. If the base tax year income is over the income threshold but the current financial year income is below the threshold, then the current tax year income can be used</li>
		<li>
The current year estimate can also be used when the care receiver's assets are in the medium or high range and an asset exemption needs to be assessed</li>
		<li>
Q48 asks for details of the net market value of the care receiver’s assets and should not include&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the home of the care receiver</li>
			<li>
assets obtained to specifically assist the care receiver in respect of their disability</li>
			<li>
funds received from the NDIA that are deposited into an account used to manage the care receiver's NDIS plan</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Q49 asks about the care receiver’s Liquid Assets. Disregard funds in an account used to manage the care receiver's NDIS plan. The value of liquid assets will need to be coded if assessable assets are in the Medium or High Range</li>
		<li>
Q50 relates to deprivation of assets</li>
		<li>
Q51 asks if the care receiver has any beneficiary interest in any trust, deceased estate or any other funds. This question is intended to capture if there are other funds not declared elsewhere on this form. If the answer is 'Yes', it may be appropriate to issue a Module PT - Private Trust (Mod PT)</li>		</ul>
