<p>When a person contacts to advise of the death of a customer, staff must offer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the services of a <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-12010000-01.html">social worker</a> in the first instance or at any time the notifier becomes or show signs of distress during the contact</li>
		<li>
to issue the pamphlet <a href="../bereavement/099-02020050-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Publications">Needing help after someone has died? (HD001)</a> and if accepted, issue to the person if at a service centre, otherwise refer them to ‘Death of a loved one’ content on the Services Australia website</li>
		</ul>
<p>The following cultural issues need to be respected and considered by Service Officers when being advised of the death of an <strong>Indigenous</strong> customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>the name of the deceased person cannot be mentioned</strong> by immediate family members. This means immediate family members may have to ask other relatives/friends to call on their behalf or attend the interview with the notifier, because they cannot say the name of the deceased</li>
		<li>
in this situation, it may also be offensive to the person for the Service Officer to say the name of the deceased person. Service Officers should sensitively ask the person if it is all right for them to use the deceased customer's name. If the person is not comfortable with this, avoid using the deceased customer's name wherever possible. See <a href="../bereavement/099-01040000-01.html">Cultural considerations when someone dies</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>Is the surviving partner receiving Parenting Payment Partnered (PPP) or Partner Allowance?</p>

<strong>Yes</strong>, see&#58;</li>

<p>Run the <strong>Notification of death</strong> guided procedure in the deceased customer's record to determine if death can be confirmed.</p>

<p>Confirmation of death can be accepted where the customer's full name is provided together with at least <strong>2</strong> of the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
deceased customer's last address in full</li>
		<li>
date of birth</li>
		<li>
Customer Reference Number (CRN)</li>
		<li>
partner's name</li>
		</ul>
<p>Confirmation of death also needs the following details about the <strong>informant</strong>&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
name</li>
		<li>
address</li>
		<li>
phone number</li>
		</ul>
<p>See <a href="../bereavement/099-02010000-01.html">Confirmation of the death of an adult or child</a>.</p>

<p>Confirm if the person notifying of the death is the executor of the estate. If the informant is not the executor, but knows the executor details, obtain&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the name and address of the executor, and</li>
		<li>
the name of the funeral director or hospital</li>
		</ul>
<p>Nominee arrangements and Power of Attorney (POA) stop at the time of death. Any correspondence, including the payment summary and possible debt recovery action from a deceased estate, will be sent to the&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
executor, or</li>
		<li>
administrator of an estate</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where executor details are not known at the time of death notification, the <strong>executor details</strong> fields in the <strong>Notification of death</strong> guided procedure must be left blank.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> executor details can be recorded manually on the Death/Executor (<strong>DEA</strong>) screen if details become known later.'</p>

<p><strong>Multiple executors</strong></p>

<p>If the deceased customer has multiple executors&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
record the details of the executor who first notifies of their executor status on the deceased customer's <strong>DEA</strong> screen</li>
		<li>
if another executor notifies, create a DOA <strong>DOC</strong> on the deceased customer's record, stating the person has multiple executors. Enter the details of all of the executors in the <strong>DOC</strong>, including the executor who notified first</li>
		<li>
proof of authority must be obtained before releasing details to an executor</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> multiple executors are not the same as disputed executors. If a person has multiple wills, or changed them, there could be disputes about who the executors are.</p>

<p>Can informant supply enough details to confirm death?</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>, <a href="../bereavement/099-02020050-03.html#bp03_tbl_Notification_of_Step05">go to Step 5</a></li>
		<li>
<strong>No</strong>&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
obtain all relevant details from the informant, including their own name, address, contact number and relationship to the deceased</li>
			<li>
obtain executor details, if known</li>
			<li>
obtain the name of the funeral director or hospital where the deceased passed away, if known</li>
			<li>
in the deceased customer's record, run the <strong>Notification of death</strong> guided procedure. The guided procedure will not code the death, but will record details on a <strong>DOC</strong>. This becomes an open work item and will be allocated to a Service Officer with the required skill to complete. If the guided procedure is not available, create an open work item. Use <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-05050020-01.html">Fast Note</a> - select <strong>Auto text</strong>, use <strong>Generic</strong> &gt; <strong>Update</strong> &gt; <strong>Death Notification (Adult) - ACTION REQUIRED</strong></li>
			<li>
If multiple notifications are received about the death of the same person do not re-run the guided procedure. Instead, check the record and annotate the original <strong>DOC</strong> to state details are correct and who advised. <a href="../bereavement/099-02020050-03.html#bp03_tbl_Notification_of_Step04">Go to Step 4</a></li>
			<li>
if there is any doubt as to the deceased's identity, contact the funeral director or the hospital where the deceased passed away. If this is not an option and contact with relatives is proposed, social worker involvement may be necessary. Where appropriate, send Request for Verification (SS257) form. <a href="../bereavement/099-02020050-03.html#bp03_tbl_Notification_of_Step04">Go to Step 4</a></li>			</ul>			</ul>

<p>If the customer was receiving Family Tax Benefit (FTB) or Child Care Subsidy (CCS), <strong>do not unlink children before coding death action</strong>. The <strong>Notification of death</strong> guided procedure will cancel FTB/CCS and allow children to be linked to another person once daily driver has run. Invite new carer to claim FTB for the child/ren. See <a href="../families/007-04050000-01.html">Death of a family assistance payment or Paid Parental Leave scheme customer</a>.</p>

<p>Death action will cancel the deceased person's payment.</p>

<p>If the guided procedure is not available, manually code the death action.</p>

<p>When recording a death the Notification Handler (NOHL) is incorrectly using the date of notification as the date to increase the survivor's rate to the single rate. The workaround for this is to record the date of receipt (DOR) as the later of either the date of death (DOD) or date paid to + 1 (DPT + 1).</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the workaround is auto-applied if the <strong>Notification of death</strong> guided procedure is used.</p>

<p>If the surviving partner was a joint owner of any assets with their late partner, full ownership of the assets legally transfers to the surviving partner following the death of their partner. However, for social security purposes, if assets are owned in joint names with the deceased partner, the surviving partner is only assessed as owning 50%. The system will continue to asses that the surviving partner owns 50% of the asset until the surviving partner advises of the transfer of assets. Where the transfer of the deceased's assets and/or income to the survivor is likely to affect the survivor's rate, code a manual review for 16 weeks following the date of death.</p>

<p>Check whether assets owned by the deceased or superannuation, compensation or other payments made to the deceased will be transferred to the surviving partner. They should not be assessed until they become available to the surviving partner.</p>

<p>If the surviving partner is granted a reversionary income stream, it is to be assessed from the date that it is first <strong>entitled to be received</strong>. A lump sum arrears payment received by the reversionary beneficiary, accrued between the death of the primary beneficiary and when the reversionary beneficiary commences to get regular payments, is assessed as income from the <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-05060010-01.html">income stream</a>.<br>This means the income is assessed over the period to which it relates and may result in a debt for that period.<br>Effective from 9 May 2018, where bereavement provisions apply and the assessment of lump sum arrears result in a debt during the bereavement period for the surviving spouse, it can be waived under the legislative instrument 'Social Security (Waiver of Debts - Bereavement Period) Specification 2017' made under subsection 1237AB(1) of the Social Security Act 1991.<br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> any debt that is incurred after the Act's 14 week bereavement period has ended would not be waived under the provisions of this legislative instrument. The legislative instrument is not retrospective. This means that any of these debts that occur before 9 May 2018 cannot be waived under class of debt waiver provisions.</p>

<p>If the deceased had any Working Credits, these credits cannot be transferred to the surviving partner.</p>

<p>If the surviving customer may be entitled to a <a target="_blank" href="../bereavement/099-06000000-01.html">Lump Sum Bereavement Payment (LBP)</a>, which is not auto-issued, a BRV activity will appear on the <strong>AL</strong> screen for a manual calculation to be made.<br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> in some cases, the calculation may result in a zero entitlement.</p>
