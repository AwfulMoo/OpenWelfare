<p>For most customers advising they, and/or their partner (if applicable), have ceased work in the last 12 months, an SU1 will be required for each employer. However, there are certain circumstances, where an SU1 may not be required. The following circumstances determine when an SU1 may not be required&#58;</p>

<p><strong>Single Touch Payroll (STP)</strong></p>

<p>STP cessation data may pre-fill during statement reporting or within an online claim. If the cessation details are confirmed by the customer, an SU1 is not required for that employer, unless changes have been made to amounts paid or there is any doubt about the number of days for leave or termination payments.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> STP data does not prefill the number of days or period covered for these payments. Therefore it is important to review the days provided by the customer is reasonable for the amount paid, example&#58; $3,000 for one day's leave is not reasonable and would need to be verified.</p>

<p><strong>Casual or Part-Time Employees</strong></p>

<p>If a customer is still employed but has had the number of working hours reduced, an SU1 is not required as their employment has not been terminated. If the customer was a casual or part-time employee but is no longer employed an SU1 is required.</p>

<p><strong>Seasonal, Contract or Intermittent Workers</strong></p>

<p>If the customer advises as part of an online claim they are a Seasonal, Contract or Intermittent Worker, the information required will be collected as part of the claim.</p>

<p>If the customer claims via other means (or it is only identified after the online claim has been submitted that the customer was a Seasonal, Contract or Intermittent Worker), an SU496 must be completed. For more information, refer to <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-05020080-01.html">Seasonal Work Preclusion Period (SWPP)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Self-Employment</strong></p>

<p>If the customer is deemed to be self-employed, a Module F - Business Details (MOD F) is required instead of an SU1.</p>

<p><strong>Customer previously working overseas</strong></p>

<p>There are no provisions in Social Security Law that exempt a customer from providing an SU1 from their previous employers.</p>

<p>Social Security Law authorises Services Australia to request relevant information from persons or entities based outside Australia. Requesting a written or verbal SU1 from an overseas employer may be impractical but overseas employers can use the National Business Gateway to verbally provide an SU1.</p>

<p>Wherever possible, alternative written evidence from the employer (for example, a letter on business letterhead) confirming details of any unused leave and/or redundancy payments paid upon ceasing employment should be provided.</p>

<p>Each case should however be assessed individually to determine the capacity of the customer to obtain the information. If the customer has attempted to obtain the information from the former employer and is unable, a statement should be taken from the customer outlining details of any unused leave and/or redundancy payments paid and the reasons for being unable to provide evidence from the overseas employer.</p>

<p><strong>Employer not contactable/No longer operating</strong></p>

<p>If the customer advises the employer ceased operations, Service Officers should endeavour to verify this information using available online sources - such as Google, Yellow Pages or Business.gov.au. See the <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07060050-05.html">Resources</a> page for links.</p>

<p>If all reasonable avenues to find a suitable contact number and address for the employer have been exhausted, a statement should be taken from the customer outlining details of unused leave and redundancy payments paid and the reasons an SU1 could not be provided by the former employer. Request suitable evidence, for example, the last payslip or any correspondence received from the employer about the closure of the business on the business letterhead, if available.</p>

<p>Service Officers must clearly document what efforts have been made to verify the employer has ceased operations and cannot be contacted.</p>

<p><strong>Youth Allowance Students, Austudy students and Australian Apprentices online claims</strong></p>

<p>If the customer (or their partner) ceased work within the last 12 months and has been paid or is due to be paid any unused leave and/or termination payment, they may be subject to an <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-05020020-01.html">Income Maintenance Period (IMP)</a>, an SU1 is required.</p>

<p>Customers who advise they and/or their partner have ceased work in the last 12 months and have not been paid and do not expect to be paid any unused leave and/or redundancy payments from any previous employers do not need to provide an SU1.</p>

<p><strong>Is an SU1 required?</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>, <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07060050-03.html#bp03_tbl_Deciding_when_t_Step03">go to Step 3</a></li>

<strong>No</strong>, procedure ends here</li>		</ul>

<div class="showcont">


<p>If the customer is current on payment and has ceased employment, check that they have been asked to provide an SU1. If not, <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07060000-01.html">appropriate notification must be issued to the customer</a>.</p>

<p>Current customers should be encouraged to upload the SU1 via the <a href="../self-service/133-04060000-01.html">Upload documents service</a>. Where the customer is not able to use Upload documents, they should lodge the SU1 at their local service centre to be scanned to the customer's record.</p>

<p>When claiming an income support payment, the online claim will identify if an Employment Separation Certificate is required and request this as part of the Next Steps process within the online claim. However, within the online claim questions, if a customer indicates they do not have an Employment Separation Certificate, the online claim will display a message stating 'I understand I need to provide this as soon as possible.'</p>

<p>To determine if there is a requirement to obtain an Employment Separation Certificate, check what information has been requested under the Tasks icon within Process Direct.</p>

<p><img src="../resources/images/process_direct_small/Tasks_screen_icon.PNG" alt="Tasks" title="Tasks" /> <strong>Tasks</strong> screen displays tasks, for example, documents the customer has been requested to provide. If the document has been returned online, a hyperlink will display in a blue box. Online modules submitted for the claim will also be displayed. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> scanned documents or those submitted online will display on the <strong>Documents</strong> screen.</p>

<p><img src="../resources/images/process_direct_small/Tasks_screen_icon.PNG" alt="Tasks" title="Tasks" /> <strong>Documents</strong> screen displays scanned documents. This includes documents received through the Upload documents online service.</p>

<p>Except for students and apprentices claiming Youth Allowance and Austudy, if an SU1 has not been automatically requested because the customer advised no leave or redundancy payments have been paid or expected, an <strong>Employment Separation Certificate</strong> is still required. This will establish the reason for ceasing employment and whether any redundancy and/or unused leave payments were made.</p>

<p>Situations where a <strong>person</strong> is not required to provide an Employment Separation Certificate but verification is still required, is when the person was employed in the last 12 months but&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
suffered sexual harassment or violence in the workplace, or</li>
		<li>
the previous employer has ceased business</li>
		</ul>
<p>In these situations, we do not ask the person to provide the Employment Separation Certificate. Verification should be obtained by phoning the employer, or sending the Q267 letter requesting an Employment Separation Certificate.</p>

<p><strong>Has an SU1 been provided?</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>

<p>If a customer contacts to query employment cessation details pre-filled in an online claim or during statement reporting, advise the customer that this information is shared with Services Australia from employers via Single Touch Payroll (STP). Employers are progressively registering to report income and employment cessation details via this service. Customers are to check, confirm or change pre-filled employer reported data. Confirmed STP data that has not had changes made to amounts paid and where there is no doubt about the number of days that leave or termination payments paid covers, does not require verification.</p>

<p>An SU1 is critical evidence used to establish qualification to income support payments, assessment of applicable waiting or non-payment periods and any compensation payments. Service Officers must ensure all&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
written evidence (for example, completed SU1s) are scanned to the customer's record and appropriately classified, and</li>
		<li>
other evidence (for example, verbal SU1s) are clearly documented on the customer's record - including details of how this evidence was sourced</li>
		</ul>
<p>Employment cessation details, unused leave and/or redundancy payments reported by employers via Single Touch Payroll will be pre-filled in online claims or Assisted Customer Claims (ACC). Staff can view this information within the Claim Summary in Process Direct. The source will be recorded in the claim as 'Employer Reported'.</p>

<p>Service officers must review all information contained in the SU1 to determine the job seeker's eligibility and payability for the income support payment.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> STP data does not prefill the number of days or period covered for these payments. Therefore, it is important to review the days provided by the customer is reasonable for the amount paid, example&#58; $3,000 for one day's leave is not reasonable and would need to be verified.</p>

<p><strong>Waiting periods</strong></p>

<p>The information provided in the SU1 or via STP will determine if the claimant is subject to waiting periods.</p>

<p><strong>The waiting periods for consideration are&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Unemployment Non-Payment Period (UNPP) Unemployment failures (UNF)</li>
		<li>
Income Maintenance Period (IMP)</li>

<p>When an STP employer reports that an employee ceased work due to reasons of 'voluntary cessation (V)' or 'dismissal (F)', mutual obligation customers are asked to supply more details as to why they are no longer employed. A compliance action is automatically generated for investigation.</p>

<p>Where an Employment Separation Certificate (SU1) has been provided (or information collected verbally by the Service Officer from the employer) and the employer has indicated the reason for separation was employee ceasing work voluntarily, misconduct as an employee, unsatisfactory work performance, or other, the Service Officer must consider whether compliance action should be generated for further investigation.</p>

<p>Where compliance action is generated, the job seeker must be advised that their reason for unemployment will be further investigated and a penalty may be applied.</p>

<p>Where a compliance event is identified at the same time a person is commencing or lodging a claim, the compliance investigation and decision regarding any compliance action must occur before the claim can be finalised as the determination has a direct impact on the job seeker's income support payment start date.</p>

<p>Customers may be subject to an IMP where they have ceased employment and have been paid out unused leave and/or redundancy payments. Where this occurs, the ISP is not payable for the period covered by these payments.</p>

<p>Unused leave and termination payments reported by STP employers are pre-filled in online claims, in Assisted Customer Claims (ACC) and in the Report Employment Income (REI) service for customers to check, confirm or change. Staff using the Earnings and Reporting workflow in Process Direct will have leave and redundancy payments from STP employers pre-filled in the workflow.</p>

<p>Staff must discuss the pre-filled information with the customer. Customers will need to advise the number of days the unused leave or redundancy payment relates to, or the average weekly wage, to assess any Income Maintenance Period. It is important to review the days provided by the customer is reasonable for the amount paid, example&#58; $3,000 for one day's leave is not reasonable and would need to be verified. The responsibility is with the customer to check, confirm or change the details.</p>

<p>Unused leave and redundancy payments confirmed by the customer will be automatically loaded on the Income Maintenance Period Summary (<strong>IMPS</strong>) screen for customers. Customer confirmed STP cessation details will have a source code of STP on the <strong>IMPS</strong> screen.</p>

<p>Located at question 7 of the SU1, employers provide information regarding leave and entitlements by asking 'On termination, did you pay or will you pay the person, any unused leave entitlements or final gross redundancy?'</p>

<p>Service Officers code the relevant information provided on the SU1.</p>
