		<ul>		<li>
<img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> (preferred option) submitting an online claim via their myGov Centrelink online account, with help from a Service Officer running Assisted Customer Claim (ACC)</li>

		<div class="block">

<p>A Social Application (SOA) generates on the customer record when they lodge a Scheme application. A Work Item is allocated to a Complex Assessment Officer (CAO) in the Home Equity Access Scheme National team for assessment and processing. Regardless of the lodgement channel, all Scheme applications are processed in Process Direct.</p>

<p>Service Officers can see customer applications via the <strong>Claim Overview</strong> in Process Direct for applications lodged&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
via Assisted Customer Claim (ACC), or</li>
		<li>
online </li>
		</ul>
<p>Service Officers can see lodged paper application forms (SA310/SA496) in the <strong>Documents</strong> section of Process Direct.</p>

<p>For combined partner online claims, there is 1 Work item to process for both the customer and partner’s loan applications.</p>

<p>If a Scheme application needs to be reindexed (for example, rejection decision overturned), create the SOA manually via the Process Direct launch pad. </p>

<p>On rare occasions, a customer may have 2 Work Items for a Scheme application created on their record that requires manual intervention to resolve. </p>

<p>To receive payment under the Scheme, a customer must meet all the <a href="../older-australians/065-19041642-01.html">eligibility criteria including</a> being in receipt of or qualified for a Scheme qualifying payment. For information on the Scheme eligibility criteria see <a target="_blank" href="../older-australians/065-19041642-01.html">Eligibility for the Home Equity Access Scheme</a>.</p>

<p>If the applicant is over Age Pension age and not getting a qualifying payment, their eligibility is assessed against the <a href="../older-australians/065-03040000-01.html">qualification rules for Age Pension</a>. The customer is not required to actually submit an Age Pension claim for the purposes of their loan application.</p>

<p>Applicants who are under Age Pension age can only qualify for the Scheme if they are partnered to a person who is Age Pension age. Applicants under Age Pension age must submit a claim for a qualifying payment unless they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
currently get a qualifying payment, or</li>
		<li>
have had their qualification assessed. For example, where the person’s qualifying payment has been cancelled or rejected for a payability-based reason in the last 13 weeks</li>
		</ul>
<p>If a customer is required to submit a new claim for a qualifying payment, they must submit the claim at the same time as the loan application. The customer's eligibility for the Scheme is assessed once the pension claim assessment is complete.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The customer and (if applicable) partner must supply identity documents if they do not have a Confirmed Identity status as well as provide proof of age if not already verified. Partners must also complete linkage. For more information see <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-09010000-01.html">Identity Confirmation</a>.</p>

<p>All Scheme applicants are required to provide the following documents (at a minimum) in relation to the real estate offered as security for the loan&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
A copy of a recent title search</li>
		<li>
The latest rates notice(s)</li>
		<li>
A copy of the current insurance policy, or certificate of currency covering the real estate</li>
		<li>
Loan agreement(s), contract(s) and most recent mortgage statement(s) if there is a loan, mortgage or other encumbrance on the real estate.</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where the applicant is a member of a couple, their partner must sign the loan application, even if they don't have ownership of the real estate being offered as security. The applicant and partner's consent is obtained via an online task or Part A of the SA310 or SA496.</p>

<p>Where a third party (other than the applicant's partner) has an interest in the real estate being offered as security for the loan, the applicant is also required to provide signed consent from the impacted party and provide it with their loan application. This includes where the real estate is the asset of a trust or company. The signed consent is obtained via Parts C to F of the SA310 or SA496.</p>

<p>Additional documents relating to the real estate may be required to establish adequate loan security. For example, if the real estate offered as security is a retirement village unit, the agreement(s) with the retirement village are usually required. This is determined on a case by case basis.</p>

<p>Upon receipt of documentation to support a customer's application, scan the document to <strong>Document Tools</strong> on the customer's record. If an associated task exists, use the <strong>Request and Manage Customer Tasks</strong> guided procedure to mark the corresponding task as 'Provided'.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Every property offered as security for the Scheme has to be valued. A recent and up-to-date valuation is required to enable accurate assessment of the applicant's equity in the Australian real estate asset(s) offered as security for the Scheme loan and the correct calculation of the Maximum Loan Amount (MLA). The assessment of a Scheme application includes the determination of whether a real estate valuation is required and, where appropriate, the submission of the valuation request. A new valuation may not be required if the property has been formally valued within the last 12 months.</p>

<p>In addition to enabling the loan security to be assessed based on the current market value, the valuation also ensures payment accuracy for Scheme applicants who are also income support payment recipients and reduces risk to recovering the Scheme loan.</p>

<p>Customers can voluntarily withdraw their Scheme application at any time while it is in progress. If the customer wishes to withdraw an application, they must do so either in writing, verbally or online. Where the application was submitted online or via Assisted Customer Claim (ACC), the customer can withdraw the application via their Centrelink online account. If a paper application was lodged, the customer can request withdrawal by contacting the agency.</p>

<p>Service Officers who receive contact from a customer requesting withdrawal of their Scheme application should advise the customer that once their claim has been withdrawn, it cannot be reinstated or appealed against. Advise the customer how to withdraw their online application via their Centrelink online account. For assistance see <a href="../self-service/133-03010130-01.html">Cancel or withdraw an online claim</a>.

<p>A customer can only have one current Scheme loan at a time. Any existing Scheme loans must be settled before a new loan can be granted, If a person has an existing loan and lodges a new application, determine if loan payments can be restarted under the existing loan instead of granting a new loan. Consideration may be given to increasing the loan security value for the existing loan (for example, adding another real estate asset), or adjusting a previously recorded Nominated Amount or Deduction. If the customer seeks to change the real estate asset used as security for the existing loan, see <a href="../older-australians/065-08020020-01.html">Security for the Home Equity Access Scheme</a>.</p>

<p>A person can be paid under the Scheme, or an income support payment under assets hardship provisions, but not both. If a Scheme customer starts being paid an income support payment under the assets hardship provisions, their Scheme payments must stop.</p>

<p>It is a legal requirement per Section 1136(1B) (2) of the Social Security Act 1991 that Scheme applications are signed by the applicant and, if they are a member of a couple, their partner. Services Australia do not accept Scheme applications lodged or signed by another person or organisation unless the person has been appointed as the legal representative for applicant (for example, under a Power of Attorney or court order) and is a correspondence nominee for the applicant.</p>

<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Assessing risk of fraud or elder abuse</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Caution should be applied where the Scheme application has been&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
lodged by a person other than the applicant, for example by a partner, family member, nominee or legal representative e.g. Power of Attorney</li>
		<li>
signed by someone else on behalf of the applicant or their partner</li>
		<li>
submitted via Assisted Customer Claim (ACC) and there is doubt over who provided the verbal consent and declaration</li>
		</ul>
<p>Scheme loan applications lodged or signed by a person other than the applicant may indicate that the applicant is not entirely aware of the application, or may not have a full understanding of the scheme and the associated terms and conditions. For assurance that an applicant's consent is fully informed, an interview is conducted with the applicant prior to granting the Scheme loan. In extreme cases, it may be identified that an applicant may be the victim of fraud or affected by elder abuse. Elder abuse is the abuse and neglect of older Australians and is a form of family and domestic violence. Elder abuse can include (but is not limited to) economic (financial) abuse. It can be unintentional or deliberate and occurs within a relationship of trust.</p>

<p>Complex Assessment Officers (CAO) are not expected to be experts in elder abuse. The role of the CAO is to identify family and domestic violence concerns and respond appropriately by offering referrals to available resources, social workers or other service providers. For assistance in identifying and supporting older customers affected by abuse, see <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-19121010-01.html">Abuse of older Australians</a>.</p>
