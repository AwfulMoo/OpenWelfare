		<ul>		<li>
Restate the job seeker's <a href="../job-seekers/001-09000000-01.html">mutual obligation requirements</a></li>

In accordance with the job seeker's participation category, discuss with the job seeker the requirement that is included in the plan as well as their options for overcoming any employment barriers. Make any relevant referrals to appropriate programs or activities</li>
		<li>
If the job seeker needs to negotiate a Job Plan as part of a new claim but the new claim cannot be finalised, the Service Officer may choose to negotiate a pre grant Job Plan if they are confident the job seeker will be Centrelink managed and they are confident which participation category the job seeker will fall into</li>
