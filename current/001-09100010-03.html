<p><strong>Compulsory Job Plans</strong></p>

<p>Explain the purpose of the interview, and tell the job seeker about the requirement to enter into a Job Plan, their rights and obligations in relation to the terms of the Job Plan, and information about compliance&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Restate the job seeker's <a href="../job-seekers/001-09000000-01.html">mutual obligation requirements</a></li>
		<li>
In accordance with the job seeker's participation category, discuss with the job seeker what types of activities may be included in the plan as well as their options for overcoming any employment barriers. Make any relevant referrals to appropriate programs or activities. <strong>The Job Plan workflow</strong> will auto-code most referrals in the referrals cluster at the same time as they are included in the Job Plan</li>
		<li>
If the job seeker needs to negotiate a Job Plan as part of a new claim but the new claim cannot be finalised, the Service Officer may choose to negotiate a pre grant Job Plan if they are confident the job seeker will be Centrelink managed and they are confident which participation category the job seeker will fall into</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a Service Officer prints the Job Plan for the job seeker, the system will check if there is a preferred written language other than English recorded on the Other Contact Details (<strong>OCD</strong>) page. It will check the language recorded against available translations of the 'Information you need to know' and if appropriate, a link displays to the Service Officer allowing them to print a translated copy of the 'Information you need to know' part of the Job Plan. The English version of this information will continue to form part of the Job Plan.</p>
