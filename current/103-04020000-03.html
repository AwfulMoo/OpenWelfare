<p>If a customer is a member of a couple and would like to receive their Centrelink payment to an overseas bank account (or by cheque), and their partner is also on a Centrelink payment and remaining in Australia, further discussion with the customer and partner is needed.

			<li>
The customer will become a CIS customer. Update the Office Code (<strong>OC</strong>) screen to WTW. The partner's <strong>OC</strong> will remain unchanged</li>

The customer in Australia needs to be aware they will not be automatically issued with a concession card when it expires. The customer must contact a Service Centre to get an interim card</li>		</ul>

<p>Overseas bank account details must be recorded using the Payment Destination Update - Record Overseas Direct Deposit Details script in Customer Record, when possible. If the script is not working, then the overseas bank details may be coded manually - but <strong>extra care</strong> should be taken to ensure that all details are coded as per the documentation received, details validated using the tools available (for example, IBAN Validation Tool) and a <strong>DOC</strong> is clearly recorded. <a href="../payment-delivery/103-04020000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Coding_customer_Step07">Go to Step 7</a> for details.</p>

<p>The script will code the fields on the Payment Destination Overseas (<strong>PAPO</strong>) screen for all the methods of payment.

The account number must be keyed twice to confirm that the details are entered correctly.</p>

<p><strong>Key the account number manually</strong>. This will make sure the details are correct. Do not copy and paste in to the script. <strong>Exception</strong>&#58; if the account number is an IBAN and the IBAN has been validated by entering it into the <a class="modal-link" href="../payment-delivery/103-04020000-05.html#bp05_tbl_IBAN_Validation_1">IBAN Validation Tool</a>.</p>

Centrelink's system, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) or Citibank</li>

intermediary or correspondent bank (if applicable)</li>

<p>It is important to investigate the reason for the rejection and take appropriate action to stop future rejections.</p>

<p>Payments rejected by the Centrelink system are easily identified by the reason, <strong>Rejected payment</strong> showing next to the payment on the Payment Summary (<strong>PS</strong>) screen. These payments do not have a payment ID allocated to them.

<p>Payments rejected by Centrelink's system are not stripped and do not leave the agency. Payments rejected at this stage do not meet minimum Centrelink payment requirements. Reasons include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Arrears in excess of system limit</strong>. A maximum arrears amount of $25,000 can be issued in Environment I at one time. A rejected payment in excess of this amount can be reissued and the system will automatically reissue the amount in separate instalments less than the system limit <a href="../payment-delivery/103-04020000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Payments_reject_Step07">Go to Step 7</a></li>
		<li>
<strong>Overseas Financial code is not valid</strong>. This applies to direct deposit payments if the overseas bank code is not recorded or has been suspended in the overseas FI table (OFS) in RDF. Contact CIS Helpdesk or staff with RDF update access to check if the FI ID or SWIFT code is still valid and correct details on the <strong>PAPO</strong> screen</li>
		<li>
<strong>Payment is to a</strong> <a href="../payment-delivery/103-04010130-01.html">Group payment schedule</a>. Payments cannot be made by Group payment from a customer record in Environment I. If the customer needs payment by Group payment to an organisation in Australia, their record must remain in the local environment and payment will be made every 2 weeks. Otherwise, get the overseas payment details from the customer and update the <strong>PAPO</strong> screen</li>
		</ul>
<p>Has the problem been corrected?</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes,</strong> as the payment has not been issued, payment can be reissued immediately if the customer is entitled to it. <a href="../payment-delivery/103-04020000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Payments_reject_Step16">Go to  Step 16</a></li>

<p>When a payment is rejected by a financial institution, a <strong>DOC</strong> is normally on the customer's record with the reason for the rejection. The <strong>DOC</strong> may be recorded by International Program or Finance Tasmania team.</p>

<p><strong>Payments rejected upfront by the RBA</strong></p>

<p>The RBA’s system may reject upfront by RBA’s system when&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
ACH payment amount is over 12,000 Euro</li>
		<li>
WWR payment amounts are under US$25</li>
		<li>
certain payment requirements are not adhered to (for example, IBAN does not start with correct country code)</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p><strong>ACH payment limit</strong></p>

<p>ACH payments are subject to a maximum limit of 12,500 Euro (approx. A$18,000) limit. This applies to every transaction. Payments above this limit will be rejected by the RBA’s system. The payment will need to be sent to the customer’s bank in smaller amounts. The RBA will notify Finance Tasmania team when a payment is rejected in this manner. Finance Tasmania team will contact CIS Helpdesk to split the amount and process via the <a href="../payment-delivery/103-04040080-01.html">Payment Adjustment (PYAJ) screen</a>. A <strong>DOC</strong> will be placed on the record to advise payment has been rejected and that CIS Helpdesk will be actioning.</p>

<p>There is no minimum limit on the amount that can be paid via ACH.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>WWR payment limit</strong></p>

<p>WWR payments are subject to a US$25 (approx. A$30) minimum limit. Where a payment has been rejected due to being under this limit and customer is paid an Australian payment regularly, SO needs to consider paying the customer periodically (for example, Every 2, 3, 4, 6 or 12 months) depending on the amount.</p>

<p>Customer’s payment will need to be suspended <strong>OTH</strong> and restored to release the payment at the agreed period before repeating this process until the amount every 4 weeks is greater than US$25.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Contact the customer and advise that they will be receiving their Australian payment periodically. Negotiate the appropriate period based on the amount customer is to receive every 4 weeks and customer’s preference. Customer can opt to be paid to an Australian bank account if they would like to receive their payment, at this rate, every 4 weeks. <strong>DOC</strong> conversation with the customer</li>
		<li>
Record a Display on Access (<strong>DOA</strong>) <strong>DOC</strong> on the customer’s record with subject&#58; <strong>WWR payment limit</strong>. State reason why customer is to receive period payments, the frequency (for example, every 4 months) and that a new FAL RVR needs to be recorded every period to ensure the payment is issued to the customer</li>

<p>Advise the customer that they need to allow enough time for the cheque to be delivered. Cheques may be delayed due to holiday periods or disruptions in mail in the country.

<p>Direct deposit payments are delivered within 2 to 6 business days of the issue date.
