<p>A <a href="../job-seekers/001-02050000-01.html">Job Seeker Snapshot</a> interview may be conducted by either Services Australia or a Workforce Australia Employment Services Provider. The Job Seeker Snapshot can be conducted in person or over the phone with a job seeker.</p>

<p>JobSeeker Payment (JSP) and Youth Allowance (YA) (other) job seekers have the opportunity to complete the Job Seeker Snapshot online at the end of the new claim process, before the Participation Interview is conducted.</p>

<p>The Job Seeker Snapshot is conducted by the agency in the following circumstances&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Within the <a href="../job-seekers/001-03020100-01.html">Participation interview</a> when a job seeker has lodged an online claim with the agency to apply for an income support payment and has not completed the Job Seeker Snapshot online</li>
		<li>
Within the Job Seeker Registration from the <strong>Participation Summary</strong> screen when a job seeker without mutual obligations wishes to register for employment assistance</li>
		<li>
When a job seeker who has completed the Job Seeker Snapshot online, indicates during the Participation Interview that their online responses may not be correct. In these cases, re-run the Job Seeker Snapshot</li>
		<li>
When job seekers notify a change in circumstances to the agency which requires the Job Seeker Snapshot to be updated</li>
		<li>
When a Service Officer believes that the Job Seeker Snapshot needs to be re-run because the job seeker is a vulnerable youth and may not have completed the Job Seeker Snapshot correctly</li>
		<li>
For job seekers in receipt of a Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) payment, such as a War Widow/er or Partner Service Pension&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
These job seekers can access Employment Services Provider assistance</li>
			<li>
They need to provide proof of their DVA payment, this can be done by displaying the cards issued to them by DVA</li>
			<li>
War Widow/ers are issued with a Gold Card and Partner Service Pensioners are issued with a DVA Pensioner Concession Card</li>		</ul>
		<li>
As an outcome of a <a href="../job-seekers/001-18030213-01.html">Comprehensive Compliance Assessment (CCA)</a> when a job seeker notifies a change in their circumstances during the CCA specialist interview</li>
		<li>
When a job seeker has participated in the <a href="../indigenous-australians/125-19092604-01.html">Time to Work Employment Service (TWES)</a> prior to claiming a payment and&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
has <strong>not</strong> already completed a Job Seeker Snapshot, or</li>
			<li>
reports to the agency a change of circumstances, other than prison release, which may affect the outcome of the Job Seeker Snapshot. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a Job Seeker Snapshot has been completed as part of TWES, another Job Seeker Snapshot does not need to be conducted at new claim unless there has been a change in circumstances that will impact the outcome of the TWES Job Seeker Snapshot</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the agency should not conduct a Job Seeker Snapshot for a job seeker who has commenced in Disability Employment Services (DES). These job seekers should be advised to contact their DES provider to report their change in circumstances.</p>

This includes JobSeeker Payment (JSP), Youth Allowance (YA), Parenting Payment (PP) and some Special Benefit (SpB) customers.</p>

<p>Job seekers can complete the online Job Seeker Snapshot at the end of the new claim process. They will have an abridged Participation Interview that will not include JSR and Job Seeker Snapshot.</p>

<p>The Job Seeker Snapshot questions and responses determine the level of assistance the job seeker may be eligible to receive.

Ensure the job seeker understands the importance of disclosing information relevant to their personal circumstances as this will mean they will receive appropriate services.</p>

<p>When completed with a Service Officer, the Job Seeker Snapshot interview must be conducted as a meaningful conversation and questions need to be asked as they appear to ensure a consistent approach is applied to all job seekers. Job Seeker Snapshot may also be conducted online by the customer.</p>

<p>Responses to some questions in the online claim will be used to pre-populate similar questions in the <a href="../job-seekers/001-02050000-01.html">Job Seeker Snapshot</a>. The job seeker will have the opportunity to review the responses and make changes where required within the Job Seeker Snapshot online or staff assisted.</p>
