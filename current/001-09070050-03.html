<p>A job seeker, who has mutual obligation requirements and is self-employed, may use their self-employment to fully meet their requirements.</p>

<p>A job seeker can fully meet their mutual obligation requirements through self-employment if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the net business income is equal to, or more than, the national minimum wage (for the number of hours required to meet the job seeker's mutual obligation requirements), <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
they are working the required number of hours in self-employment&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
35 hours per week for job seekers who have full time mutual obligation requirements</li>
			<li>
30 hours per fortnight for principal carers, those with a partial capacity to work (PCW) of 15-29 hours per week and job seekers aged 55 and over</li>
			<li>
0-14 hours per week (within their assessed bandwidth) for job seekers with a PCW or temporary reduced work capacity (TRWC)</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> principal carers combining suitable self-employment and other paid work, or self-employment and approved study must complete a combined total of 30 hours per fortnight.</p>

<p>Once the self-employment (<strong>SEL</strong>) approved activity is coded on the job seeker's record, the details are sent to the Department of Education, Skills and Employment and the job seeker will be suspended from Employment Provider Services. This suspension is automatic. There is no need for the job seeker to discuss this with their Employment Services Provider. However, the job seeker may choose to volunteer into Employment Provider Services. In these cases, the job seeker must discuss this with their provider.</p>

<p>That is, 30 hours per fortnight at the national minimum wage for job seekers with part-time requirements and job seekers aged 55 and over.

<p>If the self-employment does not satisfy the sufficient work test, the job seeker must do another approved activity entirely or may be able to combine their self-employment with another approved activity.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Services Australia can approve employment activity combinations for both Services Australia and provider managed job seekers. In the case of job seekers aged 55 and over, Services Australia can approve voluntary work and employment combinations. Services Australia can also approve a combination of self-employment, paid part-time work and/or approved study for principal carers. Only an Employment Services Provider can approve voluntary work or a combination of voluntary work and other activities for principal carers under 55.</p>

<p>If the job seeker is not doing activities that enable them to be Services Australia managed and they are not exempt from mutual obligation requirements, they must be referred to an Employment Services Provider if they have not already been connected.</p>

<p>Employment Services Providers are responsible for negotiating and maintaining the Job Plan for provider managed job seeker.</p>

<p>Self-employment must equal 30 hours or more per fortnight for partial capacity to work (PCW) 15-29 hours per week, job seekers aged 55 and over and principal carers. In addition, net business income <strong>must also</strong> equal or be more than the national minimum wage per fortnight for the number of required hours.</p>

<p>Job seekers assessed with a PCW or temporary reduced work capacity (TRWC) of 0-7 or 8-14 hours per week may fully meet their mutual obligation requirements through self-employment or a combination of self-employment and paid work activities within their assessed bandwidth.</p>

<p>Principal carers can also combine self-employment and other paid work, or self-employment and study totalling at least 30 hours per fortnight to fully meet requirements, as long as the total remuneration is sufficient for the agreed hours of self-employment.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Record the self-employment as an approved activity on the <strong>AEX</strong> screen using the following codes&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
For job seekers aged 55 and over doing a combination of voluntary work and self-employment, use both codes of '<strong>SEL</strong>' and '<strong>VWK</strong>'</li>
			<li>
For principal carers doing a combination of self-employment and other paid work, use the code '<strong>PWS</strong>'</li>
			<li>
For principal carers doing a combination of self-employment and approved study, use the code of '<strong>SSE</strong>'</li>		</ul>
		<li>
The start date used for the <strong>AEX</strong> screen should be the date of coding, to ensure details are transferred to the Department of Education, Skills and Employment system</li>
		<li>
Negotiate a Job Plan with the job seeker that includes the agreed activity/ies and ensure it includes corresponding dates to the activity/ies coded on the <strong>AEX</strong> screen. In the Job Plan workflow, the 'Self employment' activity is located under the 'Employment' heading</li>
		<li>
Ensure any other non-current activities are removed from the Job Plan</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> <strong>SEL</strong> should not be coded on the <strong>AEX</strong> screen for more than 12 months at a time and requires a new <strong>Job Plan</strong> every 12 months if the work is continuing.</p>

<p>Details must be recorded using the Self employment script.</p>

<p>Advise the job seeker they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
are fully meeting their mutual obligation requirements while they are doing the agreed approved activity</li>
		<li>
do not have job search efforts however, they still must declare their participation in the approved activity to Services Australia each fortnight</li>
		<li>
will be automatically suspended from Employment Provider Services, however they can voluntarily continue to participate with their provider</li>
		<li>
must advise Services Australia of changes about their participation in the agreed approved activity (e.g. cessation of self-employment or increase in income) within the required timeframe and how the changes may affect their mutual obligation requirements</li>
		</ul>
<p>If they are not connected to a provider or they are suspended from Employment Provider Services, they do not need to attend ongoing provider appointments.</p>

<p>Job seekers aged 55 and over are suspended from Employment Provider Services, however, they must stay connected to their provider and still must accept full-time, suitable paid work or an increase in their work hours and must accept all referrals to suitable job interviews.</p>
