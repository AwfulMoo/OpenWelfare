<a class="anchor" name="bp05_tbl_Examples_of_wei_Scenario"></a>
<p><strong>Scenario 1</strong></p></td>
<td>

<p>Job seeker states they were working on the incident date and contacted the provider to advise of inability to attend. When asked, the job seeker immediately provides details of the name of the employment consultant she notified, what date, and what approximate time.</p>

<p>The <strong>Hours for One Period (HOP)</strong> field on the <strong>EAPP</strong> screen confirms the job seeker declared 30 hours of work for the applicable fortnight.</p>

<p>The Employment Income Summary (<strong>EANS</strong>) screen confirms declared earnings for 30 hours for the applicable fortnight. There are minimal instances of non-compliance on the job seeker's Compliance Summary, indicating they have a good history of attending appointments and complying with requirements. The provider has entered notes of previous contacts to reschedule appointments due to job seeker contacts advising they will be working, but not for this compliance event.</p>

<p>The job seeker appears genuinely upset an investigation is taking place. Given their manner and engagement during this compliance investigation, record of the hours worked on the <strong>EAPP</strong> screen and their previous history of reporting when they are working, there is no reason to doubt the job seeker's statement, particularly as the job seeker was able to advise when they contacted and who they spoke with. Therefore, a greater weight can be given to the evidence of the job seeker statement as a credible source.</p>

<p>The Participation Solutions Team (PST)-skilled Service Officer must document the evidence and how this was weighed, for example, 'job seeker statement is credible given past compliance and prior notification of inability to attend for previous instances as per the <strong>Provider Recorded Information</strong> screen and factual account of who they reported their inability to attend to. Statement is also supported by the hours worked history.'</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a class="anchor" name="bp05_tbl_Examples_of_wei_Scenario01"></a>
<p><strong>Scenario 2</strong></p></td>
<td>

<p>During their initial contact with the Participation Solutions Team (PST) to discuss a work refusal failure, the job seeker advised they would be able to provide additional evidence to support their statements. An allowance of 2 days was negotiated for the job seeker to provide the evidence. At the end of the 2 days the additional evidence had not been received, and the job seeker could not be contacted to explore why. The decision about the compliance action was made, based on the available evidence. As some facts had not been substantiated these were given less weight.</p>

<p>The decision maker's explanation of decision states as the requested evidence had not been provided the facts could not be substantiated and were disregarded in the decision making process.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a class="anchor" name="bp05_tbl_Examples_of_wei_Scenario02"></a>
<p><strong>Scenario 3</strong></p></td>
<td>

<p>A Workforce Australia job seeker advised they did not attend a Mandatory Activation Point Work for the Dole (WFD) requirement due to being in court on that day. The job seeker advised they spoke to their provider a week prior to let them know of their inability to attend.</p>

<p>The report from the provider noted an ongoing legal case and court attendance is a known circumstance that may impact the job seeker's ability to comply, however, the job seeker is required to attend WFD which had been arranged around court dates. The Workforce Australia provider noted the job seeker did not advise of inability to attend on the incident date and had not recorded a Personal Event in the Online Calendar on their Homepage.</p>

<p>Due to conflicting statements, the Participation Solutions Team (PST)-skilled Service Officer was not reasonably satisfied prior contact had occurred. The Service Officer contacted the provider who confirmed the job seeker contacted the week prior to advise they would be in court on Tuesday. However, the incident date was Thursday, 2 days later. The provider had recorded a Personal Event for the Tuesday. The provider confirmed there had been no contact from the job seeker since the call the week before. The job seeker had been unable to provide details of the time, date or person they spoke with.</p>

<p>A greater weight is given to the providers' evidence as their notes were well documented and thus the evidence was more fully substantiated, they were aware of the job seeker's legal issues and can confidently recall the previous conversation. The job seeker's statement was given less weighting as it was considered the less credible in this case.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

<p><strong>Scenario 4</strong></p></td>
<td>

<p>A Workforce Australia job seeker has failed to attend an appointment with their provider, resulting in the generation of a Mutual Obligation Failure. </p>

<p>The job seeker advised they had been experiencing an exacerbation of an underlying health condition that impacted both their ability to attend the appointment and their ability to contact the provider prior to the scheduled commencement of their appointment as they had been hospitalised. </p>

<p>The PST-skilled Service Officer reviews the job seeker’s <strong>Circumstances Impacting Compliance</strong> and confirms a significant medical condition has been evidenced previously and details of impacts to compliance that may occur during periods of exacerbation reflect the information provided by the job seeker. </p>

<p>Credibility is given to the job seeker’s version of events as the <strong>Circumstances Impacting Compliance</strong> supports the job seeker’s statement. The PST-skilled Service Officer can confirm that the job seeker overall has a positive compliance history and this gives sufficient weight for them to exercise discretion in the rejection of the failure. </p>

<p>The PST-skilled Service Officer encourages the job seeker to engage with their provider to discuss the change to their circumstances and confirms that they are welcome to supply any additional medical documentation they may have obtained from their recent hospitalisation to Services Australia for an appropriate exemption or additional referral to be considered. </p>

<p>Whilst this is helpful information for the job seeker to provide to ensure that they are receiving the support they require, the documents will not impact the outcome of the failure as the failure is already able to be rejected.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a class="anchor" name="bp05_tbl_Examples_of_wei_Scenario03"></a>
<p><strong>Scenario 5</strong></p></td>
<td>

<p>A job seeker contacts Services Australia as they are required to undertake a Capability Assessment. </p>

<p>During the conversation, the PST-skilled Service Officer identifies a newly disclosed Circumstance Impacting Compliance needs to be recorded. Updates are made to the <strong>Circumstance Impacting Compliance</strong> screen and the Service Officer notes that they will require mandatory social worker consultation based on the nature of the circumstance. </p>

<p>The Service Officer is able to engage the PST-skilled social worker during the job seeker’s initial contact and is then able to utilise that contact as evidence to confirm the circumstance. This newly evidenced circumstances returns the job seeker to the Green Zone.</p>

<p>The job seeker advised there is also a change to a previously declared circumstance, but would require some time to source and supply evidence so that the exacerbation of that circumstance can also be considered.</p>

<p>Whilst this is helpful information for the job seeker to provide to ensure that they are receiving the support they require, the evidence will not impact the outcome of the Capability Assessment as the inclusion of the newly disclosed circumstance is already sufficient to result in a 'not capable' finding and return the job seeker to the Green Zone. The Capability Assessment is able to be finalised at their first point of contact, as holding for evidence that will not impact the outcome of the investigation is inappropriate. </p>

<p>The job seeker is encouraged to engage in a discussion with their provider to ensure any additional support they may be able to receive is given to them.</p></td>
