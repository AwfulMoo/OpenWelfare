<p>Generally, payment destination details can only be changed by the customer or a person with payment authority for that customer. This can include a faxed request from a bank, on their letterhead <strong>and</strong> signed by the customer.</p>

<p>A parent who has been receiving their under 18 YA child's payments may have <a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-01020010-01.html">authority to provide new bank account details in the child's own name when the child turns 18</a>.</p>

<p>There may, however, be the situation when a <strong>partner contacts</strong> the agency to advise a change to their joint bank account details. In these cases <strong>extra care must be taken before a change is made&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
The Person Permitted to Enquire (PPE) indicator must be <strong>Y</strong></li>
		<li>
The identity of the partner must be verified. Name, address, date of birth and Customer Reference Number (CRN) are not sufficient, as an ex-family member may know these details</li>
		<li>
A check of the customer record <strong>must</strong> be made to ensure marital circumstances are unchanged</li>
		<li>
The partner <strong>must</strong> be able to provide the details of the previous account, and&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the previous account <strong>must</strong> be a joint account, and</li>
			<li>
the new account <strong>must</strong> also be a joint account that the customer has legal access to, that is, their name must appear on the joint account</li>		</ul>
		<li>
The Service Officer <strong>must not</strong> have any doubts about the 'bona fides' of the third party requesting that the bank account be changed</li>
		</ul>
<p>There are serious consequences when money is paid to the wrong person. If <strong>any</strong> doubt exists as to the accuracy of the information, the Service Officer <strong>must not</strong> make the change to the customer record. It is the responsibility of the Service Officer and the agency to check the accuracy of the information prior to its use.</p>

<p>If the employee has any doubts as to the validity of the advice or the 'bona fides' of the third party, the <strong>customer</strong> must be contacted by telephone or in writing before the change is actioned.</p>

<p>A one-off or temporary third party may request to cease receiving payments on the customer's behalf. Use the Change Payment Destination workflow to action this request.</p>

<p>A <strong>correspondence nominee</strong> can request a change in the customer's payment destination when&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
there is no payment nominee arrangement in place, and</li>
		<li>
the new account is in the customer's name or the payment is to be directed to a group institution</li>
		</ul>
<p>The Authorising a person or organisation to enquire or act on your behalf (SS313) form, must be completed if the correspondence nominee is to be appointed as a payment‚ nominee.</p>

<p>If a payment nominee requests a change in the customer's payment destination, see <a href="../payment-delivery/103-04030010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Completing_upda_Step07">Step 7 in Table 2</a>.</p>

<p>Due to the fraud risks associated with changing payment destination, additional authentication checks must be conducted, even if the customer has authenticated using their Voice Print.</p>

<p>All customers must be asked to confirm their current payment destination details (prior to requested change). This can be either BSB code and account number or just simply branch name and account number.</p>

<p>If the customer is not voice authenticated, or the voice authenticated customer cannot confirm their current payment destination, ensure extra precaution is taken, and the customer can answer questions that are not common knowledge.</p>

<p>Examples of additional questions&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the approximate amount of their last payment to that account (other additional identity documentation can be checked when the customer turns 18 and wants to change payment into their own bank account)</li>
		<li>
if they are a JobSeeker Payment customer, whether they had casual earnings on their last report&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
ask questions regarding the employer's name, and</li>
			<li>
the amount of wages declared (approximate figures are fine)</li>		</ul>
		<li>
the middle name of their child (if applicable) and the date of birth</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the current payment destination is a <strong>rehabilitation centre, correctional centre trust account or respite nursing home</strong>, the customer may not know the account details of the organisation. In these cases have the customer state their previous payment destination details and the amount of their last payment delivered to that account (this does not include by group schedule).</p>

<p>If the customer cannot provide these details or the details are incorrect, other identification or authentication questions are required before updating the account destination. See, <a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-04110000-01.html">Authenticating a customer</a>.</p>

<p>If the identity of the customer is proven beyond doubt, proceed to update payment destination. See <a href="../payment-delivery/103-04030010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Completing_upda_Step01">Step 1 in Table 2</a>.</p>

<p><strong>If there are any concerns about the identity of the customer&#58;</strong></p>

<p>In cases where it may be difficult to offer a callback option, refer the customer to their service centre to further establish their identity. Advise the customer to bring identifying documents and verification of new account details to the service centre.</p>
