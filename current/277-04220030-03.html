<p>If the customer who owes the debt refuses to address the outstanding child support or overpayment in a satisfactory way, Debt Enforcement SO3/4 transfers the case to the Debt Enforcement SO5. Which officer to transfer to is determined by the state the customer resides in.</p>

<p>Examples of refusing to address the outstanding debt is not contacting Child Support or not paying in line with their capacity.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In certain circumstances an extended period of time may have lapsed between the issuing of the letter of demand and allocation of the case to a Debt Enforcement SO5. For example if a customer elected to exercise their right to lodge a Change of Assessment (COA) application upon receipt of the letter of demand. </p>

<p>In these cases, the Debt Enforcement SO5, in consultation with the team leader, must decide if theyissue a second letter of demand. This is especially important when the debt has changed.</p>

<p>The team leader will arrange for the case to be reviewed within 5 working days to determine if the matter is suitable for litigation. If appropriate, the team leader allocates the customer and any other parties owed a debt by the customer, to a Debt Enforcement SO5. </p>

<p>Within 5 days of receiving the case, the Debt Enforcement SO5 must attempt to contact&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer who owes the debt, and </li>
		<li>
any other parties that are owed a debt,</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the allocation is not appropriate, the team leader will email the Debt Enforcement Team Leader to discuss the return of the case to the Debt Enforcement SO3/4. </p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> information provided by the Debt Enforcement SO5 to the customers (or vice versa) during these initial contacts may be included in an affidavit. This may then form part of the evidence provided to the court and all parties to the proceeding. It is important that all contacts and attempted contacts are clearly documented.

<p>To initiate court proceedings, the Debt Enforcement SO5 must gather a comprehensive range of factual evidence regarding the customer who owes the debt’s financial capacity to pay the outstanding child support or overpayment debt. It is the collation of this evidence which makes up the brief.</p>

<p>It is essential that Debt Enforcement SO5s utilise administrative options for the collection of information from third parties (section 120 of the <a target="_blank" class="extwebsitelink" href="https&#58;//www.legislation.gov.au/series/c2004a03596">Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988</a>) before initiating court proceedings. </p>

<p>Once engaged in a court proceeding, it is generally no longer appropriate for Child Support to issue notices under this section of the legislation. Alternatively the agency must make use of the court processes for gathering evidence - such as a subpoena and oral evidence.</p>

<p>All available evidence is collated, folioed and presented to a legal service provider in a professional and comprehensive brief which aids them to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
establish the most appropriate course of action to be taken</li>
		<li>
evaluate the prospects of success</li>
		<li>
highlight any potential risk factors that may impede or prohibit success</li>
		<li>
note any gaps in information, and issue the appropriate applications (such as s120 notices or a subpoena), and</li>
		<li>
draft comprehensive affidavit material to support the application for the recovery of outstanding child support payments or overpayments</li>		</ul>

<p>To ensure a brief is complete, Debt Enforcement SO5 must fully investigate and produce evidence to support the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the basis of the outstanding child support payments or overpayments - assessment notices, transaction statements, section 116(2) certificate</li>
		<li>
assets - proof of ownership, encumbrance details and valuation</li>
		<li>
personal and business income - tax returns, business activity statements, Australian Securities and Investment Commission registrations, Australian Business Register search results, trust deeds, balance sheets, profit and loss statements</li>
		<li>
bank accounts - information produced pursuant to notices issued to third parties</li>
		<li>
summary of communication with the customer who owes the debt - which may aid in establishing a history of non-compliance</li>
		<li>
advise of any security incidents or information regarding other security concerns, and</li>
		<li>
other - credit reports, bankruptcy information, AUSTRAC and Department of Home Affairs/travel movements</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58; </strong>‘Suspicious Matter Reports’ (SMRs) from AUSTRAC must never be disclosed. This means they <strong>must not</strong> be included when making a submission – they cannot be disclosed to any court or tribunal and are not admissible as evidence.</p>

<p>Review AUSTRAC search results to ensure they do not contain an SMR/SUSTR – these <strong>must not</strong> be recorded in the system. If a record needs to be removed, take immediate action, email National Intensive Collection Services.</p>

<p>Full details regarding AUSTRAC disclosure of information can be found on the <a href="../separated-parents/277-04220030-05.html">Resources</a> page.</p>

<p>It is critical that Debt Enforcement SO5s thoroughly scrutinise the information produced through these searches and note any anomalies or inconsistencies in order to gather quality evidence regarding the financial circumstances of the customer who owes the debt.</p>

<p>Before engaging a legal service provider, Debt Enforcement SO5s must&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
complete the profile and brief, and </li>
		<li>
forward these documents to the team leader for initial review and approval</li>
		</ul>
<p>The team leader scrutinises the profile and brief. </p>

<p>When satisfied it is appropriate to initiate legal proceedings, the team leader will&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
forward the request to engage an external legal service provider to the relevant Litigation and Information Release Branch (LIR), and </li>
		<li>
copy in the referring Debt Enforcement SO5</li>
		</ul>
<p>The team leader is responsible for checking the accuracy of all factual information contained within the profile/brief. On receipt of this email the Debt Enforcement SO5 keys a submission to commence legal action in <strong>Collection </strong>window.</p>

<p><strong>Submission to LIR</strong> - To be recorded in real time when profile is sent to LIR.</p>

<p>Select the 'Level 3' category from the drop down menu and&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Select the 'Referral to AGS' option from the drop down menu</li>
		<li>
Select 'Submission to commence Legal Action'</li>
		<li>
Select <strong>Go</strong></li>
		<li>
Fill in fields and 'keying status' as Keyed</li>
		<li>
Select <strong>OK</strong></li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> this window needs all fields completed. The fields that require a reference number can be recorded as '0000'. The instruction field should be 'Profile submitted to LIR for approval'.</p>

<p>LIR reviews the strategy and ensures technical and legal requirements have been met, as well as weighing up the cost effectiveness, before authorising the engagement of the external legal service provider. An approval email will be sent to the Debt Enforcement SO5 and team leader.</p>

<p>On receipt of this email the Debt Enforcement SO5&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
updates the submission to commence legal action in the <strong>Collection Window</strong> to 'approved' or 'rejected', and</li>
		<li>
includes the authorising officer's details and the date on which it was approved</li>

<p>On the <strong>Submission</strong> screen the status box can either be&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Approved, or</li>
		<li>
Rejected</li>
		</ul>
<p>If a profile is recorded as keyed and an outcome is achieved (payment in full/arrangement/discharge etc.) before LIR have approved or rejected, the status should be updated as rejected.</p>

<p><strong>Cost effectiveness</strong></p>

<p>The cost effectiveness of the litigation process is measured by examining&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
whether spending money to litigate is a better option than utilising that money on other activities, and</li>
		<li>
whether the commencement of legal action is likely to result in a collection outcome</li>
		</ul>
<p>The viability of commencing legal action is determined on a case by case basis</p>

<p>Also the amount of the debt can also be an important consideration. The court has the discretion to refuse to make an order for costs in favour of a party who has initiated legal proceedings to enforce a nominal amount.</p>

<p>Although the approach to litigation is outcome orientated, the reality is that the desired outcome (the collection of outstanding child support payments) will not be achieved in every case.</p>

<p>Once authorisation has been obtained LIR will email the external Legal Service Provider to engage them to act in the enforcement proceedings. LIR attaches a copy of the profile and copies in the Debt Enforcement SO5 and team leader.</p>

<p>The Debt Enforcement SO5 will forward a copy of the brief to the Legal Service Provider and to LIR, if they request it.</p>

<p>Upon receipt of the request, the external legal service provider will create an ongoing file.</p>

<p>For the remainder of the litigation process legal costs will be incurred.</p>

<p>The external legal service provider creates the affidavit in support of the Form 2 Application in a Case. The Debt Enforcement SO5 reviews the contents and makes arrangements to swear or affirm the affidavit.</p>

<p>The affidavit is then filed by the Legal Service Provider along with the Form 2 Enforcement Application in a Case in the Federal Circuit Court of Australia or the Family Court of Western Australia in accordance with the timeframes set out in the Court Rules.</p>

<p>When sealed copies of these documents are received from the court, the Legal Service Provider will forward these to the Debt Enforcement SO5.</p>

<p>From this point the agency is no longer in a position to negotiate a payment arrangement with the payer. Any negotiations must occur with the legal service provider. Payment in full is the only payment option.</p>

<p>On receipt of the sealed application in a case the Debt Enforcement SO5 will&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
key the summons in the <strong>Collection Window,</strong> and </li>
		<li>
include the date the matter was filed as the 'summon initiated' date</li>

		<li>
Select <strong>OK</strong></li>
		</ul>
<p>The payer is commonly referred to as the respondent for the remainder of the litigation process.</p>

<p>The affidavit in support of the Form 2 Application in a Case, drafted in accordance with the appropriate court rules, is intended to set out and highlight the evidence that has been gathered during investigations in support of the orders sought.</p>

<p>The affidavit is the agency's evidence to the court, upon which it seeks to rely, in having the court make orders for payment and enforcement. </p>

<p>In the affidavit the Debt Enforcement SO5 deposes to the respondent's financial position, including&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
real or other assets they own</li>
		<li>
companies and businesses the respondent is involved in or holds interest in, and </li>
		<li>
their income over the period of liability</li>
		</ul>
<p>The affidavit will exhibit updated search results, copies of bank statements and other subpoenaed documents that are relevant to the case.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> it is critical for the Debt Enforcement SO5 to have read and fully understood each aspect of the affidavit before attending court. This is particularly important if the respondent or their associated legal representative wishes to orally examine the Debt Enforcement SO5 regarding the content or evidence provided.</p>

<p>The Legal Service Provider will send the court documents and a covering letter to the respondent, to a process server to facilitate personal service on the respondent as soon as possible.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Debt Enforcement SO5s must ensure the profile is as up to date as possible as the Legal Service Provider will rely on the information in the profile when providing instructions to the process server. This includes&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the best address and contact numbers for the respondent for service</li>
		<li>
any alternate address at which service can be attempted</li>
		<li>
details of the respondent's registered motor vehicles that might be sighted at the address</li>
		<li>
general information in relation to any person with whom the respondent is known to be living, and </li>
		<li>
a copy of the respondent's drivers licence photo (where the available</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the respondent's best address for service is current and the respondent does not deliberately avoid service, the process server is likely to only need 1 or 2 attempts before the documents are served.</p>

<p>It is not uncommon for the respondent's address to have changed since the profile was completed or for the respondent to actively avoid service. In any of these instances it is more likely that the process server will have to make multiple attempts at personal service.</p>

<p>When the respondent is personally served the process server will ask the respondent to sign an Acknowledgment of Service. This can then be filed by the Legal Service Provider with the court as evidence that service has been effected. The respondent may not always be willing to sign the Acknowledgment of Service.</p>

<p>The process server will swear or affirm an Affidavit of Service confirming the date, person and documents that have been served and return this document to the Legal Service Provider for filing.</p>

<p>In some cases, despite the process server's best attempts at service, they will be unable to personally serve the documents on the respondent.</p>

<p>If the process server has been unable to effect personal service, they will return the documents to the Legal Service Provider with a detailed Affidavit of Attempts. </p>

<p>In this affidavit the process server will depose&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
to the number of attempts they have made</li>
		<li>
any conversations with the occupant/s of the respondent's last known address, and </li>
		<li>
any other relevant facts about service</li>
		</ul>
<p>Under the court rules if it has not been possible to effect personal service, the Debt Enforcement SO5 must instruct the Legal Service Provider to prepare an application to the court for orders for substituted service. </p>

<p>An application for substituted service is made by the Legal Service Provider filing a Form 2 Application in a Case supported by an affidavit, deposing to the attempts which have been made to serve the documents personally on the respondent and of any other steps which have taken by the Registrar to bring the proceedings to the attention of the respondent.</p>

<p>In addition, the affidavit should provide evidence of the contact details for which the agency is seeking substituted service orders.</p>

<p>In deciding whether or not to make an order for substituted service, the court will consider whether reasonable attempts at effecting personal service have been made, and any other relevant matters that the court sees appropriate, which may include whether there is sufficient evidence that sub service will bring the documents to the attention of the respondent.</p>

<p>If the court is satisfied it is appropriate to make orders for substituted service, it may make an order substituting another way of serving the documents, such as by post and an SMS advice to the respondent's mobile phone. When the Legal Service Provider receives the orders for substituted service they will serve the documents on the respondent in accordance with the orders.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the court is not satisfied that sufficient attempts at personal service were attempted it may refuse to make the orders for substituted service. In this case, the court will usually direct that further attempts at personal service be attempted in the first instance.</p>

<p>Substituted service may also be effected, under section 115 of the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988.</p>

<p>This can be done by posting the court documents to the respondent at the respondent's last known address if, after reasonable inquiries, the agency is satisfied that the respondent is either absent from Australia or that the respondent cannot be found.</p>

<p>When the Debt Enforcement SO5 becomes aware that the respondent has been served, normally via an email from the Legal Service Provider advising of service and attaching the report from the process server, the Debt Enforcement SO5 will enter the 'served on date' into the summons field in the <strong>Collection Window</strong>.

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the Debt Enforcement SO5 must confirm their instructions in writing immediately following a telephone conversation with a Legal Service Provider.</p>

<p><strong>In Person</strong></p>

<p>Debt Enforcement SO5 often provide instructions to a Legal Service Provider when meeting in person. It is essential that following an in person contact with a Legal Service Provider the Debt Enforcement SO5 confirm their instructions in writing. When meeting in person in the court environment, the details of this meeting may not be confirmed in writing.</p>

<p>It is important for the Debt Enforcement SO5 to provide consistent, clear and concise instructions to the Legal Service Provider, ensuring that instances of miscommunication and misinterpretation are minimised.</p>

<p>When instructing a Legal Service Provider, Debt Enforcement SO5 must ensure they are seeking options that are cost effective and suitable for the individual circumstances of each case.</p>

<p>An instruction outline is completed by the Debt Enforcement SO5 when the profile is first drafted before engaging legal representation. The nature or type of instruction may be subject to change or variation as the proceeding unfolds. Debt Enforcement SO5s must ensure the instructions provided are tailored to reflect the individual circumstances of the case and the relevant options for each of those circumstances.</p>

<p>It is important that Debt Enforcement SO5 fully understand that the quality of instructions and information provided to a Legal Service Provider directly correlates and impacts on the costs incurred per case and the success of any application - be it for the enforcement of outstanding child support payments, overpayment or seeking payment of incurred legal costs.</p>

<p>To avoid the costs associated with a contested hearing or the costs associated with an adjournment, Debt Enforcement SO5 should initially attempt to negotiate final orders by way of consent on the basis that the first hearing date should be the last.</p>

<p>In doing so, the Debt Enforcement SO5 must instruct their Legal Service Provider as to the terms upon which the agency will be prepared to settle the matter.

<p>A respondent may be unwilling to enter into final consent orders due to their assertion that they have been assessed incorrectly and hence that the amount of the debt is not accurate. In this instance, it is not uncommon for a respondent to seek to exercise their legal rights of appeal.</p>

<p>For example, the respondent may seek&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
additional time to lodge their outstanding tax returns</li>
		<li>
to lodge a COA application, Part 6A objection, AAT appeal etc</li>
		<li>
to lodge an application to the court seeking to depart from previous assessments, vary a court order or end an agreement, and/or</li>
		<li>
to undertake paternity testing</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> on a case by case basis, the Debt Enforcement SO5 in consultation with LIR must decide whether to consent or oppose any adjournments sought by the respondent.</p>

<p>In the event the respondent exercises any of their avenues of appeal whilst an enforcement proceeding is on foot, subject to the individual circumstances of the case the matter may be adjourned until the avenue of appeal (and any subsequent appeal rights) have been finalised or have lapsed.</p>

<p>This approach ensures the agency is not seeking to enforce a debt which may be subject to change (increase or decrease) at a later date. Further, by providing the respondent with sufficient time to exercise their legal rights of appeal, the agency is fulfilling its obligation to act as a model litigant.</p>

<p>When a departure application is lodged with the court, the Debt Enforcement SO5, in consultation with the Team Manager must ensure that advice is sought from the Program Advice  team about whether it is appropriate for the agency to intervene in the departure proceeding or alternatively whether it is necessary to remove the agency as a party from the proceedings in circumstances where they have been named as a respondent.</p>

<p>In circumstances where an adjournment is agreed to, the Debt Enforcement SO5 must attempt to negotiate interim orders.</p>

<p>When a matter proceeds at court and the respondent appears, the matter will generally be stood down to enable&#58;</p>

the respondent to seek the assistance of the Duty Lawyer (Legal Aid) in the event that they are unrepresented, and</li>
		<li>
the parties to settle the matter by consent</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the Debt Enforcement SO5 does <strong>not</strong> engage in direct communication or negotiation with the respondent. Rather, the Legal Service Provider will act as a conduit for negotiations between the respondent and Services Australia.</p>

<p>The Debt Enforcement SO5 in consultation with LIR must provide clear instructions to the Legal Service Provider about the terms upon which the agency would be willing to settle the matter on a final or interim basis. The concepts outlined in <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-04220030-03.html#bp03_tbl_Settlement_of_m_Step02">Final Orders</a> and <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-04220030-03.html#bp03_tbl_Settlement_of_m_Step04">Interim Orders</a> are again applicable at this stage of the court proceedings when negotiating final or interim orders.</p>

<p>If an agreement can be reached with the respondent with respect to payment of the debt, that is child support, overpayment, late payment penalties and costs, the Legal Service Provider will proceed to draft minutes of proposed orders to give effect to the terms of the agreement. Once both parties have had an opportunity to read and approve the proposed minutes, they will be signed and presented to the court. The court is then asked to make orders by consent in terms of the proposed minutes signed by the parties.</p>

<p>The court does not have the jurisdiction to make any orders in relation to the remission of late payment penalties (LPP). It is unlikely that the agency will agree to remit any LPPs once a matter proceeds to a contested hearing as the failure by the respondent to settle the matter by consent will be treated as a failure to fully mitigate the effects of their non-compliance.</p>

<p>In a contested hearing the court will&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
hear submissions from all parties</li>
		<li>
assess the evidence before the court</li>
		<li>
determine how the debt should be paid, and</li>
		<li>
apply their discretion and make suitable orders</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the court has a general discretion as to whether or not it will enforce the child support debt or overpayment and therefore may refuse to make any orders if it is not satisfied that the respondent has the capacity to pay the debt.</p>

<p>In suitable cases, the Debt Enforcement SO5 can instruct their Legal Service Provider to seek the same orders (final or interim) which were originally attempted to be negotiated during the course of the consent negotiations. In doing so, the Debt Enforcement SO5 must consult with LIR and act upon the advice of their Legal Service Provider in relation to the suitability of this option. The supplementary affidavit and general submissions to the court will be relied on in seeking any orders.</p>

<p>In other instances it may be necessary to orally examine the respondent as to their financial capacity to repay the debt, for example where there is insufficient or uncertain documentary evidence or if the respondent disputes the evidence set out in the supplementary affidavit.</p>

<p>The cross examination of the respondent is conducted by the Legal Service Provider or briefed counsel and is designed to extract further evidence to be eventually relied upon in obtaining the orders sought.</p>

<p>It is usual for the court to award costs in accordance with the Court Scale of costs.

As a general rule, costs on the Court Scale are usually less than the actual legal costs which have been incurred by the agency.</p>

<p>In limited circumstances the Debt Enforcement SO5, in consultation with LIR, can instruct the Legal Service Provider to seek an order from the court that the respondent pay indemnity costs.</p>

<p>Where judgement is obtained, the court will usually make orders&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
declaring the amount of the debt, including late payment penalties</li>
		<li>
for the payment of the debt and any legal costs awarded in a specified way, and</li>

for enforcement of the debt if payment is not made in accordance with the orders</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Seeking costs in the Family Court of Western Australia</strong></p>

<p>Unlike the Federal Circuit Court, the Family Court of Western Australia does not have a schedule of fixed costs for proceedings before it. Instead the Court has an itemised scale of costs in Schedule 3 of the Rules.</p>

<p>In enforcement matters, the Registrar relies on the Court's power to make a costs order in a fixed amount, pursuant to Rule 19.18(1) (a). The quantum of the costs order sought is based on an estimate of the scale (party-and-party) costs of the proceedings.</p>

<p>As a general rule, the Registrar seeks an order for costs fixed in an amount in the Form 2 Application in a Case, and will seek an order for this amount if the matter is finalised at or before the first court date.</p>

<p>If the matter is listed for hearing more than once, the Legal Service Provider will generally seek a higher costs order. The respondent is given notice of the higher costs claim in the Minute of Proposed Orders and the covering letter sent to the respondent before the hearing.</p>

<p><strong>After the Court Hearing</strong></p>

<p>After every court date, the Legal Service Provider will prepare a court report which advises the Debt Enforcement SO5, by email, of the outcome of the hearing and any orders made. An engrossed copy of the sealed order is sent to the Debt Enforcement SO5 as soon as it is available.</p>

<p>If a charging order has been obtained against the respondent's real property, the Legal Service Provider will arrange for a caveat to be registered over the property. Charges relating to vehicles can be arranged by the Legal Service Provider after the orders have been made. If required, the Debt Enforcement SO5 will provide the external Legal Service Provider with an updated title search.</p>
