<p>Generally, primary claimants must claim PPL before they return to work. This is due to the backdating rules for the PPL period.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> different backdating rules apply for customers that meet the extended work test. These customers can&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
claim PPL after they have returned to work, and </li>
		<li>
nominate a start date (NSD) before their return to work date</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Claim lodged within 28 days of the child’s birth or adoption</strong></p>

<p>If a customer that has returned to work before claiming PPL, lodges an effective claim <strong>within 28 days of the child’s birth or adoption</strong>, they will be eligible for the PPL period from the child’s date of birth/adoption until the day before the return to work date. If their child’s birth or adoption was <strong>on or after 1 July 2020,</strong> they will be eligible for Flexible PPL days.</p>

<p>They can also transfer their unused portion of the PPL period or their entire PPL period to another person. The other person must claim and be eligible for PPL as a secondary claimant. See <a href="../families/007-09020020-01.html">Eligibility for Parental Leave Pay (PPL) as a secondary or tertiary claimant</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Claim lodged more than 28 days after the child’s birth or adoption</strong></p>

<p>If a customer that has returned to work before claiming PPL lodges an effective claim <strong>more than 28 days after the child’s birth or adoption</strong>, they will not be eligible for the PPL period. As they are not eligible for the PPL period, they cannot transfer it to another person.</p>

<p>If their child’s birth or adoption was on <strong>or after 1 July 2020</strong>, they will be eligible for Flexible PPL days.</p>

<p>To be eligible for the maximum PPL period, a primary claimant must not return to work from the date their child was born or adopted until the end of the PPL period.</p>

<p>If a customer returns to work before the end of their PPL period&#58;</p>

<p>In most cases, PPL cannot be paid on days when the customer is working. Customers should claim PPL before they have returned to work. It can be paid on days when the customer is on paid or unpaid leave. Customers cannot receive JobKeeper Payment and PPL at the same time.</p>

<p>However, a customer can receive JobKeeper Payment after the birth of a child (or recently adopted child) and before their Nominated Start Date (NSD), only where they have not returned to work.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> customers who received the COVID-19 Disaster Payment in the period between the birth of the child and starting PPL are <strong>not</strong> considered to have returned to work, as they have not performed paid work.</p>

<p>For the purposes of PPL a customer is working on a day if they perform paid work <strong>except </strong>where the work is for a permissible purpose or an allowable exception reason, including those who have relinquished the child as part of an adoption or surrogacy arrangement.</p>

<p>A return to work can be notified up to 30 days in advance by the customer or their employer.</p>

<p>Return to work rules were updated to include an additional exception for health professionals, emergency services or essential workers who have returned to work on or after 12 March 2020 in response to a state, territory or national emergency (including COVID-19).</p>

<p>Customers who return to work can continue to receive PPL if they&#58;</p>

are a health professional, emergency services worker or an essential worker, <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
returned to work during a declared state, territory or national emergency, <strong>and</strong></li>

what date they returned to work, to ensure it was during the emergency period</li>
		<li>
are they a health professional, emergency services or essential worker</li>
		<li>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the customer was scheduled to return to work at that time anyway, they do not meet the exception. Only customers who have returned to work <strong>in response</strong> to an emergency are covered by this exception.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> it is not a requirement that customers provide evidence to support their return to work reason.

<p><strong>Customer advises they have or will perform work, or is advising that they will perform work on a claimed Flexible PPL day</strong></p>

<p>Customers cannot work on days that they want to access Flexible PPL. Exceptions apply for work performed for an allowable exception reason or a permissible purpose, including Keeping in Touch (KIT) days.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Keeping In Touch (KIT) days are considered as working for a permissible purpose and can be accessed on a connected or scheduled Flexible PPL day provided the customer has not returned to work. Once they have returned to work they can no longer access KIT, even if all 10 days were not accessed.</p>

<p>If the customer has claimed Flexible PPL on a date and they are advising that they worked or are now intending to work on that date, and the work was not performed for a permissible purpose or allowable exception reason, it must be rejected or withdrawn. Days that are rejected or withdrawn&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
return to the customer’s balance of unclaimed Flexible PPL days, and</li>
		<li>
can be claimed for another date within 2 years of the child’s birth or adoption</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer has already been paid Flexible PPL for this date, they may have been overpaid.</p>

<p>To reject or withdraw a Flexible PPL day, see <a href="../families/007-20030334-01.html">Claiming and managing Flexible PPL days</a>.</p>
