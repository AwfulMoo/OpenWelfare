<p><strong>Question&#58; When an application for assessment is made with us and the initial contact with the liable parent is made later, can that parent's estimate be backdated to the date of lodgement of the application?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; No, an estimate can only commence on the day that the person makes the election or the start of a new financial year or a new child support period, whichever is the later. Where the estimate is lodged after 1 April an estimate for the next financial year may also be lodged. The estimate cannot be backdated to the date of lodgement of the initial application for assessment. If there are special circumstances in the case and the parent has been significantly disadvantaged, it may be appropriate to suggest a Change of Assessment.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; If an estimate is in place and the non-estimating customer advises that the estimating parents income circumstances have changed, can we do anything?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Yes. The estimating parent should be contacted to discuss their circumstances and lodging a subsequent estimate, if required. The estimate can be reviewed if the estimating parent doesn’t agree to lodge a subsequent estimate Refer to <a href="../separated-parents/277-07050000-01.html">Child support estimates review (post 1 July 2010)</a> for more information.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Can the customer ask that the estimate take effect from a future date?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Yes. Customers will be able to lodge a new estimate for the new financial year with an effective date of 1 July from 1 April or with an effective date of the first day of a new child support period.</p>

<p></p></td>

<p><strong>5</strong></p></td>

<p><strong>Question&#58; What should I do if a customer wishes to provide an estimate of zero income?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; A zero estimate can be accepted if the customer’s income for the financial year, or for the remaining period is nil. If a customer indicates they wish to lodge a zero estimate use questioning to ascertain that there is no source of income at all for the remainder of the financial year. An estimate can only be refused if you think the actual income is likely to be higher than the estimated income provided by the customer. If there are sufficient grounds to believe that the actual income will be higher than the estimated income you must refuse the estimate.</p>

<p>Even if a customer's income is zero at the time they make an estimate election this is not sufficient reason to accept a nil estimate. Further questioning is necessary to establish whether the customer expects to earn any income before the end of the financial year. For example, if a customer is no longer working but expects to receive a payment for the termination of their employment from their employer or a payment from their superannuation fund before the end of the financial year a nil estimate would not be accurate.</p>

<p>It is important to pay particular attention to customers who work on a contract basis for less than 12 months a year. For example, a contract teacher may have a contract ceasing in November but re-negotiates their contract in February the following year. During the intervening period, that person may state that they have no income however in the remainder of the financial year they will generally earn income.</p>

<p>An example of where an estimate of zero may be reasonable is where a customer is being fully supported by their spouse and expects this arrangement to continue until the end of the financial year. In this situation if it can be established that the customer will have no other source of taxable income, the estimate should be accepted.</p>

<p>We can accept a zero estimate if a customer becomes unemployed but is unsure if they will be eligible for unemployment benefits. Pend the estimate to allow the customer time to confirm their benefit position with the Centrelink Master Program. Where the customer is not eligible for benefits and has no other income a zero estimate would be appropriate. Make the customer aware that they must advise us if their income changes, including if they become eligible for unemployment benefits.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Can an estimate be backdated to start on a date prior to notification?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; There is no provision for estimates to be backdated in the legislation. New estimates are prospective and only take effect from the date of the election. This will be the date of the phone call or the date the form is received for further information,  see <a href="../separated-parents/277-07040020-01.html">Take a child support estimate (post 1 July 2010)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Can a parent amend an estimate once the financial year has ended?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Yes, a parent can lodge a subsequent estimate after the year of income has ended providing the estimate hasn't already been reconciled and the new estimate election is more than the previous estimate election.</p>

<p><strong>Part year estimate - assumes the estimate is accurate and there is no reason not to accept the estimate</strong></p>

<p>Last Relevant Year of Income (LRYI) used for customer is $74,000 (taxable income with no other components).</p>

<p>Amended taxable income issued (pre 23 May 2018) by Australian Taxation Office (ATO) for that LYRI of $80,000. The system correctly treats this as ‘For information only’ and has not used it in the assessment.</p>

<p>On 20 February 2017, the customer calls Child Support to make an estimate election of $63,614 annualised income for the estimate period 20 February 2017 to 30 June 2017, calculated as&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
$1220 per week/7 = $174.2857 per day </li>
		<li>
expected for the 131 days from 20/02/2017 to 30/06/2017 = total estimated income $22831.43</li>
		<li>
annualised income of $63,614 (365 x ($22831.43 total income /131 days) = $63614.29), rounded to $63,614 </li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> where a customer has an ATO amended income, we must apply the 85% validity rule against the amended ATI of $80,000 - whether it has been used in the assessment or not. </p>

<p>The estimate ($63,614) is compared to the amended ATI ($80,000), that is a 20% drop, the estimate is valid and can be accepted.</p>

<p>Cuba incorrectly compares the $63,614 estimate with the $74,000 original ATI, with a result of only 14.03% reduction, treating the estimate as invalid.</p>

<p>To correctly apply the estimate to the assessment, Manual intervention is required, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-07040020-01.html">Take a Child Support estimate (post 1 July 2010)</a>. Document the action taken in a Cuba notepad.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1 notepad&#58;</strong></p>

<p>On 20/02/17, the customer contacted CSA and made their estimate of $63,614 annualised income for the estimate period 20/02/17 – 30/06/17, calculated as&#58; </p>

<p>$1220 per week/7 = $174.2857 per day </p>

<p>expected for the 131 days from 20/2/17 to 30/6/17</p>

<p>= total estimated income $22831.43, and annualised income of $63,614 <br>(365 x ($22831.43 total income /131 days) = $63614.29, rounded to $63,614 annualised income)</p>

<p>This estimate ($63,614) must be compared to the amended ATI ($80,000), that is a 20% drop (meaning the estimate is valid and could be accepted.)</p>

<p>But Cuba incorrectly compares the $63,614 estimate with the $74,000 original ATI, with a result of only 14.03% reduction, so it would treat the estimate as not being valid.</p>

<p>To properly accept and apply the estimate to the assessment Manual intervention has been used.</p>

<p>Note&#58; The YTD amount for the period 01/07/16 – 19/02/17 is calculated in the same way as normal.</p>

<p>The amount recorded for the 20/2/17 – 30/6/17 estimate has been adjusted to $62,498 annualised income (i.e. just an amount low enough to clearly pass 85% validity test when compared with the original ATI of $74,000).</p>

<p>This has been recorded as a once off lump sum of $22,431, (with description ‘Manual calc lump sum – no residual’), giving total estimated income for the 131 day period 20/2/17 – 30/6/17 of $22831.00 and annualised income of $62,498. (365 x ($22431.00 total income /131 days) = 365 x $171.2290 = $62498.58, rounded to $62498 annualised income).</p>

<p>This $62,498 estimate does not reflect the real estimate made by the customer of $63,614 annualised income. The $62,498 is a Manual estimate used only as a step needed to enable the real estimate to be accepted by the system and applied to the assessment.</p>

<p>Using that Manual estimate income amount of $62,498, the assessment for the period 20/2/17 – 30/6/17 was varied to $X pa. (This is not the correct annual rate payable for the real estimate of $63,614, but this assessment was only an interim step).</p>

<p>A Client amended estimate using the real estimate annualised amount of $63,614 has been added as a subsequent estimate for the period 21/2/17 – 30/6/17, recorded as&#58;</p>

<p>$1220 per week/7 = $174.2857 per day </p>

<p>expected for the 130 days from 21/2/17 to 30/6/17 = total estimated income $22657.14, and annualised income of $63,614 </p>

<p>(365 x ($22657.14 total income /130 days) = $63614.28, rounded to $63,614 annualised income </p>

<p>When the system applied this real estimated income amount for the period 21/2/17 – 30/6/17 the correct annual rate payable by the customer based on their real estimate of $63,614 was calculated as $Y pa.</p>

<p>The assessment for the 1 day period 20/2/17 – 20/2/17 was then adjusted to reflect the correct $Y annual rate for the real estimate of $63,614 (by a manual rate set to $Y pa).</p>

<p>The result is the assessment rate actually used in the assessments for the periods from 20/2/17 – 20/2/17, and 21/2/17 – 30/6/17 both reflect the real estimate amount made by the customer of $63,614.</p>

<p>This result has been checked by an SSO and is correct.</p>

<p>Manual letters have been sent to both the estimating customer and the non estimating customer that correctly describe the real estimate amount made by the customer of $63,614 for the estimate period 20/2/17 – 30/6/17.</p>

<p>This method only requires a Manual rate for the 1<sup>st</sup> day of the estimate period, and the customer can go on to lodge further subsequent estimates in the future if required (if their circumstances change). </p>

<p>However, the existence of the 1 day Manual period will prevent any eventual automatic estimate reconciliation, so after the financial year is finished, the case will eventually need to be manually checked as to whether an estimate reconciliation is or is not needed.</p>

<p>To properly accept and apply the estimate to the assessment we had to use a Manual intervention.</p>

<p>The amount recorded for the 1/7/17 – 30/6/18 estimate has been adjusted to $62,500 (i.e. just an amount low enough to clearly pass the 85% validity test when compared with the original ATI of $74,000). </p>
