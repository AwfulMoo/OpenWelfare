<P><STRONG>Discuss referral to Employment Services</STRONG></P>
<P>If the customer is on a payment which requires participation and has a permanent work capacity which is more than 15 hours per week, discuss <A href="../job-seekers/001-02330010-01.html">Employment Services referrals</A> and requirements for their current income support payment.</P>
<P><STRONG>Referral</STRONG></P>
<P>Offer referral to suitable employment services for support in retraining and building their work capacity. This is particularly important if the claim is rejected because the customer has not actively participated in a <A href="../people-with-disability/008-03090010-01.html">Program of Support (POS)</A>:</P>
<UL>
<LI>focus on connection to the service recommended by the Assessor, such as <A href="../people-with-disability/008-04030110-01.html">Disability Employment Services (DES)</A>. Take into account the customer's participation requirements.</LI>
<LI>for example, if the customer has a <A href="../job-seekers/001-09070180-01.html">Partial Capacity to Work (PCW) or Temporary Reduced Work Capacity (TRWC)</A> of less than 15 hours per week, they are not required to participate in employment services but should still be strongly encouraged to participate on a voluntary basis</LI>
<LI>tell the customer their participation and periods of exemption or non participation in recommended employment services may affect the outcome of any future claims for DSP (this advice must be recorded as an annotation of the <STRONG>Rejection DOC</STRONG>). Do not tell the customer a future DSP claim will be automatically successful if they participate in a program. <STRONG>Note</STRONG>: provision of this information is especially important if the claim is being rejected because the customer has not actively participated in a POS or due to an insufficient impairment rating that may change on appeal or in the future</LI>
<LI>if an <A href="../job-seekers/001-02330010-01.html">ESAt is required</A> as per recommendation by the <A href="../people-with-disability/008-20102224-01.html">Medical Assessment Team (MAT)</A> or DSP Rejection after a Disability Medical Assessment (DMA) </LI></UL>

<P><STRONG>Reviews and appeal</STRONG></P>
<P>Before discussing review and appeal options, check the customer understands that the decision was made taking into account all the available information:</P>
<UL>
<LI>If the customer is not satisfied with the SOI explanation of the claim decision, advise them of the <A href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/109-03000000-01.html">review and appeal</A> rights, including:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>they can apply for a formal review at any time</LI>
<LI>it is important to apply for a formal review within 13 weeks of being notified about the decision.

<UL>

<LI>Check if the customer will be providing more evidence (including medical evidence) not previously provided. If they are, encourage them to lodge it as soon as possible (preferably within 7 days). Advise that further assessments may be required depending on the new evidence</LI></UL>
