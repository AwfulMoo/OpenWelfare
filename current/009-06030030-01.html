<UL>
<LI>can participate in these activities and still qualify for CA if they provide at least some additional care and attention to the care receiver every day </LI>

<LI>are still required to report their and/or their partner’s employment income if they and/or their partner receive an income support payment</LI></UL>
<P>CA is not taxable or assets tested, but is subject to an adjusted taxable <STRONG>income test</STRONG>. The income test applies to both levels of entitlement, CA payment level and CA Health Care Card only for a child care receiver.</P>

<P>Notification reporters can update their employment and caring activity details using the <A href="../self-service/133-04180000-01.html">Report employment income</A> service. However, where activity hours change from week to week or the carer exceeds the 25 hour rule, they will be advised to contact Services Australia and will not be able to finish their update.</P>

<P>Carers can use the <A href="../self-service/133-04090000-01.html" target=_blank>Manage income and assets online service</A> to notify their self-employment income and hours. However, they need to contact directly to advise their hours for CP purposes.</P>
<P>Carers and their partners can also <A href="../self-service/133-04160020-01.html">report using phone self-service</A>. However, if the carer’s activity hours exceed 25 hours per week, the caller is:</P>

<LI>the total number of hours the carer participates in their activities each week, away from their care receiver, and</LI>
<LI>if they exceed 25 hours per week, whether this is temporary or ongoing</LI></UL>
<P>Consider <STRONG>both</STRONG> aspects to determine if the carer may use their available Temporary Cessation of Care (TCC) days to remain qualified.</P>
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> the hours the carer spends away from their care receiver to participate in these activities counts towards the 25 hours. These are recorded as ‘Care Not Met’. </P>
<P>Cancel CP from the date they exceed 25 hours per week (as recorded on the Carer Payment Activity Summary (<STRONG>CPAS</STRONG>)<STRONG>/</STRONG> Carer Payment Activity Details (<STRONG>CPAD</STRONG>) screen) if:</P>
<UL>

<P>Carers who <STRONG>expect to exceed 25 hours per week</STRONG> on:</P>
<UL>
<LI>an<STRONG> ongoing </STRONG>basis must have their CP cancelled as they cannot utilise the TCC provision to remain qualified. See <A href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07020000-01.html">Working Credit</A> for the effect of a Working Credit balance greater than zero</LI>
