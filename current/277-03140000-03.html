<P>A customer or a third party may advise of a terminating event verbally, electronically or in writing. The following terminating events will cause a case to end:</P>
<UL>
<LI>A child is deceased, see <A href="../separated-parents/277-01120030-01.html">Deceased Child Support child</A></LI>
<LI>A child marries or becomes a member of a couple</LI>
<LI>A child is adopted</LI>
<LI>A child turns 18 (or if the assessment has been extended beyond age 18 to the end of a school year, when the school year or the child’s studies finish)</LI>
<LI>The payee or payer is deceased, see <A href="../separated-parents/277-01120000-01.html">Deceased Child Support customer management</A></LI>
<LI>Both parents of a child cease to be eligible carers and there are no non-parent carers entitled to be paid child support in relation to the child. See <A href="../separated-parents/277-03040000-01.html">Change in child support care levels (post 1 July 2010)</A> for examples of a change in care that could be classed as a terminating event</LI>
<LI>All persons who were eligible carers of the child cease to be eligible carers and a parent who would have becomes an eligible carer does not because Child Support was not advised of the change in care within 26 weeks</LI>
<LI>A child becomes covered by child welfare law in SA or WA</LI>
<LI>A child is not present in Australia, is not an Australian citizen and is not ordinarily a resident of Australia and the payee is not a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction</LI>
<LI>A child’s parents become members of the same couple for a period of 6 months or more</LI>
<LI>A carer entitled to receive child support makes an election to end an assessment for the child from a specified day</LI>
<LI>A party to a child support agreement that initiated the child support case under section 93 makes an election in a day that their agreement is suspended, to end an assessment for the child from a specific day</LI>
<LI>An agreement accepted between the carer and the liable parent, in relation to the child, that the liability to pay child support would cease on a specified day</LI>
<LI>A payer ceases to be a resident of Australia (and is not subject to an international maintenance arrangement)</LI>
<LI>An international maintenance arrangement applies, the payer ceases to be a resident of any reciprocating jurisdiction and does not become a resident of Australia</LI>

<P>If there is an application for a COA in progress, explain the following to the customer:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The terminating event may affect whether the COA application can still proceed</LI>
<LI>The COA Decision Maker (DM) will be made aware of this possible terminating event</LI>
<LI>After a decision is made on whether a terminating event has occurred, the COA DM may need to discuss any effect this has on the COA application</LI></UL>
<P>Manage customer expectations around timeframe for any call back from the COA DM. This is due to the DM not being able to determine whether the COA application will proceed until the terminating event decision has been finalised. As an indication, use the response timeframe of 7 days for a Contracted DM and 2 days for an Internal DM.</P>
<P>Raise a <STRONG>COA Call Back Required</STRONG> intray (2 days) and route as appropriate to the COA team. The intray alerts the COA DM that a possible terminating event has been notified and a terminating event decision is being considered. <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> this intray must be sent regardless of whether the possible terminating event was notified before or after the COA application was made.</P>

<P>Check the case for any issues that are not finalised, e.g. Non Agency Payments (NAPS), estimates and agreements and then process accordingly. If any of the assessments are based either on a provisional income or an estimate of income, update the provisional incomes and review any estimates of income where possible.</P>
<P>Advise the customer that regardless of the fact that the case is ending, the provisional income will be replaced when a taxable income becomes available or Child Support may review/reconcile an estimate. This may result in arrears or an overpayment. See <A href="../separated-parents/277-07010000-01.html">Income Processing for Child Support customers</A>.</P>
<P>Note: estimates are automatically reconciled when customer’s income tax assessment is issued for the relevant year. Encourage customers to lodge tax returns on time each year because it means that their estimates will be reconciled promptly.</P>
