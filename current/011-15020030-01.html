<p>Services Australia recovers payments made by the Commonwealth of Australia on behalf of an injured person for professional services and care costs provided in the course of treatment of, or as a result of a compensable injury or illness through the operation of the Medicare Compensation Recovery Program.</p>

<p>The term 'care costs' includes all payments covered by division 2 of the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995 - nursing home benefit, residential care subsidy and home care subsidy.</p>

<p><strong>A person without a Medicare card is still liable to repay related care costs</strong>. The <a href="../your-health/011-15020030-04.html">References</a> page contains a link to legislation.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>When a <a href="../your-health/011-15030060-01.html">statement by claimant</a> is returned, it includes a declaration under the Criminal Code Act 1995 on which the injured person states the information provided on the attached Medicare history statement is correct. It also states&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
whether or not they have entered a care facility, or </li>
		<li>
received home care services in relation to the compensable injury</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> in cases where a statement by claimant is not returned, no care costs checks are completed and all services in a Medicare history statement would be taken as related to the compensable injury or illness. If care costs were previously identified they will be brought forward to the new notice of past benefits or notice of charge where all services would be taken as related to the case.</p>

<p><strong>Automatic system-generated care costs check request</strong></p>

<p>When 'Yes' is answered to the nursing home question while processing a <a href="../your-health/011-15030060-01.html">statement by claimant</a> in the Compensation Case Management System (CCMS), the system automatically&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
sends a letter requesting details of care costs to a nursing home mailbox for action, and </li>
		<li>
suspends the case for 14 days pending a response </li>
		</ul>
<p>The case will reactivate in the CCMS nursing home queue for action. Results of the check should have been scanned to the case by this time. If not, request an urgent manual care costs check request.</p>

<p><strong>Manual care costs check request</strong></p>

<p>When a new or updated care costs amount is needed urgently or when an automatic request was sent but no care costs check result information is available on CCMS, send a manual care costs check request.</p>

<p>A manual care costs check may be required when&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the case has settled <strong>and</strong> the end date of the care costs calculation is after the date of judgment or settlement. The authorised staff member will do a recalculation </li>
		<li>
there are special circumstances for the case, for example the case is about to settle and an urgent issue of the notice of past benefits has been requested</li>
		<li>
after settlement and the case is nearing the end of the 3 month period in which a notice of charge can be issued (nearing the s33D or s24(4) date)</li>
		<li>
there have been previous care costs included for a different case for the same compensable person</li>
		<li>
to follow up a previous care cost request that was not responded to</li>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_How_recoverable">How recoverable care costs are checked and calculated</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Details of care costs amounts that have been paid by the Commonwealth of Australia are obtained by APS6 Officers delegated under Instrument Number DHS-DEL-34 of 2015 to perform this function. Information is obtained from the following systems&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Aged Care Management Payment System (ACMPS)</li>
		<li>
Aged Care Staff Portal (ACSP), and</li>
		<li>
Client and Service Provider eAnalysis Reporting (CASPER)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Dates included in calculations</strong></p>

<p>Care costs are calculated from the date of injury or illness until the date of judgment or settlement. Where a judgment or settlement has not yet been made, the amount is calculated&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
up to the date the care costs check is performed </li>
		<li>
the date of discharge from the care facility or service, or </li>
		<li>
the date or date of death</li>
		</ul>
<p>Send a manual care costs check request for a recalculation in cases where&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
a care costs calculation has been completed, and </li>
		<li>
Services Australia is later notified that judgment or settlement occurred prior to the end date of the care costs calculation</li>
		</ul>
<p>For example, if a care costs check was completed on 1 March 2017 and the agency was notified compensation was fixed under a judgment or settlement on 15 February 2017, a recalculation is required as costs between 16 February 2017 and 1 March 2017 must not be recovered.</p>

<p><strong>Projected figures due to system delays</strong></p>

<p>Due to system delays in reporting benefits paid by the Commonwealth, figures for any unreported days will be projected based on the rates used in the most recent payments and then added to the amount for reported days. This will occur in the following situations&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a new request for care costs</li>
		<li>
the case has not yet settled</li>
		<li>
the person is still in care, and</li>
		<li>
the details in the systems are not up to today’s date (for example, today is 22 March 2016 but data is only recorded up to 29 February 2016)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Already in care before date of injury or illness</strong></p>

<p>Where a person was already in care just prior to the date of injury or illness and, continues in care as a result of the compensable injury or illness, only the increase in the level of care (if any) after the date of injury is recoverable. </p>

<p>Home care subsidy is only recoverable from 1 July 2015 onwards. If a home care subsidy was paid on behalf of a person prior to this date, those amounts are not recoverable.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A notice of past benefits will only include a total amount for care costs. </p>

<p>In some cases, especially those where the care costs amount is significantly large, the injured person, claimant’s authorised solicitor, compensation payer or the compensation payer’s solicitor may request a breakdown of a care costs amount. The request can be verbal or in writing. Record the request in a case note in the Compensation Case Management System (CCMS). Then request a breakdown of care costs can via the 'care costs check request' - email template.</p>

<p>The breakdown table is only sent to the person making the request, along with a copy of the notice of past benefits. If the request was made by the claimant’s solicitor for whom Services Australia does <strong>not</strong> hold a third party authority, the breakdown is only sent to the injured person.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>If the injured person, claimant’s authorised solicitor, compensation payer or compensation payer’s solicitor disputes a specific benefit or subsidy or the full amount included in a breakdown of the care costs, they can ask for a review of the notice of past benefits. <strong>The request must be received prior to the date compensation was fixed under a judgment or settlement</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> a request for review of the notice of past benefits must be sent to the Team Leader for escalation to Programme Management. <strong>A request for review of the notice of past benefits will not be considered unless it is supported in writing by the treating medical practitioner</strong>. It must specify&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
some or all of the care costs do not relate to the compensable injury or illness, or</li>
		<li>
the increase in the level of care was not related to the compensable injury or illness (where the person was already in care at the time of the injury or illness)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Programme Management will consider the evidence and advise of the decision through the same pathway. Programme Management may consult the Department of Health and Aged Care for complex cases.
