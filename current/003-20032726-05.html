<p>What is considered contact</p></td>
<td>

<p>'Contact' for claiming a Crisis Payment is considered to mean contact by any available channel by a person seeking help in the form of a social security payment or concession card.</p>

<p>For example, through online channels, at a service centre or by the phone.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; the person does not need to mention a specific payment/concession card or know what they are eligible for when they make contact, only that they need help.</p>

<p>For example, a customer calls their regular payment line and explains that they came into contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19. The person asks if there is any help that they might be eligible for.</p>

<p>See the National Health Emergency section in <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-22061604-01.html">Contact requirements for Crisis Payment (CrP)</a> for more details on how to calculate the contact and claiming period.</p></td>

<tr>

<a class="anchor" name="bp05_tbl_Contact_for_i_What_is_01"></a>
<p>What is not considered contact</p></td>
<td>

<p>Contact by a person by any available channel that deals exclusively with a payment/concession card the person already receives, is not considered to be ‘contact’ for claiming a Crisis Payment.</p>

<p>For example, a customer’s income reporting period happens to fall within 14 days of them going into self-isolation. The customer reports their income online. After 16 days, the customer calls their regular payment line to say they need to self-isolate and if there is any help available to them. Reporting income is not considered ‘contact’ for the purposes of claiming a Crisis Payment. The customer has missed the 14 day contact timeframe, and is not eligible for a Crisis Payment for the National Health Emergency.</p></td>

<p>Periods of <strong>quarantine</strong> differ by state and territory and if returning from overseas.</p>

<p>Periods of <strong>self-isolation</strong> do not have a specific required length of time. This is because there are different factors for each case. For example, needing to self-isolate until test results are received versus needing to self-isolate after being diagnosed with COVID-19.</p>

<p>Some people may need to quarantine/self-isolate on more than one occasion, even if they were in quarantine or self-isolation only recently.</p>

The care receiver is an elderly frail parent or grandparent</li>

He calls to seek help and lodges a claim for JobSeeker Payment, noting that he has less than $500 in his bank account.</p>

<p>The Service Officer asks Muhammed a few questions to see if he may also be eligible for CrP-NHE once his JobSeeker Payment claim is granted. Muhammed mentions that his partner is sick and is required to self-isolate while awaiting results of her COVID-19 test due to coming into close contact with a person with COVID-19. Muhammed is going to cook for her and make sure she takes her medication while she is in isolation, so he is granted CrP-NHE.</p></td>

<p><strong>Caring for children who cannot attend school</strong></p>

<p>The school that John’s children attend has been closed temporarily due to COVID-19. John gets Disability Support Pension and usually does a few hours a week at his casual job. However, John now needs to stay home to look after his children and asks if there is any help available, as he can no longer work.</p>

<p>John meets the financial hardship criteria but is not eligible for CrP-NHE. This is because John’s children do not need to self-isolate, even though they have been sent home from school.</p></td>

<p>Maria has two children aged 5 and 8, who returned from an overseas trip on 1 April 2020 and needed to self-isolate for 14 days. Maria had to leave her job to care for them while they were in self-isolation. After the 14 day quarantine period finished and the children had returned to school, Maria contacted Services Australia about getting a payment as she was no longer employed, and was granted JobSeeker Payment.</p>

<p>The Service Officer made some further queries about Maria’s situation to see if she was also eligible for CrP-NHE. However, as it had been more than 14 days since the start of the self-isolation period, Maria was not eligible.</p></td>

<p>Talla is a 14-year old student who gets ABSTUDY Living Allowance. She lives at home in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia with her father. She needs to travel from Kalgoorlie to Adelaide to continue her schooling. Because of Talla's age, her aunty travels with her to and from her school at the beginning and end of the school term.</p>

<p>Upon arrival in Adelaide, Talla and her aunty are told that the South Australian government needs them to self-isolate for 14 days and take a COVID-19 test. Talla's aunty calls Services Australia to see if she can get a CrP-NHE due to caring for Talla.</p>

<p>Talla's aunty does not meet the definition of a family member or member of a household who is providing care, but the Service Officer tells the aunty that she can get a CrP-NHE for herself. This is because she also needs to self-isolate and is getting Age Pension. The Service Officer also tells the aunty that Talla can get a CrP-NHE too, because she gets ABSTUDY Living Allowance and is self-isolating after having a COVID-19 test.</p></td>

Once they return to their home in Brisbane, they both need to self-isolate for 14 days and take a COVID-19 test due to a requirement made by the Queensland government.</p>

<p>Jonathan thinks he might be able to get 2 CrP-NHE payments because he gets JobSeeker Payment and is caring for Michael while he is in self-isolation, but is also in self-isolation himself.</p>

<p>Jonathan calls Services Australia and is told he is only eligible for one CrP-NHE, for himself. This is considered to be one event, not separate events.</p>

<p>A person who is in quarantine or isolation and caring for another person who is also in quarantine or isolation can only be paid one CrP-NHE for themselves. Michael can also get his own CrP-NHE payment, as he is also self-isolating after being tested for COVID-19.</p></td>

<p>Astrid was feeling unwell with a sore throat and cough. After calling her doctor, she was told to get a test for COVID-19 and self-isolate until she received the results, which she received 2 days later. As the result was negative, she went to work the following day. 3 days later, Astrid’s son Marcus was displaying symptoms of COVID-19. Astrid took Marcus to get tested and provided care to her son, who needed to self-isolate while they waited for the test results.</p>

<p>Astrid meets all of the criteria for CrP-NHE and lodges two claims within the required timeframe. As the claims are for 2 separate self-isolation events, both claims are granted.</p>

<p>Biswesh was contacted by the Department of Health and Aged Care, who informed him that he had been identified as coming in close contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19. He was instructed to take a COVID-19 test, self-isolate for 14 days, and monitor for any symptoms. The day after entering self-isolation, Biswesh claimed CrP-NHE and was granted soon after, as he was getting JobSeeker Payment and met all other criteria. Wondering if he could get more than 1 payment, Biswesh lodged another claim for CrP-NHE on the same day.</p>

<p>While processing the second claim, the Service Officer checked the <strong>CRISIS_PS</strong> screen and saw that a CrP-NHE had already been granted for the same quarantine or self-isolation event date. Because Biswesh claimed again for the same quarantine or self-isolation period, his second claim was rejected.</p></td>

<p>Whilst reviewing the claim details the Service Officer identifies that Monica declared in her online claim the date she started isolating was 30 June 2022.
