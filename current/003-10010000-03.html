If this is not available and the Service Officer is in doubt they are speaking with the customer, ask further questions.

The questions must be searching, but not so personal as to be intrusive. If appropriate, explain to the customer why they are being asked these questions</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer or nominee cannot confirm details and the Service Officer is not satisfied they are speaking with the customer, do not release any information.

<p>Assess each request on its merit. While the customer may be requesting the funds for a regular expense, they may need the funds now due to an exceptional and unforeseen circumstance.

<p>The Service Officer can make up to 2 outbound calls to a third party to verify the customer's circumstances.</p>

<p>Generally, the third party is a person independent of the customer (not a family member or friend) and who is a party in the situation.</p>

<p>For example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
for a medical condition/medication this may be a doctor, hospital or pharmacist, or </li>
		<li>
for housing issues a landlord, real estate agent or housing authority</li>
		</ul>
<p>If there is no person independent of the customer who can verify the circumstance, this may be an indicator that the customer has broader issues.</p>

<p>For example, if the customer has had to leave the house due to a family breakdown/separation, are they affected by family and domestic violence? In these cases, it would be appropriate to make referral to a social worker via a warm handoff to the Social Work Line.</p>

<p>If unable to contact a social worker, complete a <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-05050020-03.html">Fast Note</a>. Select <strong>Auto Text</strong>. Use <strong>Emergency &gt; Urgent Payment &gt; Referral to SWO due to UP assessment</strong>.</p>

<p>The urgent payment request will be denied if the third party cannot be contacted by phone, or the third party chooses not to disclose information to the Service Officer. The customer still has the option to provide documentary evidence supporting their circumstances.</p>

<p>Ask the customer if they give permission for the Service Officer to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
contact the third party by phone to verify the customer's circumstances</li>
		<li>
provide enough information to the third party to identify the customer, for example, the customer's name and date of birth</li>
		</ul>
<p>Does the customer give permission to contact the third party and disclose identification information?</p>

<p>If the customer has previously been denied an urgent payment for failing to meet the exceptional and unforeseen or extraordinary circumstances the Advance Payment cannot be issued as an urgent payment. </p>

severe financial hardship, and</li>
		<li>
exceptional and unforeseen or extraordinary circumstances, before the advance payment can be issued using urgent payment methods.</li>

<p>An urgent payment is not to be made for regular expenses if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the circumstances are not exceptional and/or could be foreseen (e.g. the customer has been evicted due to not paying their rent), or</li>
		<li>
the customer has solely contributed to the delay in payment</li>
		</ul>
<p>Assess each request on its merit. While the customer may be requesting the funds for a regular expense, they may need the funds now due to an exceptional and unforeseen circumstance. For example, a customer is requesting money for food. On investigation, the reason for their request is that their fridge broke down, all food is spoilt and they have used their available funds to repair/replace the fridge.</p>
