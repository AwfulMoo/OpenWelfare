	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A Job Plan is an Employment Pathway Plan or Individual Participation Plan for the purpose of social security law.</p>

<p>Job seekers with <a href="../job-seekers/001-09000000-01.html">mutual obligation requirements</a> must agree to a <a href="../job-seekers/001-09100000-01.html">Job Plan</a> to qualify for income support payments. A Job Plan records the activities the job seeker will do to meet their mutual obligation requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> From 4 December 2021, job seekers in the Online Employment Service (OES) who are subject to RapidConnect will be required to complete a career profile before they are presented with a job plan.</p>

<p>Job seekers are either Centrelink or Employment Services Provider managed. Generally, the organisation responsible for the ongoing management of the job seeker negotiates their Job Plan.</p>

<p>All job seekers with mutual obligation requirements must have a Job Plan negotiated within&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
4 business days of their first regular payment, or</li>
		<li>
within 14 days of a change of circumstance</li>
		</ul>
<p>To negotiate a Job Plan for a job seeker with mutual obligation requirements, they must have an active Job Seeker Identification Number (JSID) and 1 of the following registration types&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Fully Eligible Participant (FEP)</li>
		<li>
No Stream Services Referral Required (NSSRR)/No Remote Referral Required (NRRR) job seeker, or</li>
		<li>
Remote fully eligible</li>
		</ul>
<p>The Job Plan should be tailored to the job seeker's needs and requirements. Activities are recorded in the mutual obligation requirements section of the Job Plan. There must be at least 1 compulsory activity. The Job Plan must include all the activities the job seeker is doing to fully meet their requirements.</p>

<p>A compulsory Job Plan must be negotiated for job seekers with mutual obligation requirements except where the job seeker&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
has a current temporary exemption from their mutual obligation requirements</li>
		<li>
is not receiving a payment with mutual obligation requirements</li>

<p>Service Officers must identify where a provider managed job seeker should be Centrelink managed, for example where they are fully meeting their requirements through an activity or programme. The exception to this is job seekers participating in a Disability Employment Services (DES) program and doing paid work. <strong>See also&#58;</strong> <a href="../job-seekers/001-09070070-01.html">Paid work as an approved activity</a>.</p>

<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Options for negotiating Job Plans</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Job Plans may be negotiated by suitably skilled Service Officers either in person or over the phone where all necessary documentation and/or information is available. Job seekers must formally <a href="../job-seekers/001-09100010-05.html">agree with the Job Plan</a> either by signing a printed copy, or by using their <img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> online account (not including the Centrelink app) to provide agreement. Job Plans cannot be finalised by verbal agreement.</p>

<p>Some Centrelink managed job seekers signed up for Online Services who are fully meeting their mutual obligation requirements can have their Job Plan updated automatically when the activity end date is reached by completing an Online Task. These job seekers then use the 'View and Agree Job Plan' online service to approve their Job Plan.</p>

<p><img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> If the Job Plan is negotiated via phone, the job seeker should access their online account and finalise the plan while they are still on the phone. It will be available immediately. If the job seeker does not have an online account, mail them the Job Plan or they can go to a service centre to sign it. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> remote job seekers can post their signed Job Plans.</p>

<p>The job seeker does not need to agree to the Job Plan immediately but must agree to it within 28 days. The following timeframes apply&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
2 days - reminder message for job seeker with an online account</li>
		<li>
14 days - reminder letter</li>
		<li>
28 days - payments suspend</li>
		</ul>

<p>Services Australia is responsible for ensuring that Centrelink managed job seekers have <a href="../job-seekers/001-09070000-01.html">appropriate activities in their Job Plan</a>.</p>

<p>An appropriate Job Plan must be negotiated with a job seeker by the agency where&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
their Job Plan is no longer current, for example, a job-seeker with voluntary work as their approved activity commences part- time work</li>
		<li>
any activity in the Centrelink negotiated Job Plan has expired or is more than 12 months old</li>
		<li>
the job seeker is now Centrelink managed as they have commenced an activity which will fully meet their mutual obligation requirements</li>
		<li>
the job seeker is returning to an income support payment, even if the activities in their new Job Plan are the same as they had during a previous period of payment</li>
		</ul>
<p>Some job seekers will have their approved part-time work (PTW) or self-employment (SEL) activity auto-updated if they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
are a principal carer, and</li>
		<li>
are receiving JobSeeker Payment (JSP), Parenting Payment Single, or Youth Allowance (job seeker), and</li>
		<li>
have declared in their last 2 consecutive fortnights that they have worked at least 30 hours each fortnight and earned income equal to or above the national minimum wage</li>
		</ul>
<p>A new Job Plan must still be negotiated to include the new approved part-time work or self-employment activity. The Job Plan needs to reflect the new dates on the Activity and Exemption Summary (<strong>AEX</strong>) screen.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>The agency should only negotiate or update a Job Plan for a provider managed or Online Employment Services (OES) job seeker where there are valid reasons for doing so.</p>

<p>The Job Plan workflow will warn the Service Officer not to proceed without consulting the provider. The Service Officer will be required to select a reason from a drop down box to explain their reason for proceeding. If the intention is to make these job seekers Centrelink managed, this is the reason to be keyed in the workflow.</p>

<p>Apart from these valid reasons, the agency is not involved in making decisions about mutual obligation requirements for provider managed/OES job seekers. Service Officers should not offer an opinion on the appropriateness of activities in a provider managed/OES job seeker's Job Plan.</p>

<p>If a provider managed/OES job seeker enquires about the mutual obligation requirements contained in their Job Plan or they require a new Job Plan, refer them to their Employment Services Provider or the Digital Services Contact Centre for OES job seekers.</p>

<p>If a provider managed job seeker wishes to lodge a complaint regarding their provider or their mutual obligation requirements, refer the job seeker to the Department of Education, Skills and Employment.</p>

<p>At new claim, where a job seeker's circumstances, for example, partial capacity to work (PCW), or the activities they are already undertaking mean they can be Centrelink managed, Service Officers should negotiate Job Plans as part of the new claim finalisation process.</p>

<p>If a job seeker is proposing to do an activity that will fully meet their requirements, or they cannot yet provide the required verification at new claim, do the approval of their activity as soon as possible after grant. In the meantime, the job seeker must be referred to an Employment Services Provider and commence meeting the requirements of a provider negotiated Job Plan. The job seeker will be provider managed until Centrelink has the information and verification needed to approve an activity that is fully meeting requirements.</p>

<p>For job seekers without mutual obligation requirements, participating as volunteers in Employment Services, their provider will need them to enter into a Voluntary Job Plan to access their services.</p>

<p>They will not have any compulsory activities. However, Employment Services Providers can exit job seekers if they are not meeting the commitments in their Voluntary Job Plan or no longer wish to volunteer for Employment Services.</p>

<p>Services Australia Service Officers may negotiate Voluntary Job Plans for&#58;</p>

<p>Voluntary Job Plans have no limit on the number of voluntary activities that may be included. Compulsory activities must not be included in a Voluntary Job Plan.</p>
