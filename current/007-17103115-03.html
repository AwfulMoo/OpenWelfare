<p>This activity includes paid work as a self-employed person.</p>

<p>The number of hours declared can include reasonable travel from the child care service to the place of work and return.</p>

<p><strong>Casual and irregular work&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Customers (or partner) who work casual or irregular hours can estimate their hours of activity over a three month (6 CCS fortnights) period. The largest number of estimated hours worked in a fortnight should be used when reporting their activity details. Customers should update their hours of work as appropriate if their largest number of hours on a fortnight in the three month period changes. The <a href="../families/007-17103115-05.html">Resources</a> page has an example of estimating irregular work</li>
		<li>
Estimating hours does not apply to fly-in fly-out, seasonal, contract and shift workers with a consistent number of fortnightly hours as these are covered by other recognised activities</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Paid and unpaid parental leave&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
The period of leave will be recognised at the same level of activity as declared for paid work (or self-employment)</li>
		<li>
The work hours before taking leave must be at least 8 hours per fortnight</li>
		<li>
There is no limit to the period of unpaid parental leave, however&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the period of leave will be within the terms and conditions of their employment contract for individuals who are permanently employed</li>
			<li>
leave is only recognised for individuals who are self-employed if their business continues to operate and they intend resuming work in their business in the foreseeable future</li>
			<li>
leave is only recognised if the individual who works from contract to contract or casually for a regular employer (or an employment agency) intends to resume work after the period of leave</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Leave will <strong>not</strong> be recognised as unpaid parental leave if the person&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
has resigned or been made redundant from their employment</li>
			<li>
was self-employed and their business ceases to operate</li>
			<li>
has completed their employment contract with no understanding or arrangement with an employer they will return to work at a future date, or who have no intention to return to work (either for the same or a different employer) in the foreseeable future</li>
			<li>
has moved from employer to employer with no formal employment arrangement or contract (such that they could not be considered to be taking leave) and have withdrawn from the workforce for the birth of a child</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Paid and unpaid annual leave, sick leave, long service leave, carers leave and other paid leave&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
This refers to leave granted under the terms and conditions of a customer's (or partner's) employment</li>
		<li>
The period of leave will be recognised at the same level of activity as declared for paid work (or self-employment)</li>
		<li>
If the work hours prior to taking leave were less than 8 hours per fortnight, and the customer (or partner) is not combining it with any other activity/ies during the period of leave, then the period of annual, long service or sick leave does not meet the Activity Test. For example, if the customer was working 7.5 hours per fortnight, this would not meet the Activity Test</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Unpaid leave (except for unpaid parental leave) can only be used to meet the Activity Test for a continuous period of 6 months</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Leave taken by a self-employed customer (or partner)</li>
		<li>
Leave for self-employed customers (or partner) will be taken as paid work where the leave would be considered annual leave, long service leave, leave for illness or injury, carer's leave or parental leave if they were an employee</li>
		<li>
The period of leave will be recognised at the same level of activity as declared for their self-employment</li>
		<li>
A medical certificate of commonwealth statutory declaration may be required if subject to a compliance check</li>		</ul>

<p>This activity can be used if the voluntary work&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
could reasonably be expected to improve work skills or employment prospects, or</li>
		<li>
be for a charitable, welfare or community organisation, or</li>
		<li>
be for a school, preschool or centred based service if the work directly support the learning and development of children at that school, preschool or service</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the voluntary work is the <strong>only activity</strong> being undertaken, only the first 16 hours will count towards the Activity Test.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Prior to the 13 July 2020 some customers would have received more subsidised hours then they were entitled to. This occurred when the customer had '<strong>Other</strong>' activities recorded with <strong>Voluntary work</strong>. Their total <strong>voluntary work</strong> hours were included when calculating their total hours of subsidised care. There will be no recovery action of the extra hours the customer received.</p>

<p>Charitable, welfare or community organisation includes&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
A charity registered with the Australian Charities and Not-for profit Commission</li>
		<li>
Other registered voluntary organisation</li>
		<li>
Community organisations with a charitable purpose</li>
		<li>
Welfare or other community organisations such as churches, sporting clubs, schools or an emergency management body (such as the State Emergency Service)</li>
		<li>
Volunteering at a school, preschool or centre based service includes reading to children or supporting children in other learning activities. It <strong>does not</strong> include activities considered to be parental duties such as being on a school's parents and citizens committee</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> foster care and home schooling are <strong>not</strong> considered voluntary work for the purposes of the CCS Activity Test.</p>

<p>This activity recognises unpaid work experience or internship which will build experience in a particular occupation or industry, enabling a customer (or partner) to maintain or improve work skills or employment prospects, or both.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
There must be no employment relationship and it must not be undertaken as a requirement of a course of education or training</li>
		<li>
The customer (or partner) must not be doing 'productive' work - that is, it must not be work that would otherwise be done by a paid employee. This is to lessen the risk of employers exploiting unpaid work experience participants or interns to avoid paying someone to do the particular job. The main benefit should be a meaningful learning experience, training or skill development</li>
		<li>
There is no time limit on this activity as there are customers (or partners) who genuinely do work experience as part of a Commonwealth or State employment program</li>		</ul>

<p>To be considered a recognised activity, it must maintain or improve work skills or employment prospects or both.</p>

<p>When submitting a request for an activity to be considered, customers are to provide&#58;</p>

details of the activity being undertaken (this may include useful details/context to support their request)</li>
		<li>
start date (and end date if known)</li>
		<li>

a statement addressing how the activity would improve their work skills or employment prospects (or both). <strong>Note&#58;</strong> the free text information (if submitted online) or the verbal statement received from the customer can be used</li>
		<li>
evidence to support their application (if required). This can include documentation from a third party that shows the individual's participation in the activity and the dates the activity occurred. Acceptable evidence may include&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
documents relating to the organisers of the activity including official letterheads of organisations</li>
			<li>

a commonwealth statutory declaration may be accepted if no other document can be provided or if a third party is not involved</li>

<p>Families will have an Activity Test exemption giving them access to 36 hours of subsidised care if they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
are entitled to less than 36 hours of subsidised child care per fortnight, and</li>
		<li>
have a child attending an early educational program at a centre-based day care service (e.g. preschool or kindergarten) in the year that is 2 years before Grade 1 of school</li>
		</ul>
<p>For example, a child due to start primary school in February 2020 is considered a preschool aged child for 2019. The child will attend Grade 1 in 2021. The <a href="../families/007-17103115-05.html">Resources</a> page details the primary school levels for child care fee assistance.</p>

<p>To receive this exemption&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer must advise the date their child expects to start primary school (<a target="_blank" href="../families/007-17103110-03.html">how to record child education details</a>), <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
the session report lodged by the child care service must confirm the child's attendance at an approved program</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer advises their child's primary school start date and may be eligible for this exemption, to view details&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Select <strong>Child Care</strong></li>
		<li>
Under <strong>Entitlement</strong>, the hours display in the <strong>Pre-School Additional Hours</strong> column. The number of hours depends on the customer's current Activity Test result. For example if the result is 0 hours, <strong>36</strong> displays. If the result is 24 hours, <strong>12 </strong>displays</li>
		</ul>
<p>The additional pre-school hours will take effect in the calendar year before the date the child is due to start primary school. It starts on the first Monday of a CCS fortnight. It ends on the last CCS Sunday of the calendar year the exemption applies to.</p>

<p>For example, if the child is due to start primary school on 4 February 2020, the pre-school exemption will take effect from 14 January 2019 and end on 12 January 2020.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The exemption only applies for the child attending the preschool or kindergarten program, not other children in the customer's care</li>
		<li>
Only pre-school exemptions from 2020 apply to the calendar year before the date the child starts primary school. Pre-school exemptions before 2020 apply to the 12 months and one day period before the school start date</li>

<p>An exemption is automatically granted if the person is in receipt of Carer Payment (CP) or has had CP rejected or cancelled due to the income or asset test in the last 5 years.</p>

<p><strong>This exemption also applies to customers who do not qualify for CP because they, or the person they care for, do not meet the income or asset test</strong>. These customers have not had CP rejected or cancelled in the last 5 years but would otherwise be eligible for CP because they have met the constant care requirement.</p>

<p>For example, a customer getting an income support payment (other than CP) would not be eligible for this exemption. These customers would be expected to meet the income and asset test if assessed as eligible for CP.</p>

<p>Customers are considered to be providing <a href="../families/007-17103115-04.html#bp04_L2LL_Policy">constant care</a> if they personally provide care on a daily basis for a significant period during each day. The care may be active, supervisory or monitoring. They need to be providing at least the equivalent of a normal working day in personal care and be unable to engage in other recognised activities due to the full-time caring responsibility.</p>

<p>If unable to find details of CP rejection due to the income or assets test, and if concerned about whether the customer meets the criteria for this exemption, ask the customer to lodge evidence to support their request for an exemption.</p>

<p>Child Care Subsidy (CCS) customers did not need to pay child care fees from 6 April 2020 until 12 July 2020.</p>

<p>The Government announced no session fees will be charged to families between 6 April 2020 and 12 July 2020. Updates made to Activity Test Details (<strong>ATD</strong>) screen will have no effect on a customer’s Child Care Subsidy entitlement. This was because customers could access child care free of the activity test or means test during the Business Continuity Payment period.</p>

<p><strong>Did customers still need to update work test/activity hours?</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Customers did not need to update activity hours if they’re on leave or need to self-isolate</li>
		<li>
They did not need to update if their employer closed due to a public health advice or as a precautionary measure, and would return to that job when their employer reopens</li>
		<li>
If a customer advised additional activities, update the activity test accordingly</li>
		<li>
Remind customers to check their activity hours before CCS started again on 12 July 2020</li>
		</ul>
<p>If CCS customers contact regarding a change to activity hours for any reason not related to Coronavirus (COVID-19), update the activity test details as per normal procedures.</p>

<p><strong>Where activity has reduced or paused due to Coronavirus (COVID-19)&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
If CCS customers contact to advise their activity hours have reduced, there was no need for them to change their hours right then</li>
		<li>
If a CCS customer has irregular hours, they would normally estimate hours across 3 months. If activity hours have reduced, there is no need to change their activity hours</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Where work ceased and they advised they do not have a job to return to&#58;</strong></p>

<p>Update the ATD screen to reflect the activities the customer may now be undertaking</p>

<p><strong>Eased Activity test requirements from 13 July 2020 until 4 April 2021</strong></p>

<p>From 13 July 2020 until 4 April 2021 the CCS activity test requirements have been eased. This applies for families whose activity test hours have reduced due to COVID-19. Impacted families can get up to 100 hours per fortnight of subsidised care, where they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
had an activity test result of more than 0 before COVID-19 (around 1 March 2020 or before)</li>
