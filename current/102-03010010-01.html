<DIV class=block>
<P>When a customer moves into a declared Income Management area, they may be profiled or referred for Income Management if they meet the criteria for an Income Management measure available in that location.</P>
<P>The location criteria for Income Management eligibility is based on a customer's permanent residential address (that is, Home or Term address), therefore it is important to confirm the customer's move is permanent and not temporary to avoid them being incorrectly identified for Income Management.

<DIV class=block>
<P>Customers will be triggered onto the Cashless Debit Card (CDC) if their home or term address is in a <A href="../payment-delivery/103-03150000-01.html">CDC location and they meet the other CDC eligibility criteria</A>. If customers are only in the area temporarily (for example, they are travelling, attending a funeral or medical appointment), their address must be coded as <STRONG>Temporary</STRONG>, to avoid being triggered onto the CDC in error.</P>
<P>If a customer wishes to change and/or backdate their address details, evidence supporting the change may be required from the customer before ending participation on CDC is considered. This is to prevent customers from changing or backdating their address details to avoid participation in the CDC.</P>
<P>Updating or deleting home or term address details for the purposes of avoiding the CDC will not automatically end a customer's participation on the CDC. Address updates done incorrectly in an effort to avoid the CDC may result in placing the customer at risk of overpayment for additional payments such as Rent Assistance or Remote Area Allowance. Service Officers must not update addresses for the purposes of exiting a CDC participant without discussing with the CDC Processing Team initially.</P>

<UL>
<LI>The partner of a Services Australia customer advises a change of address for both themselves and their partner, and they have permission to enquire, the address may be changed. The identity of the person providing the update and marital circumstances must be verified prior to the change. Extra care must to be exercised in these cases and if not convinced of the accuracy, the address must not be changed before checking with the affected person</LI>
<LI>A customer is admitted to a nursing home and their partner or an authorised third party has advised the change of address into residential aged care. Once the information is clarified with the nursing home, the address may be changed, see <A href="../ongoing-contact/102-03010090-01.html">Change of address to an aged care home</A></LI></UL>
