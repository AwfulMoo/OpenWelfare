<p>If a new calculation sheet needs to be created for a reassessment, <strong>Copy</strong> and <strong>Paste</strong> the previous calculation from the <strong>.XLSX</strong> file uploaded on the customer record into the new calculation sheet. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> the original calculation sheet does not need to be deleted, as this is a new decision from the reassessment.</p>

		</ul>
<p>All EAT and Net to Gross calculation sheets must be saved as an .XLSX file for them to be uploaded to the customer record. </p>

<p>To save the EAT or Net to Gross sheet as an .XLSX file&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The CO must save the file to their H&#58; Drive as an ‘Excel workbook’ rather than an ‘Excel Macro-Enabled Workbook’. To do this, select&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
File</li>
			<li>
Save As</li>
			<li>
Browse to find the H&#58; Drive</li>
			<li>
Change the Save as type to Excel workbook to save the file as an .XLSX file</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>The sheets must then be uploaded to the customer’s record using the Upload Document function on the <strong>Customer First Tools</strong> screen. See <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-10010140-01.html">Attaching electronic documents to a Centrelink customer's record using Document Tools in Customer First</a>.</p>

<p>All calculation sheets must be uploaded using the reason code <strong>DBTCAL</strong>.</p>

<p>For multiple match employers, save each calculation with the Customer Reference Number (CRN) and employer number as outlined in the examples below&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>EAT</strong> sheet for&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
1st employer save as - 123456789A01</li>
			<li>
2nd employer save as - 123456789A02</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Net to Gross</strong> sheet for&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
1st employer save as - 123456789A01_N2G</li>
			<li>
2nd employer save as - 123456789A02_N2G</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>If there are <strong>multiple Net to Gross</strong> sheets needed for one employer, separate calculation sheets will need to be created for each financial year. Save each <strong>Net to Gross</strong> sheet for the same employer as shown below&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
1st sheet save as - 123456789A01_N2G_FY2016-17</li>
		<li>
2nd sheet save as - 123456789A01_N2G_FY2017-18</li>
		</ul>
<p>After all calculation sheets have been uploaded, <strong>delete</strong> the saved files from their H&#58;drive.</p>

<p>If a decision is returned in Quality On Line (QOL), a request must be made to remove the calculation sheet from the customer record. The <a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-19061825-05.html">Resources</a> page has a link to the ECRM Image Deletion Request form. This will make sure, only the correct calculation sheet is attached to the customer record.</p>

Can a reassessment be made using the Benefit Action (<strong>BA</strong>) screen?
