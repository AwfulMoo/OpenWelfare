An Integrated Care Service Officer will manage customers who disagree about their care or who are advising of disputed care.

<p>Review the child’s current care records to establish whether the care is based on a written care arrangement, as this will determine what evidence needs to be obtained and the type of decision that needs to be considered. If care is based on a care arrangement but is recorded as ‘actual’, care must be re-keyed to reflect the correct type of care arrangement. </p>

<p>Disputed care should not be confused with disagreements about care. </p>

<p>For the purposes of FTB and Child Support, a dispute in relation to the care of a child exists when a written care arrangement applies in relation to a child/ren and care is not in accordance with the written arrangement.</p>

<p>A care arrangement will be considered to apply if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
it is followed by the parents immediately prior to the change in care, or</li>
		<li>
the change in care occurs before the care provided for under the care arrangement could be established</li>
		</ul>
<p>In these cases, there is no disagreement about how much care is actually being provided for the child.</p>

<p>Care will be regarded as being disputed if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a care arrangement applies in relation to a child/ren, and</li>
		<li>
no previous interim care determination has been made regarding this care arrangement, for a care event on or after 23 May 2018, and</li>
		<li>
the customer with less care as allocated in the care arrangement is taking reasonable action to regain the care, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-03060050-03.html#bp03_tbl_Contact_custome_Step05">Step 5 in the Contact customer and investigate care </a>table </li>
		</ul>
<p>Disagreements about care occur where the customers disagree on the details of the care change. The percentage of care in such cases is generally determined on the basis of actual care provided see <a href="../separated-parents/277-03060050-03.html#bp03_tbl_Contact_custome_Step01">Step 1 in the Contact customer and Investigate care table</a>.</p>

<p>If care is not disputed or disagreed, make an actual care determination. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-03060060-01.html">Integrated Care - Making care determination</a>.</p>

<p>If at any stage of the decision-making process the carers disagree about the facts, go to <a href="../separated-parents/277-03060050-03.html#bp03_tbl_Contact_custome_Step01">Step 1 in the Contact customer and investigate care</a> table.</p>

<p>Ascertain details of any reasonable action taken by the person with reduced care. Explain disputed care and interim periods to them and discuss the decision-making process.</p>

<p>See the <a href="../separated-parents/277-03060050-04.html#bp04_L2GT_Policy">References</a> page for a link to the Child Support Guide 2.2.4&#58; Disputed Care Arrangements.</p>

<p>Examples of reasonable action for the person with reduced care include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
initiating or participating in court action for contravention of a court order</li>
		<li>
obtaining or seeking legal advice regarding the making of a court order</li>
		<li>
initiating mediation, through a Family Relationship Centre or other service, to re-establish the care arrangement</li>
		<li>
negotiating with the other parent with a view to re-establishing the care arrangement</li>
		</ul>
<p>The person with reduced care is not required to provide evidence they are taking reasonable action unless that fact is disputed by the other carer. If the other carer disputes that reasonable action is being taken, go to <a href="../separated-parents/277-03060050-03.html#bp03_tbl_Contact_custome_Step03">Step 3 in the Contact customer and Investigate care</a> table.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> where the customer was not aware of reasonable action requirements and available options, this action should be taken within a specified timeframe after being advised of this process. The person with reduced care must continue taking reasonable action for the interim period to continue to apply. If reasonable action ceases, the interim period will end on that date and the care percentages will be based on the care that is actually occurring from the day after reasonable action ceases.</p>

<div class="showcont">


<p>For care periods commencing on or after 1 July 2012 (22 November 2012 for WA ex-nuptial cases), a decision can be made to apply actual care immediately where special circumstances make an interim period inappropriate, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-03180000-01.html">WA ex-nuptial cases</a>. </p>

<p>Examine the circumstances which led to the change in care including whether the behaviour and/or actions of the parent who has less care was a cause for the change in care. These circumstances should be a significant cause for the change in care. They may include unusual or unreasonable actions and behaviour of the parent with reduced care, however they can also arise due to factors beyond the parent's direct control. In determining whether a person’s behaviour or actions have been unusual or unreasonable, consider the impact of the person’s behaviour or actions on the child or the person with increased care, and if the child or the person with increased care was placed in a situation where there was substantial risk to their physical, emotional or physiological well-being.</p>

<p>Examples of where a parent is withholding care due to a substantial risk to the wellbeing of the child include the person with reduced care&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
withholding essential medical care from the child</li>
		<li>
substantially failing to comply with legal schooling requirements</li>
		<li>
neglecting the child’s basic needs</li>
		</ul>
<p>This list is not exhaustive. Special circumstances will vary with each case. Situations that may occur in the ordinary course of events will not be considered to be special. For example, changing preferences of the parents or child in relation to care will not constitute special circumstances. </p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if it is identified that a customer may have experienced, or be at risk of, family and domestic violence, see <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-15000000-01.html">Family and domestic violence</a>.</p>

<p>Eligible cases <strong>must</strong> be referred to an Actual Care in Special Circumstances (ACSC) Officer for managing and making care determinations to apply actual care in special circumstances.</p>

<p>A person's percentage of care is generally determined according to the actual care that they have of the child. However, where care is disputed, a person's percentage of care may be determined according to a care arrangement (written agreement, parenting plan or court order) for an interim period, rather than being based on actual care. The parent with reduced care must take reasonable action to have the care arrangement complied with in order for the care percentages to be based on the care arrangement for the interim period. </p>

<p>Interim care decisions require two care percentage determinations, one based on the actual care and the other based on the care set out in the care arrangement, which applies for an interim period.</p>

<p>The length of the interim period will depend on&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the type of care arrangement (court order, parenting plan or written care agreement)</li>
		<li>
the age of the care arrangement when care changed, and </li>
		<li>
in some cases, whether the person with more actual care than set out in the written care arrangement takes reasonable action to participate in an <strong>a</strong>pproved Family Dispute Resolution process </li>
		</ul>

<p>If the length of the interim period could be affected by the person with increased care taking reasonable action, ascertain the details of reasonable action taken by the person with increased care. Explain disputed care and interim periods to them and discuss the decision-making process.</p>

<p>The person with increased care is not required to provide evidence they are taking reasonable action unless that fact is disputed by the other carer. If the other carer disputes that reasonable action is being taken, go to <a href="../separated-parents/277-03060050-03.html#bp03_tbl_Contact_custome_Step04">Step 4 in the Contact customer and Investigate care table</a>.</p>

<p>See the <a href="../separated-parents/277-03060000-04.html">References</a> page for a link to the Child Support Guide 2.2.4&#58; Disputed Care Arrangements.</p>

<p>The person with increased care should be asked to provide the date of the change of care and the date they commenced taking reasonable action. If there is a gap of more than two weeks between these dates, the person with increased care should be asked to provide information on the reason for the delay in taking reasonable action so a determination can be made as to whether or not they have taken reasonable action within a ‘reasonable period’.</p>

<p>A ‘reasonable period’ will generally be within around two weeks of the change in care but it may be longer, depending on individual circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the person with increased care must continue taking reasonable action to receive the benefit of a reduced interim period. If they cease taking reasonable action to participate in Family Dispute Resolution the interim period will be extended until the end of the maximum interim period or, if the interim period has already ended, the interim period will be reinstated until the end of the maximum interim period.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> contact with <a href="../separated-parents/277-01090000-01.html">incarcerated customers</a> is by phone appointment only. Contact the Incarcerated Customer team to arrange an appointment using the Incarcerated Customer Appointment Email template located on the <a href="../separated-parents/277-03060050-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Template">Resources</a> page.</p>

<p>Contact each customer and explain the disputed care determination will be based on information and evidence that establishes care-related facts to support&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the care that is most likely to be occurring (including care other than nights), see <a target="_blank" href="https&#58;//guides.dss.gov.au/child-support-guide/2/2/1">the Child Support Guide 2.2.1&#58; Basics of care</a></li>
		<li>
whether the established pattern of care has changed or not, see <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-03060050-05.html#bp05020004_3">Resources page, Example 3</a> for more information</li>
		<li>
that the new pattern of care is likely to continue into the future (and is not a one-off minor change such as occasionally missing a weekend of care due to work or illness). See <a target="_blank" href="https&#58;//guides.dss.gov.au/child-support-guide/2/2/1">the Child Support Guide 2.2.1&#58; Basics of care</a></li>
		<li>
for disputed care, evidence of reasonable action being taken, including the date it commenced/ended</li>
		</ul>
<p>Provide the customer with options to provide supporting documentation. The fastest way to do this is via myGov/Child Support online services. The webmaster email address can be offered if they are not eligible for online services to enable customers to supply information quickly. Customers <strong>must</strong> be advised that the webmaster email address is not a secure method of communication.</p>

<p>Advise both customers the care decision is a Services Australia decision about the amount of care used in the customer’s child support and/or FTB assessment. The agency does not determine where the child should live or any custody arrangements. The agency reflects the percentage of care of the child that each parent actually has, or where a written arrangement applies and the person with reduced care is taking reasonable action to have the arrangement enforced, the percentage of care established by a written care arrangement for an interim period.</p>

<p>The circumstances around care changes can be distressing, especially where the care is disputed or not occurring in line with a written care arrangement. Be considerate and sensitive to the customer’s experience when discussing and explaining care changes.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; if one of the customers cannot be contacted by phone to discuss the disagreed or disputed care and/or request evidence, follow the steps outlined in <a href="../separated-parents/277-03060040-03.html#bp03_tbl_Contact_custome_Step05">Step 5 of the Integrated care - Gathering additional information and evidence, Contact customer</a> table and return to this process.</p>

<p>A care terminating event will occur for a child if the agency is notified of a care change more than 26 weeks after the date of event and as a result of the care change&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
all eligible carers cease to be eligible carers for the child, i.e. their care reduces below 35%; and</li>
		<li>
a person who wasn’t an eligible carer would become an eligible carer for the child except for the date of effect rules effective from 1 July 2018</li>
		</ul>
<p>If a parent/carer’s assessment is likely to end due to a care terminating event ask them if they would like to apply today for a new child support assessment, to be used in case their care change causes their assessment for a child/ren to end. Advise the parent/carer that if they do not make an application today and their care change causes their assessment to end, the assessment can only be restarted from the day we receive an application for assessment. </p>

<p>If the parent/carer does wish to make an application for a child support assessment, document their response clearly in the same notepad/Pluto process that records the care notification. The restart cannot be processed until the care determination is finalised.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> a phone call will often be required to the relevant authorities in order to obtain the required information in these situations. The Service Officer should seek support from their aligned Service Support Officer (SSO) if they are unsure what to discuss. Do not accept evidence directly from children. Where a parent provides written evidence from the child, do not consider the information and advise the parent/customer we will not be considering this for evidence purposes.</p>

<p>Where there has been a change of care prior to the interim period resuming, a review should be set on the interim care record that matures the day after the end of the interim period. A review is needed because the legislation requires a new determination of care to be made after the end of the interim period. Although Cuba may already have the correct care percentage recorded, a new care determination must be made so a care decision letter with objection rights can be issued to customers.</p>
