<p>Consider third party collection if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer has a child support debt or overpayment debt. For enforcement action on an overpayment, see <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-04120000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Negotiate_debt_Step12">Debt repayment</a> </li>
		<li>
there is an identified source of funds</li>
		<li>
deductions from the customer’s salary is not an appropriate form of collection. For example, where the Employer Servicesteam has refused a link referral </li>
		<li>
deductions from Centrelink payments are not available or are insufficient to satisfy the debt</li>
		<li>
contact has been made/attempted with the customer to discuss voluntary <a href="../separated-parents/277-04120000-01.html">debt repayment</a> of the ongoing child support and debt </li>
		<li>
the customer does not agree to voluntarily and/or satisfactorily meet their child support obligations, and&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
has been advised of the consequences of non-payment that is, enforcement action, or</li>
			<li>
payment and consequences of non-payment have not been discussed but the <strong>circumstances are urgent</strong> or delay will put collection at jeopardy. A Service Support Officer (SSO) or Team Leader must approve these enforcement actions. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-09140000-01.html">Technical support in Child Support</a></li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> garnishee from other sources can occur even if employer withholding (EW) and employer withholding arrears (EWA) is in place. Investigate each case to decide if additional third party collection is appropriate. </p>

<p><strong>Do not issue</strong> s72A notices to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) specific bank accounts to collect NDIS payments made directly to NDIS participants or their nominee. These payments are not a financial resource that is available to meet a debt</li>
		<li>
a bank account to recover debt where a known <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-18050700-01.html">National Redress Scheme</a> payment has been made. These amounts are inalienable and remain protected once paid into a bank account. For more information, see National Intensive Collection Services (ICS) </li>

<p>In some circumstances, it is not possible to issue an s72A notice or it is precluded by law. </p>

<p>To decide the appropriateness of issuing a notice, the <a href="../separated-parents/277-04100000-04.html">References</a> page contains a link to the Child Support Guide 5.2.9&#58; Collection from third parties.</p>

<p>If an opportunity to garnishee for a lump sum is identified instead of periodic amounts, see <a target="_blank" href="../utils/CustomerReferralGuidelines/Customer-Referral-Guidelines.html?lump-sum-opportunity.html">Customer referral guidelines for Child Support staff</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Consider collection from these sources&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
New Enterprise Incentive Scheme (NEIS)&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
The New Enterprise Incentive Scheme (NEIS) is a Department of Education, Skills and Employment (DESE) program. The program is for unemployed people who wish to start their own independent business</li>
			<li>
NEIS income may be identified through an ATO system search or s120 response from a financial institution</li>
			<li>
An s72A notice may be issued to the bank account to which NEIS payments are made provided the account belongs to the customer</li>
			<li>
<strong>Do not issue</strong> s72A notices to DESE if NEIS payments are the only source of funds received by the customer. DESE will not comply with s72A notices in this circumstance</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Unrestricted Non-Preserved Superannuation (UNPS)</strong>&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
<strong>Do not issue</strong> a new garnishee notice under section 72A to collect UNPS unless the customer has elected to cash these amounts</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) loans and grants</strong>&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
These payments are financial support issued to vulnerable Australians who are currently overseas and have been unable to return to Australia, either because they cannot afford flights or flights are not available. <strong>Do not issue</strong> a garnishee notice to an account holding a DFAT loan or grant</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> banks may charge their customers a fee when they comply with an s72A notice. If a bank imposes a fee and the customer is dissatisfied they must speak with their bank. </p>

<p>Services Australia has no control over the imposition of bank fees. If customers wish to avoid these fees, they have the option of making voluntary payments.</p>

<p>Before referring a submission to National ICS ensure no outstanding decisions or other avenues of collection exist.</p>

<p>Is an s72A notice an appropriate option?</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>, check the debt is correct, <a href="../separated-parents/277-04100000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Collection_thro_Step08">go to Step 8</a></li>

<p>The <a href="../separated-parents/277-04100000-04.html">References</a> page contains a link to the Child Support Guide 5.2.7&#58; Collection from veterans’ pensions and allowances.</p>

<p>Ensure the debt is correct (based on all available information) </p>

<p>Before issuing an s72AC notice, contact the customer. Ask them to enter a sustainable arrangement to address both ongoing and overdue child support.</p>

<p>Issue an s72AC notice if&#58;</p>

		<li>
the customer requests that deductions start </li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> <strong>do not</strong> deduct from customer’s DVA pension or benefit if already deducting from their Centrelink benefit for ongoing or overdue child support. If the deduction from Centrelink stops, start collecting from the customer’s DVA pension or benefit.</p>

<p>See <a href="../separated-parents/277-01010000-01.html">Contact with Child Support customers</a>.</p>

<p>An s72AC notice can only reflect a periodic amount. The periodic amount requested will be determined by&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the type and amount of DVA pension or benefit the customer is receiving</li>
		<li>
the number of the customer’s collect cases, and</li>
		<li>
the amount of overdue child support and/or overpayment</li>
		</ul>

<p>Lump sum notices are appropriate when the source of funds is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
greater than $100. Unless the case has ended or has a low liability and arrears have accrued over a substantial period of time</li>
		<li>
available once only, for example, proceeds from a sale of a house, compensation payout, and</li>
		<li>
likely to become unavailable in the future. For example, funds in a bank account</li>
		</ul>
<p>All Service Officers manage simple lump sum opportunities, such as garnishee of bank accounts.</p>

<p>Other complex/urgent lump sum opportunities requiring ongoing management may be managed by the Lump Sum Team within Intensive Collection Services. </p>

<p>If an opportunity to garnishee for a lump sum is identified, see the <a target="_blank" href="../utils/CustomerReferralGuidelines/Customer-Referral-Guidelines.html?lump-sum-opportunity.html">Lump sum opportunity in the Customer Referral Guidelines</a>.</p>

<p>Before referring a complex lump sum opportunity&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
make at least 1 phone contact attempt to all available numbers</li>
		<li>
have a s120 response that identifies a lump sum opportunity no older than 4 weeks</li>
		<li>
issue a CAL with specific action pre-approved text - <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-30010400-03.html#bp03_tbl_CAL_text_option01_2">Collection/enforcement action</a> - see <a href="../separated-parents/277-01010000-01.html">Contact with Child Support customers</a> for surface mail or online delivery response timeframes</li>

<p>If a complex lump sum referral does not meet the criteria, email National ICS for escalation.</p>

<p>An s72A notice may be issued for less than the amount of the outstanding debt. This may be appropriate when issuing a lump sum notice to a financial institution and&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer's bank account balance is less than the total debt or</li>
		<li>
where Child Support is aware that withdrawals such as mortgage payments will occur</li>
		</ul>
<p>An s120 notice can be used to establish these details.</p>

<p>Once an amount is applied to another party's entitlement, <strong>it cannot be refunded.</strong> </p>
		<ul>		<li>
for payments of child support, this amount is visible on the Payee Account Summary window</li>
		<li>
for overpayment of child support, this amount is visible in the Payer Account Summary window</li>
		</ul>
<p>Consider issuing the notice for less than the account balance. This gives the customer sufficient funds to meet their immediate essential living expenses. Before making a decision on the amount to leave in the bank account, take into consideration&#58; the customer’s&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
living expenses, and </li>
		<li>
expected regular payments </li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Unclaimed funds</strong>&#58;</p>

<p>S72A notices sent to financial institutions specifically to garnishee ‘unclaimed funds’ can only be issued for amount of the ‘unclaimed funds’ identified in the s120 response. Do not issue the s72A for the customer’s full debt amount.</p>

<p>Seek help from a SSO or Team Leader.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> s72A notices sent to financial institutions for money held for a customer must be issued for a <strong>lump sum</strong> amount only.</p>
