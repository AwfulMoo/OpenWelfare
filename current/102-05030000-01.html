If the customer is with another person, or on speaker phone, or already identified with family and domestic violence concerns, continue with the current business conversation. Otherwise, go to the <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-15000000-01.html">family and domestic violence procedure</a> to conduct the risk identification and referral process.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Purpose_of_LA_q">Purpose of LA question set</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The LA question set identifies if there is a payment correctness <strong>risk</strong> of a customer being paid the single rate of payment when they may be in a member of a couple relationship (partnered) which they haven’t advised Services Australia about.</p>

<p>A customer’s responses to the LA question set will determine if they need to give more details about their living arrangements via the relevant Relationship Details form (SS284 or SS293) to have a formal member of a couple assessment done.</p>

<p>The LA question set applies to customers who have a non-partnered relationship status and are sharing accommodation with another person who is not an immediate family member and who is 16 years or older, when they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
claim an income support payment, or</li>
		<li>
advise of a change of accommodation details (in person, via phone or online), or</li>
		<li>
living arrangements need review</li>
		</ul>
<p>Generally, both the customer and their sharer will need to each complete and return the required form.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>There are specific procedures for a customer who is experiencing <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-15000000-01.html">family and domestic violence</a>. Under <strong>no</strong> circumstances should contact be made with the alleged user of violence (generally the other person who is the sharer/ex-partner). The matter must be <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-07030010-01.html">referred to a social worker</a> to assess appropriate supports and help that may be needed. See <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-15000000-01.html">Family and domestic violence</a> for more information.</p>

<p>A safety concern question is included in the LA question set which identifies if a customer is concerned about their safety, if forms are issued to the person with whom they are sharing accommodation (for example, may be experiencing family and domestic violence). If the customer identifies safety concerns, the system will <strong>only</strong> issue the Relationship Details (SS284 or SS293) form to the customer and <strong>not</strong> to the sharer.</p>

<p><strong>Sharer Details page</strong></p>

<p>The Sharer Details page is presented before the LA question set if a non-partnered customer advises of a change of accommodation circumstances and does not have a <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-18092640-01.html">Sharer Status that is considered exempt</a>.</p>

<p>The Sharer Details page allows staff to differentiate between newly added, provisionally added and confirmed sharer details&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
New (NEW) displays next to added sharer details when the Service Officer has not yet selected <strong>Continue</strong></li>
		<li>
Provisional (PVL) displays next to added sharer details when the Service Officer has selected <strong>Continue</strong> and then gone back to the Sharer Details page to make updates</li>
		<li>
Confirmed (CNF) displays next to sharer details that are currently stored on the customer's record</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> change of address details for dates in the future cannot be coded for sharers. Tell these customers to re-contact once they have physically moved address.</p>

<p><strong>Sharer details not provided</strong></p>

<p>When completing the sharer details within the LA question set, the customer may be unable to or refuse to provide details of the people they are sharing with.</p>

<p>When the customer is unable or refuses to provide sharer details during the LA sharer questions workflow, tell the customer they must provide these details within 14 days.</p>

<p>Sharer details are needed to allow the agency to assess the customer's circumstances and deliver the correct rate of payment. The customer must respond within 14 days or their payment may be suspended.</p>

<p><strong>Boyfriends, girlfriends and non-binary relationships</strong></p>

<p>A customer is not immediately deemed to be a member of a couple if they advise they have a boyfriend, girlfriend or non-binary relationship. It depends on&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the individual circumstances of each case, and</li>
		<li>
their responses to the LA question set</li>

<p>Customers may need to give more details about their living arrangements via the relevant Relationship Details form (SS284) to have a formal <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07120010-01.html">member of a couple assessment</a> done.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The LA questions are related to <strong>4</strong> of the 5 factors that must be considered when making a decision as to whether a customer is a member of a couple&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
financial aspects of the relationship</li>
		<li>
social aspects of the relationship</li>
		<li>
nature of the household</li>
		<li>
nature of the commitment</li>
		</ul>
<p>When undertaking a Member of a Couple (MoC) assessment, information relating to all 5 factors is considered, although not all factors need to be present for a decision to be made that a person is a member of a couple.</p>

<p>The fifth factor that the LA question set does not ask is the presence or absence of a sexual relationship. The related Relationship Details form covers this additional factor when responses to the LA question set triggers the need for the completion of the form.</p>

<p>The agency does not make a determination as to whether the customer is in a relationship based on the responses of the LA questions alone. The responses will only establish whether further information (that is, issue of Relationship Details forms (SS284 or SS293) is needed from the customer and the sharer.</p>

<p>Once the Relationship Details forms (SS284 or SS293) are returned, Service Officers must conduct a series of checks to ensure there have been no change in circumstances and <a target="_blank" href="../initial-contact-general/106-19071608-03.html">confirm whether a Member of a Couple (MoC) assessment is required</a>.</p>

<p>Based on the customer's responses to the LA questions, the system may generate an automated recommendation to send to the customer and their sharer(s) either a&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Relationship Details (SS284) form, or</li>
		<li>
Relationship Details - Separated under One Roof (SS293) form</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a customer advises they have a boyfriend, girlfriend or non-binary relationship, do <strong>not</strong> issue a Partner details (MOD P) form in place of a relationship details form. Do not assess a customer as a member of a couple simply because they have a boyfriend/girlfriend/non-binary relationship. If recommended, the relevant Relationship Details form (SS284) will trigger a formal <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07120010-01.html">member of a couple assessment</a> to be done.</p>

<p>A recommendation to issue the SS284 will occur if the customer provides a '<strong>Yes</strong>' response to the following questions&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Do you share the parenting/guardianship of any children with any of these people?</li>
		<li>
Has the customer ever had joint financial commitments (for example joint bank accounts, mortgage or other loans) with this person/any of these people?</li>
		<li>
When the customer participates in activities jointly with this person/any of these people, are they considered to be a couple?</li>
		</ul>
<p>A recommendation to issue the SS293 will occur if the customer provides a '<strong>Yes</strong>' response to the question&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Have you previously lived together as a couple (for example married, partnered, de facto or in a registered relationship) with any of these people?</li>
		</ul>
<p>The issue of an SS293 form overrides the issue of any SS284 form in the event a customer responds with '<strong>Yes</strong>' to more than one question, that is, only one type of form is issued, not both.</p>

<p>The system <strong>will not</strong> issue an SS284 or SS293 to the sharer(s) if safety concerns have been identified by the customer. <strong>Under no circumstances</strong> should an SS284 or SS293 be issued manually to the other person(s) or any contact be made with the other person(s) in this situation.</p>

<p>If the LA question set recommends the SS284 or SS293 be sent, this can be accepted or overridden based on additional information provided by the customer to a Service Officer. If it is clear from further discussions with the customer that there is no risk of an undisclosed relationship existing, the Service Officer must stop the forms being issued by overriding the system recommendation. For more information on when it may be appropriate to override the issue of the forms, see <a target="_blank" href="../initial-contact-general/106-19071608-01.html">Confirming the need for a Member of a Couple (MoC) assessment</a>.</p>

<p>If a Service Officer overrides the system recommendation to issue forms, they will need to enter notes to explain why.</p>

If safety concerns have been identified, the customer will be presented with only one link to the Relationship Details form and a link to the form relating to the sharer will not be presented. At no stage during the claim process should the sharer be contacted when safety concerns have been identified.</p>
