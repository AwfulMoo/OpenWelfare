<p>This document explains how Single Touch Payroll (STP) data is used by Services Australia. It explains how employment details and income components are received, displayed and calculated. </p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_What_is_Single_">What is Single Touch Payroll</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Single Touch Payroll (STP) is an Australian Government initiative where employers report payroll information via STP enabled software to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) each time employees are paid. This STP reported payroll information is known as a pay event and can occur weekly, fortnightly, monthly or other frequencies. </p>

<p>Payroll reporting of PayEvent 2020 data via STP-enabled software was mandatory from 1 January 2022. The ATO has, however, taken a flexible approach based on the readiness of the business and their software provider. This will mean that Services Australia will continue to see growth in the number of customers with STP data.</p>

<p>Not all payroll data reported to the ATO is required by Services Australia to administer the Social Security system. Services Australia accesses and prepares only the required data in near real time to pre-fill in customer and staff-facing tools. Pre-filling means customers do not have to provide information that is already known by the government and provides a simple, helpful, respectful and transparent experience.</p>

<p>Services Australia can access the STP data of customers who are a <a target="_blank" href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-20111656-01.html">mutual client</a> of the ATO and Services Australia. The data can include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>When an STP employer reports employment income data for a notification reporter, the system will automatically place the customer onto <a target="_blank" href="../self-service/133-04180000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Reporting_onlin_2">statement reporting</a>. This can be viewed on the Reporting Regime Summary (<strong>RPRS</strong>) screen, where the reason will show as STP.</p>

<p>If the customer confirms cessation of work with an STP employer, and is in receipt of a payment with no mutual obligation requirements, they will be taken off statement reporting 28 days after their cessation date, unless the customer and/or partner has other employment income.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a customer contacts after being placed on reporting and advises they do not work, Service Officers are not to take them off reporting without discussing the STP employer details available. This can be done by running the Earnings and Reporting workflow in Process Direct if it is their reporting day, or the standalone STP Employer Update workflow.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Reviewing_and_c">Reviewing and confirming STP data</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>STP data is presented to customers when they report through their Centrelink online account, Express Plus Centrelink mobile app or though Interactive Voice Response (IVR). When claiming certain income support payments and benefits, STP data will present through their Centrelink online account or via an Assisted Customer Claim (ACC).</p>

<p>Service Officers can access STP data when using the following in Process Direct&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Earnings and Reporting workflow</li>
		<li>
STP Employer Update workflow</li>
		<li>
STP Interventions workflow </li>
		<li>
manual navigation to the STP Employer Update (<strong>EMCF</strong>) or STP Employer Wage Items (<strong>EMGI</strong>) screens (view only)</li>
		</ul>
<p>When STP data is available at the time a customer is reporting or claiming certain income support payments and benefits, the employer’s name and ABN/WPN will present for the customer to review and either confirm or reject that they are working for the STP employer.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
When <strong>confirmed</strong>, the customer can merge the STP employer with an existing employer where it matches on the record, to avoid any duplication of employers </li>
			<ul>			<li>
The customer only needs to confirm each STP employer once </li>		</ul>
		<li>
If <strong>rejected</strong>, the STP employer details are added to <strong>EMCF</strong> with a status of ‘Rejected’</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Do not take the customer off reporting</li>
			<li>
If STP data is available when next reporting, the STP employer name and ABN/WPN will present again for the customer to review</li>
			<li>
If the customer rejects the employer a second time, an STP intervention activity will be created for follow up by compliance staff</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>Once a customer confirms an STP employer, each pay event that occurs in the customer’s entitlement period pre-fills when reporting, for the customer to check, confirm or change.  Where there are multiple STP employers, the STP income must be reviewed and accepted separately. </p>

<p>Once STP data is confirmed and accepted by the customer, it is automatically loaded onto the appropriate screens on the customer’s record. All employment income components that update to the Employment Income Paid Details (<strong>EAPP</strong>) screen will be under the one employer name with a frequency of LOP. See <a target="_blank" href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010010-01.html">Recording and correcting employment income details</a>.</p>

<p>If STP data has not pre-filled at the time of reporting, customers can manually add the pay components, by selecting ‘add pay event’. Manually added pay events on<strong> EMGI</strong> will update to <strong>EAPP</strong> with a verification code of ‘<strong>NVE</strong>’.</p>

<p>The <strong>EMGI</strong> screen displays <strong>Gross STP Income</strong> reported by the STP employer and <strong>Gross Income Reported</strong> by the customer. <strong>Income Variation</strong> will advise whether income has been varied downward, varied upward or not varied. </p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> remind the customer that if the information does not match their payslip details, the amounts can be adjusted. Service Officers who are using the Earnings and Reporting workflow in Process Direct can add notes about any variations made before finalising the activity. </p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>STP data that has been reviewed and confirmed by the customer will display on EAPP with a source code of STV and on the IMPS screen with a source code of STP. If any of these confirmed amounts need to be updated, evidence must be provided before corrections can be made by Service Officers. <strong>Do not manually make any updates directly on EAPP or IMPS.</strong> </p>

<p>Corrections to these confirmed amounts must be made using the Earnings and Reporting workflow in Process Direct, and selecting <strong>Yes</strong> to wanting to ‘update income for a past period’. After selecting the relevant periods from the Past Period Range, the <strong>EMGI</strong> screen appears. The pay events for each reporting period will display one at a time and once the corrections are made, will update the coding on <strong>EAPP</strong> or <strong>IMPS</strong>.</p>

<p>Note&#58; if the Earnings and Reporting workflow task in Process Direct is not selected, the edit option on EMGI will not be enabled so Service Officers will only be able to view the STP data.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Cessation_data">Cessation data</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>When a customer ceases work with an STP employer, cessation data will pre-fill and include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the date they stopped working </li>
		<li>
the reason they are no longer working</li>
		<li>
whether any unused leave and/or a redundancy payment has been paid </li>
		</ul>
<p>Customers will be asked to provide an explanation when&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they are subject to mutual obligation requirements during statement reporting or in a new claim</li>
		<li>
STP cessation data is pre-filled, and</li>
		<li>
the STP employer advises the cessation reason is dismissal or voluntary</li>
		</ul>
<p>An unemployment failure will automatically generate for PST-skilled Service Officers to investigate.</p>

<p>When leave and redundancy payments are reported with cessation data, the customer will be asked to provide the amount of days the leave covers or their average weekly wage, to determine the duration of any potential Income Maintenance Period (IMP). Service Officers must ensure that the leave period is reasonable.</p>

<p><strong>For example</strong>, for an unused leave payment of $900 (annual leave), 2 days would be considered unreasonable but 5 days would be reasonable.</p>

<p>The customer will not need to supply an Employment Separation Certificate (<strong>SU1</strong>) when there are no changes made to the cessation data. However, if there are changes to amounts paid or there is any doubt about the number of days of the leave or termination payments, an SU1 or letter from the employer will be required.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58; </strong>some employers may pay their employees <strong>Unused leave on Termination</strong> with no actual cessation date or reason being pre-filled. If this occurs, the customer will be asked if they are still working for that employer and may need to provide an <strong>SU1</strong> where they confirm they have ceased working. This may occur for the following scenarios&#58;</p>

<p><strong>Transition to Phase 2 PayEvent 2020</strong> <strong>(PE2020)</strong></p>

<p>In situations where an employment relationship terminates prior to the employer transitioning into PayEvent 2020, it is possible that after they transition to PayEvent 2020 the employer may still make a payment of unused leave to the individual. That may result in cessation date and reason being unavailable within the payroll system, as the timing of the termination was prior to transition, during phase 1. Unused leave and terminations payments will update to IMP. An SU1/letter from employer will be required for payments subject to mutual obligation requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Employment basis changes from permanent to casual</strong></p>

<p>Where an employee changes from a permanent employment basis (full time or part time) to casual. When paid, these entitlements are correctly classified in STP as unused leave on termination but because the individual remains a casual employee of the same employer the payment is assessed as a lump sum and coded on <strong>EAPP</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Reinstatement</strong></p>

<p>An employee may leave their employment, be paid their entitlements, and later be reinstated. Commonly, this can occur in wrongful termination situations and the effect of the reinstatement is that the cessation is taken to have never occurred. The instruction for employers is to remove the cessation date. However, the reinstatement does not change the fact a payment for unused leave was made, and so it must remain in the STP reporting. The STP reporting will, as a result, show amounts present as <strong>Unused Leave on Termination</strong> without a cessation date or reason. If the customer advises they are still working for that employer, the payment is assessed as a lump sum and coded on <strong>EAPP</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Pay_Per_Period_">Pay Per Period (PayPP) amounts</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Services Australia uses the STP data from Pay Events to calculate a Pay Per Period (PayPP) amount. This is done by comparing the gross YTD (Year to Date) figure of all income components from the previous Pay Event with that of the current Pay Event. The difference between these amounts will display as the PayPP amount. </p>

<p>When presented with pre-filled STP data, customers must review and either confirm or change the PayPP information before the system will code and apply the amounts. Confirmed PayPP amounts are used to calculate a customer’s entitlement.</p>

<p>For further information about the different types of income components refer to <a target="_blank" href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010000-01.html">Assessment of employment income for Centrelink payments</a>. </p>

<p>Income components that are assessable and included in the PayPP calculation are displayed to customers when they are reporting through their Centrelink online account or the Express Plus mobile app, and to Services Officers on the <strong>EMGI</strong> screen in Process Direct. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-22070738-05.html#bp05_L3TT_STP_Allowance_t">Resources</a> to view which allowances are assessable.</p>

<p>Customers who are paid worker’s compensation payments by an STP employer, will have these amounts pre-filled as <strong>Paid leave - worker’s compensation</strong>. </p>

<p>When compensation payments are reported through STP, the system will check the Compensation Management Summary (CMS) screen for a previous assessment by the Compensation Recovery Team (CRT). Where this has already been assessed and is coded on CMS, the amounts reported through STP will not be applied to the record, unless the amounts have changed.</p>

<p>Where there has not been a previous assessment of the worker’s compensation, the pre-filled <strong>Paid leave - worker’s compensation</strong> amount will automatically load onto the <strong>EAPP</strong> screen for at least 2 fortnights. <a href="../compensation/117-01040010-01.html">The customer will need to complete a MOD C - Compensation Details form</a>.

<p>A compliance team will manage interaction activities that trigger due to certain variations made by customers to their STP data. </p>

a customer has rejected the STP employer a second time</li>

a customer varies the STP reported employment income that is presented for the first time</li>

a customer varies the STP reported employment income downward by at least $299 across a 6 month period</li>
