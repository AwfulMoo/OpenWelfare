<LI><STRONG>Effect date</STRONG> is a mandatory field to record the date from which the medical information will take effect for the assessment. For a:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>new claim, the date of effect will be the date on which the medical condition commenced, but not before the introduction of the qualification. <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> if the child becomes qualified due to a change in qualification criteria, the payment cannot be backdated beyond the date of the new qualification criteria, unless the child qualifies with another recognised disability and/or has been assessed under the THP assessment with a qualifying score</LI>

<UL>
<LI>been keyed, this field defaults from the initial date of receipt keyed on the Carer Assessment (<STRONG>CDTC</STRONG>) screen</LI>
<LI>not been keyed, this field will be empty until the <STRONG>CDMD</STRONG> screen is redisplayed after updating</LI></UL>
<LI><STRONG>THP ID</STRONG> is a number allocated to the THP assessment once the <STRONG>CDMD</STRONG> screen is updated. It is display only</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Name of THP</STRONG> is the name of the THP who completed the assessment</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Provider number </STRONG>is optional to record the Medicare Provider Number. If the number is unknown, key '<STRONG>U</STRONG>' which will be expanded to 'Unknown' when the updated <STRONG>CDMD </STRONG>screen is redisplayed</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Qualifications </STRONG>requires a three character code for the qualifications of the THP who completed the assessment. When the updated <STRONG>CDMD</STRONG> screen is redisplayed, the code will be expanded. Use field help (<STRONG>?</STRONG>) for valid values</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Period of Cond</STRONG> field. <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> processing staff are expected to manually assess this as part of the claim process. See <A href="../carers/009-03040050-01.html">Coding a paper claim for Carer Allowance (CA) where the care receiver is under 16</A>. Use field help (<STRONG>?</STRONG>) for valid codes. <STRONG>Note: </STRONG>the SA427 - Carer Payment Medical Report including functional assessment (for a child under 16 years) does not ask if the condition is permanent or temporary for at least 12 months. If this form has been lodged, processing staff must consider the condition and previous medical reports (if any). If unsure, refer to the Carer Helpdesk.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Contact Number</STRONG> is mandatory for recording the phone number of the THP who completed the assessment. The first part is for the 2-digit area code. For mobile phone numbers, leave the area code blank. THP contact numbers starting with <STRONG>1300 or 1800</STRONG> cannot be recorded in Process Direct and must be recorded as follows:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>in Process Direct, record a temporary phone number (such as a fax number) for the THP</LI>
<LI>after finalising the claim, go to the <STRONG>CDMD</STRONG> screen in Customer First and update the correct phone number</LI></UL>
<LI><STRONG>Date signed</STRONG>. Key the date the THP signed the medical assessment. If not dated, use the date it was received. If signed more than 3 months before the claim was lodged and the Service Officer:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>determines it is an accurate reflection of the child's condition, record the date signed by the THP as the date the form was received. Clearly document this on the customer's record</LI>
<LI>determines it is not an accurate reflection of the child's condition, do not record the medical report and request a new medical report. Clearly document this on the customer's record</LI>
<LI>is unsure if it is an accurate reflection of the child's condition, refer the case to the Carer Helpdesk</LI></UL></UL>

The latest version is the DSM-5 (published 18 May 2013) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) now encompasses the previous DSM-IV autistic disorder (autism), Asperger's disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. The Department of Social Services (DSS) is currently considering the impact of DSM-5 on the conditions contained in the List of Recognised Disabilities (LoRD). The policy department has advised that while they consider the impact of the changes, the current process will not change. Autistic disorder and Asperger's disorder currently appear in the LoRD and medical conditions on Carer Allowance (CA) medical reports and are still to be processed as Recognised Disabilities. Further advice will be issued when a revision is made to the LoRD. See <A href="../carers/009-03040020-01.html">Assessing a recognised disability</A>.<BR>If the field is left blank and the condition is identified by the system as one which <STRONG>may</STRONG> be a recognised disability, a warning will be presented which states '### may be a recognised disability' (where ### is the medical condition coded).

<P>If the CLVL screen displays, a process called validation will need to occur.</P>
<P>For care receivers under 3 years of age, a workaround is required.</P>
<P>The DCLAD questions from 'Domain B - Behaviour 2' are questions 9 to 20 on the SA394 version of the CNA. These questions are <STRONG>not</STRONG> applicable to care receivers under 3 years of age.</P>
<P>If validation is triggered for a care receiver under 3 years of age, the following questions, from 'Domain B - Behaviour 2' will incorrectly display on the <STRONG>CLVL</STRONG> screen:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Q11 - The child wanders, escapes or runs away from home, school or community settings</LI>
<LI>Q13 - The child becomes physically aggressive and harms others by hitting, pushing, kicking, biting or throwing objects</LI>
<LI>Q18 - The child behaves in ways that result in injury to himself/herself. This may include head-banging, hand-biting or other self-harming behaviours</LI></UL>
<P>If validation is triggered for a care receiver under 3 years of age, record '<STRONG>A</STRONG>' in the <STRONG>CNA</STRONG> field against the above questions.</P>
<P>Document the validation entries made to one or all of these questions and record that they are a workaround to address incorrect functionality of the validation process.</P>
<P>This means there are discrepancies between the responses provided in the THP and CNA, and a validation is required. Fields on this screen not requiring validation will be protected. Fields requiring validation will be unprotected and will display the THP and CNA responses that need to be checked:</P>
<UL>
<LI>key '<STRONG>?</STRONG>' in the CNA or THP action field beside the validation question for help on what to do to validate the assessment. If necessary, this will involve contacting the carer and/or THP, and/or a second THP to check their responses</LI>
<LI>update each response via the <STRONG>CNA</STRONG> or <STRONG>THP</STRONG> fields on the <STRONG>CLVL</STRONG> screen. These updated responses will flow through to the appropriate CDAT screens without the user having to navigate away from <STRONG>CLVL</STRONG></LI>
<LI>once responses have been validated with the THP and/or Carer and updated in the CNA and/or THP fields, complete the <STRONG>Validated?</STRONG> field. Key '<STRONG>?</STRONG>' In this field for applicable codes</LI>
<LI>once the <STRONG>Validation</STRONG> screen is completed, press [<STRONG>Enter</STRONG>] to display the Child Disability Assessment Tool Summary (<STRONG>CDAS</STRONG>) screen. The <STRONG>CDAS</STRONG> screen will display the new scores attributed after validation</LI>
<LI>on the Care Receiver Assessment Results (<STRONG>CJAR</STRONG>) screen, view the assessment result</LI></UL>
<P>Validation occurs in certain circumstances clearly outlined in the Social Security Guide, 3.6.12.320, Validation of the Disability Care Load Assessment (Child) - CP (child). See the <A href="../carers/009-05010040-04.html#bp04_L2GT_Policy">References</A> page.</P></DIV>
