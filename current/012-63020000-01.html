		<ul>		<li>
the approved prescriber does not state the criteria that meets the restriction</li>
		<li>
the patient does not meet the criteria</li>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p><strong>Criteria for increased quantity and repeats</strong></p>

<p>When an approved prescriber requests an Authority for increased quantity and/or repeats and the drug is listed with restrictions, an appropriate restriction/indication must be provided.</p>

<p><strong>Criteria for Authority applications</strong></p>

<p>For online and phone applications, the approved prescriber is required to satisfy Services Australia that the patient meets the restriction criteria listed in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Schedule. See <a href="../health-professionals/012-60010010-01.html">The Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits (the PBS Schedule)</a>.</p>

<p>For phone applications, due to the sensitive nature of some diseases or conditions, the restriction criteria can be read to the approved prescriber who can then respond as to whether the patient's disease or condition conforms.</p>

<p>For written applications, the approved prescriber must write the indication for the disease, purpose or condition for which the benefit is required.</p>

<p><strong>Manner of administration</strong></p>

<p>An item may not be supplied as a pharmaceutical benefit if it is to be administered in any other way than indicated in the PBS Schedule (Refer S.85 and S.88). For example, injections can only be used for injection and not for inhalation.</p>

<p><strong>Gender reassignment</strong></p>

<p>Sex reassignment surgery and/or hormone therapy are not pre-requisites for the recognition of a change of gender in Australian Government records, however evidence is required to establish or change the sex and/or gender details in personal records. The <a href="../health-professionals/012-63020000-05.html">Resources</a> page contains link to the Gender Guidelines Implementation.</p>

<p>Refer to a Pharmaceutical Adviser if changes have not been recorded on the Medicare system.</p>

<p>Some pharmaceutical benefits cannot be approved for more than the PBS listed quantity and repeats regardless of dose. Where applicable, this is stipulated in the restriction and identified in the drug description on mainframe.</p>

<p>Exception for relevant opioid listings&#58;</p>

number of days therapy requested</li>
		<li>
for reconstituted oral liquid medication - the volume</li>

<p>All ingredients for extemporaneous items must be listed in the Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits under Extemporaneously-prepared pharmaceutical benefits - Drug Tariff.</p>

<p><strong>Points to consider</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
An ingredient listed in the Drug Tariff which has no requirement/qualification attached (for example, for use as a base) may be approved as a sole ingredient or part of a total extemporaneous formula</li>
		<li>
Ingredients listed in the Drug Tariff which have a requirement for 'use as additive only' must be used as an additive in the total formula for a PBS prescription. These cannot be approved as 'sole' or 'single' item, for example, olive oil ('use as additive only') cannot be approved solely as 'olive oil' - it must be used as an additive with other PBS listed ingredients</li>
		<li>
Ingredients listed in the Drug Tariff which have a requirement for 'use as a base combined with active ingredients' must only be used as the base in a PBS prescription. The approved prescriber must confirm the ingredient is to be used as the base before approval</li>
		<li>
The approved prescriber is to confirm the selection of the type of preparation they request. For example, cream, ointment or lotion</li>
		<li>
The use of a ready-prepared item with 1 or more extemporaneous drugs listed in the Schedule is not a pharmaceutical benefit</li>
		<li>
The approved prescriber may list ingredients by the commonly known name instead of the generic name appearing in the drug tariff. The <a href="../health-professionals/012-63020000-05.html">Resources</a> page contains a list of common names for items included in extemporaneously prepared pharmaceutical benefits</li>

<p>PBS prescriptions are required to be processed in accordance with relevant Commonwealth law. See <a href="../health-professionals/012-62030000-01.html">Claim Processing in the New Claim Processing System for Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS)</a>.</p>

<p>Each state or territory has its own legislation that determines how medical practitioners and authorised optometrists should prescribe certain drugs listed in the Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits.</p>

<p>Services Australia does <strong>not</strong> enforce state law but the Service Officer may be prompted to remind medical practitioners of their responsibility to comply with state laws.</p>

<p><strong>Informing medical practitioners and authorised optometrists</strong></p>

<p>When a medical practitioner or an authorised optometrist is seeking Authority approval under Commonwealth legislation from Services Australia for an item that also requires the practitioner to comply with State legislation, a statement in the Question field may be displayed on the Authority screen that <strong>must</strong> be acknowledged by the approved prescriber. This statement only displays for drugs that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) and Department of Health and Aged Care has found necessary to flag in the Schedule, and is not applicable for unrestricted dangerous drugs.</p>

<p>This statement informs the medical practitioner or authorised optometrist of their responsibility to comply with state legislation when prescribing drugs. The statement is&#58;</p>

<p>'Please note that this drug may be subject to specific state or territory legislation'.</p>

<p>The Service Officer does not need to record any comments made by the medical practitioner or authorised optometrist.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p><strong>Archiving Authority information</strong></p>

<p>Authority information is recorded daily and backed up.</p>

<p>Written Authority requests are scanned and recorded on the system and the Medicare/Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) copy of the prescription is destroyed by secure shredding as it is no longer archived.</p>

<p><strong>Removing old Authority information</strong></p>

<p>All Authority information contained in Services Australia systems is kept for 24 months. Due to the high volume of Authority applications stored, Authority information older than 24 months is removed to ensure that there is sufficient space for new Authority requests.</p>

<p>Authority information (excluding exemptions) more than 24 months old is permanently deleted on the 4th day of each month.</p>

<p><strong>Exemptions to Authority information removal</strong></p>

<p>Authority information for specific Authority items is kept for longer than 24 months. For example medicines for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. These exemptions are based on PBS restriction requirements.</p>
