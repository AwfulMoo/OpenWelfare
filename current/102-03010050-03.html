moved to an aged care service. For entry to an aged care home, check the customer’s or their partner’s RCA Institution Summary (<strong>RIS</strong>) screen for verification of entry.

The customer can qualify for the asset exemption if it is proven the rent goes directly to them. However, if the home is being rented by someone else (for example, a deceased estate) and the estate is passing the rent to the customer, then the asset exemption would not apply. A determination would need to be made about how to treat this income</li>

<p>Granny flats, retirement village units, sale leaseback arrangements and some Supported Residential Service are referred to as special residences.</p>

<p>The home ownership status of a customer or their partner residing in a special residence doesn’t depend on who holds title to the premises. It is based on the amount of entry contribution paid. If more than the extra allowable amount was paid for their interest in a special residence then they are assessed as homeowners.</p>

<p>For customers vacating a retirement village, ongoing home ownership status depends on whether or not their entry contribution is refunded to them. Contact the Level 2 Policy Helpdesk for assessment on a case by case basis.</p>

<p>For a <strong>partnered</strong> customer vacating a special residence the Social Security Act section 1153 - 1157 defines the home ownership status of each member of the couple. For assistance in interpreting the Act, contact the Level 2 Policy Helpdesk.</p>

<p>In general, when a customer leaves their principal home and enters a care situation the home is exempt from the assets test for 2 years from the date the customer entered care. Once the 2 year exemption period has ended, the customer will be considered a non-homeowner and the house will be assessed as an asset.</p>

<p>Further exemptions are available in situations where a customer who entered aged care prior to 1 January 2017 rents their former principal home and are paying their accommodation charge or lump sum accommodation payment periodically. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the customer entered aged care on or after 1 January 2017, any net rental income from their former principal home is assessed as ordinary income, which may affect the customer’s rate of income support payments. The <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-03010050-05.html">Resources</a> page contains scenarios on how to assess a customer’s assets.</p>

<p>Verification is required if the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
has entered an aged care home</li>
		<li>
is a single homeowner</li>
		<li>
is seeking an exemption based upon renting the former principal home and paying an accommodation charge (or a lump sum accommodation payment via periodic payments)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Request the customer to provide a copy of accommodation payment agreement and proof of rental income received from their principal home (this could include lease, rent receipt or statutory declaration).</p>

Staff may complete this step if they are trained." />Further information can be provided to the customer about these exemptions, but the property should not be coded until verification has been provided.</p>

<p>To assess if the customer is eligible to have their former principal home exempted from the income and assets test and any rental income received exempted from the income and assets test, ascertain what type of care situation they have entered, and what date the customer first entered aged care.</p>
