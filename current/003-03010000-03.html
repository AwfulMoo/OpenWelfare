<p><strong>Evidence is required before granting NZ DRA</strong></p>

<p>Evidence may include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a previous tax return or Notice of Assessment as proof of participation in the Australian tax system in the past 3 financial years</li>
		<li>
a payslip or letter from their current employer that they will meet this requirement in the next 12 months</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer cannot provide the evidence as they have lost their records in the disaster, they can get a copy of their Notice of Assessment from the Australian Tax Office (ATO). Customers with a myGov account may be able to access this information if their ATO account is a linked service.</p>

<p>Also request evidence if the customer cannot show participation in the tax system for any of the following reasons&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
their income did not meet <a target="_blank" href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-03010000-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Income_Tax_Rate">income tax thresholds</a></li>
		<li>
they have lodged non-taxable returns or nil activity statements</li>
		<li>
they have not yet lodged a tax return</li>
		<li>
they were not required to lodged tax returns or activity statements</li>
		</ul>
<p>Evidence may include a payslip or letter from the customer’s current employer that there is a likelihood they will pay tax within Australia in the next 12 months.</p>

<p>When submitting a claim, customers are asked to provide this information and advised their claim cannot be assessed until they provide it. NZ DRA <strong>cannot </strong>be granted until this evidence has been provided.</p>
