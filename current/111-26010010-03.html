<p>The rules have been broken up into 3 categories&#58; New Claims, Reassessments and Retrospective Reassessments. </p>

<p><strong>Reassessments</strong></p>

<p>Rules 33, 34, 40, 43, 44 and 45 deal with what is known as 'deferring' the effect of an event on a customer's entitlement, unlike rule 32 which takes the event into account from when it happened.</p>

<p>This is one of several rules about favourable determinations (determinations resulting in the customer's rate increasing or remaining the same). These favourable determination rules all result in the Date of Effect (DOE) being the later of the Date of Receipt (DOR) or the Date of Event (DOV), where the rate is increasing. It is almost always DOR, but if we have been notified in advance, and the system is letting the date be processed rather than setting up a review, then it will be DOV.</p>

<p>Where the rate remains the same, the Date of Effect (DOE) will equal the Date of Event (DOV).</p>

<p>When Rule 1 applies, the situation is usually that a change is notified and we then defer the effect of that change to the day we are notified. For example, the customer phones on 10 September to tell us about an increase in income from 1 September. The change in rent is recorded on the relevant screen with a DOV of 1 September. The activity has a DOR of 10 September. The date of effect rules say that the change in rate is effective from 10 September. You will see Rule 1 applied on 1 September and then, on 10 September (the Date Of Effect for the change), you will see Rule <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-26010010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Summary_of_NOHL_11">11</a> applied.</p>

<p>It is important to note that where the change in circumstance relates to employment income, rules 15 to 18 will display. This is due to the fact a different Date of Effect is applied in order to apportion the employment income over an entitlement period.</p>

<p>So when NOHL decides not to apply a change in rate at the DOV but at a later date, you'll see the relevant rule at the DOV and a corresponding Rule <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-26010010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Summary_of_NOHL_11">11</a> applied at the actual DOE.</p>

<p>For Parenting Payment Partnered, there is an exception built into the system. This exception applies where the PPP customer is partnered to an NSS stimulus customer and the change of circumstances is, or includes, a change in income. The exception says that the date of effect of the change is the date of event of the change. For these cases, we have not deferred the date of effect so you'll only see Rule 1 applied at the DOV. You will not see Rule <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-26010010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Summary_of_NOHL_11">11</a> applied.</p>

<p>Rate Increase - Date of Effect = Date of Receipt</p>

<p>No Change - Date of Effect = Date of Event</p>

<p>A favourable determination rule. In this situation the customer has notified late and has already been paid for the period in which the event occurred.</p>

<p>Date of Effect (DOE) is the later of Date of Receipt (DOR) and Date of Event (DOV). Because we are dealing with changes which have been notified late, Date of Effect would normally be Date of Receipt.</p>

<p>When Rule 2 applies, the situation is usually that a change is notified and we then defer the effect of that change to the day we are notified. For example, the customer phones on 10 September to tell us about a decrease in investment income from 20 August. The change in income is recorded on the relevant screen with a DOV of 20 August. The activity has a DOR of 10 September. The date of effect rules say that the change in rate is effective from 10 September. You will see Rule 2 applied on 20 August and then, on 10 September (the Date of Effect for the change), you will see Rule <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-26010010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Summary_of_NOHL_11">11</a> applied.</p>

<p><strong>This rule generally only applies when we have advance stripped payments </strong>(the old holiday processing)</p>

<p>In this scenario there is an unfavourable determination (rate decrease), the customer notifies the change of circumstances in the same entitlement period as the change occurs and we also action the change in that same period, but the period has already been paid or stripped.</p>

<p>This is a NOHL rule that makes Date of Effect (DOE) apply from the Entitlement Period Start Date of the period in which we are actioning the change. This arises when the customer tells us about a change which results in their rate going down (an unfavourable determination) and the customer has notified that change in time (within their notification period).</p>

<p>In this case, we have already stripped one payment for the customer between when the event occurred and when we action the change. The customer has told us in time so we do not want to raise a debt, however we do want to reduce their rate as soon as we can. This rule says we reduce their rate from the beginning of the entitlement period in which we action the change. So the customer keeps their entitlement for the period we had stripped before we action the change. Their full next entitlement period is paid at the decreased rate.</p>

<p>When Rule 4 applies, we defer the change in entitlement until the beginning of the period in which we action the change. This means you will generally see two rules, at different dates, applied in the reassessment. For example, the customer phones on 10 September to tell us about an increase in income from 1 September. The change in income is recorded on the relevant screen with a Date of Event (DOV) of 1 September. The activity has a Date of Receipt (DOR) of 10 September. Their entitlement period ended on 7 September. We action the change on 10 September. We have already paid the customer for the entitlement period ending on 7 September so the date of effect rules say we reduce their rate from 8 September.</p>

<p>You will see Rule 4 applied on 1 September and then, on 8 September (the date of effect for the change), you will see Rule <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-26010010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Summary_of_NOHL_11">11</a> applied.</p>

<p>So when NOHL decides not to apply a change in rate at the DOV but at a later date, you'll see the relevant rule at the DOV and a corresponding Rule <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-26010010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Summary_of_NOHL_11">11</a> applied at the actual DOE.</p>

<p>This is a NOHL rule that sets the Date of Effect (DOE) to the day after the end of the Notification Period. It is similar to Rule <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-26010010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Summary_of_NOHL_4">4</a> in that it applies when we make an unfavourable determination (the customer's rate decreases) after being notified of a change in circumstances. The customer has notified the change of circumstances within their notification period. For this rule to apply, we haven't actioned the change until more than one payment has passed. We are not going to reduce the rate from the date of event but we are going to recover as much as we reasonably can of the money we have paid the customer.</p>

<p>The rule says the customer can keep any money for the full notification period but that we can recover entitlement for the period from the day after the end of the notification period. The customer will have a debt from the day after the end of the notification period until the date they are paid up to (their &quot;date paid to&quot;).</p>

<p>This is the same as the October 1997 changes in debt processing.</p>

<p>When Rule 5 applies, we defer the effect of the change in entitlement from the Date of Event (DOV) until the day after the end of the notification period. This means you will generally see two rules, at different dates, in the reassessment. For example, the customer rings on 10 September to tell us they moved into government housing on 1 September. This means they are no longer entitled to rent assistance and their overall rate goes down (we make an unfavourable determination). The customer's entitlement periods end on 7 September, 21 September and 5 October. We do not action this change until 1 October. The customer has been paid for the entitlement periods ending on 7 September and 21 September. The date of effect rules say we reduce their entitlement from 16 September (their notification period ended on 15 September). There is a recoverable debt from 16 September until 21 September.</p>

<p>You will see Rule 5 applied on 1 September and then, on 16 September (the date of effect for the change), you will see Rule <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-26010010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Summary_of_NOHL_11">11</a> applied.</p>

<p>So when NOHL decides not to apply a change in rate at the DOV but at a later date, you'll see the relevant rule at the DOV and a corresponding Rule <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-26010010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Summary_of_NOHL_11">11</a> applied at the actual DOE.</p>

<p>In processing a number of changes in circumstances, the date of effect rules require us to defer the Date of Effect (DOE) from the Date of Event (DOV). For example in Rule <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-26010010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Summary_of_NOHL_1">1</a> and Rule <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-26010010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Summary_of_NOHL_7">7</a> where we defer the Date of Effect to the Date of Receipt (DOR), or in Rule <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-26010010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Summary_of_NOHL_4">4</a> where we defer the Date of Effect to the beginning of the entitlement period in which we action the change. At the Date of event, you see which particular rule applied at that date (e.g. rule <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-26010010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Summary_of_NOHL_1">1</a> or <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-26010010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Summary_of_NOHL_4">4</a> or <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-26010010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Summary_of_NOHL_7">7</a>). The reassessment then works through any more dates and eventually comes to the date of effect we decided to use when we deferred the effect from DOV. When we reach this &quot;deferred DOE&quot; we say we are applying rule 11. This will always be shown in conjunction with a business rule (1-9).</p>

<p>Rule 12 says &quot;this is the system mirroring an earlier decision to apply a rate change at date of event&quot;. You can disregard the rule.</p>

<p>There are a series of &quot;rules&quot; used when we are processing dates before the earliest date of change in the current activity. These are significant for refresh and reassessment actions recorded on the <strong>BA</strong> screen. These rules are generally just the system saying it has checked what to do to make sure it mirrors any decisions from previous activities. However, there is no legislative basis to increase the rate (and hence calculate arrears) from a date of effect in the past. Where the decision is favourable, the date of effect will be deferred to the start of the current entitlement period (generally date paid to + 1). (See also Rule <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-26010010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Summary_of_NOHL_13">13</a> and Rule <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-26010010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Summary_of_NOHL_14">14</a>.)</p>

<p>For example, if there was an earlier activity processing a loss of custody for a child and this resulted in the customer's rate decreasing. This change in custody was notified late and we applied date of effect Rule <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-26010010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Summary_of_NOHL_6">6</a> which meant date of effect was date of event.</p>

<p>Let's say the custody change was on 1 September and the change was notified on 30 September. The date of effect rule applied when that reassessment was done was Rule <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-26010010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Summary_of_NOHL_6">6</a> and the decrease in rate applied from 1 September. If, on 10 November, you code a refresh action on the <strong>BA</strong> screen and specify a date of effect on the refresh action as 25 August, then, in the refresh activity, the system needs to mirror the original decision not to defer the change which happened on 1 September.</p>

<p>For example, if there was an earlier activity processing a decrease in income leading to an increase in rate.</p>

<p>Let's say the income change was on 1 September and the change was notified on 10 September and the date of effect rule applied when that reassessment was done was for example, Rule 1. We had decided to defer the effect of the change in rate from 1 September (DOV) to 10 September (DOR, also DOE). If on 4 November you code a refresh action on the <strong>BA </strong>screen and specify a date of effect on the refresh action as 25 August, then in the refresh activity the system needs to defer the change which happened on 1 September to the start of the current entitlement period.</p>

<p>This is one of several rules about favourable determinations (determinations resulting in the customer's rate increasing) and includes changes to earnings. These favourable determination rules all result in the Date of Effect (DOE) being the later of the Entitlement Period Start Day (EPSD) of either the Date of Receipt (DOR) or the Date of Event (DOV). It is almost always EPSD of the DOR, but if we have been notified in advance, and the system is letting the date be processed rather than setting up a review, then it will be the EPSD of the DOV.</p>

<p>When Rule 15 applies, the situation is usually that a change to earnings is notified and we then defer the effect of that change to the Entitlement Period Start Day of the day we are notified. For example, the customer phones on 10 September to tell us about a decrease in income from 1 September. The change in income is recorded on the relevant screen with a DOV of 1 September. The Entitlement Period Start Day for the customer is 31 August. The activity has a DOR of 10 September. The date of effect rules say that the change in rate is effective from 31 August. You will see Rule 15 applied on 31 August.</p>

<p>So when NOHL decides not to apply a change in rate at the DOV but at a later date, you'll see the relevant rule at the EPSD of the DOV.</p>

<p>For Parenting Payment Partnered, there is an exception built into the system. This exception applies where the PPP customer is partnered to an NSS stimulus customer and the change of circumstances is, or includes, a change in income. The exception says that the date of effect of the change is the date of event of the change. For these cases, we have not deferred the date of effect so you'll only see Rule 15 applied at the EPSD of the DOV. You will not see Rule <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-26010010-03.html#bp03020013_11">11</a> applied.</p>

<p>A favourable determination rule. In this situation the customer has notified of an earnings change late and has already been paid for the period in which the event occurred.</p>

<p>Date of Effect (DOE) is the later of Entitlement Period Start Date (EPSD) of the Date of Receipt (DOR) or Date of Event (DOV). Because we are dealing with changes which have been notified late, Date of Effect would normally be Entitlement Period Start Date of Date of Receipt.</p>

<p>When Rule 16 applies, the situation is usually that a change is notified and we then defer the effect of that change to the start of the entitlement of the day we are notified. For example, the customer phones on 10 September to tell us about a decrease in income from 20 August. The Entitlement Period Start Day for the customer is 31 August. The change in income is recorded on the relevant screen with a DOV of 20 August. The activity has a DOR of 10 September. The date of effect rules say that the change in rate is effective from 31 August. You will see Rule 16 applied on 31 August.</p>

<p>So when NOHL decides not to apply a change in rate at the DOV but at a later date, you'll see the relevant rule at the EPSD of the DOV.</p>

<p>A favourable determination rule (the customer's rate is going to increase). In this situation the customer has notified a change in earnings in time and has not yet been paid for the period in which the event occurred.
