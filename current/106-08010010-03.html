<p>Examples of foreign documents, including forms, are available through the International Program homepage. The <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-08010010-05.html">Resources</a> page contains a link to the homepage.</p>

<p><strong>Completing the claim</strong></p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> for Italian pension claims, Patronati offices are set up to assist customers to claim a pension and are experienced in the complex requirements. Customers should be encouraged to lodge Italian pension claims through a Patronato office. For contact details, see <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04019000-01.html">Italy Agreement Information</a>.</p>

<p>A person in Australia who is claiming a payment from an agreement country will usually receive an official claim form to complete and lodge with Centrelink. For most other countries, the notice advises the customer to complete a standard proforma (Request for Claim Papers) requesting the foreign pension authority to send them the necessary claim forms.</p>

<p>For the <strong>standard proforma</strong>, customers should complete all the necessary details and sign the document.</p>

<p>For <strong>official claim forms</strong>, the main points to note are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Signature&#58;</strong> it is critical that claim forms are signed by the customer in the appropriate sections of forms</li>
		<li>
<strong>Identity&#58;</strong> it is important that all names the customer has been known by, for example, maiden name and name at birth are entered into the relevant section of the form and as much supporting evidence as possible is provided</li>
		</ul>
<p>For claims from an agreement country, customers who are currently in receipt of Australian income support payments have already verified their identity. Non-customers should provide identity documentation that is normally required for Australian income support payments. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-09010000-01.html">Identity Confirmation</a> for further information.</p>

<p>For claims from a <strong>non-agreement country</strong>, staff should copy and certify whatever identity documents the customer provides.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Periods of Coverage&#58;</strong> most foreign pension claims are based on proving periods of coverage in that country's social security system, for example, paid social security contributions through employment. It is important that customers give as much detail as possible in the relevant section of the form and provide as much supporting evidence as possible</li>
		<li>
<strong>Personal Details&#58;</strong> some claims are reliant on proof of personal details, for example, survivor or widow pension (SUR) claims generally require evidence of legal status of the relationship or widowhood, such as a Marriage Certificate or Death Certificate</li>
		<li>
<strong>Australian residence periods&#58;</strong> For claims from an agreement country, proof of Australian periods of coverage is normally required. This is usually Australian Working Life Residence (AWLR) but does vary for some agreements. Forms are provided in agreement country claim packages. For information, see the relevant country file in <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04000000-01.html">International Social Security Agreements</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>For information on verifying Australian residence, see <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-06020010-01.html">Coding the Country of Residence (CRES) screen</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Lodging the claim</strong></p>

<p>Customers can&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
send their claim direct to CIS in the reply paid envelope provided, or</li>
		<li>
attend their local service centre to lodge the claim</li>
		</ul>
<p>From January 2021, <strong>some</strong> foreign pension claims can be scanned. Claims with a 'scan and send' coversheet&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
must be scanned as 'INTRQI' as an open work item, and</li>
		<li>
must have the original claim and supporting documents sent to Centrelink International Services (CIS)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Foreign pension claim forms without this coversheet must <strong>not</strong> be scanned but physically sent to Centrelink International Services (CIS) via internal mail. </p>

<p>Customers may choose to send their claims direct to the foreign pension authority, but should be encouraged to lodge claims from agreement countries with Centrelink.</p>

<p><strong>If the customer is on a designated Australian payment, have they indicated they will send/have sent the foreign pension claim form directly to the foreign pension authorities?</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>, see <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-08010010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Assisting_custo02_Step03">Step 3, Table 3</a></li>

<p>Service centre staff must assist customers with lodging foreign pension claim forms, including the standard proforma for requesting claim forms. If necessary, service centre staff can contact Centrelink International Services (CIS) for assistance.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> for Italian pension claims, Patronati offices are set up to assist customers to claim a pension and are experienced in the complex requirements. Customers should be encouraged to lodge Italian pension claims through a Patronato office. For contact details, see Italy Agreement Information.</p>

<p><strong>Service centre staff should&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Help the customer complete the form(s)</li>
		<li>
Ensure that the customer has signed the form(s)</li>
		<li>
Date stamp the claim form</li>
		<li>
Make certified copies of any supporting documents and return the originals to the customer. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> Croatia and Greece require original documents with claims such as workbooks which record periods of employment. In these cases the original workbook should be kept with the claim form and the certified copy should be returned to the customer</li>
		<li>
Accept the form(s) and documents once complete</li>
		<li>
Advise the customer that CIS will send it to the foreign pension authority for them and that they must notify Centrelink when they receive advice of the outcome of the claim</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Identity Confirmation</strong></p>

<p>For claims from an agreement country, customers who are currently in receipt of Australian income support payments have already verified their identity. Non-customers should provide identity documentation that is normally required for Australian income support payments. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-09010000-01.html">Identity Confirmation</a> for further information.</p>

<p>Customers are not required to claim a foreign pension if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they are not likely to qualify for or receive the payment, for example, if they did not work and pay contributions in the country or received a refund of their contributions</li>
		<li>
the requirements of making a claim are not reasonable, for example, it is <strong>not</strong> reasonable for the customer to pay extra payments to qualify or to have to travel to another country to make a claim, but it <strong>is</strong> reasonable for the customer to pay to obtain documents like a marriage certificate or medical evidence</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> policy advice is that deferring a claim for a foreign pension to obtain a higher rate of payment does not meet the criteria for taking reasonable action. Customers who choose to defer claiming for this reason should have their payments suspended.</p>

<p>Check the known information about the foreign pension and discuss with the customer.</p>

Due to a medical condition, the person&#58;</li>

is not capable of making a claim and there is no other person available to assist with the claim process, for example customers with dementia or other serious ongoing illness supported by appropriate evidence</li>
			<li>
would be traumatised or there would be other adverse health effects if they made a claim</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Making a claim may lead to persecution by the authorities of that country and jeopardise their safety or the safety of another person. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> the person's objection must be reasonable, for example, the person fled the country for political reasons and insists that all ties with that country have been severed, and supported by appropriate evidence (although a person in this position may suffer adverse health effects, see above)</li>
		<li>
The person is over 80 years of age and it is likely that the rate of foreign pension would not affect their rate of Australian pension. That is, the customer is not affected by the income test and the period of insurance in the country is&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Less than five years and the customer is more than $500 p.a. below the income test threshold, or</li>
			<li>
5-10 years and the customer is more than $1,000 p.a. below the income test threshold, or</li>

10-15 years and the customer is more than $1,500 p.a. below the income test threshold</li>
