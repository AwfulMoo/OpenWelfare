<p><strong>Question&#58; What is PRODA?</strong></p>

<p>‏Answer&#58; Provider Digital Access (PRODA) is an online authentication system based on a username, password and verification code to log on. The system is designed to provide secure access to specific Government services using one log on method. PRODA is digital, portable, and does not need additional hardware or software installed. Users can <a href="../self-service/133-02130030-01.html">change and manage their account details</a> online in PRODA including changing name or contact details.</p>

<p>Specific government services will gradually be added to PRODA, so access to these services will only require one authentication method.</p></td>

<a class="anchor" name="bp05_tbl_General_information_2"></a>
<p>2</p></td>
<td>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Is PRODA secure?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Yes. It is a unique username and password that uses a verification code. The PRODA account allows access to services that involve personal and financial information.</p>

<p>It is important the agency correctly verifies a user's identity and that they do not share their log on details with anyone else because their PRODA account may allow access to services that involve personal and financial information. It is important that users do not share their username and password with anybody.</p></td>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Who can create a PRODA account?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Can a user have more than one PRODA account?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; No. Once their identity has been verified the system will not allow their identity documents to be used again.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> email addresses and mobile phone numbers are also unique to an account. Once a user has verified an email address or mobile phone number, they will not be able to use them for another account.</p></td>

<p>Answer&#58; <strong>NDIS for providers</strong> will allow providers registered in the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) to access the new NDIS online provider portal when it becomes available.</p>

<p>NDIS providers will need to check the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) website (www.ndis.gov.au) for details of when the provider portal will be available to access through their PRODA account and how to set up access to the new provider portal.</p>

<p>Scheme information&#58; The NDIS is a new way of providing support for people living with disability. It is a whole-of-life approach - a major reform of disability services in Australia, designed to provide the right support according to each person’s needs and goals.</p></td>

<p><strong>Question&#58; How do users set up the mobile app?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; If they would like to use the PRODA app to generate codes, they need to download it from the app store or google play and go through the set-up process within the app itself. They can find the PRODA code generator in the app store for their Apple or Android device. Other types of devices are not supported at this time.</p>

<p>They do need a smartphone or tablet in order to use the app. The app is the agency’s recommended method, it will avoid filling their email account and text messages with codes.</p>

<p>Once the app is installed on their device, they open the app and enter their username and password for their PRODA account. Then they enter the verification code that will be sent to their preferred channel (email address or mobile phone). The app will then perform a sync process with their PRODA account and start to generate codes.</p>

<p>They should then go back into their PRODA account and select Mobile App as the verification code preferred channel.</p>

<p>They can then start using the app to generate codes.</p></td>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Can I access My Health Record System using PRODA?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Yes. Individual healthcare providers can access the read-only My Health Record National Provider Portal using PRODA. The organisation they work at needs to have created an authorisation link in HPOS first. </p>

<p>Healthcare providers and participating supporting organisations cannot use the My Health Record National Provider Portal. They must have a National Authentication Service for Health (NASH) PKI certificate to access the My Health Record system.</p></td>

		<ul>		<li>
Internet Explorer 9</li>

<p><strong>Question&#58; What if users want to link to their online services later?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; They can link to their online services within PRODA at a later date. They simply log on to PRODA, go to the <strong>My communities</strong> screen, select the relevant tile and search for their registration with the relevant online service.</p>

<p>The user can delay linking until later, however this will restrict the services the user can access.</p></td>

<td>

<p><strong>Question&#58; How do users confirm their identity?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; The new solution requires a greater level of security. The agency needs to ensure a high level of certainty that the person performing the transaction is correct and the agency knows who they are. As this is a new system, users are still required to complete the <strong>Your Identity</strong> process, even if they are known to the agency.</p>

<p>When setting up an account there is a requirement that the agency verifies their identity through the Document Verification Service (DVS).</p>
		<ul>		<li>
They will need 2 documents from the following category&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Medicare card</li>
			<li>
Australian driver licence</li>
			<li>
ImmiCard</li>
			<li>
Australian passport</li>		</ul>
		<li>
They will need 1 document from the following list&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Australian passport (if not used above)</li>
			<li>
Australian birth certificate</li>
			<li>
Citizenship certificate</li>
			<li>
Foreign passport (with visa)</li>
			<li>
Certificate of registration by descent</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>These documents will be verified one at a time. Once a document is selected, the information needs to be entered exactly as it is found on the document.</p>

<p>It is recommended using Medicare card, Australian drivers licence and Australian passport.</p>

<p>If their name is different on any of these documents, evidence of the name change will be required by providing a Marriage Certificate or Change of Name Certificate.</p>

<p>If they do not have these documents, a wider range of documents can be accepted <a href="../self-service/133-02130040-01.html">via a manual process</a>.</p></td>

<p><strong>Question&#58; The user's name is different on the document they want to use, can they still use it to verify their identity?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Yes. They must still enter the name exactly as it is displayed on the document. They may then be required to provide documents that demonstrate that their name has changed. When prompted, they select one of the following and upload the information on to the Document Verification Service&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Marriage Certificate</li>
		<li>
Change of Name Certificate</li>

<p><strong>Question&#58; The system says it cannot verify the user's name change, what can they do?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Unfortunately not every person will be able to verify their change of name online due to a lack of information held by the Document Verification Service, or issues with the information recorded on their identity document.</p>

<p>As a result, the user needs to finish verifying their name change using a paper form. They should download the Manual identity verification for Provider Digital Access form provided, then submit the form to the agency. A Service Officer will finalise their change of name for them.</p></td>

<p><strong>Question&#58; The user wants to change their name on the PRODA system, how can they do that?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; The user accesses their account, selects the <strong>My details</strong> link and then <strong>Edit</strong>. This will give them 2 options&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Add a new name - This option is useful if they want to use a name that has not been previously verified by the system. The new name must be as a result of marriage or legal name change, and evidence must be provided (Marriage Certificate or Change of Name Certificate). Advise them to use information on their document to go through the online verification process and add their new name</li>
		<li>
Change current name - this option is useful if they have multiple names previously verified by the system. This option allows them to change their name as it is displayed and used in the system.</li>

<p><strong>Question&#58; The user does not have the documents with them, what can they do?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; The verification process allows the user to save their progress and come back to it later.</p>

<p>The user should select <strong>Save and continue later</strong> to save their progress and log out.</p>

<p>The process can be completed later from any computer/tablet. If they have some, but not all, of the documents they need, they should select 'I don't have any of these documents' to advance to the other types of documents that they have with them.</p></td>

<p><strong>Question&#58; The system says the user's document could not be found or document failed, what can they do?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; If the system cannot match their document details, it will provide some information about the reason why. The user will receive one of 3 possible reasons&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Unable to be confirmed</strong> - the details they have entered do not match those of any documents held by the issuing agency, or the document is marked as being invalid (a death is recorded against it, or it is involved in fraudulent activity). The user should check the details they have entered are correct and try again, or select a different document type to enter</li>
		<li>
<strong>Document verification is unavailable</strong> - some issuing agencies have yet to make all their records available for online verification. If they receive this error it is because documents issued in the year they have entered cannot verified electronically. The user should choose a different document type</li>
		<li>
<strong>System unavailable</strong> - the Document Verification Service (DVS) is a separate government service managed by the Attorney-General's Department. Occasionally it may experience technical difficulties and become unavailable. If this is the case, the user should save their application and try again later</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the agency is not responsible for the operation of the DVS.</p></td>

<p><strong>Question&#58; How can it be identified that a customer has had their name changed at the Births, Deaths, and Marriages (BDM) registry?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Procedures differ for each State and Territory. See below for details&#58;</p>

<p>Australian Capital Territory (ACT)</p>

<p>A notation is made on the back of any birth certificate issued advising the new name and the date of change.</p>

<p>New South Wales (NSW)</p>

<p>When a change of name occurs, the letter N is placed after the birth certificate's registration number. This was implemented around the mid 1990's. In the section titled 'Endorsements' the details of the previous name are recorded. For certificates issued prior to this time the previous name is recorded at the top of the certificate with the new name recorded on either the side or bottom of the certificate.</p>

<p>Northern Territory (NT)</p>

<p>A notation on a birth certificate indicating a change of name is optional. An asterisk at the bottom of the certificate indicates a change of name has occurred but it is still not required to have the name recorded.</p>

<p>Queensland (QLD)</p>

<p>If a person requires the change of name to be recorded on their birth certificate, the change of name is recorded on the front of the certificate and previous names on the back. If they choose not to have the new name appear, the birth certificate will state that a change of name has been registered but will not state the new name.</p>

<p>South Australia (SA)</p>

<p>The recording of a change of name on a SA birth certificate is optional. If the person does not want it recorded on their birth certificate a Change of Name certificate can be issued which includes the previous name(s). If the person requests the details to be included on their birth certificate the new name details are recorded on the reverse side of the certificate.</p>

<p>Tasmania (TAS)</p>

<p>The noting on a birth certificate of a change of name is optional. If the person chooses YES to having it recorded there is an N placed after the registration number on the certificate. This came about in the year 2000.</p>

<p>Victoria (VIC)</p>

<p>BDM advises that the letter N is recorded after the registration number on the birth certificate indicating a name change. A letter N is recorded for each name change so there can be more than one letter N on any certificate. This has been in place since 1986. When the letter C appears on a certificate after the registration number it indicates that a correction has been made to the certificate. This includes the correction of any spelling errors.</p>

<p>Western Australia (WA)</p>

<p>If a change of name was completed before 1974, a stamp was placed on the birth certificate noting the amendment.</p>

<p>If a change of name was completed from 1974 onwards, the person is asked whether they want the details of the change to appear on their birth certificate. It is not mandatory.</p></td>

<p>For providers the account details created will need to match the account details held in both the Healthcare Identifiers (HI) Service and provider directory system (PDS).</p>

<td>

<p><strong>Question&#58; What numbers can users add?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Users only need to add numbers that affect the services they can access within the agency's systems.</p>

<p>For example, if they are a medical provider it is important to add their Medicare provider number so that they are given access in the system to clinical functions and patient data. Users should refer to the drop down list on the <strong>Search for your existing records</strong> screen to see what type of numbers the agency is referring to. If they have a number that is <strong>not</strong> on this list, it means they do not need it.</p></td>

<p>5</p></td>
<td>

<p><strong>Question&#58; The system says the user's number/identifier does not match, what do they do?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; It is possible that there are some discrepancies in the data the agency holds about them in different areas of the agency. For example, the personal information they have entered for this account may be different to the data saved against their Medicare provider number registration due to a change in circumstances or timing. Therefore, they may not be able to link all numbers in every case.</p>

<p>If a match cannot be found for the number but they are sure they entered the number correctly and it has been issued to them, they should select the checkbox to request help from a Service Officer. They need to add a short explanation in the comments box advising what kind of number it is or which area of the agency issued it (e.g. Medicare provider number).</p></td>

<a class="anchor" name="bp05_tbl_Linking_records_for_6"></a>
<p>6</p></td>
<td>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Why does the agency need to link up the user's numbers/identifiers?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Access to online services depends on the user's registration(s) with the programme areas within the agency. This includes Medicare provider numbers, Healthcare Identifier (HI) Service identifier numbers, pharmacist registrations and Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) provider numbers etc.</p>

<p>Most of these numbers relate to clinical services they are authorised to provide, so if they are working in an administrative role it is possible they do not have any numbers recorded in their name with the agency. HI Service administration officers can add the Healthcare Provider Identifier - Organisation (HPI-O) number they are linked to, to gain access to Healthcare Identifiers in HPOS.</p>

<p>To ensure they can access all the services they are entitled to, a link needs to be established between their existing registration(s) and their PRODA account. For providers, the easiest way to find all numbers relating to them in the agency's databases is via their Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra) number.</p>

<p>If their Ahpra number does not return all identifiers linked to the agency, they can also use other identifiers from the drop down list on the <strong>Search for your existing records</strong> screen.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Ahpra Medical Registration number</strong>. This is a common element held across a range of the agency's databases, and is more likely to provide the desired result of linking up all numbers the agency has stored for them. If they are registered with Ahpra, the agency can use this number to find other numbers they have across the agency.</li>
		<li>
<strong>Add any number the user has</strong>. Alternatively, they can add numbers one by one until they have added all the different numbers issued to them. If they add their Medicare provider number the system will automatically find and add any other provider numbers issued to them.</li>
		</ul>
<p>They can add more numbers later within the PRODA management function. They simply log on to PRODA and go to the <strong>My communities</strong> screen and select the relevant tile from their selected communities.</p></td>

<p><strong>Question&#58; What if users do not have any numbers/identifiers?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Users don't necessarily have to have any numbers issued to them to be able to register and use online accounts. If they don't have any, it is likely they're setting up this account in order to perform delegated functions on behalf of another user, or administrative functions for their organisation.</p>

<p>If they don't have any numbers issued in their name, they should answer the guided questions and they will automatically skip past this section to finalise their PRODA registration.</p></td>

<p>Settings established in HPOS when using a Medicare PKI individual certificate, such as delegates and favourites, will not be carried over when a user logs on to HPOS using a PRODA account.

The provider will display twice in the <strong>Select provider</strong> screen for the delegate with the 2 separate RA numbers.</p>

<p>The provider will not see transaction performed by the delegate in <strong>My access history</strong> if the provider is logging on with their PKI and the delegate's transactions were performed when acting, using the provider's PRODA RA number and vice versa.</p>

<p>Answer&#58; In July, NDIS providers will use a new provider portal called myplace accessible only through the establishment of a PRODA account. Due to the number of individuals who will need to create a PRODA account, the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) is requesting that people not apply for a PRODA account until the registered provider they act on behalf is contacted by the NDIA. The NDIA will contact providers over the coming weeks.</p>

<p>The NDIA is processing applications for registration as quickly as possible.  Once registered, you will need a PRODA account, but you will need to wait until after you have received your certificate of registration from the NDIA to start this process.</p></td>

<p>Answer&#58; Due to the large number of providers who will need to access myplace from 1 July, the Agency is requesting that only the nominated Account Manager apply for a PRODA account ahead of 1 July.</p>

<p>This will ensure that every provider can access myplace when it comes online in July.</p>
