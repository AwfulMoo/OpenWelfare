<p><strong>Initial contact required with one customer to verify facts</strong></p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>

<p>A payer calls to report an error in the estimate they provided 2 months ago. It was recorded as $65,000 instead of $56,000. The original estimate notepad confirms the $56,000 figure should have been used.</p>

<p>The error may be corrected as a simple error without the payer lodging an objection as the correct amount has been confirmed. There is no need to make initial contact with any associated customers, such as the payee, to confirm the facts as they would have no knowledge of the payer's estimate amount.</p>

<p>Before processing the decision, contact is required with any associated customers affected by the error correction to explain the decision and the impact on their assessment.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>

<p>A date of birth (DOB) of a payee's relevant dependent child has been recorded as 7 March 2012 instead of 3 July 2012. Initial customer contact was made with the payee who has confirmed that the correct DOB is 3 July 2012. There is no need to make initial contact with any associated customers due to potential privacy issues. Also, it is unlikely the associated customers would be aware of the facts. Before processing the decision, contact is required with any associated customers affected by the error correction to explain the decision and the impact on their assessment.</p>

<p>A care decision has been keyed in the Cuba care window as 25% care to the payer and 75% care to the payee. However, the care decision notepad documented these care percentages the other way around, that is 75% care to the payer and 25% care to the payee.</p>

<p>It is unclear from the documentation what the correct facts are which means initial customer contact is required. As both customers need to be consulted about a care change of a child, initial customer contact will need to be conducted with both customers to confirm the facts of the care prior to correction.</p>

<p><strong>Correcting errors macro summary example&#58;</strong> Child (child's name) care arrangements from (from date) should have been recorded as 75% care to (payer's name) and 25% care to (payee's name), however an error occurred and these care percentages were incorrectly keyed and accepted the other way around.</p>

<p><strong>Initial contact not required with either party to verify facts</strong></p>

<p><strong>Example 4</strong></p>

<p>Where there is a Cuba error with a mixed assessment, initial customer contact to confirm the facts may not be required as the issues are too complex and the customers would not be able to comment on the accuracy of the case details. Contact would be required with any associated customers affected by the error correction to explain the decision and impact prior to processing.</p>

<p><strong>Example 5</strong></p>

<p>A FAO care record has been applied in Cuba incorrectly. The correct FAO care details are confirmed with Centrelink. As Child Support is applying a care decision already made in the FAO system, initial customer contact to confirm the facts is not required.  Contact would be required with any associated customers affected by the error correction to explain the decision and impact prior to processing.</p>

<p><strong>Correcting errors macro summary example&#58;</strong> Child (child's name) FAO care arrangements from (from date) of x% to (payee's name) and x% to (payer's name) were applied in error.

<p><strong>Decision made, yet to be implemented</strong></p>

<p><strong>Example 6</strong></p>

<p>A payer's relevant dependent child application was accepted in Cuba, however eligibility was not saved to apply the relevant dependant to the assessment. The payer contacts Child Support a month later to enquire why their relevant dependent child is not included in the assessment.</p>

<p>As Child Support has not given effect to the decision (due to eligibility not yet being saved) this may be treated as a simple error. On investigation, it is clear from the documentation that a decision has already been made to accept the payer's relevant dependant application. There is no need to make initial contact with any associated customers due to potential privacy issues. Also, it is unlikely the associated customers would be aware of the facts. Before processing the decision, contact is required with any associated customers affected by the error correction to explain the decision and its impact on their assessment.</p>

<p><strong>Decision yet to be made</strong></p>

<p><strong>Example 7</strong></p>

<p>An application for assessment was made for a child by the payee. The registration and the child's care arrangements were pended. Three unsuccessful contact attempts to the payer were made however no letter was issued. The customers were then unlocked in error with the registration and care arrangements still pending. The payee contacts Child Support 6 weeks later to enquire why the child has not been included in the assessment.</p>

<p>As a decision is yet to be made, the error (the failure to make the decision) may be corrected through the error correction process. The customer cannot object because no decision was ever made (usual objection rights would apply to the application of assessment decision once it is made under the correcting errors process).</p>

<p>On investigation, it is clear that all of the application requirements were met by the payee including presumption of parentage for both parties which is recorded in an earlier registration, however the care arrangements have not been verified and the payer has not yet been contacted. Initial customer contact will need to be conducted with the payer to confirm the facts of this application for assessment error correction.</p>

<p><strong>Correcting errors macro summary example&#58;</strong> An application for assessment was made on (date) by payee (name) for child (name) against payer (name). This application remained pended as Child Support failed to make a decision on the application.</p>

<p><strong>2 August 2010</strong></p>

<p>M makes an application for an administrative assessment for children A and B.</p>

<p>M is advised that marriage dates are sufficient evidence for presumption of parentage (POP) for child B, however, Child Support require additional information to legally make the presumption that F and M are the parents of A.</p>

<p>Additional POP evidence is requested to be supplied by 16 August 2010.</p>

<p><strong>14 August 2010</strong></p>

<p>A's birth certificate is received and is imaged and indexed in the View Correspondence window. Both F and M are named as A's parents on the birth certificate, however the Service Officer who made the decision was not aware of this evidence at the time they made the initial decision.</p>

<p><strong>18 August 2010</strong></p>

<p>Eligibility is saved without updating the Relationship window with the new POP information. Cuba accepts the application for B but refuses the application for A.</p>

<p><strong>Invalid decisions about parentage</strong></p>

<p><strong>Example 9</strong></p>

<p>An example of a summary of the error&#58;</p>

<p>F applied to add child A to their existing case 123456 with M on 15 May 2019. The case was refused on 31 May 2019 on the basis that POP had not been satisfied for M. On 30 May 2019, M had provided a statutory declaration that he was A’s parent satisfying POP. This evidence was not considered when the application was refused. This means the decision should be declared invalid.</p>

<p>Further this application was refused 16 days after being lodged. Eligibility and presumption of parentage (PoP) for a child support assessment 277-03010030 OB states that an application must not be refused before 28 days after the initial application, unless the customer indicates that POP will not be established.</p>

<p>The decision and impact on customers&#58;</p>

<p>The decision to refuse the application of 15/05/2019 is declared invalid for the reasons stated in the submission. A new decision must now be made, with reference to the evidence, after which the application will be accepted.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Accepting the application lodged on 15/05/2019 will not have any impact on the assessment, as the rate will remain at MAR. However, F will be deemed to have taken reasonable maintenance action as of 15/05/2019 and will be paid the correct rate of FTB.</p>

<p></p>

<p>=Authorisation===================</p>

<p></p>

<p>SO6 (PSM) Child Support delegation&#58; The decision is declared to be invalid.</p>

<p></p>

<p>reason(s)&#58;</p>

<p></p>

<p>- It followed a denial of procedural fairness (i.e. Child Support has failed to take into account relevant and material evidence).</p>

<p></p>

<p>- details&#58;</p>

<p>Section 29(2)(d) of the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 states that “the Registrar is to be satisfied that a person is a parent of a child only if the Registrar is satisfied&#58;….. that, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, the person has, under the law of the Commonwealth or of a State, Territory or prescribed overseas jurisdiction, executed an instrument acknowledging that the person is a parent of the child, and the instrument has not been annulled or otherwise set aside;…..”</p>

<p></p>

<p>Prior to the decision being made to refuse the application, CSP had received a statutory declaration in which M declared that he was a parent of A, and POP was therefore satisfied against M as per section 29(2)(d).  On this basis, the application should have been accepted.</p>

<p><strong>MAR apportionment errors - Example one</strong></p>

<p>A parent has a Child Support case involving 3 children. (All of the children are full siblings with the same parents, so they and all the parties involved are part of the one child support case)&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Payer has 20% care of Child A</li>

NPC 1 has 80% care of Child A and 100% care of Child B</li>
		<li>
NPC 2 has 100% care of Child C</li>
		</ul>
<p>The payer is assessed to pay MAR of $420 to each NPC (total annual rate of $840).</p>

<p>This is incorrect as the total annual rate payable in a case assessed at MAR cannot be more than $420 (MAR). It is also incorrect as the payer has at least regular care of at least one child of the case, so MAR does not apply.</p>

<p>As all carers have an equal percentage of care of the children (100 / 300 = 33%), and that percentage is the highest percentage of care for all children, each carer is entitled to an equal share of the amount payable. Each NPC should receive $420 (MAR) / 3 carers = $140 each.</p>

<p>Original income for [name of the party who has the amended income]&#58;</p>

<p>Affected period&#58;</p>

<p>As the amended income for [name of the party who has the amended income] was available before the assessment was made for the new child support period for this case, it should be used in the assessment, rather than the original income.  Due to system limitations, this manual workaround is needed to achieve that result.</p>

<p>Payee was contacted on ___</p>

<p>=Decision=======================</p>

<p>In the assessment calculations for the affected period, the original income of ___ will be replaced with the amended taxable income of ___.</p>

<p>The correct annual rate applicable based on the amended taxable income has been calculated as $      pa, and this has been set as a manual annual rate.</p>

<p>This will create arrears of ___</p>

<p><strong>or</strong></p>

<p>This will create an overpayment of ___</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if correcting the income will cause an overpayment, this document should only be completed once Program Advice has confirmed the overpayment is recoverable. Paste Policy Advice approval here&#58;</p>

<p>=Authorisation===================</p>

<p>SO3 Child Support delegation&#58; The original income of ___ has been replaced with the amended income of ___under sections 56(2) and 75 of the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 without further escalation as per Program Advice directive.</p>

<p>FUTURE ASSESSMENT CHANGES&#58;</p>

<p>If an event that would ordinarily change the assessment amount occurs, for example new child support period, new income, care change, this manual annual rate calculation MUST be reviewed. If eligibility is run - the eligibility window will indicate this manual assessment with the following 'W' (warning) message&#58; 'Manual Assessment found'. Escalate this manual assessment to the SSO for investigation and reviewing before saving eligibility.</p>

<p>MAR MANUAL ASST. WORKAROUND</p>

<p><strong>Body Text</strong></p>

<p>MAR MANUAL ASSESSMENT WORKAROUND&#58;</p>

<p>A manual MAR apportionment calculation has been applied to this case via the formula modification window due to Cuba functionality limitations.</p>

<p><strong>Either&#58;</strong></p>

<p>Payer (name) has (number of cases) cases</p>

<p>CALCULATION&#58;</p>

<p>3 x minimum annual rate / number of cases</p>

<p>= annual rate for this case = $       pa,</p>

<p><strong>or&#58;</strong></p>

<p>Payer (name) has (number of carers) carers potentially entitled to a share of the MAR payable for one overall case that is recorded over several Cuba cases.</p>

<p>CALCULATION&#58;</p>

<p>[If the payee has <strong>equal</strong> most care and is entitled to an <strong>equal</strong> share of MAR]</p>

<p>The correct share of MAR payable to payee (name) is MAR / number of carers entitled to an equal share of MAR payable for the overall case</p>

<p> = entitlement for this carer within the case = $     pa</p>

<p>[IF the payee has <strong>higher overall care than all the other carers in the case</strong>, and they are entitled to all of the MAR]</p>

<p>Payee (name) has the most care of the children of the case, and is entitled to the full amount of MAR with no apportionment = $       pa</p>

<p>[IF the payee does not have the most care, or equal most care, of the children of the case,</p>

<p>and they are not entitled to any portion of the MAR]</p>

<p>Payee (name), that payee has less care than the other payees, that is they do not have the most care, or equal most care</p>

<p>and they are not entitled to any share of the amount of MAR = $0 pa</p>

<p>If an event that would ordinarily change the assessment amount occurs for example new child support period, new income, care changes, one of the payer's MAR cases ends) this manual MAR apportionment calculation <strong>must</strong> be reviewed.  If eligibility is run - the eligibility window will indicate this manual assessment with the following 'W' (warning) message&#58; 'Manual Assessment found'.
