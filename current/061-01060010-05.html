then returns to Australia and transfers to Age Pension while in Australia</li>

This is because these customers have not normally returned to Australia as a permanent resident and so do not satisfy the former resident rules (which only apply if the customer resumes residence prior to the transfer).</p>

<p>If the customer did return for residence consider the portability conditions attached to the previous payment paid during the earlier absence&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If that payment was portable indefinitely and the customer remained continuously qualified for payment until the transfer to Age Pension then the customer is not subject to the former resident provisions. This is because the customer has not gained an advantage by returning to Australia (their payment was already portable indefinitely) and it is accepted that the customer has not returned to reside in Australia purely to gain an indefinitely portable payment</li>		</ul>

<p>Payments made under an international agreement are not only affected by income and assets but are also paid a special rate determined by the relevant agreement.

<p>BVA was subject to former resident provisions before being closed to new claims from 20 March 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Norfolk Island residence and former resident rules</strong></p>

<p>Before 1 July 2016, customers who lived on Norfolk Island before arriving in Australia for the first time and being granted Age Pension, BVA or DSP were subject to the former resident rules.</p>

<p>From 1 July 2016, Australia’s social security system was extended to Norfolk Island and the external territory former resident rule became obsolete. However, the system incorrectly automatically applied former resident rules to customers who started living in Australia on 1 July 2016 after a period of residence in an area that was an external territory at the time of residence.</p>

<p>Customers granted or transferred to Age, DSP or BVA before 1 July 2018, <strong>and</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
were living on Norfolk Island immediately before 1 July 2016 and either</li>
			<ul>			<li>
lived in Australia or Norfolk Island for at least 2 years immediately before that date, or</li>
			<li>
never lived outside Australia or Norfolk Island before 1 July 2016?</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>were not affected by former resident provisions. Authorised staff (APS 5 or 6 in CIS) had to code an override on the <strong>Former resident override</strong> field on the Residence Savings (<strong>RSS</strong>) screen either at the time the customer was granted or transferred to Age Pension before 1 July 2018, or when they left Australia before that date, to stop the system incorrectly applying the former resident rules.</p>

<p><strong>Examples of when the former resident rules did and did not apply to customers who had lived on Norfolk Island&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
A customer living on Norfolk Island was granted Age Pension between 1 July 2016 and 1 July 2018. They started living on Norfolk Island more than 2 years before 1 July 2016. The customer was not subject to former resident provisions because under the Norfolk Island reforms the date they took up residence in Australia is considered to include Norfolk Island.</li>
		<li>
A customer living on Norfolk Island was granted Age Pension between 1 July 2016 and 1 July 2018. They started living on Norfolk Island less than 2 years before 1 July 2016. They were born in Vanuatu and in 1990 they started living in Australia on a permanent visa and later became an Australian citizen. On 1 January 2016 they started living on Norfolk Island.<br>In this example the customer lived in a combination of Australia and Norfolk Island for at least 2 years immediately before 1 July 2016 so the former resident rules do not apply and a former resident override was coded.</li>
		<li>
A customer living on Norfolk Island was granted Age Pension between 1 July 2016 and 1 July 2018. They started living on Norfolk Island less than 2 years before 1 July 2016. Before that they only lived in Australia.<br>The customer was not subject to former resident provisions because under the Norfolk Island reforms they had never lived outside Australia. A former resident override had to be coded.</li>
		<li>
A customer living on Norfolk Island was granted Age Pension from 1 July 2016. In this example they lived in Australia as a child, then went to live on Norfolk Island, had a period of residence in New Zealand and finally returned to Norfolk Island on 1 January 2016.<br>From 1 July 2016 Australia’s social security system was extended to Norfolk Island. For former resident purposes, the customer effectively returned to live in Australia on 1 January 2016. The system automatically applied the former resident period from 1 July 2016 so the expiry date of the former resident period is to be manually changed on the Residence Savings (<strong>RSS</strong>) screen to 1 January 2018.<br>In this example, if the customer left Norfolk Island i.e. Australia, to travel to another country during the period 1 July 2016 to 31 December 2017, they were subject to former resident provisions.</li>		</ul>

<p><strong>Pre 20 September 2000 former resident rules</strong></p>

<p>For departures before 20 September 2000, the former resident period was 12 months (instead of the current 2 years) and applied to Age Pension, BVA, DSP, Widow B and Wife Pension.</p>

<p>The former resident rules could be waived if the departure was for ‘unforeseen circumstances’.</p>

<p>Unforeseen circumstances were situations that the customer could not realistically have expected or foreseen when they returned to Australia. Examples of unforeseen circumstances were&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
severe illness or death of an immediate family member overseas, or</li>
