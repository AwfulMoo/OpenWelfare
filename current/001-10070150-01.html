	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Job seekers, including ParentsNext participants, receiving a participation payment are expected to attend compulsory appointments arranged by providers and behave in an appropriate manner while in attendance. This expectation applies to both provider appointments and third party appointments arranged by the provider.</p>

<p>The provider has responsibility for ensuring the job seeker receives proper notification and reasonable notice of compulsory appointments.</p>

<p>Attending a compulsory appointment includes the following requirements&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
be punctual for the appointment and remain until the completion of the appointment</li>
		<li>
behave in an appropriate manner while in attendance</li>
		<li>
contact before the start time if they are unable to attend</li>
		</ul>
<p>When a job seeker fails to attend, or be punctual for, a compulsory appointment or act in an appropriate manner while in attendance at a compulsory appointment, this is managed using the relevant job seeker compliance system.</p>

<p>Attending an appointment means the job seeker&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
attended the appointment punctually</li>
		<li>
remained in attendance until the purpose of the appointment was completed, and</li>
		<li>
behaved in an appropriate manner</li>
		</ul>
<p>Providers use the Online Diary or Calendar to book all compulsory provider appointments and are required to record job seeker attendance prior to the end of the working day.</p>

<p>Providers will use the Activity Diary (for job seekers managed under the CDP Job Seeker Compliance Framework) or the job seeker calendar (for job seekers managed under the Targeted Compliance Framework) to schedule attendance at third party appointments, but may also use other manual processes in some circumstances. Job seekers, including ParentsNext participants, who are managed under the Targeted Compliance Framework, are responsible for recording their own attendance at third party appointments if this has been scheduled using the Calendar. Providers assist job seekers to access and use available systems tools to record attendance at these appointments. Job seekers who are experiencing difficulties with recording their attendance should discuss this with their provider before close of business on the day of the appointment.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>Job seekers who are unable to attend an appointment are required to notify their provider why they are unable to attend prior to the scheduled appointment start time. This reflects the same expectations that an employer would have of an employee.</p>

<p>Job seekers who need to arrive late or leave early from an appointment are also required to discuss this with the provider prior to the appointment.</p>

<p>When prior contact occurs and the provider accepts the job seeker has a valid reason, the appointment may be rescheduled if still required. When the provider does not accept that the job seeker has a valid reason, the provider will record the contact and reasons provided but advise the job seeker that they are required to attend.</p>

<p>When the job seeker fails to comply with the requirement to make prior contact a financial penalty may apply, even if the job seeker had a reasonable excuse for their non-attendance, unless it was unreasonable for them to make prior contact.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>Job seekers are required to behave in an appropriate manner while attending an appointment. When inappropriate behaviour occurs while attending an appointment, this is managed using the relevant job seeker compliance system.</p>

<p>Behaving inappropriately means failing to behave in accordance with the standards that would be commonly expected. This includes, but is not limited to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
not following reasonable instructions</li>
		<li>
being disruptive or uncooperative</li>
		<li>
behaving in a manner that is aggressive, violent or offensive</li>
		<li>
harassing other people on the premises</li>
		<li>
behaving in a manner that causes risk to the health and safety of themselves or others, or</li>
		<li>
being intoxicated or consuming intoxicants during the appointment</li>
		</ul>
<p>Generally, this type of behaviour is only considered inappropriate when serious in nature, deliberate and within the job seeker's control.</p>

<p>When misconduct is reported by a provider, but during the compliance investigation Services Australia establish that behaviour was not in the job seeker's control free text is sent to the provider to ensure this can be considered for future servicing.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Under the Targeted Compliance Framework, when a job seeker fails to attend, is not punctual or behaves inappropriately at a compulsory appointment, a mutual obligation failure has been committed. When a job seeker has been notified that they are required to record their attendance at a third party appointment and do not do so, a mutual obligation failure has also been committed if they do not contact their provider to advise of difficulties they are experiencing with recording attendance by close of business on the day of appointment.</p>

<p>Following a mutual obligation failure, participation payments are not payable until the job seeker contacts their provider and meets a reconnection requirement notified by the provider.</p>

<p>When providers report that a mutual obligation failure has been committed, the job seeker's participation payments are automatically suspended, Services Australia lifts the payment suspension when the provider electronically notifies that the conditions for lifting the payment suspension have been met. Participation payments are cancelled if the reconnection requirement is not met within four weeks.</p>

<p>Job seekers in the warning zone will accrue one demerit when the provider&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
is not satisfied the job seeker made prior contact or that this was unreasonable and the job seeker has a valid reason for failing to punctually attend, or</li>
		<li>
determines that misconduct has occurred and behaviour was within the job seeker's control</li>
		</ul>
<p>Job seekers in the financial penalty zone will incur a financial penalty unless&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
their provider closes the Non-Compliance Report on contact with the job seeker to discuss their non-attendance because they are satisfied the job seeker has a valid reason, or</li>
		<li>
the job seeker satisfies Services Australia during a compliance investigation that they had reasonable excuse or that inappropriate behaviour was not within their control. Participation Solutions Team (PST)-skilled Services Officers are responsible for conducting these compliance investigations</li>

<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Managing non-compliance for CDP job seekers - CDP Job Seeker Compliance Framework</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Under the CDP Job Seeker Compliance Framework, non-attendance at an appointment arranged with or by a Community Development Program (CDP) provider is managed in various ways. The action taken is based on agreed processes, policy, and legislation for each type of appointment.</p>

<p><strong>Appointment is with the CDP provider</strong></p>

<p>When a CDP job seeker does not attend an appointment with their CDP provider, or contact prior to explain why they are unable to attend, their provider may submit&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a Non-Attendance Report (NAR), or</li>
		<li>
a NAR and a Provider Appointment Report (PAR)</li>
		</ul>
<p>A valid NAR will result in the suspension of the CDP job seeker's payment 'Non-attendance report received' (ANR). Payment will remain suspended until the CDP job seeker&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
attends a re-engagement appointment, or</li>
		<li>
the provider determines the CDP job seeker is not required to re-engage</li>
		</ul>
<p>A valid PAR will result in a compliance failure for investigation by Services Australia. The type of failure generated from a PAR will depend on the type of appointment the CDP job seeker did not attend&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
failure to attend a 'regular' appointment will result in a non-attendance failure</li>
		<li>
failure to attend an appointment that was a reconnection requirement will result in a reconnection failure</li>
		</ul>
<p>An applied non-attendance failure, will result in the CDP job seeker entering into a non-attendance failure period. The non-attendance failure period commences from the deemed date of notification by their provider that their participation payment is not payable due to the appointment they missed, and will end the day before the re-engagement appointment or the day before the CDP job seeker is advised they are no longer required to re-engage. The procedure, <a href="../job-seekers/001-10120110-01.html">Non-attendance failure penalties</a>, contains further information.</p>

<p>An applied reconnection failure will result in the CDP job seeker entering into a reconnection failure period until they comply, or are notified they are no longer required to comply, with a further reconnection requirement.</p>

<p>A reconnection failure period commences from the reconnection failure event date and continues until the day before the CDP job seeker either complies with a further reconnection requirement, or are notified they are no longer required to comply with the requirement. The procedure, <a href="../job-seekers/001-10120010-01.html">Reconnection failure penalties</a>, contains further information.</p>

<p>Once a valid NAR has been submitted, if the CDP job seeker does not contact the CDP provider to discuss the missed appointment within 28 days, their participation payment may be cancelled 'Did not contact provider' (DCP) and a new claim will be required if the CDP job seeker wishes payment to restart.</p>

<p><strong>Appointment is with a third party</strong></p>

<p>Under the CDP Job Seeker Compliance Framework, a provider may choose to manage failure to attend a compulsory appointment they have arranged for a CDP job seeker with a third party by submitting a Participation Report to Services Australia.</p>

<p>Upon receipt of the Participation Report&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a connection failure will be generated, and</li>
		<li>
the CDP job seeker will be sent a notification advising them to contact the Participation Solutions Team (PST) as soon as possible to discuss the non-compliance event</li>
		</ul>
<p>A PST-skilled Service Officer will investigate the compliance action and if the CDP job seeker does not provide a reasonable excuse for failing to provide suitable job search efforts, a connection failure will be applied.</p>

<p>During the investigation, the PST-skilled Service Officer will notify the CDP job seeker of a reconnection requirement to attend an appointment with the CDP provider. Non-attendance with this appointment will be managed through the NAR/PAR process.</p>

<p>Applied connection failures contribute to a pattern of non-compliance for a Comprehensive Compliance Assessment (CCA). An automatic CCA will be generated based on the number of connection, non-attendance and/or reconnection failures applied in a serious failure assessment period. When a decision is made that a CDP job seeker has been persistently non-compliant, a serious failure may be applied.</p>

<p>If the CDP job seeker does not comply with a reconnection requirement within 28 days of first being asked to do so, their participation payment may be automatically cancelled 'Customer failed to re-engage' (CDR) and a new claim will be required if the CDP job seeker wishes payment to restart.</p>
