<p><strong>When do I get paid?</strong></p>

<p>A&#58; There are a number of factors that may affect the start date of payments such as waiting and exclusion periods. The start date of payments are assessed on a case by case basis.</p>

<p>As a general rule job seekers must supply all supporting documentation and meet the qualification and eligibility criteria for payment.</p>

<p><strong>Job seekers subject to RapidConnect requirements</strong></p>

<p>Generally job seekers are payable once they have met their RapidConnect requirement by either&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
acknowledge your Job Plan online (if referred to the Workforce Australia Online),</li>
		<li>
or attend an appointment (if referred to an Employment Service Provider)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Failure to meet RapidConnect requirements within 28 days of the Participation Interview, the income support claim is rejected or cancelled, (reason code FCJ '<a href="../ongoing-contact/102-10010180-01.html">Failed to connect with Employment Providers</a>').</p>

<p><strong>Job seekers not subject to RapidConnect requirements</strong></p>

<p>Generally, when a job seeker is exempt from RapidConnect requirements the start day is the date the claim was submitted with all supporting documentation if they meet the qualification and eligibility for payment.</p>

<p>For more information, see&#58;</p>

<p><strong>Can I change my provider?</strong></p>

<p>Job seekers will select or be automatically allocated a provider including Online Employment Services during their initial contact (Participation Interview) with the agency.</p>

<p>When a job seeker registration is completed, eligible job seekers will be referred to Workforce Australia Online (unless already connected to a Workforce Australia Employment Services Provider) to access the assistance available through Workforce Australia. The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations may determine a Workforce Australia provider is more suitable for the job seeker and refer them onto the provider at commencement.</p>

<p>Job seekers who approach Services Australia for any transfer reason should be advised to discuss their situation with their Employment Services Provider. Services Australia has no role in transferring job seekers between providers.</p>

<p>CDP providers deliver a range of services based on the needs of both the community and the individuals in that community.</p>

<p><strong>What are mutual obligation requirements?</strong></p>

<p>Mutual obligation requirements are designed to ensure that unemployed people receiving activity tested income support payments are actively looking for work and are participating in activities that will help them into employment.</p>

<p>When claiming a payment, job seekers are generally required to engage with employment services before receiving payment. Job seekers will then be required to enter into a Job Plan which outlines all of a job seeker's mutual obligation requirements. These requirements will generally include looking for and accepting suitable work, attending appointments with their employment services provider, attending all job interviews and undertaking other suitable activities.</p>

<p>Job seekers' mutual obligation requirements are generally determined by the following factors&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
age</li>
		<li>
assessed work capacity</li>
		<li>
the primary responsibility for the care of a child.</li>
		</ul>

<p><strong>What sort of activities can I do, I have school aged children and my time is limited?</strong></p>

<p>Principal carers have Part-time requirements mutual obligation requirements.</p>

<p>'Part-time' refers to the ways in which their requirements vary from other job seekers, and the extra flexibilities they are allowed, in recognition of their family care responsibilities.</p>

<p>This means mutual obligations, appointments and other requirements should be scheduled to occur during school hours only (generally between 9 am and 3 pm during school terms), unless otherwise requested or agreed to by the principal carer. This includes participation in employment services and requirements negotiated by providers.</p>
