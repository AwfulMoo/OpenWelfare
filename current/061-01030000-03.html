<p><strong>Indefinite portability</strong></p>

<p>All Age Pension customers were portable indefinitely under the pre September 2000 rules. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> although Age Pension was portable indefinitely, there were still situations where payment ceased on departure or 12 months after. For example, where customer was subject to former resident rules, customer was subject to a proportional rate and had no working life residence, customer was paid under an International Agreement which does not allow portability.</p>

<p><strong>Exemptions from proportional rate</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Granted a pension before 2 July 1986, or</li>
		<li>
Australian resident on 8 May 1985 and travelled to a non-Agreement country, or</li>
		<li>
Australian resident on 8 May 1985, travelled to an Agreement country before 1 January 1996, or</li>
		<li>
Australian resident on 8 May 1985, travelled to an Agreement country on or after 1 January 1996 and has not been an Australian resident since</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Use of partner's working life residence (WLR) if higher</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the customer is married to an Age Pension or Disability Support Pension (DSP) recipient and the partner has a higher WLR than the customer, the customer will be paid according to the partner's WLR</li>
		<li>
If the customer was previously partnered to a customer and at the time they were both receiving either Age Pension or DSP pension and the partner died or separated from the customer and the former partner had a higher WLR than the customer, the customer will be paid according to the former partner's WLR</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Length of portability before proportional rate</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
If subject to a proportional rate, a customer has 12 months after departure rather than 26 weeks until proportionalisation or cancellation if WLR is zero</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Advantages of the previous rules</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Portability rules prior to 20 September 2000 included several exemptions from a proportional rate</li>
		<li>
The former rules allow a customer to use their partner's (or former partner's) WLR</li>
		<li>
The length of absence before proportionalisation is 12 months rather than 26 weeks</li>		</ul>

Current rules do not allow any exemption from a proportional rate other than customers whose inability to work occurred in Australia</li>

<p>Customers may be entitled to a portability extension if they reside overseas, are temporarily in Australia and are unable to depart due to unforeseen circumstances. The event preventing the customer's travel must have occurred within the 26 week period.</p>

<p>A discretionary extension must be for a definite period, during which time the customer's situation is expected to change and enable return to their usual country of residence.</p>

<p>The appropriate delegation to grant or reject an application for an extension of payment overseas, or to approve or reject an approved reason period of portability, is held by a specialist Service Officer in CIS. A Service Officer without this delegation must refer all requests to CIS specialist staff.</p>

<p><strong>Suggested advice to customer&#58;</strong></p>

<p>'Under normal circumstances you will lose your portability savings after 26 weeks in Australia. With the portability savings extension, you will continue to maintain the benefits of your portability savings until the end of the extension.'</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Determine the date customer is able to depart Australia; apply extension until then</li>
		<li>
Determine the Date of Event (DOV) for use on <strong>RSCD</strong> screen. This will be the start date of the extension, i.e. the date they would have lost their portability savings</li>
		</ul>
<p>The portability extension must be recorded in Customer First&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The <strong>RSCD</strong> screen should show the travel details advised by the customer. If the customer advised travel details is blank, complete as follows&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Code the arrival date for the relevant arrival in the <strong>Event Date</strong> field</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Under the Portability <strong>Reason</strong> heading, code the <strong>Event Date</strong> field as follows&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Use the date that the customer will lose their portability savings from</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Complete the coding required&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Country of Location AUSTRALIA</li>
			<li>
Portability Reason&#58; EXT</li>
			<li>
Portability End date</li>
			<li>
Ext Rsn</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Code the <strong>Source</strong> and <strong>DOR</strong> fields</li>
		<li>
Go to the Assessment Results (<strong>AR</strong>) screen and check the results are correct</li>
		<li>
Do not inhibit the advice</li>
		<li>
Finalise the activity</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p>Check that the portability savings indicator on <strong>RSS</strong>/<strong>PSV</strong> (as appropriate) is correct. If the savings indicator has changed from Y to N (for example, when coding the extension retrospectively), this will need to be manually updated back to Y.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Select <strong>Continue</strong></li>
		</ul>
<p>The EXT start date should commence after the end of the 26 week portability savings period. For example, customer arrives in Australia on 1 January 2022. The allowable portability savings period of 26 weeks expires on 1July 2022. The coding start date for portability savings extension will be 2 July 2022.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the portability extension will move the date that the savings provisions on <strong>RSS</strong>/<strong>PSV</strong> will change from Y to N, from 26 weeks after the customer’s arrival in Australia, to the extension end date +1. If the customer remains in Australia after the extension end date, the savings provision will be changed.</p>

<p>Also note that any change to the <strong>RSCD</strong> screen, where a retrospective decision is applied, ensure that the <strong>PSV</strong> screen is displaying the savings provision correctly. If not, this will need to be updated manually.</p>
