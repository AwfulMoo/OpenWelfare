<p>This document explains Farm Household Allowance (FHA).</p>
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GI_Government_inte"></a>
<h2 id="bp01_L2GI_Government_inte">Government intent</h2>


<p>FHA is an income support payment delivered by Services Australia on behalf of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. It came into effect from 1 July 2014.</p>

<p>FHA provides eligible farmers and their partners who are experiencing financial hardship with assistance and support to improve their long term financial situation. It can be used to address all causes of hardship and is <strong>not dependent</strong> on climatic triggers or associated with drought declarations.</p>

<p>The Australian Government announced changes to increase the cumulative time period that individuals can receive FHA. From 1 August 2018, eligible farmers and their partners are able to access up to 4 years (1,460 days) of payment in specified 10 year periods. The first 10 year period commenced on 1 July 2014. The second 10 year period will commence on 1 July 2024. Customers that have received 1,460 days of FHA payment will be able to apply for FHA again from 1 July 2024. This gives farm families the opportunity to take steps to improve their circumstances.</p>

<p>Although specific FHA legislation and policy applies, it refers to social security law for general provisions that apply to JobSeeker Payment (JSP) and Youth Allowance (YA).</p>

<p>Part 5 of the Farm Household Support Act modifies how the Social Security Act and Social Security Administration Act operate, so that those Acts can apply in relation to FHA.</p>

<p>There is also Rules that work with the Farm Household Support Act and modify the Social Security Act to deliver the Farm Household Allowance Program.</p>

<p>Specific eligibility and payability provisions apply to farmers and their partners claiming FHA. FHA customers are also subject to some waiting period provisions.</p>

<p>The income and asset tests that apply for FHA are linked to those that apply for JSP and YA customers, but there are significant differences&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
From 11 June 2020 the FHA assets test combines personal and farm assets under a single test with a limit of $5.5 million either for a single customer or a couple. Prior to 11 June 2020, non-farm assets and farm assets are assessed separately for FHA, and both asset tests must have been met to be eligible for FHA</li>
		<li>
From 11 June 2020, customers who qualify for FHA will receive the maximum rate of FHA payable </li>
		<li>
The customer's estimate of their farm enterprise business income and any directly related business is combined to obtain the total farm business income</li>
		<li>
FHA customers may be able to reduce their non-farm income by up to $100,000 if their total farm business income is a loss</li>

<p><strong>Pre-commencement debt </strong></p>

<p>Reconciliation debt (FHA) (RCN) <strong>raised prior to Royal Assent 24 July 2021</strong>. </p>

<p>Pre-commencement RCN debts fall into 2 categories&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Partial rate RCN debts&#58;</strong> customers with a pre-commencement RCN debt, where they were entitled to a partial rate (reduced rate but not to NIL) at any time during the relevant financial year, are eligible to have the RCN debt waived in full, without the need to ‘trade’ clock days. <br>Partial rate BIR debts did not have days re-credited as available clock days when the debt was raised</li>
		<li>
<strong>Nil rate RCN debts&#58;</strong> customers with a pre-commencement RCN debt where they were entitled to a NIL rate (zero rate for entire BIR period), will be required to 'trade' any available clock days to have their debt reduced or waived. This is because they had the benefit of clock days being re-credited when the original BIR debt was raised. FHA recipients with days to trade will have the choice of whether to accept the waiver. Some recipients may wish to continue to receive FHA, rather than reduce their debt by trading days.</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Post-commencement debt</strong> </p>

<p>RCN debt raised on an after Royal Assent 24 July 2021.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Customers with a post-commencement RCN debt will have their debt automatically waived in full without the need to ‘trade’ any clock days regardless of whether they received a partial rate or NIL rate during the financial year/s being assessed for BIR. This process will be automatic, the new BIR system functionality will apply the debt waiver and will not recredit clock days where the customer had zero or partial entitlement for the year been reconciled</li>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>This legislative amendment makes 2 significant changes to the Farm Household Support Act 2014 (FHS Act).</p>

<p><strong>Remove requirement for FHA customers to serve an Ordinary Waiting Period (OWP) and Liquid Assets Waiting Period</strong></p>

<p>This requirement has been removed because farmers were already attached to the workforce. It also required them to use their liquid assets for self-support before FHA became payable. This risked diverting those assets from supporting the operation of the farm enterprise.</p>

<p>This change applies to claims&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
submitted on or after 5 April 2017</li>
		<li>
on hand and not yet determined as at 5 April 2017</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Definition of farm assets</strong></p>

<p>The FHA Farm assets test was permanently set at $5 million on 1 July 2019 under the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2019.</p>

<p>The existing definition of farm assets in section 35 of the FHS Act is framed in restrictive terms. That is, an asset is a farm asset only if it falls within 1 of the categories specified in that section.</p>

<p>The Farm Household Support Amendment Act 2017 (Amendment Act) broadened the meaning of a farm asset to include any asset which is used or held wholly or mainly for carrying out a farm enterprise, except for cash, bank deposits and Farm Management Deposits. The Amendment Act defines and specifically includes water entitlement rights and some shares as farm assets.</p>

<p>The new definition of farm assets is applied to claims submitted on or after 5 April 2017.</p>

<p>For all claims determined on or after 5 April 2017, the assessment was based on the definition of farm assets in section 35 of the FHS Act and the provisions of the Farm Household Support (Non-farm Assets)</p>
