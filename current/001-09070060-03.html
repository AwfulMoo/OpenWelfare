<p>To be included in the Job Plan as an approved activity, voluntary work must&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
occur without payment other than for out of pocket expenses</li>
		<li>
have a community focus</li>
		<li>
not be undertaken in the job seeker's own home</li>
		<li>
not primarily promote a particular religious or political view</li>
		<li>
not involve working for the job seeker's or a family member of the job seeker's own organisation</li>
		<li>
not involve violence towards people or damage to property</li>
		<li>
not undertake tasks which would normally be done by a paid employee, including a casual or part-time paid employee</li>
		<li>
not reduce hours usually worked by a paid employee or reduce overtime of an existing worker</li>
		</ul>
<p>When assessing voluntary work as an approved activity for job seekers aged 55 and over, the above points must be considered, as well as whether the organisation is or can be approved for voluntary work.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the job seeker must attend a 'base' or like place, and is participating in a work-like activity for the duration of their time on call, these hours may count towards their voluntary work hours.</p>

<p>If the job seeker is going about their daily life, without participating in any work-like activity while on call, these hours cannot be counted towards their voluntary work hours.</p>

<p>If the voluntary work placement is not approved, the job seeker's record should include a <strong>DOC</strong> to advise why the voluntary work activity has not been approved. Ensure the job seeker is verbally told of the decision.</p>

<p>If approving the voluntary work activity, the Service Officer will need to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Select the <strong>Approved Voluntary Work organisation details</strong> workflow, and add the details of the voluntary work organisation (including their Organisation ID number/LAD number)</li>

For Disability Employment Services (DES) provider managed job seekers, <a href="../job-seekers/001-09070060-03.html#bp03_tbl_Initial_assessm_Step05">go to Step 5</a></li>
		<li>
Negotiate a Job Plan with the job seeker that reflects the activities approved, as fully meeting the job seeker's mutual obligation requirements. The job seeker will now be Centrelink Managed</li>
		<li>
Select the <strong>VWK</strong> (voluntary work) activity in the Job Plan so that activity start and end dates are included<br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the Job Plan will reflect the new dates on the Activity and Exemption Summary (<strong>AEX</strong>) screen once accepted by the job seeker. For job seekers who are not DES participants, do not update <strong>AEX</strong> prior to negotiating Job Plan and it being accepted</li>
		<li>
Select other appropriate activities in the Job Plan where a combination of activities are being approved, e.g. <strong>VPE</strong> (voluntary and part-time work combined). If the job seeker is doing a combination of voluntary work and self-employment, use both codes '<strong>SEL</strong>' and '<strong>VWK</strong>'</li>
		<li>
When updating the Job Plan, remove any Employment Services Provider compulsory activities. If the updates will make the job seeker Centrelink managed, the Service Officer does not need to contact the Employment Services Provider to tell them of the changes to the Job Plan</li>
		<li>
If the <strong>AEX</strong> screen is not automatically updated after negotiating the Job Plan, manually code the details ensuring the corresponding activities and dates are recorded on the <strong>AEX</strong> screen<br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> <strong>VWK</strong> and other approved activities cannot be coded on the <strong>AEX</strong> screen for more than 12 months at a time. This ensures the approved activity is reviewed and a new Job Plan is negotiated every 12 months if the voluntary work activity is continuing</li>
		<li>
Close any Digital Image Work items associated with the voluntary work activity. See <a target="_blank" href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-10020040-01.html">Viewing Centrelink customers' digital images</a></li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> do <strong>not</strong> update the Job Plan if the customer is a Disability Employment Services (DES) participant.</p>

<p>Where the Activity and Exemption Summary (<strong>AEX</strong>) screen is updated to record the voluntary work type of <strong>VWK</strong> or <strong>VPE</strong> coded as an approved activity for 52 weeks, a Voluntary Work 12 Monthly Review (VWR) is automatically generated for 48 weeks in the future to alert Service Officers to review the job seeker's voluntary work.</p>

<p>Once the date of the review is reached, an appointment will be automatically booked and a letter sent to the job seeker advising details of the appointment and of the need to provide details of the voluntary work organisation at the interview.</p>

<p>If a job seeker fails to attend the interview, make 2 genuine attempts to contact them and if they cannot be contacted, their payment should be suspended with the reason 'Failed to Attend Interview' (<strong>FAI</strong>).</p>

<p>Following successful contact with Services Australia, reschedule the interview and when the job seeker attends their appointment, payment can be restored. Service Officers must record a <strong>DOC</strong> with reasons for non-attendance.</p>

<p>If an appointment cannot be booked within 4 weeks of the review date, the system creates a Manual Follow-up (MFU) activity prompting manual action for the VWR to prompt Service Officers to manually book an appointment.</p>

<p>At this review, the Service Officer should do the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Check if the job seeker is between 55 and 59 and has been getting their current income support payment for more than 12 months. These job seekers can now fully meet their mutual obligation requirements solely with voluntary work. There is no longer a minimum of 15 hours paid work for these job seekers</li>
		<li>
Check the job seeker intends to, and can continue with voluntary work to fully meet their mutual obligation requirements</li>
		<li>
Discuss the suitability of the job seeker's current activities</li>
		<li>
Re-verify the job seeker's participation in the voluntary activity with their current volunteer organisation or link the job seeker to a different organisation via the Approved Voluntary Work organisation details workflow if required</li>
		<li>
If the voluntary work placement or organisation is not approved. The job seeker's record should include a <strong>DOC</strong> advising the reason the voluntary work activity has not been approved. Ensure the job seeker is told verbally of the decision</li>
		<li>
If the voluntary work will no longer be an approved activity, Services Australia must end date the voluntary work activity on the <strong>AEX</strong> screen</li>
		<li>
Investigate <a href="../job-seekers/001-09070000-01.html">other approved activities</a> for the job seeker if required</li>
		<li>
If the job seeker will <strong>not</strong> be doing voluntary work, either alone or combined with part-time paid work (including self-employment) for at least 30 hrs per fortnight, advise of the requirement to undertake suitable job search activities. The job seeker must be immediately reconnected to their Employment Services Provider or referred to an appropriate provider if not already active with a provider and must attend all appointments</li>
		<li>
<a href="../job-seekers/001-09100010-01.html">Renegotiate the Job Plan</a> to continue voluntary work or combinations of other approved activities for up to another 12 months where the activities will continue to fully meet the job seekers requirements (such as, self-employment, part-time work, or a combination with voluntary work). If voluntary work or other approved activities are not approved, do not update the job seekers job plan. The job seeker will become provider managed and the job plan negotiated by the job seekers Employment Services Provider</li>
		<li>
Update the start and end date for approved activities on the <strong>AEX</strong> screen as required, (dates should align with Job Plan)</li>
		<li>
Close any Digital Image Work items associated with the voluntary work activity. See <a target="_blank" href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-10020040-01.html">Viewing Centrelink customers' digital images</a></li>
