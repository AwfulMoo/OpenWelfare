<p>On 1 July 2011, Paul has an annual child support entitlement of $5,000.</p>

<p>On 1 March 2012, Child Support advises a new annual child support entitlement of $10,000 with effect from 1 October 2011.</p>

<p>Calculation of annual maintenance income under the Entitlement Method on 1 March&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
$5,000 for the period 1 July - 30 September 2011 (92 days) = $1,260</li>
		<li>
$10,000 for the period 1 October 2011 - 30 June 2012 (274 days) = $7,506</li>
		<li>
Annualised amount = $8,767 x 366/365 = $8,791</li>
		</ul>
<p>On 1 April 2012, Paul contacts about the FTB Part A rate for 2011-12. Paul is unable to collect the arrears associated with the backdated Child Support assessment.</p>

<p>Summary&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Paul received the original amount ($5,000) during the period 1 July 2011 - 28 February 2012</li>
		<li>
Paul advised that from the 1 March 2012 the higher rate of child support ($10,000 per annum) was collected after becoming aware of the new assessment</li>
		<li>
Paul advised unable to collect any arrears from the payer for the period 1 October 2011 - 28 February 2012</li>
		</ul>
<p>Although Paul did not receive the arrears associated with the backdated assessment, the new assessment amount was received, and Paul was not required to transfer to Child Support collection. Paul has met the MAT for the full year through continuing to collect (ongoing) the amount assessed by Child Support. Paul's FTB rate for 2011-12 can be adjusted and the non-paid child support arrears taken out of the FTB assessment.</p>

<p>Paul's adjusted child support amount for 2011-12 would be $6,671.43 for the whole financial year&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
$5,000 for the period 1 July 2011 - 28 February 2012 (243 days) = $3,328.77</li>
		<li>
$10,000 for the period 1 March 2012 - 30 June 2012 (122 days) = $3,342.46</li>
		<li>
annualised amount = $3,328.77 + $3,342.46 = $6,671.43</li>		</ul>

		<li>

		</ul>
<p>For ongoing FTB Part A payments, annual maintenance income was assessed as $10,000 from 1 July 2005 and $8,005 from 1 April 2006.</p>

<p>Under <a href="../families/007-07060030-01.html">mandatory continuous adjustment of FTB</a>, on 1 April any potential overpayment of FTB is based on estimated maintenance income of $8,005.</p>

<p>At FTB reconciliation, annual maintenance income is assessed as $8,005 for the whole financial year.</p>

<p>A negative adjustment of -$6,005, ($2,000 - $10,000) x 274/ 365, is calculated due the backdated Child Support assessment. This amount would be deducted from the paying parent's annual maintenance income if Helen confirmed this child support was paid back.</p>

<p><strong>Example of the OVP method&#58;</strong></p>

<p>Jane (payee) received $5,000 in the 2016/2017 financial year. Jane then contacts Centrelink to apply for a formal review of the Family Tax Benefit (FTB) after receiving advice from Child Support of an overpayment due to being entitled to a lower amount of child support.</p>

<p>The Child Support Unit (CSJ) contacts Child Support via the Income Estimate Excel template, advising Jane has been overpaid $3,000 in the 2016/2017 financial year. Using this information, the CSJ code the new received amount of $2,000 for the 2016/2017 financial year. This results in 2016/2017 being re-reconciled.</p>

<p>In column I of the 'Overpayments' sheet, Child Support advise that this is an OVP rather than a CR. This means that John (payer) will not make any child support payments to Jane until the value of the $3,000 is used up. John has an ongoing assessment of $3500pa. Jane is placed on the Entitlement Method, which assesses Jane’s ongoing FTB on her ongoing child support assessment ($3500). During the financial year, the full $3000 is drawn down, and John then pays the remaining $500. </p>

<p>Prior to reconciliation, MNOI needs to be coded with $3500, otherwise reconciliation will occur based on the $500 which is shown on MNGP.</p>

<p>Brenda (payee) received $14,000 in the 2016/2017 financial year. Brenda then contacts Centrelink to apply for a formal  review of the Family Tax Benefit (FTB) after receiving advice from Child Support of an overpayment due to being entitled to a lower amount of child support.</p>

<p>The Child Support Unit (CSU) contacts Child Support via the spreadsheet, advising Brenda has been overpaid $3,000 in the 2016/2017 financial year. Using this information, the CSU code the new received amount of $11,000 for the 2016/2017 financial year.</p>

<p>In column I of the 'overpayments' sheet, Child Support advise that this is a CR rather than an OVP. Child Support have paid Paul (payer) $3,000 the amount that was overpaid, and the $3,000 has been converted to a CR debt for Brenda.</p>

<p>In column J of the 'overpayments' sheet, Child Support record 10%, which means that 10% of any amounts paid by Paul to Brenda will be withheld by Child Support to repay the $3,000 CR debt.</p>

<p>Brenda is placed on the Entitlement Method, which assesses her ongoing FTB on her ongoing child support assessment ($9000). </p>

<p><strong>Example continued&#58;</strong></p>

<p>Paul makes a $600 payment on 20 April. The details Centrelink receive electronically from Child Support show a $540 payment. This is because Child Support only send the net amount of the payment, not the gross amount. As Brenda is on the Entitlement Method, she continues to be assessed against the $9000 assessment. Brenda remains Child Support collect for the full financial year.</p>

<p>Prior to reconciliation, MNOI needs to be coded with the total amount that was drawn down against the child support debt (shown in Cuba), plus all payments shown on the MNGP screen.</p>

<p>Zara is the receiving parent in a child support case. Zara's child support case against the payer John was registered for private collection. Child Support used a provisional income for John to calculate the amount of child support payable because John had not lodged tax returns for the 12/13, 13/14 and 14/15 financial years.</p>

<p>In September 2015, Child Support received information from the Australian Tax Office (ATO) about John's income. As the income assessed by the ATO was higher than the provisional income used for John, child support reassessed the amount John should have paid Zara for the periods from 1 July 2012 onwards based on John's actual income. This resulted in an increase to the child support assessed rate for those periods with the result of child support arrears owing to Zara.</p>

<p>As the amount of child support Zara was entitled to for past period increased, her FTB for those periods was reassessed as Zara is deemed to have received the assessed amounts. This resulted in an FTB overpayment of $5000 over the three financial years. This is because Zara's child support case is private collect and the FTB is based on the amount of child support Zara is assessed to receive, not the amount that is actually collected.</p>

<p>Zara attempted to collect the increased liability and arrears from John privately, and when unable to do this, has asked Child Support to start collecting.</p>

<p>Unless there are exceptional circumstances, Child Support can only collect arrears for 3 months prior to the date Zara asked for collection to begin. Zara must seek legal advice about enforcing the remainder of the arrears through court action. Centrelink raised the $5000 FTB debt, which Zara had to start repaying immediately.</p>

<p>Zara sought legal advice and provided Centrelink with a letter from her legal practitioner advising that they were unable to assist her as it would not be cost effective. Zara should be referred to a Centrelink social worker to discuss a partial exemption from enforcing the child support arrears. If granted, an adjustment would be made to the FTB payments to reflect the amount of child support Zara actually collected.</p>
