<P></P>

<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_Early_reporting>Early reporting</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P><STRONG>Reporting Statement (SU19) due date</STRONG></P>
<P>A statement reporter job seeker must report on their on their Entitlement Period End Date (EPED). The questions in the Reporting Statement relate to the full fortnight period or the relevant period for variable reporters.</P>
<P>Early reporting may be accepted if:</P>
<UL>
<LI>a customer changes their pay day code, see <A href="../payment-delivery/103-05030000-01.html">Changing Entitlement Period End Dates (EPED)</A></LI>
<LI>arrangements are in place for national public holiday processing. Job seekers will be notified of the early reporting date, see <A href="../job-seekers/001-09040080-01.html">Payment and reporting arrangements over national public holiday periods</A></LI>
<LI>customer advises they are going overseas, see <A href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010010-03.html">Recording and correcting employment income details</A></LI></UL>
<P>Customers can view a summary of due to report dates and reporting periods in their online account. All reporting periods within 12 weeks of the date viewed will display. The summary is accessed by selecting <STRONG>Income and Assets</STRONG> &gt; <STRONG>Employment Income</STRONG> &gt; <STRONG>Next reporting periods</STRONG> from the menu.</P>
<P><STRONG>Variable reporting</STRONG></P>
<P>A job seeker on variable reporting can use self-managed service reporting on their non-stimulus Entitlement Period End Day (EPED). A job seeker must report employment income paid in their reporting fortnight if they are a notification reporter.</P>
<P>If the job seeker, or their partner, receives a family assistance payment, updates to the estimate due to the change in income may be needed.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P></P>
<DIV class=twisty><A name=bp01_L2GT_Late_reporting class=anchor></A>
<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_Late_reporting>Late reporting</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P><STRONG>Determining and recording a late report</STRONG></P>
<P>If a job seeker reports late or a self service reporter is referred to a Service Officer after the report 'drops through', discuss the reason for late reporting and remind the job seeker to report on their due date to avoid delays in payment.</P>
<P>Determine:</P>
<UL>
<LI>whether or not the reason for late reporting is acceptable</LI>
<LI>if any special circumstances apply for reporting form late, and</LI>
<LI>if payment will be approved and processed</LI></UL>
<P>The Service Officer must record:</P>
<UL>
<LI>whether or not the reason is satisfactory/acceptable, and</LI>
<LI>for job seekers with mutual obligation requirements or pending compliance investigations, how the job seeker has met requirements during this period</LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>Reason for late reporting not acceptable</STRONG></P>
<P>If the reason(s) for late reporting is/are not acceptable, the Service Officer can cancel/suspend payment and advise the job seeker of the decision. If payment is cancelled, advise the job seeker to test their eligibility and re-claim. Job seekers must be advised in writing the reason their payment is cancelled/suspended.</P>
<P><STRONG>Outstanding compliance action</STRONG></P>
<P>Where a job seeker has a participation-related payment suspension or outstanding compliance action, they will need to re-engage with their Employment Services Provider and/or speak to the Participation Solutions Team (PST) about any outstanding failure investigation before reporting can be finalised. Service Officers must check the Participation Compliance workflow summary and where the:</P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Completed/Provider to Action</STRONG> section shows outstanding compliance actions the provider is responsible for managing, advise the job seeker to contact their provider, and/or</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Outstanding</STRONG> section shows a compliance investigation is outstanding, assist the job seeker to contact the PST</LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> any changes to the customer's circumstances on the Reporting Statement (SU19) must be updated before the customer contacts the PST.</P>
<P><STRONG>Self service for reporting customers</STRONG></P>
<P>The obligation to report on their due date applies to job seekers who use self service (online, Express Plus mobile app or phone self service). Self service reporters can report <STRONG>up to 13 days after the due date</STRONG> without any penalty or cancellation.</P>
<P>If the job seeker tries to report more than 13 days after their due Entitlement Period End Day (EPED) using the self service channels, reporting will not be available as they will be cancelled Did Not Lodge (CAN-DNL). The job seeker will receive a message which will refer them to a Service Officer for assistance.</P>
<P>Job seekers can:</P>
<UL>
<LI>update and correct reported employment income online using the Update employment income service to change initial report</LI>
<LI>correct employment income reported in the last 6 reporting periods</LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> employment income confirmed via the Single Touch Payroll (STP) channel cannot be corrected via self service. Customers must discuss changes and provide evidence to staff.</P>
<P>Genuine attempts must be made to transition customers to report via self service options before assisted reporting is completed, unless an Exception applies.</P>
<P><STRONG>Late Reporting Customers (LRC) screen</STRONG></P>
<P>The <STRONG>LRC</STRONG> screen lists names and home and/or mobile phone contact numbers for customers who are due to report on a specified date but have not yet reported.</P>
<P>The <STRONG>LRC</STRONG> screen is not to be used for these customers regardless of their choice of reporting channel.</P>
<P>See <A href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-18120555-01.html">Reporting screens</A> for information on the <STRONG>LRC</STRONG> screen.</P>
<P><STRONG>Customer fails to report</STRONG></P>
<P>A job seeker's payment will not be generated until the Reporting Statement is submitted and processed. Late reporting (after 5pm on the due date) can result in the customer and/or their partner's payment being delayed.</P>
<P>If the <STRONG>partner</STRONG> is a:</P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>notification reporter</STRONG>, payment is made automatically regardless of whether the customer has reported or not</LI>
<LI><STRONG>statement reporter</STRONG> (fortnightly/2 weekly), payment is generated when the job seeker reports. Usually when the job seeker reports, their partner's payment is generated, unless the partner has mutual obligation requirements and is also required to report</LI></UL>
<P>If a job seeker fails to report for 2 consecutive fortnights (28 days), the payment will cancel automatically from Date Paid To +1 (DPT +1). For more information, see <A href="../job-seekers/001-19051508-01.html">JobSeeker Payment (JSP) cancellations, suspensions and restorations</A>.</P>
<P><STRONG>Variable reporting customer fails to report</STRONG></P>
<P>If the customer is on variable reporting, payments issued automatically cannot be proven until a Reporting Statement is lodged. For example, if the customer doesn't report within 15 days of their reporting date, payment will cancel back to date last reported +1.</P>
<P>If a job seeker was previously on a variable reporting cycle when cancelled did not lodge (CAN/DNL) or cancelled failed to report (CAN/FRP), the system automatically creates an undetermined debt shell. The debt shell is automatically placed on hold for 21 days to allow time for the job seeker to make contact and report. If the job seeker reports while the debt shell is on hold, it will adjust if the payment is restored. If no report has occurred in the 21 days the debt shell is on hold, the debt can then be investigated.</P>
<P>When a debt shell is created, a cancellation letter is automatically sent to the job seeker. This letter advises the job seeker to report within 14 days of receiving the notification by contacting Services Australia via phone or going to a service centre. The letter includes a warning that failure to report may result in a debt being raised for payments already received within the reporting period.</P>
<P>The expectation for these job seekers is that they contact to discuss their options for preventing the CAN/DNL or CAN/FRP debt.</P>
<P><STRONG>Reporting within 13 weeks of payment cancellation</STRONG></P>
<P>If the job seeker is seeking restoration and reports within 13 weeks of payment cancellation and it is has been determined:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the job seeker was entitled to payment during that period, and</LI>
<LI>continuing ongoing entitlement has been established,</LI></UL>
<P>the payment must be restored from the cancellation date and Reporting Statements are required for each 2 weekly reporting period from their cancellation date. These Reporting Statements can be confirmed verbally if the mutual obligation requirements have been met and all employment income is reported for each 2 weekly reporting period.</P>
<P>When the job seeker's income support payment is:</P>
<UL>
<LI>suspended or cancelled, outstanding compliance action is maintained where it is likely the payment may be restored back to the suspension/cancellation date</LI>
<LI>restored, outstanding compliance action may need to be actioned before reporting can be finalised</LI>
<LI>cancelled for a participation-related reason, the payment may not be restorable and the job seeker will have to reclaim payment</LI></UL>
<P>If the system prompts arrears ensure arrears are correct, particularly if a debt has already been raised due to the job seeker failing to report.</P>
<P>If arrears have been manually adjusted to ensure a duplicate payment is not made, the Service Officer must send an <STRONG>ACTDOC</STRONG> to the relevant Debt Raising Team to allow adjustment of the debt. The Debt Raising Team is responsible for adjusting the debt.</P>
<P><STRONG>Report more than 13 weeks after cancellation</STRONG></P>
<P>Job seekers who try to report more than 13 weeks after notification of cancellation, must lodge a new claim.</P>
<P>If the job seeker applies for a formal review of the cancellation decision, follow normal review and appeal procedures.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
