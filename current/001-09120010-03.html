		<ul>		<li>
contact the medical practitioner via phone to check the relevant information (e.g. may differ from information provided in a current and valid JCA/ESAt report)</li>
		<li>
record details of the additional information provided on a <strong>DOC</strong> including contact details</li>
		<li>
if the medical practitioner has completed an old version of the medical certificate, tell them they can now access the SU415 on Services Australia's website or explain how to order the latest version. See <a href="../people-with-disability/008-09050050-01.html">Centrelink Medical Certificate (SU415 or SU683)</a></li>
		<li>
if the treating health professional is unable to be contacted or further information is required, escalate to appropriate level for advice on whether the information on the medical certificate is sufficient to determine an incapacity exemption (for example, Service Support Officer, Technical Peer Support or Level 2 Helpdesk). <strong>Note&#58;</strong> do <strong>not</strong> place medical certificate on hold. Medical certificate must be actioned</li>
		</ul>
<p>Only grant an exemption if satisfied with the integrity of the information, taking into account all available evidence. If the medical practitioner advises they never issued the certificate or the information is different, discuss with immediate supervisor and complete a Suspected Fraud referral. The <a href="../job-seekers/001-09120010-05.html">Resources</a> page contains a link to the referral form.</p>

<p>A temporary incapacity exemption can be granted if evidence shows that a job seeker with mutual obligation or participation requirements is temporarily unable to work at least 8 hours per week due to a medical condition.</p>

<p>Points to consider when determining if a job seeker can be granted a temporary incapacity exemption&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
exemption is to be based on the <strong>current</strong> medical certificate. Consideration can also be given to additional information provided by&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the Medical Condition Summary (<strong>MCSS</strong>) screen</li>
			<li>
<a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-10020010-01.html">Document Tools</a> to view previously lodged medical evidence</li>
			<li>
current and valid assessment of the job seeker's work capacity (ESAt or JCA reports)</li>
			<li>
reported earnings</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>all medical conditions</strong> listed on the medical certificate must be considered when determining if a temporary incapacity exemption can be granted, <strong>except</strong> where&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the primary condition listed on the medical certificate is primarily attributable to <strong>drug and/or alcohol dependency or misuse</strong> and the job seeker is not a Community Development Program (CDP) participant. A temporary incapacity exemption cannot be granted for this situation. This is regardless of whether there is a secondary temporary condition not related to drug or alcohol, which indicates an exemption may be applied. If the medical certificate does not differentiate between primary and secondary, the Service Officer must determine if the customer's incapacity is wholly or mainly attributable to drug or alcohol dependency/misuse. This can be based on previous medical information provided by the customer and/or a current and valid ESAt or JCA report. If unsure, discuss with appropriate person for assistance (for example, customer's treating doctor, Service Support Officer, Technical Peer Support)</li>		</ul>
		<li>
if all medical conditions listed are <strong>permanent with no exacerbations</strong> with a <strong>prognosis of 24 months or more</strong>, a temporary incapacity exemption cannot be granted</li>
		<li>
a temporary incapacity exemption may be granted where a condition is considered 'permanent', but the prognosis states the resulting incapacity for all work is expected to be temporary (less than 2 years)</li>
		<li>
a prognosis of 'Uncertain' is acceptable and applies to TMP/ PRM/ REC</li>
		<li>
if <strong>multiple medical conditions</strong> are listed, including both temporary and permanent, a temporary incapacity exemption can be granted if the job seeker is unable to work at least 8 hours per week due to at least 1 of the temporary or exacerbated/recurring conditions</li>
		<li>
if the customer has received repeated, continuous exemptions for the same primary conditions, this may indicate their incapacity for work is no longer temporary (expected to persist for less than 2 years). A temporary incapacity exemption can still be granted based on the current medical certificate if it lists new primary conditions, or if the conditions causing incapacity for work have recently changed</li>
		<li>
check if all medical conditions are included in a current and valid ESAt or JCA report. Information from the report can be used unless the new medical evidence indicates the previously assessed medical condition(s) has changed therefore the report is no longer valid (for example, existing spinal condition has worsened or treatment has changed). New conditions are to be assessed based on the latest medical evidence supplied. <strong>Note&#58;</strong></li>
			<ul>			<li>
if there is conflicting information between the medical certificate and a current and valid ESAt/JCA report, and unable to clarify with the health professional, consider escalating to appropriate level for advice if unsure which information to base decision on (for example, Service Support Officer, Technical Peer Support or Level 2 Helpdesk)</li>
			<li>
do not place medical certificate on hold. Medical certificate must be actioned</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Even if the customer is temporarily incapacitated for all work, an exemption may not be granted if the treating medical practitioner has provided information on the medical certificate which clearly shows the customer can meet their requirements in other ways (for example, by undertaking job searches). A decision not to grant an exemption for this reason must be supported by current, clear medical evidence in all cases</li>
		</ul>

<p>Service Officers can assess medical certificates via a guided <strong>Task Selector</strong> in Process Direct.</p>

<p>From 28 September 2019, scanned medical certificates (SU415 and SU683)&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
automatically create a Change of Circumstance (COC) medical certificate activity in Process Direct</li>
		<li>
allocate via Workload Manager (WLM)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Status of work items in WLM&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
When a scanned medical certificate is assessed and completed in Process Direct, the WLM work item will automatically be closed</li>
		<li>
If the task selector is started, but not completed, in Process Direct, the work item will remain open. In these cases the status of the WLM work item should be checked and updated as required as per <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-06050000-01.html">Workload Management</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>To identify the correct medical condition, Service Officers can select the 'Medline' hyperlink on the Medical Condition Information screen, which goes to the MedlinePlus website. Service Officers can use this website to search for relevant medical conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the Process Direct Task Selector, does not allow for the DOR (Date of Receipt) to be changed. Quality On Line (QOL) checkers must disregard the DOR question within the QOL tool.</p>
