<P>A temporary incapacity exemption can be granted if evidence shows that a job seeker with mutual obligation or participation requirements is temporarily unable to work at least 8 hours per week due to a medical condition.</P>
<P>Points to consider when determining if a job seeker can be granted a temporary incapacity exemption:</P>
<UL>
<LI>exemption is to be based on the <STRONG>current</STRONG> medical certificate. Consideration can also be given to additional information provided by:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>the Medical Condition Summary (<STRONG>MCSS</STRONG>) screen</LI>
<LI><A href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-10020010-01.html">Document Tools</A> to view previously lodged medical evidence</LI>
<LI>current and valid assessment of the job seeker's work capacity (ESAt or JCA reports)</LI>
<LI>reported earnings</LI></UL>
<LI><STRONG>all medical conditions</STRONG> listed on the medical certificate must be considered when determining if a temporary incapacity exemption can be granted, <STRONG>except</STRONG> where:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>the primary condition listed on the medical certificate is primarily attributable to <STRONG>drug and/or alcohol dependency or misuse</STRONG> and the job seeker is not a Community Development Program (CDP) participant. A temporary incapacity exemption cannot be granted for this situation. This is regardless of whether there is a secondary temporary condition not related to drug or alcohol, which indicates an exemption may be applied. If the medical certificate does not differentiate between primary and secondary, the Service Officer must determine if the customer's incapacity is wholly or mainly attributable to drug or alcohol dependency/misuse. This can be based on previous medical information provided by the customer and/or a current and valid ESAt or JCA report. If unsure, discuss with appropriate person for assistance (for example, customer's treating doctor, Service Support Officer, Technical Peer Support)</LI></UL>
<LI>if all medical conditions listed have a <STRONG>prognosis (functional impact) of 24 months or more</STRONG>, a temporary incapacity exemption cannot be granted</LI>
<LI>if <STRONG>multiple medical conditions</STRONG> are listed, including different functional impacts, a temporary incapacity exemption can be granted if the job seeker is unable to work at least 8 hours per week due to at least 1 of the temporary or conditions</LI>
<LI>if the customer has received repeated, continuous exemptions for the same primary conditions, this may indicate their incapacity for work is no longer temporary (expected to persist for less than 2 years). A temporary incapacity exemption can still be granted based on the current medical certificate if it lists new primary conditions, or if the conditions causing incapacity for work have recently changed</LI>
<LI>check if all medical conditions are included in a current and valid ESAt or JCA report. Information from the report can be used unless the new medical evidence indicates the previously assessed medical condition(s) has changed therefore the report is no longer valid (for example, existing spinal condition has worsened or treatment has changed). New conditions are to be assessed based on the latest medical evidence supplied. <STRONG>Note:</STRONG></LI>
<UL>
<LI>if there is conflicting information between the medical certificate and a current and valid ESAt/JCA report, and unable to clarify with the health professional, consider escalating to appropriate level for advice if unsure which information to base decision on (for example, Service Support Officer, Technical Peer Support or Level 2 Helpdesk)</LI>
<LI>do not place medical certificate on hold. Medical certificate must be actioned</LI></UL>
<LI>Even if the customer is temporarily incapacitated for all work, an exemption may not be granted if the treating medical practitioner has provided information on the medical certificate which clearly shows the customer can meet their requirements in other ways (for example, by undertaking job searches). A decision not to grant an exemption for this reason must be supported by current, clear medical evidence in all cases</LI></UL>
<P>If the medical certificate is lodged:</P>
<UL>
