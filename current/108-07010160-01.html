<p>This document outlines the eligibility requirements of the employment income nil rate period provision. This provision enables a customer to retain certain benefits, such as a concession card when their rate of income support payment is nil due to the effect of the Income Test. This only occurs when the customer's total ordinary income <strong>includes</strong> employment income.</p>

If a JobSeeker Payment (JSP) customer starts working in a full time job expected to last for at least 6 fortnights, they are no longer unemployed and payment should be cancelled once any <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07020000-01.html">Working Credits are depleted</a><br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> this does not apply to JSP or YA (Other) customers who are employed under the <a href="../job-seekers/001-17030800-01.html">Youth Bonus Wage Subsidy (YBWS)</a> initiative.

an employment income nil rate period can continue if their relationship status changes, and</li>
		<li>
their PP is reassessed (transfers between PPS and PPP)</li>

<p>During the employment income nil rate period a customer who would normally report fortnightly must continue to report fortnightly. Failure to report will result in the cancellation of payment.

<p>Care needs to be taken for payments that can no longer be claimed. If the customer's payment is cancelled due to a failure to report income these payments cannot be reclaimed even if it is still within the employment income nil rate period.

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the customer's payment cancels due to failure to report income <strong>due to staff error</strong> (for example, the income was coded but the payment was not stimulated) then the payment can be restored.</p>

<p>If an allowance customer has returned to full time work, their payments will cancel once their Working Credits have been depleted. This is because they are no longer entitled to the employment income nil rate period due to a lack of qualification. If their partner is on Parenting Payment Partnered (PPP), the system will&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
SUS-INV the PPP customer's payments</li>
		<li>
automatically send an income estimate form for customer to complete for FTB and CCS estimate of income details update</li>
		<li>
create a manual follow up to check PPP entitlement</li>
		</ul>
<p>As the PPP customer <strong>is</strong> entitled to the employment income nil rate period if under Age Pension age, the PPP will need to be restored if there are no other changes to their entitlement. Smart Centre Call Service Officers can do this once the customer's entitlement is established.</p>

<p>If a customer has a partner and the partner's payment is dependent on the customer being current, then the partner's payment will cancel at the same time as the customer's. For example, Partner Allowance (PA) cannot continue if the partner's pension is cancelled.</p>

<p>If the partner's payment is not dependent on the customer being current, the partner's entitlement needs to be assessed based on the payment that they are getting for</p>

Working Credits or the Work Bonus, and</li>
