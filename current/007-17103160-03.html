<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a CCF customer contacts and wishes to add a new child for CCB, Service Officers are to complete an <a href="../self-service/133-03010070-01.html">Assisted Customer Claim (ACC)</a> for CCB. The ACC will have the additional CCS question set to ensure the new child is assessed for CCS. The CCF New Claim guided procedure must <strong>not</strong> be used in these circumstances as it does not include the CCS questions and there is no trigger for the child to be assessed for CCS once the claim is processed. If the CCF New Claim guided procedure was used, customers will need to lodge a new claim for CCS for the additional child to be assessed for CCS.</p>

<p>Current GCCB customers were included in the CCF/CCR call to action mail out and therefore eligible for streamlined transition. </p>

<p>When providing CTA information, customers will be asked to provide further information to transition to ACCS (Grandparent), including&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
evidence of their grandparent relationship to the child, and</li>
		<li>
evidence they have 65% or more care of the child (parenting orders etc.), including autonomy of decision making for the child (responsible for day-to-day decisions about the care, welfare and development of their grandchild)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>ACCS (Grandparent) evidence</strong></p>

<p>To support GCCB customers transition to ACCS (Grandparent), evidence requirements have been streamlined&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
In <strong>all</strong> cases, customers must verify their relationship to the child if this has not already been established, noting the customer must meet the definition of a grandparent for the purpose of ACCS (Grandparent)</li>
		<li>
Customer has 100% care of the child&#58; If Services Australia has 100% care recorded, and evidence exists on record, no further evidence is required. Current evidence is sufficient to verify care arrangements and substantial autonomy of decision making</li>
		<li>
Customer has less than 100% care&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Evidence of percentage of care is required</li>
			<li>
Evidence of autonomy of decision making is required if not previously provided, or not detailed in other evidence on hand (e.g. FTB shared care assessment)</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>Where a customer is required to provide evidence to support their ACCS (Grandparent) application, and this is not provided within 28 days, the ‘deemed’ ACCS (Grandparent) claim will be not effective, however they will be assessed for CCS. The customer will need to lodge a new ACCS (Grandparent) application and the maximum 28 day backdating provision will apply. In these cases, customers should be encouraged to lodge a new application as soon as possible.</p>

<p>If a customer contacts because they are unable to submit their CTA online due to evidence requirements, and they advise this information has been provided previously, record the customer’s CTA information via the Roxy call to action script so the CTA can be submitted. Advise the customer they may be required to provide evidence if it is not accessible from their record when assessing their ACCS (Grandparent) application.

<p>Customers using an approved child care service should be encouraged to claim CCB as reduced fees before 2 July 2018. By doing so, they can also be assessed for CCS from 2 July 2018. Customers should be encouraged to claim CCB/CCS via <img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> online services, but can also claim verbally via staff assisted channels. Claims will include an additional set of questions for CCS.</p>

<p><strong>Paper claims</strong></p>

<p>If the customer lodges a FA002 between early April and 2 July 2018 and are granted CCF, a CTA notice will be issued requesting they provide additional information to transition to CCS. Service Officers who grant CCF on or after 15 June 2018 should attempt to telephone the customer to obtain the additional information for CCS. This is to avoid any delays in customers receiving this request due to mail delivery.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> after 23 September 2018 obsolete versions of FA002 will not be accepted.</p>

<p>Before requesting evidence, review the customer’s record to determine whether evidence has already been provided and is accessible (for ACCS (Grandparent) applications), or requested evidence has already been provided (scanned onto the customer’s record but not linked to a claim or transaction).</p>

<p>Documents lodged within the Call To Action response can be found by clicking the <strong>Show/hide the claim overview</strong> icon <img src="../resources/images/process_direct_small/right-hand-slider.jpg" alt="Open right slider; Close left slider" title="Open right slider; Close left slider" /> and scrolling to the bottom of the customer responses. Each tile at the bottom represents an uploaded document.</p>

<p>If the relevant evidence cannot be located this way, use the <img src="../resources/images/process_direct_small/Back_icon.PNG" alt="Back" title="Back" /> to move back to the Claim Application screen and search elsewhere in the record.</p>

<p>Outside the Call to Action, select <strong>Documents</strong> which will display all other documentation previously attached to the record.</p>

<p>If the Service Officer is still unable to find suitable evidence, select <img src="../resources/images/process_direct_small/more-options-button.png" alt="" title="" />, located on the bottom right hand corner of the screen. Then select <strong>Request Documents</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Maintain</strong></p>

<p>This page will automatically populate with the benefit type and status. When requesting additional information, staff must update the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Information to be supplied within</strong>&#58; change to <strong>28 days</strong></li>
		<li>
<strong>Free Text required</strong>&#58; select <strong>No</strong></li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Staff Notes required</strong></p>

<p>Record a brief summary of why the customer is required to provide additional information, e.g. Evidence required to support application for ACCS (Grandparent); Evidence required to support age/school status exception.</p>

<p><strong>Available Documents</strong></p>

<p>Select the document required - evidence can be located using the search function. </p>

<p>For ACCS (Grandparent) applicants, evidence required may include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Evidence of relationship to grandchild</li>
		<li>
Evidence of care including day to day decisions</li>
		</ul>
<p>Navigate to the bottom of the page to select <strong>who</strong> the document is for.</p>

<p>Select the double right facing arrow to move the document to the Selected Document list.</p>

<p><strong>Finish the transaction</strong></p>

<p>The <strong>Review</strong> page provides an opportunity to confirm the information requested is correct and to ensure the Customer Notification is correct.</p>

<p>Select <strong>Finish</strong> if the request is correct. The claim will be placed on hold for 28 days.</p>

<p>Advise the customer what evidence is required and that it must be provided within 28 days. Customers should be encouraged to provide evidence using Upload documents. Failure to provide evidence may result in the CCS claim and/or ACCS (Grandparent) application not being assessed or being rejected.</p>

Staff changed CTA activity from Draft to In Process and a CCS Claim on the record; process the CCS claim first and ensure children are added to the assessment. The Staff changed CTA activity In Process should be held until 24/09/18</li>

CCB current customer lodges a CCS claim and later submits their call to action with updated activity test details. The CCS claim is processed and the CTA is placed on hold until 24/09/18. The updated activity test details are coded via the relevant ATD table(s) as this information was received after the initial full CCS claim</li>
		<li>
CCB current customer contacts and requests a child be added to their CCB assessment. The Assisted Customer Claim is run to obtain the relevant information and submitted.
