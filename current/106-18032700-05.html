		<li>
a CP and/or CA customer's caring responsibilities started during the 8 week period, that is. they have recently taken on the caring role</li>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>

<p>Rhianna was released from prison 6 weeks ago. Rhianna contacts to make a claim for JobSeeker Payment. As Rhianna is a vulnerable customer, record an intent to claim and advise Rhianna to lodge a claim within 14 days. If eligibility criteria is met and Rhianna lodges a claim within 14 days Rhianna will be payable from today.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>

<p>Michael was released from prison without notice in Far North Queensland and is heading back to country in the Northern Territory.</p>

<p>The nominee or a third party contacts Services Australia the day Michael is released. Tell the third party to encourage Michael to contact or lodge a claim as soon as possible (today if possible), with all supporting documents, to ensure the claim is assessed from the earliest date.</p>

<p><strong>Example 3</strong></p>

<p>A Corrections Officer advises Sammy will be released from prison in the near future. PRECLM cannot be coded as the customer is not qualified at time of contact. Record a <strong>DOC</strong>.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Sammy has an expected date of release of 20 August 2022</li>

<h2 id="bp05_L2GT_Determining_the">Determining the 14 day period to submit a claim</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Customers have a 14 day period in which to submit their claim after contacting Services Australia, (the 14 day period can be extended in some circumstances but no more than 13 weeks).</p>

<p>The 14 day period generally begins the day after the customer contacts Services Australia. For example, if a customer contacts on Tuesday 4 January, the 14 day period starts from Wednesday 5 January and includes Tuesday 18 January.</p>

<p>The last day in which a customer has to submit a claim (within the 14 days) is usually the same day of the week as the day they registered their intention to claim (or the day the 14 day period was re-started).</p>

<p>However, if the customer's 14 day period ends on a weekend or a public holiday, they can lodge their claim on the next working day. For example, if a customer contacts on Saturday 7 May, they will be required to lodge the claim by Monday 23 May. Similarly if a customer contacts on Tuesday 12 January, they will be required to lodge the claim by Wednesday 27 January (26 January being Australia Day).</p>

<p>Elijah advises the deadline was unable to be met due to caring for their mother continuously since the contact date on 2 January 2021. Elijah requests extra time to gather the additional details needed to submit the claim.</p>

<p>On 24 January 2021, Elijah submits a completed claim and evidence of their mother's continuing medical condition. The claim is assessed and determined on 29 January 2021.</p>

<p>A vulnerable customer <strong>DOC</strong> was recorded on Chloe's record on 28 March 2021 as the vulnerable circumstance occurred within the <strong>8 weeks </strong>before Chloe's first contact with the agency.</p>
