<p>The Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) is a publication that is maintained and updated by the Department of Health. Each professional services contained in the MBS has been allocated a unique item number. Located with the item number and description for each service is the Schedule fee and Medicare benefit, together with a reference to an explanatory note relating to the item (if applicable).</p>

<p>Services listed in the MBS must be rendered according to the provisions of the relevant Commonwealth, State and Territory laws. The day-to-day administration and payment of benefits under the Medicare arrangements is the responsibility of Services Australia. To view the MBS, see MBS Online on the Department of Health website.

<p>Each medical service listed in the Schedule is a complete medical service in itself. However, there are circumstances where a separate benefit is not payable for a particular service when rendered in conjunction with another more comprehensive service or, when rendered under particular circumstances. Such limitations are often easily identified by the item description.</p>

<p>Only 1 amount of benefit is payable for each listed medical service whether the service is rendered&#58;</p>

by the 1 practitioner</li>
		<li>
partly by 1 practitioner and completed by another practitioner. For example, after care provided other than by the operating practitioner or radiographic examination</li>

<p>When a practitioner renders a comprehensive service listed in an item and components of that service are separately listed under individual items, benefits are payable under the comprehensive item</p>

		<ul>		<li>
attends a patient who dies in their presence, with or without resuscitation attempts</li>
		<li>
attends a person who may or may not be dead and they have to either verify death or institute treatment if the person is alive. The following interpretation applies to this situation - legally, only a medical practitioner can verify that life is extinct and, until a statement of death or death certificate is issued, the patient is still regarded as an eligible patient for Medicare benefit purposes. Situations may arise where the medical practitioner is aware, prior to the attendance, that the patient is still not alive (for example, through nursing staff). Such an attendance to verify death would attract a Medicare benefit even if the practitioner subsequently issues a death certificate or statement of death. Only the time taken to examine the patient and verify death attracts benefit. Other non-clinical tasks, for example, issuing a death certificate are not eligible for benefits and should not be considered in determining the appropriate attendance item</li>
