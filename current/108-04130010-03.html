<p>Procedure ends here.</p>

<p><strong>For a new or unrecorded property&#58;</strong></p>

<p>If the customer advises of a new real estate asset, a net market value of the real estate must be established. Direct the customer to the relevant online service or issue them with the following forms&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Real Estate form (MOD R), or</li>
		<li>
Income and Assets Update (SA220m) for Age Pension and Carer Payment (CP) customers (and Disability Support Pension (DSP) customers from mid-January 2010)</li>
		<li>
Business details form (MOD F). (If the customer's real estate is used for business purposes, issue a MOD F <strong>and</strong> a MOD R</li>
		<li>
For medium to large farm properties&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
The Rural Property Questionnaire (Q454) is used along with the MOD R. It collects more information from the customer for the valuer, which enables a more accurate valuation of the property from the roadside</li>
			<li>
In most cases, if the property operates as a commercial enterprise, issue the Q454 in addition to the MOD R</li>		</ul>
		<li>
The Q454 is not needed for smaller properties such as hobby farms with minimal farm improvements or bush blocks. </li>
		<li>
do <strong>not</strong> issue a Q454&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
if the whole <strong>property is exempt</strong> because it is the principal home, or </li>
			<li>
it is an exempt farm asset. If required, see Issue the Rural Property Questionnaire (Q454).</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a customer is conducting a business from their principal home, only the portion used exclusively for business purposes is assessed as an asset. If part of the home is used for both domestic and business purposes, the assets test exempt status of the customer's principal home is retained, so a MOD R is not required.</p>

<p>If the customer is receiving a <strong>Blind Pension</strong>, only issue a MOD R and/or MOD F if they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
are being assessed for rent assistance, or</li>
		<li>
have a partner and the partner is not on a means test free payment </li>
		</ul>
<p>In these cases, details are still needed to determine rent assistance or the partner's rate.</p>

<p>The legal structures of timeshare arrangements vary widely and can include a share in holiday homes/units, caravan parks, houseboats, etc. Do not request valuations for timeshare assets.</p>

<p>A MOD R is not required in most circumstances. If the customer provides evidence of the sale price or recent sale values then these are accepted. The asset value of a timeshare depends on when it was purchased. If it was&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
in the last 12 months, use the purchase price</li>
		<li>
more than 12 months ago, use the most recent sale price within that timeshare. Customers should be able to obtain this from the timeshare management</li>
		</ul>
<p>When a timeshare asset has been purchased, sold or its value has changed&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the timeshare is already recorded on Other Assets (<strong>OAS</strong>) this must be ceased. From December 2015, timeshare in a property is assessed as a managed investment on a Direct Investment Account (<strong>SVDI</strong>)</li>
		<li>
To cease the timeshare assessment on <strong>OAS</strong>, code the following fields&#58;</li>
		<li>
<strong>Expand</strong> <img src="../resources/images/process_direct_small/Closed_chevron.PNG" alt="Closed chevron" title="Closed chevron" /> the time share investment</li>
		<li>
<strong>Add</strong> <img src="../resources/images/process_direct_small/add-new-line.png" alt="Adding a new line" title="Adding a new line" /> a new investment details entry</li>
		<li>
<strong>Event Date</strong>&#58; Today's date. The same date of event is used for ceasing the timeshare when adding it as a Direct Investment Account (<strong>SVDI</strong>)</li>

<p>See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-04130100-01.html">Maintaining the value of real estate assets on customer records</a>, for details of how the value of a current customer's real estate is indexed.</p>

<p>Procedure ends here.</p>

<p><strong>For a new or unrecorded property&#58;</strong></p>

<p>When the customer advises of a new real estate asset, a net market value of the customer's real estate must be established. Direct the customer to the relevant online service or issue them with the following forms&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Real Estate form (MOD R), or</li>
		<li>
Income and Assets Update (SA220m) for Age Pension and Carer Payment (CP) customers (and Disability Support Pension (DSP) customers from mid-January 2010)</li>
		<li>
Business details form (MOD F). (Where the customer's real estate is used for business purposes a MOD F <strong>and</strong> a MOD R must be issued)</li>
		<li>
For medium to large properties&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
The Rural Property Questionnaire (Q454) is used along with the MOD R. It collects more information from the customer for the valuer, to enable a more accurate valuation of the property from the roadside</li>
			<li>
In most cases, if the property operates as a commercial enterprise, issue the Q454 in addition to the MOD R</li>		</ul>
		<li>
The Q454 is not needed for smaller properties such as hobby farms with minimal farm improvements or bush blocks</li>
		<li>
If the whole <strong>property is exempt</strong> because it is the principal home, or it is an exempt farm asset, do <strong>not</strong> issue a Q454 for that property. If required, issue the Rural Property Questionnaire (Q454)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when a customer is conducting a business from their principal home&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
only assess as an asset the portion used solely for business purposes&#58;</li>
		<li>
if part of the home is used for both domestic and business purposes, the assets test exempt status of the customer's principal home is retained, so a MOD R is not required</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer is receiving a <strong>Blind Pension</strong>, only issue a MOD R and/or MOD F if they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
are being assessed for rent assistance, or</li>
		<li>
have a partner and the partner is not on a means test free payment</li>
		</ul>
<p>In these cases, details are still needed to determine rent assistance or the partner's rate.</p>

<p>Customers who own real estate as 'tenants in common' have their legal share assessed based on the agreed ownership percentage. For example, if a customer owns 40% of the property, use 40% of the whole property value.</p>

<p>If the customer <strong>disposes of a real estate asset</strong>, do not update the property value. Code the <strong>% Asset Owned&#58;</strong> field as '<strong>0</strong>'.</p>

<p><strong>For overseas properties&#58;</strong></p>

<p>Using the Real Estate Update script, code asset values of overseas real estate on the Foreign Income and Assets (<strong>FID</strong>) screen. <strong>Do not code</strong> it on the <strong>RE</strong> screen. Code the asset value in the relevant foreign currency and the system will convert it to $AUD. The asset value automatically updates variations in exchange rates each month.</p>

<p>The legal structure of timeshare arrangements vary widely and can include a share in holiday homes/units, caravan parks, houseboats, etc. Do not request valuations for timeshare assets.</p>

<p>A MOD R is not required as in most circumstances when the customer notifies the sale price or recent sale value it is accepted. </p>

<p>The asset value of a timeshare depends on when it was purchased. If purchased&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
in the last 12 months, use the purchase price</li>
		<li>
more than 12 months ago, use the most recent sale price within that timeshare. Customers should be able to obtain this from the timeshare management</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>A timeshare asset is purchased, sold or its value changes</strong>.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the timeshare is already recorded on the Other Assets (<strong>OAS</strong>) screen this must be ceased. From December 2015, timeshare in a property is assessed as a managed investment on the Direct Investments (<strong>SVDI</strong>) screen</li>
		<li>
To cease the timeshare assessment on the <strong>OAS</strong> screen, code the following fields&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
<strong>Event date&#58;</strong> today's date (the same date is used for coding in the timeshare investment on the <strong>SVDI</strong> screen)</li>
			<li>
<strong>Total Asset $&#58;</strong> $0</li>
			<li>
<strong>% Owned Client&#58;</strong> and <strong>% Owned Partner&#58;</strong> code as '0'</li>
