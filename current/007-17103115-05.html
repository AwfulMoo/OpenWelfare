<p>Milli works two casual jobs in the fast food industry. Milli's total hours can vary significantly across fortnights - in some fortnights Milli is only assigned one 4 hour shift, while in others up to five 4 hour shifts could be assigned.</p>

<p>Milli's working hours across six fortnights range from 4 hours to 16 hours per fortnight which would ordinarily give Milli an entitlement ranging from zero to up to 36 hours of subsidised child care per fortnight depending on hours worked each fortnight.</p>

<p>To support the maximum hours of paid work during a fortnight with access to sufficient hours of child care, Milli would declare an estimate of 16 hours of paid work per fortnight and would be entitled to 36 hours of subsidised child care in each fortnight.</p>

<p>Two months after advising the work hours, Milli's work shifts increase, ranging from 12 hours to 28 hours per fortnight. Milli updates the work hours from 16 hours to 28 hours online, resulting in access to 72 hours of subsidised child care per fortnight.</p></td>

<p>Rashid has 2 jobs - one part time job working 20 hours per fortnight, and a second casual job. Rashid's casual work can ranges from 20 to 25 hours per fortnight, depending on the number of shifts worked.</p>

<p>When recording 'paid work' hours, Rashid would indicate the paid work is casual, and record 45 hours work per fortnight. This is a total of the regular part time hours (20) and the highest number of casual hours worked in a fortnight (25).</p></td>

<p>After dropping Cale at day care, Kate has a 30 minute drive to work. After finishing the shift, Kate goes to the gym for an hour long workout before returning to the service to collect Cale. Travel time from the gym to the child care service is 45 minutes.</p>

<p>Kate's activity would be 7 hours each working day - 6 hours work and 1 hour travel time to and from the child care service. Kate's travel time estimate cannot include travel time to the gym, the time at the gym or the extended travel from the gym to the child care service.</p></td>

<p><strong>Voluntary work</strong></p>

<p>John and Adelaide have a 7 year old child Izzy. John works full-time but Adelaide is not currently working. Izzy attends outside school hours care twice a week when Adelaide visits John's parents in a retirement home some distance away. Adelaide has been spending several hours per week teaching Izzy guitar. In this context, teaching Izzy to play the guitar is considered a private activity and a personal interest that Adelaide shares with Izzy and these hours cannot be claimed as hours of voluntary work.</p>

<p>Adelaide is invited to provide group guitar lessons to all the children in Izzy's class at school. In doing so, Adelaide's guitar lessons support children's learning and development at the school and are recognised as voluntary work. Adelaide's 15 hours per fortnight providing guitar lessons entitle the family to 36 hours of subsidised child care per fortnight, as voluntary work is the only recognised activity and Adelaide's Activity Test result is the lowest.</p>

<p>See the attachment above for more examples of activities which may or may not be considered suitable as voluntary work for the purposes of the CCS Activity Test.</p></td>

<p><strong>Studying as an approved activity</strong></p>

<p>Sam advised of starting a two year course of study on 6 February. When recording Sam's activity details, the Service Officer would record the entire two year period, as Sam is considered to be meeting his Activity Test requirements during semester breaks.</p>

<p>However, Sam could not have the study commence on 1 January because Sam is due to start his activity in February, or have the period at the end of the two years included in the Activity Test period as breaks at the start or after the conclusion of the course are not included.</p></td>

<p>Salma is a single parent receiving Carer Allowance, which means automatic entitlement to 72 hours of subsidised care per fortnight. Salma also volunteers for 10 hours per fortnight at preschool undertaking reading activities with the children.</p>

<p>When reporting levels of activity, Salma indicates 'caring' for 60 hours per fortnight and volunteering for 10 hours per fortnight, totalling 70 hours of recognised activity. As this is more than the automatic Activity Test result, Salma would be entitled to 100 hours of subsidised care per fortnight.</p>
