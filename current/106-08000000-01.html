<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_What_is_a_forei">What is a foreign pension?</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The term 'foreign pension' refers to payments from a country other than Australia, that are either made by, or regulated by governments at any level, for example, national, regional or local. It is possible for a customer to receive more than one foreign pension, for example, multiple old age or retirement pensions or an old age and a survivor pension and have other means-tested payments and private retirement income as well.</p>

<p>Most countries have a three 'tier' or 'pillar' model for social security.</p>

<p><strong>First tier/pillar&#58;</strong></p>

<p>The 'first tier' is usually compulsory social insurance schemes that require employees and employers to pay contributions to a fund for cover for <strong>old age</strong> or <strong>retirement</strong>, <strong>invalidity</strong> or <strong>disability</strong> and <strong>survivors</strong> of contributors for example widow/widower, orphans or other family members. The legislation is government regulated, but most countries appoint pension funds that run the collection of contributions and payment of pensions. Most are government bodies but may be private or occupational based providers, like superannuation in Australia. These payments are comparable to Australian pensions and some customers may be <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-08010000-01.html">required to make a claim</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Second tier/pillar&#58;</strong></p>

<p>The 'second tier' is generally private savings, investments and other financial products and may include voluntary contributions to an occupational fund, generally only by the customer. These payments are generally <strong>not</strong> considered 'foreign pensions' event if they provide ongoing payments. These 'superannuation-like' funds and 'income stream-like' payments do not meet the legal definition for income streams or superannuation under Australian law so are treated as <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-04090000-01.html">managed investments</a> in the accumulation phase or ordinary <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-05020050-01.html">foreign income</a> for ongoing payments or lump sums such as commutations or withdrawals.</p>

<p><strong>Third tier/pillar&#58;</strong></p>

<p>The 'third tier' is usually non-contributory social welfare schemes provided by government bodies at the national, regional, or local level. These schemes provide for benefits and concessions for people with low income; that is, based on a means test. These payments are a 'safety net' and are generally, similar to Australian social security or payments and concessions by State or local governments in Australia.</p>

<p><strong>Other foreign pensions</strong></p>

<p>Foreign pensions may also be made for <strong>service</strong> in the military (that is, employed by army, navy, air force), <strong>caring</strong> for a child or disabled person, injury or internment during <strong>war</strong> or even <strong>restitution</strong> for persecution during wartime (see below).</p>

<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Comparable_fore"></a>
<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Comparable_fore">Comparable foreign payments (CFP)</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p><strong>CFPs</strong></p>

<p>A CFP is a payment from another country that is like an Australian pension. Unlike the broader term 'foreign pension', a CFP is considered 'comparable' if payments are made on the basis of retirement/old age (like Australian Age Pension), invalidity (like Australian Disability Support Pension) or survivorship (like the former Australian Widow B Pension or Bereavement Allowance).</p>

<p>CFPs are generally from those 'first tier/pillar' schemes based on compulsory contributions in that country.</p>

<p><strong>Making a claim</strong></p>

<p>Social security law requires a person who is in receipt of a designated Australian payment to claim any 'comparable foreign payment' (CFP) to which they may be entitled.</p>

<p>The agency is responsible for assisting customers with the process of making a claim, including any non-customers who voluntarily seek assistance from staff. This also applies to assisting customers to maintain their foreign pension, for example assisting with life certificates.</p>

<p>See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-08010000-01.html">Foreign pension claims</a>.</p>

<p><strong>CFP arrears debts</strong></p>

<p>Lump sum arrears of a CFP are treated differently to other lump sums (see below).</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Restitution_pay">Restitution payments</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The term 'restitution' generally refers to payments that may be made by other countries as compensation for people who were persecuted during wartime or by particular government regimes. Regardless of the source, in all cases be sensitive when dealing with customers who may be in receipt of such payments.</p>

<p>In general, a payment made by <strong>any</strong> country for persecution by the National Socialist (Nazi) regime during World War II is exempt by virtue of subsection 8(8)(n) of the Social Security Act 1991. Some ordinary foreign pensions for example for old-age or retirement, may include components or amounts attributable to deemed insurance periods during which the person was interned or in forced labour during Nazi occupation, in which the whole payment is exempt.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> payments made from a <strong>Swiss</strong> fund for Holocaust survivors are treated as exempt lump sums.</p>

<p>Pensions of Mercy from Chile for persecution under the Pinochet regime are also generally exempt by virtue of clauses in the social security Agreement with Chile.</p>

<p>Other restitution payments are not generally exempt for example, payments from the Netherlands for internment by the Japanese during World War II.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> under Section 10A(2) of the Social Security Act, restitution payments are considered assessable foreign income for Commonwealth Seniors Health Card (CSHC) customers and should be assessed as part of the adjusted taxable income.</p>

<p>Some restitution payments may be identified by the name of the payment or by the paying authority but most will be self-identified by the customer. Customers must provide sufficient evidence such as a statement from the paying authority.</p>

<p>The following payments are the most common forms of restitution payments that are exempt income for social security income support payment purposes. Information on known restitution payments from a range of countries, including sample foreign documents, is available through the International Programme homepage. See the <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-08000000-05.html">Resources</a> page for a link.</p>

Payments may refer to 'compensation' paid under sections 500-508 of Austrian legislation or the German BUNDESENTSCHCÄDIGUNGSGESETZ (BEG). Known payments include&#58;</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Arrears_and_lum">Arrears and lump sums</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A foreign lump sum may be made for various reasons and a customer may be granted both an ongoing pension and a lump sum at the same time. Lump sums are assessed and coded differently depending on what they are for however, all assessable lump sums from a source outside Australia must be <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-08020000-01.html">converted to Australian dollars using the exchange rate</a> that was applicable at the date of receipt and coded in Australian dollars for the period required.</p>

<p>Foreign pension lump sums may be arrears of a comparable foreign payment (CFP) that represents cumulative entitlement for a period in the past, usually associated with a new grant. The treatment and coding of CFP arrears are covered in <a href="../debts/107-04040000-01.html">Comparable foreign payment lump sum arrears debts</a> but it is important to <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-08030000-01.html">first code the ongoing pension</a>.</p>

<p>Other lump sums may be&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a separate entitlement or ad hoc payments with their own qualification criteria, such as, bereavement or funeral grants</li>
		<li>
bonus payments on top of the foreign pension, such as, annual holiday or Christmas bonuses</li>
		<li>
payments in lieu of pension, such as, where a customer's rate of pension is too small or where the provisions of the legislation allow commutation of a pension to a lump sum, or</li>
		<li>
refund of contributions when a customer does not have enough insurance to qualify for a pension or other withdrawals</li>
		</ul>
<p>The treatment and coding of other foreign lump sums is covered in <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-05020020-01.html">Treatment of Lump Sums</a>, however, where the payment of a lump sum prevents any further entitlement to a foreign pension, the FPS status must be updated from the relevant date to reflect the customer is not entitled to a pension from that country (FIN-NOM).

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_How_to_identify">How to identify and assess foreign pensions</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p><strong>Identifying foreign pensions</strong></p>

<p>It is important that any foreign payment is correctly identified, as some foreign pensions may be assessed differently under social security law (see below).</p>

<p>For information on how to identify foreign languages, see <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-01020010-01.html">Guidelines for using interpreters</a>.</p>

<p>Information on known foreign pensions from a range of countries, including sample foreign documents, is available through the International Programme homepage.</p>

<p>Staff should first check whether a foreign document is known before requesting translation but can check with International Services for assistance.</p>

<p>If a payment is not covered and staff believe it should be assessed differently, refer the case to the International Programme via the homepage.</p>

<p>See the <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-08000000-05.html">Resources</a> page for a link to International Services and the International Programme.</p>

<p><strong>Assessing foreign pensions</strong></p>

<p>The gross rate of a foreign pension, that is, before tax or other deductions, is generally assessed as ordinary income under the income test.</p>

<p>However, there are exceptions in social security law, for example, reimbursement of expenses is not income and payments in respect of a dependent child, restitution for National Socialist persecution and some specific payments from the governments of New Zealand and the United Kingdom are exempt.</p>

<p>Social security agreements may also modify the treatment of certain payments and may mean the amount received is proportionalised before being included in the income test, treated as a direct deduction instead of income or even exempt from assessment.</p>

<p>Information is available on the assessment of known foreign pensions from <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04000000-01.html">agreement countries</a> and some <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-08050000-01.html">non-agreement countries</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Blocked income</strong></p>

<p>Australian case law has determined that the possibility of a person being able to access income may be so remote that it cannot be taken to be 'earned, derived or received' and so should not be assessed. This is referred to as 'blocked income'.</p>

<p>Some countries only allow payments to be made to a bank account in that country; this does <strong>not</strong> mean that the income is blocked.</p>

<p>However, if evidence suggests that a country has suspended payment indefinitely or that a person is unable to travel to a country that restricts payments due to a disability or because it is unsafe to do so, a payment <strong>may</strong> be considered to be blocked.</p>

<p>Before making a decision, any cases that might meet the criteria <strong>must</strong> be referred to the International Programme to check with the Department of Social Services. See the link on the <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-08000000-05.html">Resources</a> page.</p>

<p>It is important that any foreign payment is correctly identified and coded as foreign pensions may be assessed differently under social security law, for example, direct deduction, 'proportionalised' or exempt from the income test. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-08030000-01.html">Foreign pension coding</a>.</p>

<p>Customers receiving foreign pensions or who have other income and assets from overseas will have the Australian dollar amount of the overseas income revalued using <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-08020000-01.html">foreign currency exchange rates</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Staff must not create a Foreign Pension Details (<strong>FPD</strong>) record just to record a foreign pension reference number. Foreign pension reference numbers can be recorded on the Foreign Claim Detail (<strong>FGD</strong>) screen.</p>

<p><strong>Example&#58;</strong> Work and Income New Zealand (WINZ) may ask staff to update customer records with a New Zealand (<strong>NZ</strong>) reference number (<strong>SWN</strong>) so they can access the International Verification Facility (the portal).</p>

<p><strong>Only record</strong> a SWN on FPD&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
where an FPD record exists</li>
		<li>
to key an Assumed Rate, or</li>
		<li>
to process a NZ Service Decision</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Otherwise</strong>, record the SWN in the <strong>Foreign Description</strong> field on the <strong>FGD</strong> screen.</p>
