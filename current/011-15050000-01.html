<p><strong>Notification of claims</strong></p>

<p>Services Australia (the agency) is notified by&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The first defendant in the compensation case, or</li>
		<li>
Each individual compensation payer</li>
		</ul>
<p>The compensation payer must notify the agency where the total amount awarded is fixed at greater than $5,000.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> where multiple compensation payers settle a case on the same day for the same injury or illness and apportion the amounts to be paid between the parties, consider the total sum of all amounts payable by all compensation payers to determine if the case is notifiable.</p>

<p><strong>First defendant</strong></p>

<p>The first defendant is nominated as the principal point of contact with the agency when all the compensation payers involved in a single compensation case agree to this arrangement.</p>

<p>The role of the first defendant is to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Notify the agency of the claim</li>
		<li>
Provide all relevant documentation, and</li>
		<li>
Be responsible for any amounts owing to the agency</li>
		</ul>
<p>Normal processing applies to these cases and only the first defendant will receive a response.</p>

<p><strong>Notification from each individual compensation payer</strong></p>

<p>If multiple compensation payers involved in a single compensation case notify the agency individually, contact the compensation payers (if required) to confirm it is the same case and determine which compensation payer is the first defendant.</p>

<p><strong>Payments from multiple compensation payers</strong></p>

<p>Where the agency receives multiple payments from different compensation payers in relation to an advance payment (multiple compensation payers are responsible to pay a portion of the total advance payment), consider all payments when calculating whether a refund is payable to the injured person or claimant or if a further debt is owed.</p>

<p>In these circumstances, manually process the <strong>notice of past benefits</strong> to make sure all payments are reconciled before the case is finalised.</p>

<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Advance_payment"></a>
<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Advance_payment">Advance payments</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p><strong>About advance payments</strong></p>

<p>A compensation payer may choose to make an advance payment under section 33B of the HOSC Act. An intended advance payment is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Any amount greater or less than 10% of the total compensable amount of the judgment or settlement</li>
		<li>
Payable where the total amount of compensation (including legal costs for settlements) is more than $5,000</li>
		<li>
Notified to the agency on a completed <a target="_blank" class="extwebsitelink" href="https&#58;//www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/mo022">Medicare Compensation Recovery Notice of judgment or settlement form (MO022)</a>, and to the claimant in writing</li>
		<li>
Made where no valid notice of charge exists on the date of settlement (see <strong>Intended advance payments</strong> below)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when an advance payment does not equal exactly 10%, the CP057K letter must <strong>not</strong> be issued and must be deleted from the Print Queue Maintenance application.</p>

<p>After the agency has received an advance payment, the compensation payer can then release the remainder of the settlement sum to the injured person or claimant before the amount owed to the agency has been determined. Once an advance payment has been made, the compensation payer is not entitled to receive any further information relating to the case, including&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Details of any debts owed by the injured person, or</li>
		<li>
Any amounts deducted from the advance payment</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> where a <strong>notice of past benefits</strong> has been issued within 6 months of the day on which the judgment or settlement is fixed, it becomes the <strong>notice of charge</strong> and an advance payment <strong>cannot</strong> be made.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Advance payments and Centrelink clearance</strong></p>

<p>While the insurer or compensation payer may need to wait for a Centrelink clearance under the Social Security Act 1991 (SS Act) before releasing a compensation payment to the person, this does not prevent them from making an advance payment. </p>

<p>The SS Act states that it is an offence for a potential compensation payer or insurer to release payment of compensation to a person if they have been given a notice under section 1182 or 1184 of that act (recovery from compensation payers and insurers). As an advance payment made to the agency in accordance with the HOSC Act is not a payment of compensation to a person, making an advance payment is not an offence under the SS Act.</p>

<p>If the compensation payer is unable to comply with the advance payment requirements under section 33B of the HOSC Act it remains an option to them to withhold payment of the compensation amount under section 32 of the HOSC Act and request a notice of charge from the agency.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Criteria for advance payments</strong></p>

<p>If the compensation payer intends to make an advance payment, they must notify the injured <strong>person in writing</strong> under section 33A of the HOSC Act.</p>

<p>The notice must state&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The compensation payer intends to make the advance payment</li>
		<li>
The amount of the advance payment</li>
		<li>
The circumstances in which the agency can retain some or all of the advance payment, and</li>
		<li>
The circumstances in which the injured person will be required to make an additional payment to the agency in respect of eligible benefits</li>
		</ul>
<p>A compensation payer can make the advance payment in respect of the compensation payable, if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
A <strong>notice of past benefits</strong> has not been issued in respect of the claim in the 6 months preceding the day on which the judgment or settlement is fixed (see <strong>Intended advance payments</strong> below)</li>
		<li>
A <strong>notice of judgment or settlement</strong> under section 23 of the HOSC Act has been given to the agency indicating the compensation payer intends to make an advance payment</li>
		<li>
A notice under section 33A of the HOSC Act has been given to the injured person</li>
		<li>
The total amount of compensation fixed under the judgment or settlement (including legal costs) is fixed at more than $5,000</li>
		<li>
The advance payment is a portion of the total amount of compensation payable, and</li>
		<li>
The advance payment is made after the judgment or settlement was fixed</li>
		</ul>
<p>Any payment that does not meet the criteria for advance payments is considered a failure to comply and will be treated as a voluntary payment and used to offset any debt to the insurer. See Voluntary Payment under ‘Other Payments’ on this page.</p>

<p>The <a href="../your-health/011-15050000-04.html">References</a> page contains legislation relevant to Division 2A - Advance payments to the Commonwealth.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Intended advance payment </strong></p>

<p>Where a payment is received that is 10% of the total compensable amount on a case where a valid notice of past benefits exists, any refund is made as if it was an advance payment.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Advance payment and payment of notice of past benefits received for the same case</strong></p>

<p>Where the agency receives an advance payment and has previously received payment for a <strong>notice of past benefits</strong>, consider both payments when calculating whether a refund is payable to the injured person or claimant or if a further debt is owed.</p>

<p>In these circumstances, manually process the notice of past benefits to ensure both payments are reconciled before the case is finalised.</p>

<p><strong>Finalising advance payment cases</strong></p>

<p>Following receipt of an advance payment, finalise the case in consultation with the injured person or claimant. Deduct any eligible benefits owed (if applicable) from the advance payment.</p>

<p>The amount to be repaid to the agency is calculated by the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If a <strong>statement by claimant</strong> is not returned by the injured person or claimant, all services are taken as relating to the injury or illness</li>
		<li>
If a completed <strong>statement by claimant</strong> is returned, all eligible benefits identified by the injured person or claimant are taken as relating to the injury or illness</li>
		<li>
If a valid section 23A statement is received and accepted, the amount specified in the expired <strong>notice of past benefits</strong> or, no repayment if a <strong>notice of past benefits</strong> has not been previously issued</li>
		<li>
Any advice received from the agency relating to nursing home benefits or residential and home care subsidies incurred by the injured person</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> under Section 33D the agency must finalise an advance payment case within 3 months of receiving a <strong>notice of judgment or settlement</strong> or the advance payment, whichever is the later. </p>

<p>Where an extension was granted, if the new statement return date is after the section 33D(1) date (3 months after the date of receipt of notice or judgment or settlement or advance payment, whichever is later), the new 33D date is 28 days after the new statement return date. For example, if the section 33D(1) date was 2 April 2020, but the extension to return the statement was granted until 10 April 2020, a notice of change must be issued by 8 May 2020. Where the agency does not meet this timeframe the whole of the advance payment is payable to the injured person or claimant, discharging the injured person’s liability to pay any amounts owed.</p>

<p>Cases where the whole of the advance payment is payable to the injured person or claimant need to be reported to Programme Management at case closure. Complete the 'S33K report' email template.</p>

<p>The <a href="../your-health/011-15050000-05.html">Resources</a> page contains a link to the ‘S33K report email’ template.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Reconciliation of eligible benefits</strong></p>

<p>Where the amount owed is less than the amount of the advance payment, the difference is payable by the agency to the injured person or claimant.</p>

<p>Where the amount owed is more than the amount of the advance payment, the difference is payable to the agency by the injured person or claimant within 28 days after the notice is given.</p>

<p><strong>Amount owed remains unpaid</strong></p>

<p>When the injured person or claimant does not pay the agency within 28 days of the request, the amount is recoverable as a debt. Recovery of the debt is commenced by the Debt Management Team.</p>

<p><strong>Refunding an advance payment</strong></p>

<p>When an advance payment or intended advance payment was received by the agency, any refund due must be paid to the injured person or claimant in accordance with section 33H of the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995. However, a legal document may be provided that directs the refund to a third party. </p>

<p><strong>Refunding notice of charge and other payments</strong></p>

<p>For notice of charge or other payments, the compensation payer is liable to pay the total amount specified in the <strong>notice of charge</strong> to the agency. The amount owing to the agency may be reduced if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The claimant, within the period of 2 years from the date of judgment or settlement, satisfies the agency that not all of the services in the <strong>notice of charge</strong> (all services taken) were provided for treatment of the injury or illness</li>
		<li>
The judgment or settlement fixes the amount of compensation on the basis liability for the injury should be apportioned between the claimant and the compensation payer, or</li>
		<li>
The judgment fixes an amount of compensation specifying the past expenses component for medical, nursing home care, residential care and/or home care already incurred for the injury or illness</li>

<p>An <strong>advance payment</strong> refund must be issued to the injured person unless a legal document directing the release of the refund to a third party has been provided. </p>

<p>Any advance payment refund to anyone other than the Public Trustee or injured person/care of the claimant <strong>must</strong> be escalated to Programme Management with the relevant documents. Cases <strong>must</strong> be escalated to Programme Management where any doubt exists regarding the acceptability of a document directing the refund to a third party. </p>

<p>These documents may be in the form of&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Court documents directing disbursement of the funds</li>
		<li>
Tribunal documents naming a financial administrator</li>
		<li>
Letter from a state trustee office confirming they are administering the funds</li>
		<li>
Guardianship documents</li>
		<li>
Garnishee notice, or</li>
		<li>
Notice under section 72A of the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988</li>
		</ul>
<p>Entitlement to the refund must be established at settlement, and be described in settlement documentation, and processed accordingly prior to finalising the case. Otherwise, the advance payment refund will go to the injured person.</p>

<p>The Medicare Compensation Recovery Third party authority (MO021) form does not provide the authority to release any payment to a third party.</p>

<p>Refunds to a third party will be issued by cheque in the name of the injured person and be directed to the nominated third party, once confirmation in writing is received from the relevant Court or Trustee. If there is no written documentation, do not issue a refund to the third party.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p><strong>Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) payments</strong></p>

<p>The agency’s preferred mode of receiving incoming payments is via EFT. For those organisations who do not have access to EFT facilities, cheque payments are accepted.</p>

<p>Payments are banked or deposited into the 'Services Australia Medicare Official Recovery of Compensation for Health Care and Other Services Special Account'. </p>

<p>Compensation payers are required to apply for a unique account number before any payments can be made. If a compensation payer does not have a unique account number, they can email the Compensation Finance team and a unique account number will be created.</p>

<p>Compensation Finance will issue a letter with the unique account details for the compensation payer along with the requirements, allowing Compensation Finance to allocate the money to the correct case. Compensation payers are required to email a remittance advice for any EFT payment outlining the details of the injured person so payments can be allocated to the correct case.</p>

<p><strong>See&#58;</strong> <a href="../your-health/011-15050010-01.html">Accounts receivable and banking for Medicare Compensation Recovery</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Cheque payments</strong></p>

<p>Cheque payments should only be received together with a remittance advice. Where no advice has been provided, Compensation Finance will attempt to identify who the payment is for. If identified, a copy of the receipting information is forwarded to Medicare Compensation Recovery for scanning into the Compensation Case Management System (CCMS). Cheques are usually banked within 2 working days. If the case cannot be identified, either the funds will be allocated to a generic ‘87’ number or the cheque will be returned to the sender with a request for further information.</p>

<p>The request to stop a cheque being posted to the payee is referred to a 'cheque extraction'. This is different to a 'stop cheque' which is after a cheque has been posted.</p>

<p>Contact the Compensation Finance Team immediately to request a cheque extraction or a stop cheque <strong>before</strong> sending them the 'Referring a case to Compensation Finance email template.</p>

<p>Reasons for requesting a cheque extraction can include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
where a processing error has been identified, or </li>
		<li>
an omission has occurred, e.g. the payee’s address has not been amended prior to initiating the refund</li>
		</ul>
<p>All cheque extraction requests are sent to the Compensation Finance team. Call the Compensation Finance team first, before emailing the request.</p>

<p>Cheque information can be found in Systems, Applications and Products (SAP). Enter case notes in the Compensation Case Management System (CCMS), or the National Compensation Recovery Information (<strong>NCRI</strong>) mainframe screen, if CCMS is not working.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Compensation Finance can make a cheque extraction request before the cheque is issued. However, the extraction cannot be guaranteed.</p>
