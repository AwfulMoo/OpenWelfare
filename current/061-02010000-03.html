If the online service has already coded the absence, details are recorded on a <strong>DOC</strong>. The online service may refer them to contact to have their absence coded, or explore further portability for their situation. In either case, the Service Officer is to run the script.</p>

<p>Advise them the interview can generally be done over the phone and takes around 15 minutes. In some circumstances, further information may be needed before making a final decision.</p>

<p>If they notify of an absence <strong>after they have left Australia</strong>, whether they are still overseas or have since returned to Australia, still assess portability and, where possible, use the script.</p>

<p>It is not mandatory for them to provide an address outside Australia but a current contact address is necessary.</p>

<p>Portability Script - Departures and Returns</p>

<p>Use this script to accurately guide decisions about portability and can be used for hypothetical cases when a person wants information about the effect on their payments (except child care payments) before making a decision to travel outside Australia.</p>

<p>While the script will provide accurate information to the person, the information about payment for a hypothetical situation is not a decision and therefore cannot be appealed until they advise a definite absence from Australia.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the Portability Script - Departures and Returns cannot be run for Child Care Subsidy, ABSTUDY, Farm Household Allowance, non-income tested Pensioner Concession Card (PCC) holders, child only departures or a Double Orphan Pension (DOP) only departure.</p>

<p>Only issue the Pre Departure - Portability (XOB101) letter if they are definitely leaving Australia and have specifically requested a letter. If they require further information, refer them to the Services Australia website. The <a href="../australians-overseas/061-02010000-05.html">Resources</a> page has a link.</p>

<p>If the portability script is not available, see <a href="../australians-overseas/061-02000000-01.html">Leaving Australia</a> for a list of all payment specific and concession card portability procedures.</p>

<strong>No</strong>, advise them the Department of Home Affairs will generally advise Services Australia when a customer leaves or returns and the system will assess their payments. They can find out what will happen to their payments on the Services Australia website, and might choose to discuss their planned absence with Services Australia later. Record a <strong>DOC</strong> noting the person has contacted and been given general advice about portability. Procedure ends here</li>		</ul>

<p>As well as the portability rules, <strong>most</strong> payments require a customer to remain an Australian resident to continue to qualify for payment. If they leave Australia to live overseas, qualification is lost on departure.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> this does not apply to people receiving Age Pension or Disability Support Pension (DSP),for customers who are exempt from the ongoing residence requirement, <strong>unless</strong> they are receiving the payment because they are a refugee and have a qualifying residence exemption (that is, they do not qualify for payment under the usual rules such as 10 years residence in Australia but rely on the refugee visa for qualification).</p>

<strong>No</strong>, they either receive a payment other than those noted above or they are receiving one of these payments solely because they are a refugee&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Check their residence including previous absences recorded on the Immigration Advised Movements (<strong>RSIM</strong>) and/or Customer Advised Travel Details (<strong>RSCD</strong>) screen</li>
			<li>
If they have been outside Australia a number of times with only brief returns to Australia, they may not be residing in Australia</li>

<p>Before running the Portability Script - Departures and Returns identify if the carer or care receiver will be travelling overseas without the carer continuing to provide care. If this is the case, as respite will occur, check the Absences Enquiry (<strong>ABCE</strong>) screen to calculate manually when respite will be fully depleted.</p>

<p>Where respite applies, insert the day following the last date of respite when the script stops to ask <strong>'Do you know or the customer know of any event that will happen and cause them to lose entitlement to Carer Payment/Carer Allowance before dd/mm/yyyy?'</strong> This date will appear in the letter issued when the script is finalised. Consider respite provisions independently and code manually where applicable. If the care receiver is going overseas without the carer, record the absence on the <strong>ABCE</strong> screen.</p>

<p>There is a current system limitation, which continues to count Temporary Cessation of Care (TCC) after expiration of portability. Where the carer's payments will suspend after 42 days the TCC end date should reflect only 41 days if care is provided on the day of departure. Unless there is evidence to the contrary, accept care was provided on the date of departure and TCC will commence from the following day. Code respite with start date equal to day after departure and end date equal to the end of the limited portability period. Therefore, the TCC period is 41 days, provided the carer has this number available.</p>

<p>Respite provisions do not apply when&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the carer is travelling overseas with the care receiver, or</li>
		<li>
the carer receives CA and is travelling by themselves, but the care receiver is a child and the child is remaining with the carer's partner. Respite will still apply to CP in these cases. Code these absences using the 'child with partner' code '<strong>CWP</strong>' which will calculate a respite absence for CP but not CA</li>
		</ul>
<p>Respite provisions apply when&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the carer is leaving Australia and an adult care receiver is remaining in Australia. <strong>Ensure respite is applicable and not cessation of care altogether</strong></li>
		<li>
the care receiver is going overseas without the carer</li>
		<li>
the carer receives CP and is leaving Australia and the care receiver is a child who is remaining in Australia whether in the care of the customer's partner or not</li>
		<li>
the carer receives CA and is travelling by themselves and the care receiver is a child who is not remaining in the care of the carer's partner</li>
		<li>
The carer is leaving Australia with the care receiver but the care receiver will not be in the carer's care during part or all of the absence from Australia. For example, the care receiver will stay with other family members for 2 of the 6 weeks absence. If the person is a care receiver who is leaving Australia temporarily and the carer is remaining in Australia, this does not affect the care receiver's portability but the respite for the carer should be discussed with the care receiver</li>

<p>Run the Portability Script - Departures and Returns.</p>

<p>The purpose of the portability script is to assess portability rules associated with the payment and record the absence. It does not assess ongoing qualification.</p>

<p>The script will ask for the date of departure and return as well as the destination country. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> if they are unsure of their exact return date, choose an option with an approximate return date.</p>

<p>Even if they advise they are only outside Australia temporarily, the Service Officer can determine they are leaving Australia to live in another country. In this case, the Service Officer should select the option 'never' when the script asks for the return date.</p>

<p>The script will ask the Service Officer to select all payments they want assessed. All payments received by the customer will usually be preselected.</p>

<p>The following payments may be preselected&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Supplements (for example, Energy Supplement)</li>
		<li>
Add-ons (for example, Rent Assistance)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Check they are eligible for the preselected payment(s). Some payment types may need to be removed from the list (for example, if not grandfathered for Energy Supplement) using the <strong>Add or Remove Payments</strong> function of the script.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Energy Supplement grandfathering provisions apply for Family Tax Benefit (FTB) customers and Commonwealth Seniors Health Card (CSHC) holders. An overseas absence of longer than the allowable portability period for these payments means the customer will not be eligible for Energy Supplement if they reclaim FTB or CSHC when they return to Australia.</p>

<p>Once the options are chosen, the script will prompt the Service Officer to ask questions based on their record, departure dates and country of destination.</p>

<p>If they are leaving Australia for more than their available portability period, DSP may be payable if they are terminally ill, or assessed as meeting the 'no future work capacity' portability provisions, or they are going to an agreement country that covers DSP.</p>

<p>If they are noted on the Medical Conditions Details (<strong>MC</strong>) screen as manifestly qualified (excluding conversion CNV), or assessed under the 'no future work capacity' (NWC) portability provisions on the Customer Advised Travel Details (<strong>RSCD</strong>) screen, the script will automatically assess portability accordingly.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Service Officers must inform the customer that this assessment requires a full review of their DSP qualification.

<p>Reason for the absence from Australia for restricted portability payment.</p>

<p>Ask the customer why they are travelling outside Australia.</p>

<p>If they are clearly not travelling for an approved reason, payment is not portable except for Disability Support Pension (DSP), which may be payable for all or part of their absence using their allowable 4 weeks in a rolling 12 month period. If they may be travelling for an approved reason, refer them to Centrelink International Services (CIS) to assess if they satisfy these conditions. The Portability Script - Departures and Returns will correctly refer these cases through to CIS.</p>

<p>Do they want payment to continue because they are travelling for an approved reason?</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>, refer to CIS. See <a href="../australians-overseas/061-02010000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Updating_record_Step01">Step 1 in Table 5</a></li>
		<li>
<strong>No</strong>, payment is not portable except DSP, which may be payable for all or part of their absence using their allowable 4 weeks in a rolling 12 month period. Continue with the Portability Script - Departures and Returns and advise them on what date their payment will cease. They should advise of their return to Australia.

<p>If they have returned to Australia after an absence that resulted in their PP, Family Tax Benefit (FTB) or Child Care Subsidy (CCS) being stopped for portability reasons, then PP, FTB or CCS is not payable for any reason if they leave Australia again within 6 weeks of their latest return to Australia.</p>

<p>The script will normally pick this up as long as the previous absence is recorded. If PP or FTB is cancelling for this reason and the Service Officer believes they should be payable, the problem could be incorrect recording of residence, arrivals or departures.

The children are still their dependent children <strong>and</strong> another person may be better off claiming payment for the children. For example, if a customer is remaining outside Australia for more than 6 weeks but the partner and children are remaining in Australia, FTB will reduce to base rate and their partner may be better off receiving the payment at the maximum rate</li>

		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
In these circumstances the Portability Script - Departures and Returns will assess their ongoing entitlement based on the information held on the Country of Residence (<strong>CRES</strong>) screen</li>
			<li>
The script will proceed to the <strong>CRES</strong> screen to allow the Service Officer to check the details contained are correct. If blank or an update is required, the Service Officer must record the residence at this time or the decision made by the script will be incorrect. A compensation claim can be the result if they are told payment can only be made for 26 weeks when it is actually indefinitely portable</li>
			<li>
If blank, ask them when they first arrived in Australia for residence. Record any other countries they have lived in</li>

<p><strong>Give the customer the correct advice</strong> about whether they will lose entitlement before they leave Australia or while they are overseas.</p>

<p>Not all income support payments can be paid outside Australia. The portability script does not assess if they will remain qualified during their absence, so when a person calls to advise they are travelling overseas, it is essential to look at their situation. Determine if they will lose entitlement&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
before they leave Australia or</li>
		<li>
while they are overseas</li>
		</ul>
<p>When the script asks if any circumstance will result in loss of entitlement&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
answer '<strong>Yes</strong>', and</li>
		<li>
advise the date and a brief reason</li>
		</ul>
<p>The script will use this information in the XOB101 letter, which may be issued, if required, to give the person the correct date of cancellation. They must be manually advised of the reason for the cancellation during the portability interview.</p>

<p>If they are changing payment types before going overseas (for example now on PPS but will be on JSP before departure), use the <strong>Add or Remove payments</strong> button to select a different payment type.</p>

<p>The script will make a decision based on the choice of payment and give them correct information based on this payment type.</p>

<p><strong>Important changes to consider include&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Reporting and Employment Income&#58; A 2 weekly reporting customer will be re-profiled as a notification reporter once the departure date is reached. The system will issue any entitlement calculated for the prior period. If they have employment income to declare before their departure, they must report their income on the business day before departure so they do not incur an overpayment. They will not be required to report while overseas. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010010-03.html">Recording and correcting employment income details</a> for more details</li>
		<li>
PP customers may lose eligibility due to the age of their youngest child. If their youngest child is turning 6 (PPP) or 8 (PPS), their PP will stop regardless of the portability period unless they are eligible to transfer to another payment which is portable for that absence</li>
		<li>
If a care receiver is temporarily leaving Australia, respite may apply to the carer's payment</li>
		<li>
If a medical certificate ends</li>
		<li>
Ensure all customers understand if they have to contact when they have returned to Australia</li>
		</ul>
<p>See <a href="../australians-overseas/061-02010000-05.html#bp05_L3TT_Travel_details_">Travel details required</a> on the Resources page for other changes to consider when a customer is leaving Australia.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> selecting any other consequential review type will generate an unnecessary work item in Workload Manager (<strong>WLM</strong>) or a <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-06050000-03.html">WLM OWN</a> work item in the staff members Inbox/Worklist.</p>

<p>The script will generate a Registered (<strong>REG</strong>) Reassessment (<strong>REA</strong>) activity for each review type selected on the customer's Activity List (<strong>AL</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>Where the Service Officer has the appropriate skills, they are to complete the review with the customer after finalising the Portability Script - Departures and Returns update.

<p>Is the customer going outside Australia and their payment is payable for more than 12 months and their record will be transferred to Environment I on departure?</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>, the Portability Script - Departures and Returns will code the person's departure, <strong>however</strong> the departure will not be assessed until the Department of Home Affairs confirms they have left Australia. See <a href="../australians-overseas/061-02020000-01.html">Transferring a customer record to provide additional service options when customer is going overseas long term</a>.

		<li>
<strong>No</strong>&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
The Portability Script - Departures and Returns will code the person's departure, <strong>however</strong> the departure will not be assessed until Home Affairs confirms they have left Australia</li>
			<li>
In some circumstances, their departure may not be coded immediately but a review will be created by the script on the Future Activity List (<strong>FAL</strong>) screen. When the review comes due and is received in Work Load Manager when ready for work, re-run the Portability Script - Departures and Returns, which will ask if the Service Officer wants it to code the absence based on the previously collected information. If their details have not changed, '<strong>S</strong>'elect '<strong>Yes</strong>' and it will pick up the data <strong>DOC</strong> and automatically record the departure based on that information</li>
			<li>
If they leave Australia more than 3 days either side of the date advised (and recorded by the script) the country of destination will be recorded as '<strong>XX</strong>' ('Unspecified'), even if they have provided details of their destination country</li>
			<li>
If they are receiving a restricted payment (Disability Support Pension (DSP), JobSeeker Payment (JSP), Youth Allowance (YA), Austudy, ABSTUDY or Special Benefit (SpB)), and change their departure date by more than 3 days, any approved reason for the absence will not be recorded. The system will place '<strong>OTH</strong>' in the <strong>Code</strong> field, which will cause payment to suspend on departure (or after 4 weeks in 12 months for DSP). The reason for this is that the customer's approval may no longer be relevant, therefore they <strong>must</strong> advise of changes to their departure dates so the reason for approval remains valid. It is therefore important to advise them to tell Services Australia if they change their date of departure</li>
