<p>This document outlines the process for completing an Aged Care assets assessment for care recipients assessed under pre 1 July 2014 assessment schemes.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Aged_Care_asset">Aged care assets assessments</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>An assets assessment for aged care purposes is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the net value of a person's assets either on or before the date the customer enters permanent residential aged care</li>
		</ul>
<p>Changes in the value of the customer's assets after they enter care are not relevant to an assessment made for that admission to care.</p>

<p>Since 1 July 2005, Services Australia and the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) have been undertaking asset assessments. Prior to that date, service providers were responsible for assessing the assets of their care recipients.</p>

<p>Applying for an assets assessment is voluntary. However it is compulsory where the care recipient wishes to claim either concessional, assisted, or supported resident status. Assessment of care can be completed either prior to or after entry into care.</p>

<p>Only the care recipient (and nominee where applicable) are notified of the result of an assets assessment. As the service provider does not receive notification, the care recipient may elect to show the notification letter to the service providers.</p>

<p>A care recipient’s resident status is determined by the assets assessment in conjunction with&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
care needs, plus</li>
		<li>
additional criteria for pre 2008 reform care recipients</li>
		</ul>
<p>If on the day they enter residential care, a care recipient&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
has assets above the minimum assets amount, or</li>
		<li>
does not complete a Calculation of your cost of care (SA457, SA486 ) they would pay an&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Accommodation Charge (for High Level Care), or</li>
			<li>
Accommodation Bond (for Low Level Care or Extra Service Facility)</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>Care recipients with net assessed assets&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
equal to, or</li>
		<li>
less than the relevant minimum permissible asset amount are not required to pay either an accommodation bond or an accommodation charge</li>
		</ul>
<p>An accommodation supplement is paid at the maximum rate for care recipients who are not required to pay an accommodation bond or accommodation charge. Where the care recipient is liable for an accommodation charge the amount of supplement is reduced. Accommodation Supplements are for care recipients that have low care classifications and are liable to pay an accommodation bond. The provider has a monthly retention amount from the bond.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The following applies to an assets assessment&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The assessment is based on the value of assessable assets on or before the date of entry to care. Unlike post 1 July 2014 assessment schemes, the accommodation charge does not change. This irrespective of any change in asset value after entry date</li>
		<li>
The value of the principal home is included in the assets assessment (unless a protected person exemption exists). However the value is not capped</li>
		<li>
The assessable asset amount is reduced by allowable asset reductions. This includes mortgages (even when home was exempt), credit cards, utility bills, outstanding loans and any other outstanding liabilities</li>
		</ul>
<p>The results of an assets assessment are displayed on the Customer First RCAA Assessment Determination (<strong>RCAD</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>Information about when a form is required for an assets assessment is on the Background page of <a href="../older-australians/065-09000000-01.html">Aged Care means assessment</a>.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>An assets assessment may be requested for a deceased or discharged care recipient when a care recipient&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
was originally assessed as low care and the service provider did not negotiate an accommodation bond (as assets were below the threshold)</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the provider was not paid accommodation supplements as there was no assets assessment</li>
			<li>
completing an assets assessment will result in the payment of any accommodation supplements that may be due to the provider</li>		</ul>
		<li>
was originally assessed as high care and no accommodation costs were charged (as assets were below the threshold). It is then found that they have been paying an accommodation charge at the maximum rate as there was no assets assessment completed</li>
			<ul>			<li>
completing an assets assessment will adjust supplements paid to the provider if it determined that assets were below the threshold. If applicable the service provider will then refund any overpaid accommodation charge to the care recipient</li>		</ul>
		<li>
has a completed assessment effective from date of entry that requires correction to adjust accommodation charges paid by them</li>

they are their payment or correspondence nominee (as per the <strong>Nominee Link Summary (NOLS)</strong> screen). Or they have a power of attorney or other guardianship type authority in relation to the care recipient</li>

the care recipient is unable to sign the application form. In this case a letter from a doctor, hospital or social worker stating that the care recipient is unable to sign is sufficient authority</li>

they are the Director of Nursing for the service provider and they provide a letter from a doctor stating that the care recipient is unable to sign the application form</li>
