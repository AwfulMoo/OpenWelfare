<p><strong>Debt information</strong></p>

<p>The HSP bonus payments were not used to recover any Social Security or Family Assistance debts and having a debt had no effect on entitlement to HSP bonus payment.</p>

<p>No debts will be raised where a person has received the ESS payment and it was subsequently found that the person and/or child should not have attracted the payment, unless the person knowingly made a false or misleading statement, or knowingly provided false information.</p>

<p>HSP debts will need to be raised manually.</p>

<p><strong>HSP bonus review process</strong></p>

<p>Recipients can request a review of the non-payment of a HSP bonus payment. </p>

<p>Service Officers must ensure they fully discuss with recipients the reason they were ineligible for the HSP bonus payment before recording a request for review. The reason the recipient was ineligible must also be included in the <strong>DOC</strong>.</p>
