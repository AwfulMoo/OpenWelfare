	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The Scheme is a voluntary arrangement that provides financial support to customers in the form of a non-taxable, government funded loan. </p>

<p>The loan&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
accrues compound interest, currently 3.95% each fortnight until repaid in full</li>
		<li>
is secured against Australian real estate owned by the customer and/or partner</li>
		</ul>
<p>Customers&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
can repay the loan electronically in full or in part at any time through their Centrelink online account or BPAY even though there are no mandatory repayments</li>
		<li>
must settle the loan&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
at the sale of the secured property, or </li>
			<li>
through the deceased customer’s estate</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>The Scheme loans are paid each fortnight for a short or indefinite period until their loan balance reaches their Maximum Loan Amount. The Maximum Loan Amount is based on the age of the customer and partner (if applicable) and how much equity there is to offer as security. Lump sum loans are not currently available through this scheme.</p>

<p>Advise customers they should seek independent legal or financial advice before applying for a loan under the Scheme.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Background">Background</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The original Scheme was set up in 1985 when the assets test was introduced. </p>

<p>On 10 July 1996, a new scheme commenced and new applications were no longer accepted under the old provisions.</p>

<p>On 1 July 2019, the current scheme expanded&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
to increase the maximum fortnightly loan rate, and </li>
		<li>
the eligibility criteria to allow more people to participate</li>
		</ul>
<p>Before 1 July 2019, to be eligible the customer’s qualifying payment rate had to be a reduced rate because of their income or assets. Nil rate customers could apply as long as their pension rate was reduced to nil by only one (not both) of the income or assets tests. These requirements were removed from 1 July 2019, enabling maximum rate pensioners to participate in the scheme, and people who are not eligible for a pension under both the income test and assets test.</p>

<p>On 1 January 2022, the Scheme was renamed to the Home Equity Access Scheme.</p>

<p>The loan amount a customer owes under the Scheme can be deducted from the value of the customer's assessable real estate for social security payments or benefits. </p>

the value of the customer's assessable assets may decrease (depending on whether the value of the asset is appreciating)</li>

their pension payable under the assets test may increase, and</li>

<p>No reduction in the overall value of assessable assets occurs where the person's principal home is the security for the loan as this is an exempt or non-assessable asset. The only exception is when the principal home is partly assessable because the house and curtilage exceeds 2 hectares and does not meet the extended land use test.</p>

<p>The Scheme is also open to self-funded retirees so long as they qualify for (but not necessarily receive) one of the qualifying pensions.</p>

<p>This may be because they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
are not eligible to receive a pension under the income and assets test, or</li>
		<li>
have chosen not to claim a pension</li>
		</ul>
<p>Customers who receive their entire payment as a Scheme loan without any qualifying payment components are ‘the loan-only’ customers. These customers do not meet the definition of an income support payment (ISP) recipient, as they do not receive a payable rate of a social security pension or benefit. </p>

<p>Service Officers can identify a loan-only customer if the Scheme qualifying payment is Current Zero Rate (CZR) because of nil rate reason PLS.</p>

<p>The loan-only customers are not entitled to a Pensioner Concession Card (PCC). However some customers may have a grandfathered entitlement to a non-pensioner PCC (see <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-06050000-01.html">Pensioner Concession Cards (PCC)</a> for details). Customers who wish to test their eligibility for a concession card can lodge an online claim for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card (CSHC).</p>

<p>The maximum Scheme rate payable per fortnight is 150% of the maximum payment rate of the qualifying payment (1.5 times the maximum payment rate of the qualifying payment).</p>

<p>The maximum payment rate is the sum of the maximum basic rate of pension, and any supplements (for example, Pension Supplement and Energy Supplement) and Rent Assistance a person is eligible for.</p>

<p>Customers provide a nominated amount they want to receive per fortnight (p/f). They can either choose to receive&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the maximum amount available (loan type ‘maximum’), being 150% (1.5 times) the maximum payment rate</li>
		<li>
a percentage that is lower than 150% (loan type ‘percent’). For example, 120% p/f (maximum payment rate x 1.2) or 80% (maximum payment rate x 0.8), or</li>
		<li>
a fixed flat rate (loan type ‘fixed’) for example, $500 p/f</li>
		</ul>
<p>If a customer gets a pension&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the loan is added to the pension each fortnight</li>
		<li>
the combined amount of pension and loan can’t exceed 150% of the maximum payment rate</li>
		<li>
the loan amount will automatically increase or decrease&#58;</li>

if their pension rate changes in order to maintain their chosen percentage for that fortnight (which may be 150% or a lower percent)</li>		</ul>
		<li>
if a customer does not want their loan amount to increase over a certain amount&#58;</li>

they can choose to receive a fixed loan amount each fortnight</li>		</ul>
		<li>
the combined fixed rate of loan and actual pension rate can’t exceed 150% of the maximum rate of pension</li>

<p>If the customer or their partner received a Department of Veterans' Affairs disability payment before 1 January 2022, their maximum payment rate for the Scheme purposes would have been affected by any <a target="_blank" href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-03060010-01.html">Defence Force Income Support Allowance (DFISA)</a> they received.
