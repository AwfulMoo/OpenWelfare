<P>This document explains the Home Equity Access Scheme (the Scheme) to help Service Officers answer enquiries from customers, and escalate questions that are more complex.</P><A name=bp01_L2GI_Government_inte class=anchor></A>
<H2 id=_Toc344898764>Government intent</H2>
<P>Customers and self-funded retirees who are Age Pension age (or partnered to a person who is) can access equity in their Australian real estate asset(s) under the Home Equity Access Scheme to supplement their retirement income.</P>
<DIV class=twisty><A name=bp01_L2GT_Pension_Loans_S class=anchor></A>
<H2 id=_Toc344898764>What is the Scheme</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>The Scheme is a voluntary arrangement that provides financial support to customers in the form of a non-taxable, government funded loan. </P>
<P>The loan:</P>
<UL>
<LI>accrues compound interest each fortnight, currently 3.95% per annum, until repaid in full</LI>
<LI>is secured against Australian real estate owned by the customer and/or partner</LI></UL>
<P>Customers:</P>
<UL>
<LI>can repay the loan electronically in full or in part at any time through their Centrelink online account or BPAY® even though there are no mandatory repayments</LI>
<LI>must settle the loan:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>at the sale of the secured property, or </LI>
<LI>through the deceased customer’s estate</LI></UL></UL>
<P>The Scheme loans are paid as an advance lump sum, fortnightly payments or a combination of both for a short or indefinite period until their loan balance reaches their maximum loan amount (MLA). </P>
<P>The MLA is based on the age of the customer and partner (if applicable) and how much equity there is to offer as security. </P>
<P>Customers should seek independent legal or financial advice before applying for a loan under the Scheme.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P></P>
<DIV class=twisty><A name=bp01_L2GT_Background class=anchor></A>
<H2 id=_Toc344898764>Background</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>The original Scheme was set up in 1985 when the assets test was introduced. </P>
<P>On 10 July 1996, a new scheme commenced and new applications were no longer accepted under the old provisions.</P>
<P>On 1 July 2019, the current scheme expanded:</P>
<UL>
<LI>to increase the maximum fortnightly loan rate, and </LI>
<LI>the eligibility criteria to allow more people to participate</LI></UL>
<P>Before 1 July 2019, to be eligible the customer’s qualifying payment rate had to be a reduced rate because of their income or assets. Nil rate customers could apply as long as their pension rate was reduced to nil by only one (not both) of the income or assets tests. These requirements were removed from 1 July 2019, enabling maximum rate pensioners to participate in the scheme, and people who are not eligible for a pension under both the income test and assets test.</P>
<P>On 1 January 2022, the Scheme was renamed to the Home Equity Access Scheme.</P>
<P>On 1 July 2022, the Scheme introduced access to lump sum advances and a No Negative Equity Guarantee.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<P>Do <STRONG>not</STRONG> escalate general enquires about claim timeliness or the progress of a claim.</P>
<P>If a customer asks about their Scheme claim, confirm a claim has been lodged and advise it will be allocated for processing in due course.</P>

<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>The loan amount a customer owes under the Scheme can be deducted from the value of the customer's assessable real estate for social security payments or benefits. </P>
<P>As the amount owing increases with each payment made under the Scheme:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the value of the customer's assessable assets may decrease (depending on whether the value of the asset is appreciating)</LI>
<LI>their pension payable under the assets test may increase, and</LI>
<LI>this may lead to the customer’s fortnightly loan amount reducing</LI></UL>
<P>No reduction in the overall value of assessable assets occurs where the person's principal home is the security for the loan as this is an exempt or non-assessable asset. The only exception is when the principal home is partly assessable because the house and curtilage exceeds 2 hectares and does not meet the extended land use test.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<H2 id=_Toc344898764>Home Equity Access Scheme only customers</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>The Scheme is also open to self-funded retirees so long as they qualify for (but not necessarily receive) one of the qualifying pensions.</P>
<P>This may be because they:</P>
<UL>
<LI>are not eligible to receive a pension under the income and assets test, or</LI>
<LI>have chosen not to claim a pension</LI></UL>
<P>Customers who receive their entire payment as a Scheme loan without any qualifying payment components are ‘the loan-only’ customers. These customers do not meet the definition of an income support payment (ISP) recipient, as they do not receive a payable rate of a social security pension or benefit. </P>
<P>Service Officers can identify a loan-only customer if the Scheme qualifying payment is Current Zero Rate (CZR) because of nil rate reason PLS.</P>
<P>The loan-only customers are not entitled to a Pensioner Concession Card (PCC). However some customers may have a grandfathered entitlement to a non-pensioner PCC (see <A href="../additional-products-and-services/101-06050000-01.html">Pensioner Concession Cards (PCC)</A> for details). Customers who wish to test their eligibility for a concession card can lodge an online claim for the <A href="../older-australians/065-06000000-01.html" target=_blank>Commonwealth Seniors Health Card (CSHC)</A>.</P>
<P>Customers that get their income support payment entirely as a loan payment under the Scheme, can only be transferred to Age Pension. </P>
<P>Before transferring a Scheme only customer to Age Pension, Age Processing must contact the Home Equity Access Scheme National team to determine if the transfer is appropriate. </P>
