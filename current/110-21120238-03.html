<p>Some customers will contact in their attempts to fraudulently obtain emergency payments. </p>

<p>They may do this to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
have a <strong>new Customer Reference Number (CRN)</strong> created under a <strong>false identity</strong> or under other people’s identities </li>
		<li>
obtain the <strong>CRN </strong>and <a href="../self-service/133-02010030-01.html">linking code<strong></a> </strong>to claim online</li>
		<li>
check the <strong>status</strong> of their claim </li>
		<li>
have <strong>self-service</strong> unlocked</li>
		<li>
complete an Assisted Customer Claim (ACC) as they have exceeded the online <strong>withdrawn claim</strong> limit</li>
		<li>
request a <strong>re-issue</strong> of a payment</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer has provided a CRN, staff <strong>must </strong>thoroughly review the customer’s record and <strong>all </strong>Display on Access Docs (<strong>DOA) DOCs</strong>. </p>

<p>In Process Direct&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Select the <strong>Notes </strong>icon from the menu bar</li>
		<li>
Select the arrow twisty <strong>Display on access documents. </strong>This will show all <strong>DOA DOCs</strong> on the customer’s record</li>
		</ul>
<p>In Customer First&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
In <strong>Next</strong> key <strong>DL</strong> and then press [<strong>Enter</strong>]</li>
		<li>
<strong>DOA DOCs </strong>will show under <strong>Display on access documents</strong></li>
		</ul>
<p>If there is no <strong>DOA DOC</strong> indicating fraud is suspected, look for warning signs. There may be other warning signs that a claim may be fraudulent. It may be an odd feeling or inconsistencies in what the customer says.</p>

<p>Some <strong>warning signs</strong> include if the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
calls from a blocked number or a different number than recorded on the record</li>
		<li>
cannot provide the <strong>password</strong> on a <strong>DOA DOC</strong></li>
		<li>
has trouble answering <strong>Proof of Record Ownership (PoRO)</strong> questions or failed Interactive Voice Recognition (IVR) authentication</li>
		<li>
there are <strong>DOCs</strong> on the record (on the <strong>DL/Notes</strong> screen) indicating a fraudulent claim or compromised record, for example&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
<strong>DOA DOC</strong>, Pre-payment integrity check, Scams and Identity Theft Helpdesk (SAITH), Locked Self-Service, Claim progress</li>
			<li>
<strong>FRD </strong>keywords attached to the claim, such as FRDASS/FRDCHK</li>
			<li>
<strong>DOA DOC </strong>titled ‘Caution Emergency Payments’</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>inconsistencies</strong> in claim details </li>
		<li>
wants to <strong>claim for a new address </strong>in a declared local government area (LGA) for an emergency event</li>
		<li>
has provided a <strong>payment destination </strong>in the claim that differs from regular payment destination </li>
		<li>
multiple bank accounts used across different emergency payment claims including&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment</li>
			<li>
Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment (AGDRP), and </li>

Disaster Recovery Allowance (DRA)</li>		</ul>
		<li>
insists on needing their claim to be assessed <strong>urgently</strong></li>
		<li>
indications on the customer’s record of <strong>incarceration</strong></li>
			<ul>			<li>
payments may be suspended or cancelled with reason imprisonment ‘IMP’</li>
			<li>
for example the benefit status on the customer’s record may show <strong>JSP/SUS-IMP</strong> </li>		</ul>

has contact <strong>phone numbers</strong> that are currently linked to other customers</li>
			<ul>			<li>
check <a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-21120238-03.html#bp03_tbl_Actions_to_prev_8">SMS/Email Search</a> </li>		</ul>
		<li>
has multiple <strong>withdrawn claims</strong> or exceeded online withdrawn claim limit</li>
		<li>
is unable to <strong>claim online </strong>because of unauthorised access has claimed a payment before that was <strong>previously rejected </strong>because of the validity of the claim or the customer's identity</li>
		<li>
is <strong>recently cancelled</strong> from an income support payment and is now claiming Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment</li>
		<li>
has a <strong>conflicting story</strong> about how they have been adversely affected by a major disaster</li>
			<ul>			<li>
for example, claiming to be a delivery driver but unable to provide drivers licence details</li>		</ul>
		<li>
the customer calls from an <strong>overseas phone number</strong> reporting to be in an affected area</li>
			<ul>			<li>
for example the number the customer is calling from is longer than 10 digits</li>		</ul>
		<li>
is calling and saying they have never dealt with Centrelink and <strong>need a CRN</strong> to claim and they&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
cannot provide details of children, parents, partner</li>
			<li>
cannot upload or provide details of <strong>at least one verifiable identity document</strong>, such as a Medicare card, driver’s licence, birth certificate or passport. These documents are all verified through the Documentation Verification System (DVS)</li>
			<li>
can only provide identity documents such as a Bank card or Proof of Age card. These documents are <strong>not</strong> verified through DVS</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Do not grant the payment</strong> if there are <strong>any</strong> concerns about the validity of the claim or the customer's identity. Staff must&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
make sure they are satisfied that the person making the claim or on the phone is who they say they are, before making any updates </li>
		<li>
ask questions and using the resources available to confirm the information a customer is giving</li>
		<li>
record a <strong>DOC</strong> in circumstances where information received from or provided to a customer will need to be documented</li>
			<ul>			<li>
this documented information builds a history of advice and actions taken when interacting with customers (information related to suspected fraud that cannot be recorded on the record can be recorded in a tip-off)  </li>		</ul>

<p>Staff may place a <strong>DOA DOC </strong>on a customer’s record with important instructions for other staff accessing it.</p>

<p>Staff must&#58;</p>

		</ul>
<p>When a pre-payment integrity check&#58;</p>

<p>Some fraudulent claims occur because of fabricated records being created, highlighting the need for care to be taken when establishing a person's identity. </p>

<p>Staff must make sure they are satisfied that the person making the claim or on the phone is who they say they are, before creating a new record or issuing a linking code. </p>

<p><a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-04110000-03.html">Proof of Record Ownership</a> <strong>cannot </strong>be completed on a new CRN. It is more critical that customers provide verifiable identity details when a CRN is created. Take extra care to make sure that identity requirements are met when creating a new record.</p>

<p>Some key indicators from recent fraud activity to be <strong>aware </strong>of when <strong>creating a new record </strong>include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The customer's phone number does not show and says 'anonymous'</li>
		<li>
The customer provides a different phone number for their record creation saying they are using someone else's phone for the contact. Check <a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-21120238-03.html#bp03_tbl_Actions_to_prev_8">SMS/Email Search</a> for links to other customers</li>
		<li>
Customers who say they are Australian born but do not have a Customer Reference Number (CRN)&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
ask where their parents were born</li>
			<li>
if in Australia, then may have a child record for Family Tax Benefit (FTB) purposes</li>		</ul>
		<li>
The customer&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
struggles to answer simple PoRO questions such as Date of Birth (DOB), partners or children’s name or DOB - do not continue with the call </li>
			<li>
provides&#58;<br>- <strong>proof of age </strong>or <strong>photo ID card</strong> and <strong>bank cards</strong> as their only identity documents, or <br>- their <strong>Drivers Licence</strong> fails DVS and the customer advises it recently expired or license was suspended</li>
			<li>
will say they have a friend or partner with them who also needs to claim and passes the phone to them</li>
			<li>
seeks the <strong>alternative identity</strong> process and cannot provide at least one verifiable document</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> it may be reasonable for an individual to have one of these indicators. However, the more indicators a person has, the greater the identity fraud risk.</p>

<p><strong>Never</strong> give the customer details for them to confirm. Scammers collect these details so they can impersonate customers and access their record.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Determine <a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-04110000-03.html">Proof of Record Ownership</a> by <strong>asking multiple PoRO questions</strong> in addition to CRN, name, date of birth and password&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Name and date of birth of parents, partner, children</li>
			<li>
When they travelled overseas last (check the <strong>RSIM</strong> screen)</li>
			<li>
Email and telephone number</li>
			<li>
Last known payment with Centrelink</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Confirm</strong> that the customer does not have an existing record, see <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07030010-03.html">Searching for a customer on the system</a></li>
			<ul>			<li>
Search with minimal fields, such as the surname and date of birth only</li>
			<li>
Check spelling, and ask if they have gone by any other names</li>
			<li>
Check if the customer's mobile phone number has been recorded on another record by conducting a <a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-21120238-03.html#bp03_tbl_Actions_to_prev_Conduct_">SMS/Email Search</a> </li>		</ul>
		<li>
Staff with <a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-06030000-01.html">Online Search Facility</a> access can perform additional searches for the customer</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Customers born in Australia should have a Medicare (HIC) record on OLS</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Be careful when coding the Identity Confirmation Dashboard. DVS <strong>does not</strong> verify documents such as&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
<strong>proof of age card</strong></li>
			<li>
<strong>photo ID card</strong></li>
			<li>
<strong>bank cards</strong></li>
			<li>
<strong>shooter or firearm licence</strong></li>		</ul>
		<li>

<p>Some customers deliberately cancel their income support payments (ISP) in order to claim Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment. They may attempt to have their payment restored after the Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment has been granted. </p>

<p>If a customer has voluntarily cancelled their income support payment (CAN/CLR) in the 28 days before the start date of the 7 day period they are claiming Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment and has not reported employment or self-employment income in their last payment period, they may need to provide evidence that they would have worked in the period. See, <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-22011652-03.html">Processing Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment claims in Process Direct</a>.</p>

<p>Payment cannot be restored unless the customer remains eligible for the whole period covered by the restoration. To make sure the correct payment is delivered, any changes of circumstances must be updated as part of the activity to restore the customer's record.</p>
