<UL>
<LI>Customers that have already turned Age Pension age and are residentially qualified should transfer to Age Pension as soon as possible. Staff <STRONG>must</STRONG> complete Assisted Customer Claim (ACC) at first point of contact for these customers</LI>
<LI>Customers that have not yet reached Age Pension age will be invited to transfer to Age Pension 13 weeks prior to turning Age Pension age</LI>
<LI>Current WA customers who will not be residentially qualified for Age Pension on 1 January 2022, will have a residence exemption coded on the Additional Residence Details (<STRONG>ARD</STRONG>) screen as part of their claim/transfer to allow transfer to Age Pension on that date.

<P>91 days before reaching Age Pension age, if the customer is:</P>
<UL>
<LI>subscribed to online services, they will be sent an online letter to their myGov inbox to complete the transfer to Age Pension. The letter will include a hyperlink to the agency's website and direct link to their online transfer task</LI>
<LI>not subscribed to online letters or Electronic Messaging, they will be sent a letter and a Transfer to Age Pension (SA383) form by mail, with the option to complete the transfer online rather than return the form</LI></UL>
<P>If the Transfer to Age Pension has <STRONG>not</STRONG> been completed online/returned 28 days before reaching Age Pension age and the customer is:</P>
<UL>
<LI>subscribed to online services, they will be sent a reminder letter to their myGov Inbox</LI>
<LI>not subscribed to online letters through myGov Inbox but to Electronic Messaging, they will be sent a reminder SMS or email depending on their preferred communication method</LI>
<LI>not subscribed to either myGov Inbox or Electronic Messaging, they will be sent a reminder letter by mail</LI></UL>
<P>If the customer has not completed the online task/returned the SA383 form upon reaching Age Pension age, their (and their partner's) payment will be suspended, or cancelled.</P>
<P>If the customer reaches Age Pension age and their current payment suspends or cancels, the Transfer to Age Pension task will remain available on the Centrelink online account landing page for up to 13 weeks after the suspension or cancellation date.</P>

<P>Some online transfers will not require Service Officer intervention and will automatically complete once submitted by the customer. Auto completion may occur where the transfer is straightforward, for example, there are no updates required, no documentation to be provided, and no adverse impacts on the entitlements of the customer (or their partner).</P>
<P>Where transfers to Age Pension cannot auto complete, the claim status of the activity will change to 'In Process' and either an AGE/NCL or PEN/REA activity will be generated based on the reason for auto-complete not proceeding.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<P>If an income support customer contacts about transferring to Age Pension because they have not received an invitation to transfer and they are within 13 weeks of Age Pension age, <IMG title="A self service option is available" alt="" src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png"> an online transfer must be offered first.

<LI>early warnings if claimants may not be eligible, for example, not residentially qualified</LI>
<LI>less information to provide, as information from Centrelink records will be pre-populated into the online transfer</LI>
<LI>for Carer Payment and Disability Support Pension customers, detailed messaging will populate within the online transfer process. This outlines the customer's circumstances including the advantages and disadvantages of transferring from their respective payment. This enables them to make an informed decision about whether to transfer to Age Pension or remain on their current payment</LI>
<LI>the ability to monitor the progress of a transfer through Centrelink online account or the Express Plus Centrelink mobile app</LI></UL>
<P>If customers decline or are unable to use the online transfer offer, the Assisted Customer Claim (ACC) can be run with the customer. This includes Widow Allowance (WA) and Partner Allowance (PA) customers as their payments will cease on 1 January 2022.</P>
<P>If a correspondence nominee enquires about transferring to Age Pension on behalf of a customer, Service Officers can run the ACC workflow. ACC allows for the Verbal Declaration or signed CDF to be made/provided by the customer or their correspondence nominee.</P>
<P>A declaration is required prior to submitting the transfer. When a Service Officer reads the Verbal Declaration to the customer (or correspondence nominee), they must tick the Declaration box on the <STRONG>Review your claim</STRONG> page. This confirms that the Service Officer has read the declaration script and the customer (or correspondence nominee) accepts it.

<UL>
<LI>invite the customer to log into their online services, accept the customer declaration and submit their transfer, or</LI>

<P>Care is to be taken to ensure that customers who will soon lose qualification of their existing payment (for example, JobSeeker Payment) are processed as a priority and at the earliest touch point to avoid placing the customer in financial hardship. This includes Widow Allowance (WA) and Partner Allowance (PA) customers as their payments will cease on 1 January 2022.</P>
<P>If staff who do not have the appropriate Transfer to Age Pension skill tags encounter urgent transfers to Age Pension where a customer is in hardship, or payment was cancelled, or is unable to complete the transfer and requires urgent processing, create a <A href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-05050020-03.html">Fast Note</A>:</P>
