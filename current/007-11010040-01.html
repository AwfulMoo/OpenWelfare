<p>For financial years 2012-13 to 2017-18 it is a condition for payment of the FTB Part A supplement that immunisation requirements are met for each age milestone.</p>

<p>From 1 January 2016 to 30 June 2018, these immunisation requirements apply until the end of the calendar year that a child turns 19 years of age.</p>

<p>From 1 July 2012 to 31 December 2015, these immunisation requirements apply only to children in the financial year that they turned 1, 2 and 5 years of age.</p>

<p>From 1 July 2018 onwards, FTB immunisation requirements are linked to the rate of FTB Part A. See <a href="../families/007-18043002-01.html">Immunisation requirements for Family Tax Benefit from 1 July 2018</a>.</p>

<p>Immunisation requirements also apply to <a href="../families/007-17103109-01.html">Child Care Subsidy (CCS)</a> and Child Care Benefit (CCB).</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> exceptions apply to some non-parent carers or if a customer or child is deceased.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) is responsible for the assessment of a child's immunisation status.</p>

<p>Customers are not required to provide documentary evidence of a child's immunisation history to Centrelink.</p>

<p>A child meets the immunisation requirements when their FTB immunisation status on the <a target="_blank" href="../your-health/011-10170030-01.html">Child Immunisation Summary</a> guided procedure is displayed as <strong>Yes</strong> for the relevant milestone. This status is provided by the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) which is updated by the child's vaccination provider each time the child receives a vaccination.</p>

<p>A child meets the requirements if they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
are up to date with vaccinations appropriate to their age, listed in the Childhood schedule on the Department of Health and Aged Care's National Immunisation Program Schedule - these vaccinations are typically given to children under 5 years of age</li>
		<li>
are on a suitable <strong>catch-up schedule</strong> according to the current Australian Immunisation Handbook</li>
		<li>
have an approved medical exemption from immunisation which has been recorded on the AIR, or</li>
		<li>
have an exemption from the immunisation requirements (in extremely limited circumstances)</li>
		</ul>
<p>The <a href="../families/007-11010040-05.html">Resources</a> page contains a link to the Childhood schedule on the Department of Health and Aged Care website. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> school age and adolescent vaccinations on the school programs schedule (such as the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine) are <strong>not</strong> included.</p>

<p>If a child has <strong>missed vaccinations</strong> on the Childhood schedule, they will meet the immunisation requirements if they start and remain up to date on a suitable catch-up schedule according to the current Australian Immunisation Handbook. The child's vaccination provider will update the AIR with the appropriate information, including when the next vaccination is due. The child will meet the immunisation requirements as long as they remain up to date according to this schedule.</p>

<p>Centrelink Service Officers must not discuss specific vaccinations or vaccination schedules with customers. If a customer has questions about specific vaccinations or concerns about vaccinations, they should be referred to their vaccination provider.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Immunisation requirements are met if one of the following medical exemptions is recorded on the AIR&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
medical exemption due to medical contraindication or natural immunity - these are recorded on the AIR by the child's general practitioner, paediatrician, public health physician, infectious disease physician or clinical immunologist</li>
		<li>
temporary unavailability of a vaccine - these are notified by the AIR</li>
		</ul>
<p>Generally, exemptions from immunisation are managed and recorded by the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR).</p>

<p>Customers must be referred to their child's general practitioner if there is a medical reason why a child cannot be fully immunised.</p>

<p>In <strong>extremely limited</strong> cases a child may also meet the immunisation requirements if a Secretary Determination exemption from immunisation applies. These exemptions are assessed on a case-by-case basis and are <a href="../your-health/011-10170030-01.html">recorded as an immunisation override</a> by a Families override contact following approval from the Level 2 Policy Helpdesk.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> these exemptions are recorded for a prescribed timeframe and generally do not exempt a child from all vaccinations.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>An FTB immunisation override may be required in limited circumstances if a child's immunisation status, or the date from which that status can be applied, is not correctly assessed by the system. Immunisation overrides can only be applied for a prescribed period of time.</p>

<p>Overrides can only be <a href="../your-health/011-10170030-01.html">recorded by a Families override contact</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Child remains overseas at reconciliation override</strong></p>

<p>This override can be recorded if a child has received vaccinations overseas and remains overseas at FTB reconciliation. As the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) can only be updated by Australian vaccination providers, the overseas vaccinations will not be included in the child's immunisation status.</p>

<p>The customer must provide written evidence of the overseas vaccinations from the child's health provider. If the child has received at least one of the vaccinations for their age milestone they are taken to meet the immunisation requirements.</p>

<p><strong>This evidence must not be referred to the AIR</strong>. To update the AIR with details of vaccinations received overseas, the customer must provide this evidence to their Australian vaccination provider upon their return to Australia. The vaccination provider can then update the AIR.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A child's immunisation status is obtained by linking the child's Centrelink record with the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR). This is done by using the Medicare Information (<strong>MEI</strong>) screen to request a link with the AIR. Once the link is established the AIR will provide the child's immunisation status.</p>

<p>If a child's record was not linked with the AIR, the customer was asked to provide their child's Medicare number and Individual Reference Number (IRN) as part of the new claim for FTB. A reminder letter was sent before the end of financial year reconciliation if the child's record was not linked.</p>

<p>A manual matching process applies for children who are not enrolled or are not eligible for enrolment with Medicare. See <a href="../your-health/011-10170010-01.html">Establish a Family Tax Benefit (FTB) link for a child between Centrelink and the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) </a>.</p>

<p>In limited circumstances, customers may provide other evidence directly to Services Australia for an assessment which is not handled by the AIR (for example, Secretary Determination exemption).</p>

<p>If a customer wants to update the immunisation status held on the AIR they must take evidence to their vaccination provider who will update the AIR if appropriate. This includes cases where a child has received vaccinations overseas or where an immunisation history is incomplete.</p>

<p><strong>Non-parent carers</strong></p>

<p>On 1 January 2016, immunisation requirements were extended and some exemptions removed. This means that two sets of rules were applied during the 2015-16 financial year.</p>

<p>Pre-1 January 2016 rules will be applied when reconciling the FTB Part A supplement for the period 1 July - 31 December 2015 and extended immunisation requirements will be applied for the period 1 January - 30 June 2016.</p>

<p>If a child's 2015-16 FTB immunisation status on the <strong>Child Immunisation Summary</strong> guided procedure displays as <a href="../families/007-11010040-03.html#bp03_tbl_Checking_a_chil_Step03">Partial</a>, the child is not currently up to date and does not meet the immunisation requirements from 1 January 2016. This means they will only be eligible for a partial supplement (for days on or before 31 December 2015). They will not be eligible for the supplement for any days after 1 January 2016 unless requirements are met by the end of the lodgement year.</p>
