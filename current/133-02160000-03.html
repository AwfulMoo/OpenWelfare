<p>If the customer does not submit their claim, it will expire after 13 weeks. The customer will usually need to reclaim. However, there are some instances where staff can assess an expired claim. The following can assist with the determination&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Online claims (without Service Officer intervention) not submitted by the customer and the claim has expired<br><strong>Process&#58;</strong> Reclaim required. Advise customer to claim online or run ACC</li>
		<li>
ACC claims, where the customer returns all documents within 13 weeks but does not submit the claim. It must be clearly documented that the customer was advised and agreed to submit their claim online<br><strong>Process&#58;</strong> Reclaim required. Advise customer to claim online or run ACC</li>
		<li>
ACC claims and the customer returns all documents, including the Customer Declaration Form (CDF) or verbal declaration, within 13 weeks but does not submit the claim<br><strong>Process</strong>&#58; The determining officer (APS 6 level or higher) must clearly document the reasons for the claim to be reassessed with the appropriate start date. The start date would usually be the date the last mandatory document was provided. The <strong>DOC</strong> can remain closed. Where the APS6 determination is not in the customer's favour, the customer will need to reclaim. Advise the customer to claim online or run ACC.</li>
		<li>
CCM claims started through ACC that have not been submitted, and the customer did not supply documents (including the CDF or verbal declaration) documented on the customer's record within 13 weeks<br><strong>Process&#58;</strong> Reclaim required. Advise customer to claim online or run ACC</li>
