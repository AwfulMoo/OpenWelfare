<p><strong>Question&#58; How can customers apply for an advance payment?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Generally eligible customers are able to apply for an advance payment via any self service channel, over the telephone or by visiting their local service centre. There are some restrictions on which customers can use self service.</p>

<p>Customers who apply for an advance payment in the service centre or via self service channels will be issued with either a receipt number only or an immediate printed receipt number and information about the decision that has been made at the time of contact. Smart Centre Service Officers are able to issue a verbal receipt number to the customer.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Can a partner apply for an advance payment on behalf of a customer?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; No, unless they are the customer's nominee. A partner, although they may have permission to enquire, is not allowed to claim an advance payment on behalf of the customer.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; How can 'at risk' customers and customers with a nominee arrangement in place apply for an advance payment?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; For Social Security entitlement advances, 'at risk' customers are customers who are independent Youth Allowance (YA) or independent ABSTUDY recipients and are aged under 18 years.</p>

<p>'At risk' customers applying for a Social Security entitlement advance must have a face-to-face interview when applying (except if rural and/or remote). A thorough assessment of the customer's individual circumstances is required before the advance is assessed.</p>

<p>Customers must be made fully aware of the impacts of taking the offer an advance payment.</p>

<p>Rurally isolated customers are those who live in rural or remote areas who live more than 90 minutes from a service centre and have no access to a service centre.</p>

<p>Customers with a nominee are not able to use self service channels to apply for an advance payment and must contact a Service Officer at either a service centre or Smart Centre.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; How can weekly payment customers apply for an advance payment?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Weekly payment customers can apply for an advance payment via either Smart Centre Call or face to face. Weekly payment customers cannot use self service channels.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the information currently displayed in the advance payment workflow in relation to weekly payment customers requiring a face to face contact to request an advance payment is incorrect.</p>

<p>These customers require a thorough investigation of their circumstances and ability to repay without placing themselves in financial hardship.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Can income managed customers apply for an advance payment?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Yes, customers whose payments are Income managed can apply for an advance payment. However, 100% of the funds will be income managed so will not be paid into the customer's nominated bank account. These funds will be available the next day in the customer's Income Management account, and can be accessed by the customer through their BasicsCard or Third Party Organisation allocations.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; there is no one day or two day delivery based on the payment type the customer is receiving. Funds are credited with the nightly payment strip and available in the Income Management account the next day. This means customers who are granted an advance on a Friday can access these funds on the weekend using self service options to transfer to their BasicsCard.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Can Home Equity Access Scheme customers apply for an advance payment?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Customers who participate in the Home Equity Access Scheme can apply for an advance payment of either their pension (providing they receive a payable rate of pension) or their loan. Advance payments of the loan are assessed and paid separately to advance payments of their pension.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; What is the tax status of an advance payment?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; For tax purposes, advance payments are treated as a 'loan of money'. This applies irrespective of when the advance payment was paid during the financial year. Advance payments do not attract any additional tax liability as they are not an extra payment but a lump sum payment of the customer's ongoing entitlement.</p>

<p>2</p></td>
<td>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Can the advance be paid as a lump sum or instalments?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; All advances can be paid as a lump sum into the customer's normal bank account.</p>

<p>Social Security entitlement advance payments can also be paid in 2 instalments.</p>

<p>The customer must nominate the instalment amount and the date they require the second instalment to be paid. Staff must code this date in line with current payment processing times.</p>

<p>For pension customers, the instalment date is coded as 2 working days prior to the date the customer has requested the funds be paid. For non-pension customers, the instalment date is coded as 1 working day prior to the date the funds are required by the customer.</p>

<p>The second instalment must be paid within 6 months of grant.</p>

<p>When a customer elects to have instalments, the recovery rate is calculated on the full amount to be advanced.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; If an advance has been processed in 2 instalments in error, can this be undone?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; No, it cannot be undone, but the date of delivery of the second instalment can be changed to still deliver the advance in 2 instalments, but over consecutive days. Use the Manage Advances action from the Current Advances menu, select the advance to be modified, then select Adjust instalment date from the action drop down list in Process Direct to alter the delivery date of the second instalment.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; If an advance has been processed in error, can this be undone?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; If the advance has been processed due to a fraudulent claim or has been granted on an incorrect record, the advance can be removed by ICT. See, <a href="../payment-delivery/103-05040100-01.html">Deletion of advance granted on incorrect record or fraudulently claimed</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; If a customer calls to request an advance payment (and it has been processed), can the customer contact the agency later the same day to advise they no longer wish to receive the advance and request it be cancelled?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; No. Once the advance has been processed, the decision has been made under legislation to meet the customer's request. The customer should be advised the advance has been processed and payment has been made.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Can a customer on a low rate of pension be paid an advance?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58;  The system will look at the customer's rate of payment when deciding if an advance can be granted.  If the customer's rate of payment, taking into consideration any existing deductions, would not allow the advance payment to be granted at more than the minimum amount for the customer's situation or for the amount requested to be recovered, then advance will be rejected.</p>

<p>If the customer has been granted an advance payment on the incorrect record and the balance is still outstanding, a mySupport request needs to be raised to request the advance payment be moved to the correct CRN.   If the advance cannot be moved, then a debt will need to be raised for the outstanding balance.</p>

<p>If the advance is fully repaid, the advance information cannot be moved to the correct record.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Is a customer entitled to an advance payment if they have a temporarily written off overpayment?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; A temporarily written off overpayments is still a recoverable debt owing to the Commonwealth Government and therefore the customer is not entitled to an advance payment.</p>

<p>The exception to this is for FTB advances, if the debt has been temporarily written off due to an ex-partner non-lodger debt or bankruptcy debt, these debts will not affect their eligibility for an advance payment.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Is the customer entitled to an advance payment if they have a permanently written off overpayment?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; If the overpayment has been permanently written off, while the customer still owes the amount to the Commonwealth Government, it is no longer recoverable by means of deductions. This means the customer is eligible for an advance payment.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Should a Service Officer grant a customer an advance when they apply with an outstanding debt balance of less than 5 cents?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Yes. When a customer pays an outstanding balance of a debt but a rounding amount remains outstanding, any advance payment application will automatically reject. Service Officers are allowed in these instances to override the rejection using the advance payment workflow where the customer has an outstanding debt balance of less than 5 cents. This is so the customer is not disadvantaged by the administrative process which occurs as the remaining rounding amount will not clear until after the customer's next pay day.</p>

<p>Example&#58; Customer has a debt for $234.67, they attend a Post Office to pay the full amount in cash but due to rounding can only pay $234.65 (the customer cannot pay more than the amount due). The $0.02 (2 cents) outstanding will not clear until the customer's next payday. A Service Officer can manually override the application rejection and process the next advance if the customer meets all the other qualification criteria.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; If the customer has a Compensation Insurer debt that has not been repaid, can they receive an advance payment?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; This type of debt does not meet the qualification requirements and should not prevent the customer from receiving an advance. The debt is owed to the Commonwealth by the insurer, not the customer.</p>

<p>As the system is unable to identify this type of debt from other debts, the workflow will automatically reject the application. In these cases, the rejection should be overridden.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Can a customer repay an outstanding debt in cash to qualify for an advance payment?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; <img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> Yes, customers can make a debt repayment via their Centrelink online account using the <strong>Money You Owe</strong> service. Where the repayment is made via Centrelink online account using their debit or credit card, the repayment will be recognised immediately as 'paid' and the customer may apply for a new advance.</p>

<p>Customers may also use Australia Post BillPay, Direct Debit and BPAY® to repay their debt. The customer will not be able to apply for a new advance until payments made by these methods have been received by Services Australia.</p>

<p>Payments made via cash or card in person at Australia Post using Post Billpay will be recognised as 'paid' within 10 minutes. Other payment methods may take from 3 - 7 days to be received.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; How are repayments calculated?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; The system will generate a repayment amount spread over the next 13 fortnight period.</p>

<p>If the amount of repayment requested by the customer is equal to or greater than the system generated amount, this amount is accepted and updated on the customer's record when the advance payment is being granted.</p>

<p>If the amount of repayment requested by the customer is less than the system generated amount, the customer's advance payment will be rejected as the customer is unable to afford the repayment.</p>

<p>For customers who may have more than 1 advance payment in place at a time, each advance payment is recovered separately. If the customer is granted a second or third advance payment while still repaying an earlier one, the amount deducted from their fortnightly payment will increase.</p>

<p><strong>Can a customer make extra advance repayments outside of their regular fortnightly repayments?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; A customer may elect to repay an amount/s of an outstanding advance payment at any time. <img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> Customers can repay their advance amount using their debit or credit card via their Centrelink online account or with staff assistance over the phone.</p>

<p><img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> Customers will also be able to print from their online account an Australia Post Billpay barcode to make repayments at any Australia Post outlet. The barcode will also be available via the Express Plus Centrelink mobile app, but this will need to be saved to the mobile device. Each advance will have its own unique identifier number and a separate barcode will be required for each advance.</p>

<p>Where the repayment is made via Centrelink online account or the Express Plus Centrelink mobile app, the repayment will be recognised immediately as 'paid' and the customer may apply for a new advance as long as all other eligibility criteria is met.</p>

<p>For payments made at an Australia Post outlet, if the repayment is made by any payment method other than cheque, the repayment will immediately be recognised as 'paid'. If payment is made by cheque, it can take up to 7 working days for the payment to be finalised.</p>

<p>If the customer is repaying the outstanding amount/s in order to immediately qualify (pending all other criteria) for another advance payment, see <a href="../payment-delivery/103-05040050-01.html">Lump sum repayment of advance payment</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Customer has transferred to another payment. Why have their repayments ceased?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Where a customer transfers Social Security entitlement payments, for example from Carer Payment to Youth Allowance, a Manual Follow-up (MFU) will trigger the recovery of their outstanding advance payment after 3 weeks. The repayment rate cannot be modified prior to the review maturing.</p>

<p>If the person is no longer entitled to a Social Security entitlement payment and there is an outstanding advance balance, the balance becomes a debt to the Commonwealth.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Can a customer have their rate of repayment increased?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Yes. Customers may request their rate of repayment to be increased. This request will be approved only if the customer will not suffer severe financial hardship.</p>

<p>There is no restriction on the amount a staff member can increase the repayment amount to, as long as the customer has the capacity to meet the repayment amount without being placed in hardship.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; How much can a customer increase their rate of repayment to when using online services or Express Plus mobile app?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; The customer is limited to increasing their repayment amount to double the minimum repayment amount.</p>

<p>Example&#58; If minimum repayment amount is $38.50, the maximum repayment amount can be $77.00.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Can the customer have their rate of repayment decreased?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Decreasing the rate of repayment or stopping the repayment should only be considered if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer has special and unusual circumstances, and</li>
		<li>
they would suffer severe financial hardship if the repayment rate was not reduced</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> future applications for an FTB Advance Payment will reject if an outstanding advance of any type has a reduced recovery arrangement in place.</p>

<p>Repayments are <strong>not</strong> to be decreased on the same day as the advance is granted as the customer must have capacity to make repayments at the standard rate for the advance to be granted.</p>

<p><img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> Customers will be able to do this via the digital channels, over the phone, or at a service centre.</p>

<p>There is a known system limitation for advance payments of pensions that arises when an advance payment was granted on the customer's Entitlement Period End Date (EPED).</p>

<p>Where an advance payment was granted to a customer on their EPED, the final repayment will be deducted on the 13th EPED following the date of grant. This is also the date that is calculated as the 'next available date' for a further advance payment. However, the final repayment may not update on the customer's record until the following day. This means that although the required number of days since the previous advance payment has lapsed, and the advance payment has been fully repaid, the system will not recognise this until the following day.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Customers should be informed that any advice provided about their future eligibility for an advance payment is indicative only and that the only accurate assessment is on the day of application.</p>

<p><strong>To calculate the next available date manually</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Identify oldest advance granted within the last 26 weeks/13 fortnights that has not yet been repaid</li>
		<li>
Find the customer's Entitlement Period End Day (EPED) code on the Entitlement Delivery (<strong>RAD</strong>) page</li>
		<li>
Using the Centrelink Calendar (OS035) count forward 13 EPEDS from the entitlement period that the advance was granted in (inclusive) and add one day. Example&#58; customer is granted an advance on 10 February 2022 (EPEDC '5'), however their standard entitlement period EPED is EPED code (EPEDC) 'B' on 15 February 2022. 13 x EPED code 'B' = 2 August 2022 = 1 day = 3 August 2022. Customer would be eligible for the next advance on 26 July 2022</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the outstanding advance was granted on the Entitlement Period End Date (EPED) for the customer, the next advance will not be available until 13 EPEDs plus 14 days from when the advance was granted. This is because the recovery is not commenced within the fortnight the advance is paid. Example&#58; Customer applies for an advance on 19 January 2022. This is EPEDC 'C'.  It is also the customer's Entitlement Period End date (EPED). As no recovery of the advance can be made in this fortnight, the customer will not be eligible for their next advance until 3 August 2022 (13 EPEDs + 14 days).</p>

<p><strong>Customer declares excess income that does not correlate with their prior history</strong></p>

<p>Dino is on Disability Support Pension (DSP) and contacts Smart Centre Call to request an advance payment of $1000.00. Dino is on weekly payments due to a history of requesting urgent payments for food, medication or accommodation.</p>

<p>Dino's weekly net rate of payment is $493.80pw ($987.60pf) as there are no deductions. Dino advises that at the end of each fortnight there is $380.00 left. Repayments will be $77.00 per fortnight.</p>

<p>The Service Officer should ask Dino&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
how much money is spent on accommodation</li>
		<li>
how much money is spent on food</li>
		<li>
how much money is spent on medication</li>
		<li>
any other expenses</li>
		</ul>
<p>As Dino has a history of needing urgent payments, it is unlikely the amount stated would available at the end of each fortnight. Dino considers the declared amount would qualify for an advance payment. However, by granting Dino an advance of $1000.00, it may cause further financial hardship.</p>

<p><strong>Partnered maximum rate pensioner not qualified due to previous and outstanding advance payments</strong></p>

<p>Customer received an advance payment of $350.00 8 months ago and is repaying $26.92 per fortnight.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Customer also received an advance payment of $380.00 2 months (4 fortnights) ago and is repaying $29.23 per fortnight</li>
		<li>
The total repayment is $56.15 per fortnight</li>
		<li>
3/52 of APQA is $1056.45</li>
		<li>
1/52 of APQA is $352.15</li>
		<li>
Because of the earlier advance payments the maximum amount is reduced by the combined total of both advance payments ($350 + $380 = $730)</li>
		<li>
The maximum amount is reduced to $326.45 which is less than the minimum available</li>
		<li>
The application is rejected because the minimum amount is not available to be advanced. Rejection code is LMA (less than minimum)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the customer was to repay the outstanding balance of the earliest advance (as this was granted more than 6 months ago), the amount available would be $676.45 and could be paid if the customer is qualified and can afford the repayments for the existing and new advance payments. Alternatively, the customer's partner may qualify for an advance payment.</p>

<p><strong>Single customer where there has been an increase to the consumer price index (CPI) since receiving last advance</strong></p>

<p>Changes to the CPI can impact on a customer's entitlement to the advance payment due to the increasing minimum and maximum rates. For a single customer receiving the maximum rate of pension, the advance entitlement would be calculated as follows&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Minimum rate for the period September 2021 to March 2022 $457.55</li>
		<li>
Maximum rate for the period September 2021 to March 2022 $1372.65</li>
		</ul>
<p>and</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Minimum rate for the period March 2022 to September 2022 $467.20</li>
		<li>
Maximum rate for the period March 2022 to September 2022 $1401.60</li>
		</ul>
<p>On 10 November 2021, a customer takes an advance at the minimum rate of $425.00.</p>

<p>On 8 April 2022 (after the March 2022 CPI increase) the customer applies for and is granted the remaining allowable amount of $976.60.</p>

<p>On 12 May 2022 the customer wishes to test their eligibility for an advance payment. The minimum amount is now $467.20.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>On 12 May 2022, as 13 fortnights have elapsed since 10 November 2021, the earlier of the customer's 2 advances has now been repaid and has no effect on the calculation.</p>

<p>However, the advance for $976.60 is still relevant to the calculation and is deducted from the new maximum rate of $1401.60.</p>

<p>This leaves $425.00 allowed. But as this is less than the new minimum since the March CPI of $467.20, the customer is ineligible for an advance and will need to wait until 13 fortnights have elapsed from the 8 April advance before again being able to test their eligibility for another advance payment.</p>
