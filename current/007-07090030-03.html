<p>Ensure the new estimate is updated using the claim lodgement date as the date of event (DOV).</p>

<p>The customer's entitlement for the <strong>CAN-INC</strong> non-payment period can only be assessed after the end of the financial year when reconciliation occurs. The customer's FTB reconciliation letter will advise them&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they have not been assessed for the full financial year, and</li>
		<li>
to lodge a lump sum claim so their entitlement for that period can be checked. See <a href="../families/007-11010100-01.html">Assessment of income cancellation periods in Family Tax Benefit (FTB) reconciliation</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>If the system is attempting to pay FTB arrears for the <strong>CAN-INC</strong> non-payment periods when being restored based on a previous Child Care Subsidy (CCS) estimate that is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>lower</strong> than the most recent estimate provided code the <strong>FYSO</strong> for the <strong>CAN-INC </strong>non-payment period, using Status code <strong>CAN</strong> and Reason code <strong>OTH</strong>. This will stop incorrect FTB arrears from paying for this period. The arrears will be assessed in reconciliation when actual income is confirmed, and the customer has lodged a lump sum claim or requested a reassessment within the relevant time frame</li>
		<li>
<strong>equal to or higher</strong> than the most recent estimate provided, pay the FTB arrears provided they are correct. For help in determining why arrears are paying. See <a href="../families/007-07060060-01.html">What to check when Family Tax Benefit (FTB) rate has changed</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>The period from date of cancellation to 30 June of the previous financial year will be assessed as a lump sum claim period once income details for reconciliation have been received.</p>

<p>If income details are available (for example, reconciliation has completed or can complete in the current activity), payment will be made for this period immediately, if eligible.</p>

<p>If adequate income is not available (for example, reconciliation is pending), the lump sum claim will appear as ASS/AIU and payment will be made, if eligible, once reconciliation occurs.</p>

<p>Run the <strong>Fast Note</strong> - <strong>Auto Text</strong> &gt; <strong>Families</strong> &gt; <strong>SUS/CAN/RES</strong> &gt; <strong>FTB Restore</strong> to ensure the correct Act reference is recorded. Include in the restoration <strong>DOC</strong>&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
DOV = date of receipt (DOR) of new revised estimate</li>
