<p>The customer should list all dependent children in their care during the relevant financial year. There is room on the claim form to list 4 children. A separate sheet should be attached to give details for other children. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> this also includes children aged 16-18 who are in full-time secondary schooling.</p>

<p><strong>Child residence requirements</strong></p>

<p>Any <a href="../families/007-02080000-01.html">overseas absences</a> must be recorded.</p>

<p><strong>Change of care</strong></p>

<p>Details of the previous carer of the child, date the child entered the customer's care, and the period the child lived with the customer in the relevant financial year are needed. If the customer has legal or other documents to support the change of care, these should be provided. If they do not have supporting documents, they should list the names of the child's natural (or adoptive) parents.</p>

<p><strong>Child income details</strong></p>

<p>A child income limit applied to some children until 30 April 2014.</p>

<p>If the child receives a payment in their own right, they may not be an <a href="../families/007-07040050-01.html">FTB child</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Family circumstances</strong> (<a href="../families/007-02040010-01.html">care arrangements</a>)</p>

<p>If the child has spent time in the care of another person, the customer needs to advise the name and address of that person, provide a parenting plan or court order or state the percentage of time in the customer's care during the financial year, and list any short periods the child left the customer's care.</p>

<p><strong>Children from a previous relationship</strong></p>

<p>For each child in care during the financial year, the customer needs to indicate if the child is from a previous relationship and, if yes, whether they (or their partner) took action to obtain child support. If no action was taken, they need to state the reason.</p>

<p>From 2011-2012 onwards, lump sum claims will be assessed using information from Child Support. Customers can no longer self-assess their child support.</p>

<p>If the customer has taken action to obtain child support during the financial year, the details of this will be obtained directly from Child Support.</p>

<p>If the customer has indicated that they did not take any action to obtain child support for their child/ren, assess the reason. If the customer has indicated a reason, for example other parent overseas, family and domestic violence or parentage unknown, an exemption should be explored, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-51070090-01.html">Exemptions from seeking child support for Family Tax Benefit (FTB) customers</a>.</p>

<p>Has the customer (or their partner on 30 June 2023) lodged a tax return for the 2022-2023 financial year <strong>and</strong> received their Notice of Assessment (NOA)?</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>, they should state the taxable income amount as advised on the NOA.<br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the customer accessed superannuation funds under the First Home Super Saver (FHSS) Scheme these withdrawals will contain some portion that the ATO will determine as taxable income and include within the customer’s taxable income value on their NOA. However, for Services Australia purposes, FHSS Scheme withdrawals are not counted towards taxable income. If referring to a customer’s NOA who has accessed superannuation under this scheme, you will need to exclude any taxable income attributed to the FHSS Scheme. Advice from the individual on the value to be excluded should be obtained. This is expected to be information the individual has access to from their FHSS Scheme submission and approval paperwork. This consideration is only applicable to NOA’s.</li>
		<li>
<strong>No</strong>, they need to estimate the amount of taxable income (see <a href="../families/007-07080010-01.html">Taxable income for family assistance and Paid Parental Leave Scheme payments</a>) they will receive for the financial year from the following sources (if they did not receive any income they should write '$<strong>0</strong>' in the box)&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
salary and wages</li>
			<li>
lump sum payments</li>
			<li>
business or self-employment</li>
			<li>
investments</li>
			<li>
real estate</li>
			<li>
government pensions and benefits</li>
			<li>
other taxable income</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Other adjusted taxable income (ATI) components</strong></p>

<p>All customers need to estimate the amount they (and their partner on 30 June) received for the financial year from each ATI component.</p>

<p>See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-05030010-01.html">Helping families provide a reasonable annual income estimate for family assistance payments</a>.</p>

<p>If the customer (or their partner on 30 June) is required to lodge a tax return for the relevant financial year, the customer's annual FTB entitlement will be calculated once all required actual income details are transferred electronically from the ATO.</p>

<p>If the customer (or their partner) is <strong>required to lodge</strong> a tax return, it <strong>must</strong> be lodged with the ATO by the end of the lodgement year.</p>

<p>Time limits apply to the lodgement of tax returns for assessing FTB entitlement. If a customer or their partner is required to lodge tax returns with the ATO and fail to do so by the end of the lodgement year, the FTB lump sum claim will be rejected.</p>

<p>If the customer (or their partner) is <strong>not required to lodge</strong> a tax return, a ‘not required to lodge’ advice <strong>must</strong> be provided to and accepted by the agency before the end of the lodgement year, that is within 12 months of the end of the relevant financial year.</p>

<p>For members of a couple, if the customer or their partner has returned to work in 2022-2023 for the first time after having a baby or after a period out of the workforce to care for a child, FTB Part B may be paid free of the income test for a period before their return to work.</p>
