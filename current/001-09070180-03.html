<p>The Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) or Job Capacity Assessment (JCA) assesses work capacity according to one of the following bandwidth hours. Mutual obligation requirements are determined based on this&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
0-7 hours per week</li>
		<li>
8-14 hours per week</li>
		<li>
15-22 hours per week</li>
		<li>
23-29 hours per week</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> requirements for a customer with a PCW must take into account the customer's baseline and 'with intervention' work capacity.</p>

<p>For example, a customer has a PCW of 15-22 hours per week if their ESAt shows that they have a baseline work capacity of 8-14 hours per week but work capacity (with intervention) of 15-22 hours per week. This shows that, with intervention (such as participation in DES) in the next 2 years, they will have a work capacity of between 15 and 22 hours per week. The Employment Service Provider will&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
work with the customer to attain their work capacity (with intervention)</li>
		<li>
update their Job Plan to include appropriate activities for their work capacity with intervention</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Partial capacity to work (PCW) and temporary reduced work capacity (TRWC) of 0-7 or 8-14 hours per week</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
A customer has a <strong>PCW</strong> of 0-14 hours per week if both the baseline and work capacity with intervention (as assessed in an ESAt) are less than 15 hours per week</li>
		<li>
A customer has a <strong>TRWC</strong> of 0-14 hours per week if they have been assessed by an Assessor as being temporarily unable to work because of a medical condition</li>
		<li>
Customers with a <strong>PCW or a TRWC</strong> of 0-7 or 8-14 hours per week of 12 weeks or more in duration, must attend compulsory quarterly participation interviews with Services Australia to fully meet their requirements, unless they are undertaking paid work or self-employment within their bandwidth</li>
		<li>
Customers with an assessed <strong>TRWC</strong> of 0-7 or 8-14 hours per week of less than 12 weeks in duration will <strong>not</strong> have a quarterly interview requirement. Instead, these customers will fully meet their requirements by&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
reporting employment income and participation details, and</li>
			<li>
attending appointments with the agency, if requested</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Customers with a <a href="../job-seekers/001-09070190-01.html">PCW or TRWC of either 0-7 or 8-14 hours per week</a> are still required to meet mutual obligation requirements, except they&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
are not required to look for work, but</li>
			<li>
can volunteer to connect with the Employment Services Provider identified as suitable in their ESAt or JCA report. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> customers with a TRWC of 0-7 hours per week cannot voluntarily participate in Disability Employment Services (DES) during their period of reduced capacity, but can be referred to jobactive</li>		</ul>
		<li>
While these customers are always encouraged to participate in employment services, they cannot be penalised if they choose not to do so</li>
		<li>
Customers who have a DSP claim rejected due to not meeting Program of Support (POS) requirements should be encouraged to commence with the provider recommended in their JCA report</li>
		</ul>
<p>For Job Plan and Activity and Exemption Summary (<strong>AEX</strong>) screen coding for PCW or TRWC 0-7 or 8-14 hours per week customers, see <a href="../job-seekers/001-09070190-01.html">Quarterly Participation Interviews for Partial Capacity to Work and Temporary Reduced Work Capacity (0-7 or 8-14 hours per week) job seekers</a>.</p>

<p>Customers with a work capacity of 0-7 or 8-14 hours per week may be medically qualified for Disability Support Pension (DSP). However they may not qualify for DSP for other reasons (for example, residency or not meeting POS) or they may choose to claim JobSeeker Payment (JSP) or Youth Allowance (YA) (job seeker) instead of DSP.</p>

<p><strong>Partial capacity to work (PCW) and temporary reduced work capacity (TRWC) of 15-22 hours per week</strong></p>

<p>Customers with a PCW or TRWC of 15-22 hours per week&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
must look for work or undertake another activity</li>
		<li>
must be connected with an Employment Services Provider</li>
		<li>
may be required to accept an offer of paid work, provided the work is not unsuitable, to satisfy their mutual obligation requirements</li>
		<li>
can fully meet their mutual obligation requirements by undertaking suitable paid work of at least 15 hours per week</li>		</ul>

<p><strong>Work</strong></p>

<p>Customers with a PCW of 15 hours per week or more satisfy mutual obligation requirements if they undertake sufficient work of at least 15 hours per week, where remuneration meets or exceeds the national minimum wage.</p>

<p>If they are working more than 15 hours per week, they can leave this job to commence work of 15 hours per week without penalty, providing the job is suitable.</p>

<p>Customers with a PCW or TRWC of less than 15 hours per week can fully satisfy requirements through paid work (either part-time work or self-employment) within their assessed bandwidth. They do not need to be working to their capacity. In these cases, quarterly interviews are not required.</p>

<p><strong>Study</strong></p>

<p>Customers who are required to transfer to JobSeeker Payment (JSP), Youth Allowance (YA) or Parenting Payment (PP) who have a PCW at the Disability Support Pension (DSP) transition review contact and are studying and receiving Pensioner Education Supplement (PES), can continue their studies (full-time or part-time) in the same course and be qualified for JSP/YA and PES. This can include courses of more than 12 months duration.</p>

<p>After an ESAt has been accepted for a Services Australia managed customer, a Service Officer conducts a face-to-face interview as soon as possible to update the customer's Job Plan with their current activity.</p>

<p>Where a Partial Capacity to Work (PCW) or Temporary Reduced Work Capacity (TRWC) has been assessed, the ESAt Assessor will also&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
indicate the type of intervention the job seeker requires to increase their work capacity, and</li>
		<li>
refer the job seeker to appropriate services, where possible</li>
		</ul>
<p>Information about appropriate interventions is contained in the <a href="../job-seekers/001-02320000-01.html">Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) report</a>, parts of which are also available to the customer's Employment Services Provider.</p>

<p>Where possible, the referral recommendations made by the Job Capacity Assessment Provider (JCAP) will become the primary activity for these job seekers. </p>

<p>However, there are specific rules concerning what types of activities can be included in a Job Plan. For example, customers assessed with either a PCW or TRWC of 0-14 hours per week&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
do not need to be connected to an Employment Services Provider, but</li>
		<li>
may volunteer to be connected</li>
		</ul>
<p>Regardless of whether they are connected to a provider, they will remain a Services Australia managed job seeker for the purposes of negotiating their Job Plan.</p>

<p>A Job Plan must include at least one compulsory activity suited to their circumstances.</p>

<p>An ESAt is required to determine a partial capacity to work or temporary reduced work capacity.</p>

<p>When the customer's ESAt report is accepted by the agency, the assessed work capacity is automatically recorded on the <strong>WC</strong> screen.</p>

<p>A corresponding Medical Conditions Details (<strong>MC</strong>) screen is also created. The <strong>Event Date&#58;</strong> field on the <strong>MC</strong> screen is taken from the <strong>JCA Acceptance Date&#58;</strong> field on the <strong>WC</strong> screen. This is the start date of customer's current PCW or TRWC status.</p>

<p>In some limited circumstances, the customer's PCW or TRWC status may need to be backdated before the ESAt or JCA Acceptance Date. This is normally only where the PCW or TRWC status affects the customer's assessment or rate of income support payment, including for payment of <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03070030-01.html">Youth Disability Supplement (YDS)</a> and <a href="../job-seekers/001-04030050-01.html">assessment of independence for Youth Allowance job seekers</a>. The dates of effect are as follows&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>new claims</strong> - the PCW or TRWC status start date should be the new claim start date (if the customer's disability/illness/incapacity was identified and the ESAt or JCA referral was required as part of the new claim processing), or</li>
		<li>
<strong>payment current</strong> - the PCW or TRWC status start date should be the ESAt or JCA referral date (which is the date the disability, illness or injury was identified)</li>
		</ul>
<p>To backdate the start date, go to the corresponding <strong>MC</strong> screen and manually change the <strong>Event Date&#58;</strong> field to the appropriate date. This then changes the start date on the <strong>CTCH</strong>/<strong>CTCS</strong> screens.</p>

<p>Customers with mutual obligation requirements may fit into more than one of the following categories&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
JobSeeker Payment (JSP) mature age 55+ customers</li>
		<li>
PCW</li>
		<li>
TRWC</li>
		<li>
principal carers</li>
		</ul>
<p>The mutual obligation requirement or exemption which is the most beneficial to the customer is automatically applied by the system. For example, a 57 year old JSP customer with full time care of a 14 year old child. As the customer fits into both the 'Mature Age 55+' and 'Principal Carer 15+' participation categories, the Services Australia system will place the customer in the 'Principal Carer 15+' participation category.</p>
