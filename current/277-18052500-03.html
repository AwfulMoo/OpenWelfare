<p>The term ‘special circumstances’ refers to circumstances that are out of the ordinary and not something that could be considered to be common place. Examine the circumstances which led to the change in care including whether the behaviour and/or actions of the parent who has less care was a cause for the change in care. These circumstances should be a significant cause for the change in care. They may include unusual or unreasonable actions and behaviour of the parent with reduced care, however they can also arise due to factors beyond the parent's direct control.</p>

<p>In determining whether a person’s behaviour or actions have been unusual or unreasonable, consider the impact of the person’s behaviour or actions on the child or the person with increased care, and if the child or the person with increased care was placed in a situation where there was substantial risk to their physical, emotional or physiological well-being.</p>

<p>See the<a target="_blank" class="extwebsitelink" href="https&#58;//www.legislation.gov.au/series/c2004a03872"> Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989</a> when making the decision about interim care decisions and special circumstances under the following sections&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>

		</ul>
<p>This list is not exhaustive. Special circumstances will vary with each case. Situations that may occur in the ordinary course of events will not be considered to be special. For example, changing preferences of the parents or child in relation to care will not constitute special circumstances. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-18052500-05.html#bp05020002_1">Resources page, Example 1</a> for more information</p>

<p>The actual care differs from the care arrangement and the person with reduced care is taking reasonable action to adhere to the existing care arrangement. S51 also applies to actual care in special circumstances, see <a target="_blank" href="https&#58;//guides.dss.gov.au/child-support-guide/2/2/4">the Child Support Guide 2.2.4&#58; Disputed Care Arrangements</a>  where a parent is withholding care due to a substantial risk to the wellbeing of the child.

substantially failing to comply with legal schooling requirements</li>

<p>The actual care differs from the care arrangement and the person with reduced care is taking reasonable action to seek a new care arrangement which is more than actual care but less than the existing care arrangement, and there are special circumstances. In this context, special circumstances refer to situations where the parent could not continue to have the previous level of care. Examples include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
serious medical problems relating to the child or parents</li>
		<li>
one parent has moved a substantial distance away from their previous home without making care arrangements with the other parent for the child</li>		</ul>

<p>The interim period can be extended from 14 weeks up to a maximum of 26 weeks where special circumstances apply.

<p>For care periods commencing on or after 1 July 2012 (22 November 2012 for WA ex-nuptial cases), a decision can be made to apply actual care immediately where special circumstances make an interim determination inappropriate, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-03180000-01.html">WA child support ex-nuptial cases</a>.

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> different disputed care rules apply if the care period commenced before 1 July 2012 (22 November 2012 for WA ex-nuptial cases).</p>

<p>Eligible cases must be referred to an ACSC Officer for managing and making care determinations to apply actual care in special circumstances.</p>

<p>To be eligible for referral to an ACSC Officer, the case must meet each of the following criteria&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the current care assessment is based on a care arrangement</li>
		<li>
the customer who has less care than provided for in the care arrangement has demonstrated reasonable action to regain care in line with the care agreement</li>
		<li>
in situations of ‘left without consent’, the person legally responsible for the child has satisfied the agency they have taken reasonable action to regain the child</li>
		<li>
there is evidence that an interim determination would not be appropriate due to <a href="../separated-parents/277-18052500-03.html#bp03_tbl_Determine_if_th_Step04">special circumstances</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>Actual care in special circumstances cannot be considered where a customer is taking reasonable action to seek a new care arrangement and special circumstances apply. In this circumstance, make a determination for an interim period of&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
less than 14 weeks if special circumstances did not exist at the time the initial care determination was made but occurred during the interim period</li>
		<li>
up to 26 weeks if special circumstances apply</li>

<p>During the discussions explain to both customers what a change in care is. Advise them the change in care decision is a Services Australia decision about the amount of care to be used in the customer’s child support assessment. The agency does not determine where the child should live or any custody arrangements. The agency reflects the percentage of care of the child that each parent actually has, or the percentage of care established by a written care arrangement.</p>

<p>The circumstances around care changes can be distressing, especially where the care is disputed or not occurring in line with a written care arrangement. Be considerate and sensitive to the customer’s experience when discussing and explaining care changes.</p>

<p>If the customer advises of a change in care during the interim period, the new percentage may not take effect until the interim period has ended.</p>

<p>Where the care changes during an interim period and a new care arrangement is not entered into, a customer may notify of the care change after the interim period has ended. This care change must only be applied from the day after the interim period ends unless the parent has also ceased to take reasonable action to enforce the existing arrangement. In this case the care percentages will be based on the new actual care from the date the parent ceased taking reasonable action.</p>

<p>The interim period will cease if a parent stops taking reasonable action, even if there has been another change in care. If the customers make a new care arrangement, and actual care is in line with that arrangement, make a new decision based on actual care.</p>

<p>If a terminating event occurs for the case or the child within the interim period, adjust the interim period to end on the date of the terminating event, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-03140000-01.html">Terminating events (Stage 2) (CS)</a>. For FTB purposes, see <a target="_blank" href="https&#58;//guides.dss.gov.au/family-assistance-guide/2/1/1/70">Family Assistance Guide 2.1.1.70&#58; Disputed Care Arrangements</a> on how to treat payments in the event an interim period ends earlier.</p>

<p>If the case or assessment restarts for a child, the interim period does not apply and a new care determination must be made from the date of the restart. If care ceased to be in accordance with the care arrangement 14 weeks or more before notification of the change, an interim period will not apply. Actual care will be used to determine the percentage of care from the date of notification. Only in special circumstances can this 14 week limit on the notification period be extended up to a maximum of 26 weeks.</p>

<p>If the interim care period is extended to between 14 and 26 weeks and the agency determines the care percentage based on the care arrangement for an interim period, the interim period care percentage will be used in the child support assessment from the date of notification to the end of the interim period, or the date of event if within the previous 28 days. The care percentage used in the period before the start of the interim period will continue to apply until the interim care percentage takes effect.</p>

<p>Review evidence and information that support relevant findings of fact. Allegations of abuse, family and domestic violence or similar that are not supported by independent evidence are unlikely to result in a decision to apply actual care instead of an interim determination. A child welfare order is not a requirement for this decision to be made.</p>

<p>Evidence from an independent third party that may indicate special circumstances exist include (but is not limited to)&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a police report detailing violent behaviour to a child or the person with increased care</li>
		<li>
an intervention order preventing contact with the child or the person with increased care</li>
		<li>
statement from a medical (or other relevant) professional regarding assault or abuse of the child or the person with increased care</li>
		</ul>
<p>Do not accept evidence directly from children. Where a parent provides written evidence from the child, do not consider the information and advise the parent/customer we will not be considering this for evidence purposes.</p>

<p>Make the recommendation for referral on the basis of evidence that supports relevant findings of fact. Consider information that substantiates claims and demonstrates that care has increased or reduced for a particular customer, as well as independent third party evidence.</p>
