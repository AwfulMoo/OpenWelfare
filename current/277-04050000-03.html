<p>A partnership is the relationship that exists between two or more people who are carrying on a business in common with a view to profit.</p>

<p>In this situation, two or more people ‘together’ are the business. A partnership is not a legal entity.</p>

<p>Essentially, all partners are jointly in direct control of the business and the money the business makes belongs to all partners jointly, although this can be modified through the use of a partnership agreement.</p>

<p>The rights and interests of members of a partnership are defined in a partnership agreement between the persons in the partnership, but there is no requirement for a written agreement. Partnership agreements can be written, oral, or inferred from the conduct of the parties. Partners can be individuals or artificial legal entities, such as companies.</p>

<p>Companies are a separate legal entity where the directors of the company manage and administer the assets of the company on behalf of the company’s owners who are called shareholders.</p>

<p>To become a company, an entity must be incorporated under the Corporations Act 2001 and be registered with Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC).</p>

<p>It is not uncommon for a company to be formed by an individual who takes on the roles of director and secretary and who is the sole shareholder of the company.</p>

<p>A company may be private or publicly listed&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
public companies are publicly listed and this enables the company to raise funds by selling shares to the general public, for example Telstra</li>
		<li>
private companies are not publicly listed and funding is raised by private means (usually by taking out loans) or borrowing from individuals associated with the company. For example, a director provides $30,000 of his own money to buy initial plant and equipment and this may be repaid by the company to the individual and is not considered salary and wages</li>
		<li>
a public company is a company of not less than five members, with no restriction on the right to transfer shares and with the capacity to invite the public to subscribe for shares or debentures</li>
		<li>
a private company is owned by between 1 and 50 non-employee shareholders and where shares are available only under strict conditions set out in the Memorandum of Association. Ownership is by way of a shareholding which gives certain entitlements and responsibilities which are set out in the Memorandum of Association. Private companies can be identified by the letters Pty Ltd or the words Propriety Limited after the company name</li>		</ul>

<p><strong>What is a share?</strong></p>

<p>Issued shares are legal instruments which demonstrate and detail the extent of ownership of a company. Many Australians, including customers, own shares in public and private companies.</p>

<p><strong>Shareholder information</strong></p>

<p>Many Australian public companies use share registries to manage their share portfolio. For more information see the Process page in <a href="../separated-parents/277-04390000-03.html">Bank and organisation listing (CS)</a>. The information below could be used to make a decision to garnishee dividend payments.</p>

<p><strong>What is a dividend?</strong></p>

<p>A dividend is a share of the company’s profits. Dividends can be paid in different ways, for example, money, property, or shares. The amount of a dividend can vary and a low dividend may not necessarily mean a low number of shares held.</p>

<p>Not all companies pay a dividend for a range of reasons including&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the company did not make a profit</li>
		<li>
the customer may own a particular type of share which affects their entitlement to a dividend</li>
		<li>
part of the company’s constitution may direct that the profits be distributed back into the company</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Investigation tips</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
investors are given a reference number often referred to as a Holder Identification Number (HIN) or Share Registry Number (SRN)</li>
		<li>
the HRN/SRN is an account number similar to bank and superannuation account numbers</li>
		<li>
the HRN/SRN is used as the primary identifier by share registries to identify and confirm a customer’s assets</li>
		<li>
the Annual Investment Income Report (AIIR) identifies customers who received a dividend payment in the previous financial year</li>
		<li>
the data from the AIIR is uploaded into the External Information window in Cuba</li>
		<li>
the HIN/SRN number can be sourced from the AIIR in the External Information window in Cuba</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Collection tips</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
when issuing a section 120 notice to a share registry include the HIN/SRN</li>
		<li>
if a section 120 share registry response confirms a payer has assets, issue a section 72A notice and include the HIN/SRN on the notice</li>
		</ul>

<p>A trust is basically a structure which owns and holds assets, such as investments, that are controlled and managed by a person or a company (trustee) for the benefit of other persons (beneficiaries). The trustee has the legal control over the assets of the trust, which means that they can buy and sell assets, however is not entitled to the income generated from the trust. The beneficiaries are those entitled to the assets and profits of the trust.</p>

<p>The trustee may be a natural person or a company, and the beneficiaries may be natural persons and/or other trusts or companies.</p>

<p><strong>Discretionary/Family Trust</strong></p>

<p>The primary feature of this trust is that the trustee has discretion to determine which beneficiaries receive income/assets, and when and how. Therefore, there is no fixed entitlement for each and every beneficiary. </p>

<p>Generally, the immediate family members of the trustee are the beneficiaries of a discretionary trust. The trustee will ordinarily consider which of the beneficiaries will receive the most benefit from the income, and is usually undertaken with a view to minimising the tax implication of the family members.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed Trust</strong></p>

<p>The trustee must distribute assets / income to the beneficiaries strictly in accordance with the terms of the trust deed. The trustee has no discretion to alter the distribution of the assets and or income.</p>

<p><strong>Unit Trust</strong></p>

<p>Beneficiaries hold units in a trust. All units have a pre-determined value, so those beneficiaries who hold more units are entitled to a greater share of the assets and income.</p>

<p>The Statement of Financial Position was previously known as the Balance Sheet. It is a record of the financial standing of a business and it lists the assets, liabilities and proprietorship of a business at a particular date (often the end of the financial year). <strong>It reflects a business’ financial health</strong>.</p>

<p>A Statement of Financial Position enables one to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
quickly see the financial strengths and capabilities of the business</li>
		<li>
review the level of assets, debt and working capital of the business</li>
		<li>
compare the increase or decrease in value of the business over time</li>
		<li>
see the relative liquidity of the business, and</li>
		<li>
analyse the business’ ability to pay all short-term and long-term debts as they come due</li>
		</ul>
<p>A Statement of Financial Position has 3 key sections&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Assets</li>
		<li>
Liabilities, and</li>
		<li>
Owner’s Equity</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Assets</strong></p>

<p>Assets are sub-divided into&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
current (short-term) assets; current assets are business resources that can be easily turned into cash and are readily available to pay the liabilities of the business. For example, cash at bank, inventory or stock and accounts receivable</li>
		<li>
non-current (long-term) assets; non-current assets are business resources that are not so easy to convert into cash. For example, machinery, motor vehicles, land and buildings</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Liabilities</strong></p>

<p>Liabilities are also sub-divided into current and non-current&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
current liabilities are business debts that are due and payable in the short term. For example, accounts payable, accrued liabilities</li>
		<li>
non-current liabilities are business debts that are not expected to be paid in full in the short term. For example, mortgages, unsecured loans from business owner’s shareholders, partner's advances or loans</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Owner's Equity</strong></p>

<p>The Statement of Financial Position is a major source of information to determine the owners’ assets within the business. It is the amount the owners of the business would receive if they sold all the business assets and repaid all the business liabilities.</p>

<p>Retained earnings, dividends paid, distributions, and owners’ drawings are recorded in this statement. The information may be useful in developing any challenges to a customer’s actual financial position.</p>

<p>You may see ‘Personal services attributed income’ on a customer’s personal tax return.</p>

<p>Personal services income is income which is mainly a reward for a person’s efforts or skills, but paid to a personal services entity (a company, partnership or trust).</p>

<p>This type of income is included in the customer’s personal assessable income for tax purposes, and may be included in their salary and wage payments from the business. In these cases, when calculating the business income available for a customer to make child support payments, do not double count this type of income.</p>
