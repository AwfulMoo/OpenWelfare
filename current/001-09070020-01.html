		<div class="block">

<p>Job seekers in receipt of JSP are expected to focus on job search. JSP is not payable to full-time students, unless they are doing a short course approved by Services Australia or an employment services provider and included in their Job Plan.</p>

<p>Most of the time  a person who is studying full-time should test their eligibility for a student payment. However, some short courses (less than 12 months) may be appropriate where the job seeker is unlikely to find work with their existing skills, and the course will enhance their immediate employability. Participation in these courses is subject to short course approval policy.</p>

<p>Full-time study will preclude a job seeker from qualifying for JSP <strong>only</strong> where&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they have been advised (either at grant or at a later time) by their provider that their full-time study will not meet their mutual obligation requirements, <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
the job seeker is <strong>not</strong> willing to undertake other approved activities, such as job search, to meet their mutual obligation requirements</li>
		</ul>
<p>Otherwise, it is up to the provider to negotiate appropriate activities for the job seeker, including whether the study is included in the Job Plan or not, and to instigate compliance action as necessary for failure to meet compulsory requirements.</p>

<p>If a JSP job seeker is already connected with a provider, or has claimed JSP and is referred to a provider through normal processes, they should be advised to discuss approval for any full-time study with their provider.</p>

<p>Provider managed job seekers will continue to be required to undertake job search and/or other approved activities, in conjunction with their study, even where the study is full-time.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>In limited circumstances, when a job seeker is Centrelink managed, Services Australia can approve full-time short courses as fully meeting requirements. See <a href="../job-seekers/001-09070020-01.html#bp01_L2GT_Services_Austra">Services Australia full time short course approvals</a> below.</p>

<p>In accordance with the Department of Education, Skills and Employment short course guidelines, Services Australia staff should not approve and code a short course for a job seeker who is provider managed. The job seeker is referred to their provider to discuss their participation and approval in a short course. This is important because it may impact on the level of servicing the provider can offer. If the provider approves the short course, the course details will be coded in the Department of Education, Skills and Employment system and the job seeker's Job Plan updated.</p>

<p>If a job seeker is enrolled in a course of study that makes them eligible for a student payment, this should be discussed with the job seeker and where necessary a transfer to a more appropriate income support payment completed.</p>

<p>If a job seeker is undertaking a course of full-time study which cannot be approved under short course policy, and cannot be included in their Job Plan, they will not remain qualified for JSP. To remain on JSP, they must reduce or reorganise their hours of study so that the course is considered part-time, and they can still undertake job search or other activities to meet their mutual obligation requirements. The job seeker's provider would need to include the study in their Job Plan and consider whether other requirements could be reduced as a result.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Employment Services Providers have the primary role in the approval of full-time short courses for JSP job seekers, regardless of the current Stream of the job seeker.</p>

<p>The same short course policy applies to all JSP job seekers, including those with 'part-time' mutual obligation requirements, such as principal carers and job seekers assessed as having a partial capacity to work.</p>

<p>The provider can approve a full-time short course for JSP job seekers at any time after they have begun service with the provider and if <strong>all</strong> the following conditions apply&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the full-time course is less than 12 months in duration</li>

the course is full-time (or at least 15 hours per week for principal carers or partial capacity to work 15-22 hours per week)</li>

		<li>
the provider has identified that the job seeker is unlikely to find work with their existing skills</li>
		<li>
the course is likely to provide a job seeker with a qualification and/or greater employability</li>

		<div class="block">

<p>If a full-time short course activity is approved, the job seeker will be deemed to be meeting their mutual obligation requirements for the duration of the activity.</p>

<p>When a provider approves the short course and includes it as a compulsory activity in the Job Plan, job seekers are still required to look for and accept work, but not where it conflicts with the time of the course or if it would prevent them from completing the course. Job seekers are required to accept any suitable work that does not conflict with the course and they are not permitted to limit their job searches only to areas relating to the course.</p>

<p>Job seekers with full-time mutual obligation requirements who are undertaking full-time short courses are required to remain connected with their provider. These job seekers are also required to attend an appointment with their provider or Services Australia if notified of a requirement to do so. Appointments should be scheduled for times that do not conflict with the job seeker's study timetable.</p>

<p>Job seekers (excluding those with Disability Employment Services (DES) and ParentsNext), may have their job search requirements halved by their provider if they are&#58;</p>

connected to a jobactive provider, and</li>
		<li>
undertaking 40 or more contact hours of study and/or work per fortnight</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the job seeker is undertaking 70 or more contact hours of study and/or work per fortnight, their job search requirements may be fully met.</p>

<p>Job seekers must negotiate their job search requirements with their jobactive provider.</p>

<p>Job seekers with part-time requirements (for example, principal carers or people assessed with a partial capacity to work of 15-29 hours per week) undertaking an approved full-time short course are deemed to be fully meeting their mutual obligation requirements and have no other requirements with their provider.

<p>For JSP job seekers, any type of part-time study which cannot be approved under short course policy can be undertaken if the job seeker continues to meet all of their mutual obligation requirements, including job search, attending appointments and accepting offers of employment. For example, a job seeker may be studying at night and willing to look for work during the day. A job seeker will remain qualified for JSP, even where the course cannot be coded as an approved activity and count towards meeting their mutual obligation requirements if&#58;</p>

<p>Principal carers on JSP can participate in approved study of at least 15 hours per week (30 hours per fortnight) in any combination of contact and non-contact hours to fully meet their mutual obligation requirements. This is regardless of whether the institution regards the course as full-time or part-time. If the study is less than 15 hours per week the principal carer must participate in another activity. This could be a combination of paid work and study, or self-employment and study. If no other activity can be approved to fully meet the job seeker's requirements, they will have job search requirements, in addition to their hours of study.</p>

<p>A full-time academic course cannot be approved as a short course for a JSP job seeker just because they have exhausted their allowable time on a student payment. In exceptional circumstances, the provider may approve the full-time academic study as a compulsory activity in the Job Plan for JSP job seekers. An example of when full-time academic study might be approved is where a person has been unsuccessful in their job search but has only a single study period (for example, a semester, or between 6 and 12 months) to complete in order to obtain a degree that would greatly improve their employment prospects. If a provider approves full-time study as per the guidelines above, there is no requirement for the person to test their eligibility for a student payment even if the job seeker is undertaking an academic course and could qualify for Austudy.</p>
