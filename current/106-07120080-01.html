<p>This document outlines when a partnered person may be treated as single under Section 24 of the Social Security Act 1991.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Purpose_of_Sect">Purpose of Section 24</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Section 24 of the Social Security Act 1991 enables Services Australia to apply a decision that there is a ‘special reason’ not to treat a partnered person as a member of a couple. If Section 24 of the Social Security Act 1991 is applied, the customer is treated as single for all purposes of the Social Security Act and Family Assistance Act. As a result, the customer is paid the single rate of payment. Only their individual income and assets are included in the assessment of the rate of payment.</p>

<p>Section 24 assessments must only be conducted once the customer is linked to their partner on the Marital Status (<strong>MS</strong>) and Link Person (<strong>LP</strong>) screens. For information on which forms are required for customers claiming or in receipt of an income support payment, see <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-05010000-01.html">Change in relationship status from single to partnered</a>. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> where Family and Domestic Violence (FDV) issues are identified, it may be appropriate not to establish the initial partner link depending on the individual customer circumstances. Engagement with a Social Worker may be appropriate to discuss the customer’s situation to determine if they should be linked or not. </p>

<p>A formal MoC assessment <strong>must not be initiated</strong> for customers who request to be treated as single under Section 24 of the Social Security Act 1991.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Identity_requir">Identity requirements for partners</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Only specific payments require a person's partner to confirm their identity. If a customer has a partner, the customer <strong>must</strong> provide identity documents for themselves and <strong>their partner</strong> when they claim&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
Parenting Payment Partnered (PPP)</li>
		<li>
Low Income Card (LIC)</li>
		<li>
Farm Household Allowance (FHA)</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the partner's identity has been confirmed previously, further identity documents will not be required.</p>

<p>If the partner has not provided identity documents in person, they will have a status of ‘No Linkage’. See <a target="_blank" href="../initial-contact-general/106-09010000-01.html">Identity Confirmation</a> for more information.</p>

<p>A Partner Details (MOD P) or Partner details (AUS174) (where the customer is in receipt of an Australian income support payment while living overseas) form is required if the customer is not already linked to their partner. Confirmation from the customer’s partner may be required before linking can occur. See <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-20012318-01.html">Confirming a partnered relationship</a>.</p>

<p>Once the customer has been linked to their partner, there must still be sufficient information detailing the customer's and partner's current circumstances and financial situation to make a Section 24 determination. Generally, the MOD P/AUS174 alone does not support the ability to make a Section 24 determination. Further information from the customer or partner is required, see <strong>Circumstances to consider</strong> section below</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> exceptions to linking applies where a customer is in a multiple relationship.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Section 24 is intended to be the <strong>option of last resort. </strong>It must only be applied when all other reasonable means of support have been explored and exhausted. It is not possible to predict all the situations where Section 24 can be applied as the circumstances of each particular situation must be considered on a case by case basis.</p>

<p>The discretion to treat a customer as not being a member of a couple should be exercised only where full consideration of all the circumstances relevant to the individual's case would make it unjust or unreasonable not to do so.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Responsibility_">Responsibility for Section 24 assessments</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A customer may not specifically request an assessment under Section 24 provisions, as they may not be aware of its availability. When the agency has information about a customer's circumstances that would indicate a Section 24 assessment may be warranted, as a duty of care the customer should be offered to test whether they have an entitlement under Section 24 provisions to be treated as single.</p>

<p>When a customer is requesting an initial Section 24 assessment, including where a new claim is being processed, it is to be undertaken at first contact where possible. If the Service Officer does not have the required skill set to undertake the Section 24 assessments, a referral may be required.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Service Officers processing JobSeeker Payment or Youth Allowance (job seeker) new claims must complete the Section 24 assessment when the customer is residing in Australia.</p>

<p>If the Section 24 assessment is for a customer who <strong>resides overseas</strong>, the assessment is conducted by International Services (CIS). </p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a customer is in receipt of Family Assistance payments only, Section 24 provisions are <strong>not</strong> to be used as a work around when the partner is unable to supply their tax file number.</p>

<p>Section 24 provisions may be applied in <strong>limited circumstances</strong> to customers&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
whose partners <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07120050-03.html">are in prison</a> (including overseas detention). Separate provisions of the Social Security Act provide for higher levels of payment in situations where the partner is in prison but the S24 may be applied in special circumstances.

who are partnered and the partner is subject to the <a href="../migrants-refugees-and-visitors/005-02020000-01.html">Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Period (NARWP)</a> and has an <a href="../migrants-refugees-and-visitors/005-03000000-01.html">Assurance of Support (AoS)</a> in place.

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Circumstances_t">Circumstances to consider</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The following questions must be considered as part of the assessment while looking at the full circumstances of the case&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
is there a special reason to be considered in the couple's circumstance?</li>
		<li>
is there a lack of being able to pool resources for the couple as a result of the circumstances?</li>
		<li>
is there financial difficulty as a result of the couple's circumstances?</li>
		</ul>
<p>There must be some degree to which circumstances are outside the couple's or individual's control and cannot be changed. A couple's circumstances must be compared to a couple in similar circumstances but for whom the special reason to apply Section 24 does not exist. Each determination made must be based on the merits of each case after careful consideration of all the facts.</p>

<p>It may be appropriate to apply Section 24 in circumstances including, but not limited to when the&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
customer is experiencing <strong>family and domestic violence</strong>, particularly where a person is unable to pool resources or is in financial difficulty because of family and domestic violence</li>
		<li>
customer has <strong>limited access to their partner's income/assets</strong>. For example&#58; </li>
			<ul>			<li>
if the income of a person is not available for the use or benefit of their partner, or </li>
			<li>
the person is mentally infirm and a guardian has been appointed to manage their affairs, or </li>
			<li>
the presence of family and domestic violence</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>partner is overseas or goes overseas</strong>, in which case the primary consideration is whether the customer in Australia is deprived of the income support of the partner overseas. For example&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
there are legal restrictions on the transfer of funds from overseas</li>
			<li>
the overseas partner does not have sufficient excess funds to send to Australia</li>
			<li>
the situation has arisen beyond the control of either partner, or as an unintended consequence of the partner's actions</li>
			<li>
does either party have power to alter the situation and, if so, are they taking reasonable steps to do so?</li>
			<li>
in general, the circumstances must be unusual, uncommon, abnormal or exceptional, which would support their description as ‘special’</li>		</ul>
		<li>
partner is <strong>not residentially qualified</strong> for an income support payment (see exception to the rule below), or</li>
		<li>
partner is in an <strong>Immigration Detention Centre</strong> awaiting deportation</li>
		</ul>
<p>If either partner has knowingly contributed to their situation, there would be considerably less justification for exercising the discretion. This may be the case if one partner goes overseas and leaves the other partner in Australia with insufficient funds, despite having the means to support their partner.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> where a formal member of a couple (MoC) assessment is conducted under Section 4 of the Social Security Act 1991 and family and domestic violence has been identified, it is intended that it is factored into the MoC assessment rather than finding the person is a member of a couple and subsequently applying provisions under section 24 due to the presence of family and domestic violence.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Assessing_finan">Assessing financial difficulty</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The customer's overall financial situation must be considered when making a Section 24 determination. Financial difficulty has been described as not being able to provide for accommodation and the basic necessities of life or to be without adequate means of support. Decisions from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) and Federal Court indicate ineligibility for a Centrelink payment, in itself, is very unlikely to constitute a 'special reason' for a determination under Section 24 provisions.</p>

<p>Financial difficulty can be determined by comparing readily available funds to necessary expenditure. For example, taking into account all income and readily available funds from all sources for both members of a couple. This includes (but is not limited to)&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
wages</li>
		<li>
income support payments</li>
		<li>
foreign pension</li>
		<li>
foreign income and assets</li>
		<li>
Family Tax Benefit</li>
		<li>
investments, and</li>
		<li>
any in-kind assistance they might receive such as the value of free rent</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the total of these funds is insufficient to provide for accommodation and the basic necessities of life, then the couple could be considered to be in financial difficulty. An example of this is when a couple are living on the one partnered rate of payment as one partner is not eligible for any assistance and has neither employment nor investment income.</p>

<p>When assessing a customer's circumstances, it is important to look at the <strong>overall</strong> financial situation. For example, a customer has $80,000 in a savings account, but the deemed fortnightly income is considerably less. The <strong>total amount</strong> of the balance of the bank account is taken into account when considering Section 24, not just the fortnightly deemed amount.</p>

<p>The presence of family and domestic violence may be inclusive of financial control. This results in a customer being unable to pool resources or access funds, placing them in financial hardship.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>If a customer is partnered with a person and living overseas and the partner did not have any income or assets prior to entering into the relationship, this does not necessarily constitute special circumstances or an inability to pool resources.</p>

<p>In some countries the Australian Age Pension is several times the average wage per annum in the country the couple are living together in. This must be considered when making a Section 24 determination, it is not appropriate to consider a couple to be in hardship in these cases.</p>

<p>For customers living overseas consideration must also be given to the cost of living expenses of the country the customer is living in. This is consistent with the requirement to assess financial difficulty and an inability to provide for accommodation and the basic necessities of life.</p>

<p>Customers living together overseas permanently who request Section 24 are assessed and reviewed by International Services (CIS).</p>

<p>When an AoS is in place and the assurer is a third party, and the assuree does not receive regular income or in-kind support from the assurer, then the assuree must be encouraged to draw on the AoS or apply for Special Benefit (SpB) if they are eligible. If the assuree is eligible for and makes a claim for SpB, the assuree must prove they have made every effort to get adequate support from the assurer prior to making the claim. Any assistance received by the assuree is taken into account as income for SpB.</p>

<p>If there has been a substantial change of circumstances for the assurer (for example illness or job loss) which means they are no longer able or willing to fulfil the obligations under the AoS, Service Officers must </p>
		<ul>		<li>
closely examine the assurer’s financial circumstances and </li>
		<li>
confirm no other forms of assistance can be provided prior to determining if a Section 24 assessment is appropriate.</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the assuree is to serve a NARWP for all payments, including SpB, any assistance provided by the assurer is taken into account when looking at financial difficulty. Certain types or classes of visas have available funds conditions placed upon them. That is, the person needed to have a certain amount of funds available to support themselves while in Australia, before they are eligible for the visa. Visa conditions must be explored when determining whether the couple are in financial difficulty.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> SpB customers are generally subject to a long term available funds test if they are likely to be on payment for more than 13 weeks. The long-term available funds test precludes payment to the customers if the couple have more than $5,000 in available funds. If a non-residentially qualified partner fails the long-term available funds test when claiming SpB, then it may not be appropriate for Section 24 to be considered.</p>

<p>Where a person has a partner in prison, this alone is not sufficient to warrant the application of Section 24. The higher 'partner in gaol' rate of payment is available to customers in this situation in recognition that they are less able to pool resources while their partner is in prison. Section 24, however, may be applied if there is a 'special reason' in that particular case (i.e. not just the partner being in prison), which warrants not treating the person as a member of a couple. For example, the customer's partner is in prison awaiting trial on fraud charges and the partner's assets and accounts have been frozen by the courts.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Multiple_relati">Multiple relationships</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The social security system does not recognise the existence of multiple relationships, regardless of whether they were formed within Australia or overseas. The policy was updated to include changes relating to assessments under Section 24 provision, which decision makers can take into consideration for when the customer does not form part of the central couple.</p>

<p>Section 24 is a discretionary decision and the discretion exists to deal with unfair, inequitable and/or unjust anomalies. In assessing whether the customer in a multiple relationship should be treated as single and paid the single rate under Section 24, Service Officers must consider the impact in relation to any aspect of unfairness or absurdity in the operation of the Social Security Act 1991 (the Act) and A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999. </p>

<p>A Service Officer may determine, for example, if it would be unfair to assess one partner's income and assets against multiple partners given provisions in the Act around Member of a Couple relationships (s4 of the Social Security Act 1991), which could generally lead to a favourable determination. This is because, the provisions with the Act appear to contemplate that a person has one partner or none at all.</p>

<p>Whilst it is understood there appears to be an anomaly with applying Section 24 determinations to customers in a multiple relationship (that is, to be considered under Section 24 provisions, a customer must be partnered), the policy is clear on the requirements in relation to multiple relationships. Section 24 remains a discretionary decision, therefore the outcome of any assessment is determined by the Service Officer making the decision based on the information available to them at that time.</p>

<p>Where a Service Officer has determined the customer should not be considered as single under Section 24 and is to be paid at the partnered rate, the customer must be coded as single and paid a <strong>manual partnered rate</strong>, as the system does not allow for a customer to be linked to more than one partner. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> additional partners who qualify for Parenting Payment (PP) will be paid Parenting Payment Single (PPS) at the manual partnered rate. It is important to calculate the <strong>manual</strong> partnered rate by applying the Parenting Payment Partnered (PPP) income test, not the PPS income test.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>If a customer has failed to advise within 14 days (<a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-08040040-01.html">28 days for customers living together overseas</a>) they have become partnered, it may be necessary to consider any Section 24 assessment as being in 2 parts. The first part (Decision 1) being from the consideration day. The second part (Decision 2) may be required for any period prior to the consideration day.</p>

<p><strong>Decision 1</strong> - A current assessment to apply Section 24 to treat a partnered person as a single person.</p>

<p><strong>Decision 2</strong> - When a person is already receiving the single rate of payment and fails to advise they have become partnered (for example, married or entered a registered or de facto relationship), and their circumstances may have warranted exercise of discretion to apply Section 24 had they advised correctly.</p>

<p>It would also be appropriate to consider Section 24 when investigating if a debt exists and the amount of any debt. For example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
if after consideration it is determined Section 24 would have applied to the customer based on their circumstances, then it is possible no debt exists, or</li>
		<li>
if after consideration it is determined Section 24 would <strong>not</strong> have been applied to the customer based on their circumstances, then a debt can only be raised for the difference between what they were paid (single rate) and what they were entitled to receive (partnered rate, taking into account the full effect of the partnered income/assets test being applied)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Service Officers undertaking the Section 24 assessment need to determine whether Section 24 may have been applicable retrospectively in order to work out if a debt exists. This includes where a customer retrospectively discloses they were partnered but paid the single rate, however their partner has passed away and the surviving member of a couple requests to be assessed under Section 4 provisions for the retrospective period. Obtaining a co-signed MOD P will not be possible, however accepting the customer’s signed form would be sufficient in these circumstances to assess the need to recover payments the customer was not entitled to.</p>

<p>Section 24 should be considered in circumstances where a partnered person has not disclosed the relationship and it is determined that family and domestic violence exists. The failure to disclose the relationship may be the result of the family and domestic violence situation. For the retrospective period, an assessment should be made on whether Section 24 provisions should be applied due to presence of family and domestic violence.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>It is important for cases where a Section 24 assessment is applied to be kept under close review, especially if there is a risk of incorrect payments due to a change of circumstances which would warrant the termination of the Section 24 assessment. A manual review must be conducted <strong>every 13 weeks</strong>, or earlier if warranted. However, for customers whose circumstances are unlikely to change, or where there is a very low risk of incorrect payment, reviews may only need to be conducted annually. If discretion is used to extend the review period beyond 13 weeks, this must be documented on the customer’s record and supported by facts.</p>

<p>Whenever a customer leaves Australia to visit their partner overseas, a review must be conducted prior to departure to determine if Section 24 should continue to be applied whilst they are away. Generally Section 24 does not apply if the couple are living together overseas.</p>
