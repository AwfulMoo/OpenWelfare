<p>Services Australia and Employment Services Providers, including ParentsNext providers, are delegated to issue formal notification in relation to compulsory requirements.</p>

<p>A notification must include the&#58;</p>

date, time and location of the appointment, and</li>
		<li>
consequences for failing to attend or failing to advise of an inability to attend</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if possible, appointment notifications should also include the contact person, purpose and/or reason for the appointment, however not doing so does not invalidate the requirement. This is because all Job Plans and Participation Plans include a requirement to contact the provider with an acceptable reason if unable to meet a requirement.</p>

<p>The requirement to enter into a Job Plan or Participation Plan can be included within the original notice or delivered verbally at or before the appointment.</p>

<p>For job seekers in the Community Development Program (CDP), Disability Employment Services (DES) or ParentsNext participants, the requirement must be recorded in the Job Plan or Participation Plan and must include the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a description of the requirement</li>
		<li>
start and end date the job seeker is required to participate, and</li>
		<li>
the number of hours per fortnight of required participation</li>
		</ul>
<p>CDP and DES job seekers receive formal notification of their Job Search Requirement through their Job Plan. This includes the number of Job Search efforts required, the date the efforts are due to be reported, and how they can meet this requirement and report their Job Search efforts.</p>

<p>For job seekers in Workforce Australia and Workforce Australia Online, the Job Plan is simplified and must only include mandatory requirements like&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
achieving a monthly points target which includes a minimum job search requirement</li>
		<li>
attending compulsory appointments, and</li>
		<li>
participation in Mandatory Activation Point tasks as required</li>
		</ul>
<p>Workforce Australia job seekers receive formal notification of their Points Requirement (including minimum job search) via their Workforce Australia homepage.</p>

<p>All job seekers are required to make prior contact with the provider and provide an acceptable reason if unable to comply with a requirement.</p>

<p>Under the Targeted Compliance Framework, job seekers are responsible for recording their own attendance at activities using the Workforce Australia App, Homepage, or by contacting their provider by close of business on the day of the requirement.</p>

<p>Providers are required to issue formal notification any time they set or change a compulsory requirement. This includes when they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
set the requirement for the first time in a job seeker's Calendar/Activity Diary</li>
		<li>
reschedule a requirement because the job seeker has an acceptable reason for not being able to meet a requirement</li>
		<li>
adjust requirements to reflect they no longer need to be met (in part or in full) due to another requirement being set, or</li>
		<li>
set a re-engagement requirement</li>
		</ul>
<p>When a separate notification is issued requesting evidence of an activity, it must include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the evidence the job seeker needs to provide</li>
		<li>
when the evidence needs to be provided</li>
		<li>
the organisation the information should be provided to</li>		</ul>

<p><strong>Formal (or primary) notification</strong></p>

<p>Formal notification is a notification that meets the requirements under Social Security Law. It must include the following details&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
What the requirement is, for example, an appointment or an activity</li>
		<li>
The purpose or reason for the requirement (if relevant)</li>
		<li>
The date and time of the requirement, or the date and/or time the requirement needs to be completed by</li>
		<li>
The location or address of the requirement (if relevant)</li>
		<li>
That the job seeker must contact their Provider before the requirement if they have an acceptable reason for not being able to meet it</li>
		<li>
The consequences of not meeting the requirement, and</li>
		<li>
A statement that the Notification is being issued under Social Security Law, explaining the job seeker must meet their requirements in order to receive income support payments</li>
		</ul>
<p>Formal (primary) notification methods used by providers can include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Letter-mailed</strong> - a letter is mailed to the job seeker's residential address on the day the requirement is scheduled</li>
		<li>
<strong>Letter-handed</strong> - a letter is handed to the job seeker in person as they are currently with the Provider</li>
		<li>
<strong>Phone (script)</strong> - a script is read to the job seeker by their provider as the requirement is being scheduled. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> leaving a message on an answering machine or with another person in the job seeker's household does not count as formal notification</li>
		<li>
<strong>Face to face (script)</strong> - a script is read to the job seeker as they are in attendance at the provider's office as the requirement is being scheduled</li>
		<li>
<strong>Email</strong> -sent to the job seeker with a read receipt sent back to the Provider. This is only available if it is recorded as the job seeker's preferred method of Notification</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Secondary notification (reminders)</strong></p>

<p>Depending on the requirement, job seekers may also receive reminders.</p>

<p>Job seekers may receive reminders through&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
SMS</li>
		<li>
Email</li>

<div class="showcont">


<p>The job seeker must be given enough time between formal notification being issued and a requirement occurring to receive the notification and prepare for the requirement.</p>

<p>Reasonable notice will vary according to the circumstances of the notification and whether or not the job seeker was directly consulted prior to notice being given.</p>

<p><strong>Direct consultation&#58;</strong></p>

<p>When an appointment has been made in direct consultation with a job seeker and the job seeker has agreed to attend, reasonable notice is considered to have been given, even if the appointment is on the same day as the notification.</p>

<p><strong>Reasonable notice time frames for other formal notification methods&#58;</strong></p>

<p>The Employment Services System (ESS) ensures that reasonable notice timeframes are met when the provider is setting requirements and creating formal notification for job seekers, preventing a requirement on a specific day or use of a particular type of notification if these will not meet the following policy guidelines&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Letter mailed to a job seeker - 6 business days, Community Development Program (CDP) providers are required to post their letters 8 business days ahead of the scheduled appointment</li>
		<li>
Letter handed to a job seeker - 3 calendar days</li>
		<li>
Verbal script read face to face or over the phone - 3 calendar days</li>
		<li>
Email (can only be used if this is the job seeker's preferred notification method) - 2 business days with a read receipt sent back to confirm the job seeker has received, read and acknowledged the notification</li>
		</ul>
<p>When direct consultation has not occurred and the job seeker disputes notification of the requirement, Service Officers should consider the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the address where the letter was sent</li>
		<li>
if the notification was made by email, whether the requirement for a read receipt was met</li>
		<li>
if there was sufficient time for the job seeker to receive the notification, and</li>
		<li>
if there was sufficient time for the job seeker to make the necessary arrangements required to attend. Examples include arranging transport to the appointment or making child care arrangements</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> in rural and remote areas, local mail delivery conditions and the job seeker's arrangements for collecting mail should also be taken into consideration.</p>

<p>The Employment Services System (ESS) retains a history of any formal notification issued on the Notification List.</p>

<p>The notification record must be provided if a non-compliance event is reported to the agency. The Services Australia IT system automatically picks up the notifications for any requirements scheduled in the job seeker's Calendar.</p>

<p>Linked notification record/s can be viewed in the Participation Compliance workflow when conducting a compliance investigation. Linked notifications are available within the relevant provider report on the <strong>Participation Compliance Workflow Summary</strong> screen.</p>

<p><strong>Job Seeker Compliance Framework&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
The notification linked to the Non-Attendance Report (NAR) can be found immediately <strong>above</strong> the 'Evidence' heading within the report</li>
		<li>
Notifications linked to Participation Reports and Provider Appointment Reports (PAR) appear under the 'Notification' heading</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Targeted Compliance Framework&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
The type of notification used by the provider is recorded on the <strong>other related information page</strong> under the <strong>recent non-compliance</strong> link available within the <strong>Compliance Investigation</strong> workflow, or within the NCE on the <strong>Provider Report Summary</strong> screen</li>
		</ul>
<p>Details in the linked notification records should be consistent with other details recorded by the provider.</p>

<p>Details of the notification given may not be displayed in these links, for example when&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a verbal notification has been issued</li>
		<li>
the notification was generated via the Activity Diary/Calendar, or</li>
		<li>
if the notification has been archived</li>
		</ul>
<p>The information provided when reporting the non-compliance event will include evidence to satisfy appropriate notification. Further information from the provider is only required when the job seeker disputes notification and/or reasonable notice.</p>
