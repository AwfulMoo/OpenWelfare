		<ul>		<li>
the date of event for the change in circumstance. When did the support start?</li>
		<li>
if the customer is receiving free board and lodging or lodging only. Update the Accommodation (<strong>ACS</strong>) screen.</li>

<p>For a child who is at or below school age, check the custodial parent is in financial hardship and has no means to adequately support the child,</p>

<p>Check the custodial parent's residential status for any changes that may mean they are entitled to claim an income support payment. For example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the parental visa status has changed and now allows the parent to claim SpB, the child is no longer entitled, so the SpB should be cancelled. The parent should test their eligibility.</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the custodial parent is on an eligible visa that qualify them for SpB, the NARWP can be waived in this instance for the custodial parent. This is because there has been a substantial change in their circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>Check if the parent been granted a visa that would qualify them for FTB or another payment</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Refresh the Immigration datalink on the parent’s record.</li>
		<li>
Check the custodial parent’s record to see if a permanent/provisional or any qualifying visa is granted. Refer to Residence assessment for customers claiming Family Tax Benefit (FTB), Parental Leave Pay (PPL) and Dad and Partner Pay (DAP)</li>
		<li>
Check if they are already on an income support payment.</li>
		<li>
Contact the custodial parent to advise they should claim another payment (SpB and FTB).</li>
			<ul>			<li>
If contact is successful, issue the relevant letter. SpB for the child will be cancelled on the date of the visa change plus 14 days.</li>
			<li>
If contact is unsuccessful, <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-08070000-05.html#bp05_L3TT_Manual_letter_t01">issue the relevant letter</a>. SpB for the child will be cancelled on the date of the visa change plus 28 days. This gives a buffer to the customer due to potential hardship.</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Adjust the EED to the date cancelling plus 28 days to make sure the ACC payment is cancelled.</li>
		<li>
Upon lodgement of a claim, the custodial parent can ask to have their claim assessed urgently for SpB and FTB due to hardship.</li>
		<li>
SpB cannot be paid if&#58;</li>
		<li>
the custodial parent gets Family Tax Benefit (FTB) for the child on SpB (ACC category) and can earn a sufficient livelihood from the FTB payment</li>
		<li>
they have available funds over $5,000.<br><br>In these cases, cancel the payment, as the customer is not considered to be in hardship.</li>
		<li>
Make sure the Accommodation (<strong>AC</strong>) screen is coded correctly. See <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-08010010-01.html">SpB for ACC and Australian permanent resident children</a></li>
		<li>
Check if there are changes to child support payments and code if appropriate</li>
		<li>
Code the custodial parent’s available funds on the Savings Summary (<strong>SVS</strong>) screen on the <strong>parent's </strong>record</li>
		<li>
Code the available funds as a family unit from all sources on the <strong>NSOD</strong> screen on the <strong>child's</strong> record</li>
		<li>
Check the child’s Tax File Number or exemption if applicable</li>
		<li>
Check that the nominee is current</li>
		<li>
Check the Rate Component Override (<strong>RCO</strong>) screen to make sure the customer's rate is correct. Make sure all CPI rate increases have been applied if the customer is on a manual rate. Check the correct rate is applied to siblings on SpB</li>
		<li>
If the custodial parent gets Status Resolution Support Services (SRSS) payment, SpB should be paid at the equivalent FTB rate</li>
		<li>
Check for changes in child maintenance payments on the parent’s or guardian's <strong>MNGS </strong>screen, and update on the Other Income Summary (<strong>OINS</strong>) screen. Contact the custodial parent to get updated information if it is evident that&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
no child support is in place</li>
			<li>
a maintenance exemption was applied but may not be applicable anymore. <br><br>See <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-08010010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Review_claim_Step11">Special Benefit (SpB) for Australian Citizen Child (ACC) and Australian permanent resident children</a>, Table 2 Step 11.</li>		</ul>
		<li>
If the custodial parent is working, income above the maximum rate of JSP plus add-ons will reduce the rate of SpB. Make sure the amounts are coded correctly on the <strong>OIN </strong>screen</li>
