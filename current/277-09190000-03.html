<p>OEI involves the exchanging of any information provided by customers (or third parties) in relation to their COA application or objection. Where the information will be used to make the decision it will be provided to the other party for comment. Information is usually exchanged by providing the other party with copies of documents but information can also be provided verbally if it is more efficient to do so.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
information they provide will be exchanged with the other party</li>

<p>A copy of the COA application/objection and accompanying documents provided will be sent to the other customer. Responses and supporting documents provided by the other customer are also subject to OEI and will be exchanged with the applicant.</p>

<p>There is no legislative requirement in the objections process to provide a copy of the response (and/or accompanying documents) to the objector. However, in the interest of procedural fairness, customers must be provided with the opportunity to respond to any information which may result in findings which are adverse to their interests. It is also appropriate to seek a response where doing so would assist in making a better decision.</p>

<p>The documents can be discussed verbally and it may be appropriate to exchange actual copies or edited copies of relevant documents. Document any discussions in the Objections or COA Maintenance window. </p>

<p>Customers must choose what they include in their application/objection and supporting documents however documentation containing offensive material or other material such as certain personal information or evidence from children will not be exchanged. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-09190000-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Exchanging_info">Table 5</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> tell the customer if the matter proceeds to the AAT for an AAT first review, the agency will provide a copy of all information relevant to the decision to the AAT and the other party including&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
information not previously exchanged that is now relevant to the AAT review</li>
		<li>
records of conversations the customer had with us</li>
		<li>
information obtained from Child Support’s requests for information. For example section 161 notice</li>

<p>Child Support <strong>will not remove or edit documents on behalf of the customer</strong> - with the exceptions outlined in <a href="../separated-parents/277-09190000-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Information_tha01">Table 3</a> and <a href="../separated-parents/277-09190000-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Editing_informa">Table 4</a>.</p>

<p>If the applicant <strong>does not want</strong> the application or supporting documents to be exchanged tell the customer they can withdraw their application and resubmit it after reviewing and editing the documents. If the applicant refuses to do this, tell them the agency will serve a copy of the application and accompanying documents on the other party in accordance with the requirements in the legislation (Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 section 98G).</p>

<p>If the respondent <strong>does not want </strong>their response or supporting documents to be exchanged change the category of the correspondence to '<strong>General</strong>' and the subcategory to '<strong>None</strong>' in the View Correspondence window. This will ensure that the response is not identified as part of the relevant COA process.</p>

<p>This will generate a <strong>Correspondence Received</strong> intray, this intray must be deleted.</p>

<p>If the applicant or the respondent chooses 1 of the options above, the Decision Maker (DM) will print and provide a copy of the relevant documents to the owning customer only along with a unique letter and a blank copy of the Application/Objection or Response if required. The unique letter must explain these documents have been disregarded and will not be provided to the other party as part of the COA process. See <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-30010400-01.html">Letters Cuba Process Help</a>.</p>

<p>If the customer decides not to exchange the information, document their decision.</p>

<p>Having sighted documentation that is now withheld from the OEI process, the DM may consider that they, or someone else, may perceive that their impartiality is affected. It may be appropriate to refer the case to the DM’s Team Leader for re-allocation to a different DM.</p>

<p>The documents can be discussed verbally and it may be appropriate to exchange actual copies or edited copies of relevant documents. Document any discussions in the COA Maintenance or Objections window.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> customers must be told that although information gathered may not have been exchanged with the other party during the COA, CTP or objections process, if the matter progresses to the AAT for an AAT first review relevant information will be exchanged.</p>

<p>‘Suspicious Matter Reports’ (SMR) from AUSTRAC must never be disclosed. This means they <strong>must not</strong> be included when making a submission – they cannot be disclosed to any court or tribunal and are not admissible as evidence.</p>

<p>If the customer will not remove or edit the irrelevant information and exceptional circumstances exist (for example the information is highly sensitive and the release of that information may have an adverse impact on a third party), the DM may decide to remove or edit the information, with advice from Program Advice. The decision must not result in denial of procedural fairness.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> in some instances, information provided by the customer may be potentially relevant to the consideration of the COA application or the objection, but is considered to be unnecessary in the circumstances, for example, because other evidence provided by the customer is already sufficient for the making of the decision.

<p><strong>COA applications</strong></p>

<p>A copy of the customer’s application form (<a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-09190000-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Forms01">Application to Change your Assessment - Special Circumstances</a>) and accompanying documents they provide will be given to the other parent who may then lodge a response. If the customer has included information or supporting documents they do not wish to be exchanged, they may elect to withdraw their application and resubmit.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> do<strong> not</strong> send the personal and confidential information contained in the red Privacy page to the other parent.</p>

<p>See <a href="../separated-parents/277-03120000-01.html">Change of Assessment in special circumstances.</a></p>

<p><strong>Objections (general, care, part 6A)</strong></p>

<p>Objections to a percentage of care decision made after 1 July 2010 can be lodged over the phone. All other objections must be in writing and can be received via post, email or fax. Customers may submit their objection using the form <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-09190000-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Forms01">Objecting to a Child Support decision</a>.</p>

<p>Child Support will discuss objections relating to percentage of care decisions with the other party. When exchanging information with customers, documents may be sent for a response or discussed verbally.</p>

<p>Generally it will only be information that is received during the course of the objection which should be exchanged. Information received outside of the objection process (for example, information relating to the original decision) can also be exchanged, but only where failure to do so would result in a denial of procedural fairness. This would generally be limited to instances where adverse findings are likely to be made based on this information.</p>

<p>Discuss the documents. It may be appropriate to exchange actual copies or edited copies of relevant documents. Inform the customer of the possible disclosure and to remove any <a href="../separated-parents/277-09190000-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Information_tha01">information that must not be provided to the other party</a>. Document any discussions in the relevant window.</p>

<p>Although information gathered may not have been exchanged with the other party during the COA, CTP or objections process, relevant information will be exchanged if the matter progresses to the AAT for an AAT first review. <strong>Customers must be told  this.</strong></p>

<p>For the objections processes see <a href="../separated-parents/277-09170000-01.html">Child Support objections</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Responses to COA applications or objections</strong></p>

<p>A 'right of reply' response can be provided verbally or in writing by the respondent. Forms such as the <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-09190000-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Forms01">Responding to an Objection</a> or <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-09190000-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Forms01">Response to application to change your assessment - Special circumstances</a> can be used.</p>

<p>For an objection if any new or possibly unfavourable information which is relevant to the application is received, contact the customer to allow comment. If requested these documents will be provided to the customer to allow for a response.</p>

<p>For a COA applicant a copy of the response and any accompanying documents must be provided to the applicant.</p>

<p>The Contract Decision Maker Support Officer (CDM Support) must tell the CDM if the response requires editing before forwarding to the applicant.</p>

<p><strong>Accompanying documents</strong></p>

<p>Accompanying documents are those provided to support a customer's application, objection or response and must be received before the decision is made.</p>

<p>Accompanying documents include documents provided by&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer with their application or response</li>
		<li>
a third party at the request of the customer. For example pay slips faxed to Child Support by an employer</li>

<p>If the customer is lodging an AAT first review application with the AAT, explain the other party will receive a copy of the <strong>entire </strong>file sent to the Tribunal. This will include any information relevant to the decision under review, including Cuba screen shots and notepads.</p>

<p>Customers must be told the other party will receive documentation relating to their conversations with officers and other potentially sensitive information.</p>

<p>However, the agency will remove personal information from the file including non-parent carer income information and details of other cases. Also, in certain circumstances it may be asked that information of a sensitive nature not be disclosed.</p>

<p>For information about the legislative requirements between Child Support and AAT, including the procedure when an application for an AAT first review is lodged and the information that can be edited from the AAT first review file, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-09180000-01.html">Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) applications against Child Support decisions.</a></p>
