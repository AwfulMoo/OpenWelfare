<p>SpB is paid to eligible people who are in financial hardship due to circumstances beyond their control.</p>

<p>To qualify for SpB, a customer must meet<strong> all</strong> of the following criteria&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
be in financial hardship</li>
		<li>
be unable to earn a sufficient livelihood for themselves or their dependants by reason of age, physical or mental disability or domestic circumstances or for any other reason over which they have no control</li>
		<li>
not be receiving or entitled to receive income support payment, pension or benefit from Services Australia or a Service Pension, Veteran Payment or Income Support Supplement (ISS) from the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA)</li>
		<li>
not be able to receive sufficient ongoing support from any other source</li>
		<li>
be an Australian resident or the holder of an approved visa, and</li>
		<li>
be residing in Australia at the date of claim and during the period of payment except under certain exceptional circumstances</li>
		</ul>
<p>Although payments under the Paid Parental Leave scheme will not be treated as income when working out the rate of SpB, it may be included when assessing a customer's eligibility for SpB under the 'unable to earn a sufficient livelihood' criteria.</p>

<p>SpB customers are subject to the <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-08030040-01.html">available funds test</a> and the asset test is applied by considering whether the person's assets are accessible.</p>

<p>SpB is only payable where a person is unable to earn a sufficient livelihood. The person's circumstances must be carefully considered to determine whether their inability to earn a sufficient livelihood was unavoidable or reasonable or whether they have placed themselves in financial hardship by&#58;</p>

persevering with an unprofitable business venture</li>

spending their money on unnecessary items, or</li>

disposing of money, by gifting or other means without adequate return</li>

<p>Customers may receive various one-off support payments from the Australian Red Cross or one-off immediate needs support packages funded by the State Government. These one-off payments are not assessed as income or in kind support for Special Benefit purposes, however may be included in the <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-08030040-03.html">available funds test</a>.</p>

<p>Discretion should be used in these cases. Due to the nature of these payments, it is likely that the customer will use these funds as soon as practical to fund their immediate needs. </p>

<p>If the customer has over $5,000 in available funds at the date of claim, any funds over $5,000 may be considered committed funds if the customer can provide evidence of the intended immediate future costs and these are deemed as exceptional or unforeseen expenses. </p>

<p>Any remaining funds that are not deemed as exceptional or unforeseen will be included in the available funds test.</p>
