<p>In the following situations, only the carer who is living with the care receiver can be paid CA. This is the case even if the non co-resident carer is providing the required amount of care and attention to the care receiver&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
care is shared between a carer who would be qualified for CA under <a href="../carers/009-03020030-01.html">section 954</a> of the Social Security Act (because they live with their adult care receiver), <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
a carer who would be qualified for CA under <a href="../carers/009-03020040-01.html">section 954A</a> (not living with their adult care receiver, but providing at least 20 hours per week of personal daily care and attention), <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
both carers have claimed</li>
		</ul>
<p>In addition, a non co-resident carer cannot qualify for CA by combining the hours of care provided by a co-resident carer.</p>

<p>A co-resident carer cannot qualify for CA if there are days they do not provide care, and on those days care is provided in the home of a non co-resident carer. In these cases neither can qualify.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> there are 2 sections of the Social Security Act under which people sharing the care of an adult care receiver may be paid, s954 and s954A. For adult care receivers, a carer who qualifies for CA under s954 can only share CA with another carer under s954. Similarly a carer getting CA under s954A can only share CA with another carer under s954A.</p>

<p>CA may be shared between 2 carers who are not members of a couple who <strong>both</strong> qualify under section 954.</p>

<p>When 2 people have applied for CA for the same care receiver(s), and both live with the care receiver in the case of an adult care receiver, Services Australia is required to make a declaration before both can be paid CA. In all cases, the agency must provide written advice to both carers stating the payment will be shared. The system will generate the correct written advice to each carer.</p>

<p>If 2 carers who receive a shared care rate of CA for the same care receiver advise they have become partnered, CA can no longer be paid to both partners. See <a href="../carers/009-03050040-01.html">Changes to shared care for CA</a>.</p>

<p>If both members of a couple apply and are qualified, the department is required to make a declaration under section 965(2) of the Social Security Act, stating that both are qualified and specifying to which person the payment will be made.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when making the declaration, the agency must take into account if either member of the couple is the primary carer for the care receiver(s). <strong>These letters must be manually sent to each member of the couple</strong>.</p>

<p>If 2 carers who receive a shared care rate of CA for the same care receiver advise that they have become partnered, CA can no longer be paid to both partners. See <a href="../carers/009-03050040-01.html">Changes to shared care for CA</a>.</p>

<p>When 1 member of a couple is already receiving CA and the other member of the couple applies and is subsequently <strong>rejected</strong> (the original CA claimant continues to receive CA), then the system will only generate a free text letter shell for the rejected claimant.

<p>Under Section 964 of the Social Security Act 1991 (SSA), if 2 people who are not members of a couple share the care, but only 1 claims CA (or the second person's claim has not yet been assessed), that person (if qualified) receives 100% of the CA, regardless of the percentage of care by the qualified carer. This is the case even if both carers already share the Family Tax Benefit (FTB) payments for the care receiver(s).</p>

<p>Additional care and attention must be provided on a daily basis, but this may be provided by the other carer, as long as it is provided in the private residence of the carer and care receiver (in the case of a child or co-resident adult care receiver) or provided in the home of either the carer or care receiver (in the case of a non co-resident care receiver).

<p><strong>Second carer claims CA for the same care receiver AFTER the date of the first claim</strong></p>

<p>The first qualified carer will continue to receive 100% of the maximum CA until a second carer qualifies <strong>and</strong> a declaration is made by the secretary under Section 981 of the SSA. The date this decision is made is the date of effect or start date for the second carer, overriding other date of effect provisions (for example, claim lodgement date).</p>

<p>The claim cannot be backdated beyond this declaration. However, if the grant is the result of a successful review of decision within 13 weeks of notification of the decision&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the date of effect/start date is the date of the original decision to reject the payment</li>

		<li>
for further advice on the start date of payment for CA, contact the Carer Helpdesk</li>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> a declaration under Section 981 must be made each time there is a change in level of care.</p>

<p><strong>2 carers claim CA for the same care receiver and are processed on the SAME date</strong></p>

<p>In limited situations, 2 CA claims for the same care receiver can both be granted on the same date. This occurs when both would be eligible <strong>from the same date</strong> providing both claims are processed and finalised on the same day.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when processing both claims, the arrears will need to be manually adjusted to the correct amount for both carers <strong>prior</strong> to finalising the claim.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>First carer is a non co-resident and the second carer is a co-resident</strong></p>

<p>If the non co-resident continued to provide daily care and attention of at least 20 hours per week to the care receiver, entitlement to CA is lost from the date a decision is made to grant the co-resident carer.</p>

<div class="showcont">


<p>Carers who qualify because of the combined DCLAD 2010 scores of 2 children can <strong>share</strong> the CA payment if both carers share the care of both care receivers. If the care of only 1 of the care receivers is shared (1 person cares for 2 children, the other cares for only 1 of the children) the person with the care of only 1 child will not qualify for CA. The person with care of both children will receive CA at the full rate.</p>

<p>For carers qualifying because of the combined DCLAD scores of 2 children, CA is paid in the same proportion as the average of the care they provide to the children. For example, if Carer 1 cares for Child A for 20% of the time and Child B for 40% of the time, this amounts to a total of 30%. Carer 2 cares for Child A 80% of the time and Child B 60% of the time. This amounts to 70%.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> as stated above, Carer 1 cannot care for Child A 100% of the time and Child B 0% of the time to result in an average of 50% of the total time, as this would mean the care of 2 children is not shared.</p>

<p>In the case of a child care receiver, the child <strong>must</strong> be a dependent child of both carers.</p>

<p>If the care is shared between a parent and a grandparent it is highly unlikely the child will be a dependent of both carers. CA can only be paid to the carer who has the dependent child. If the shared care provisions do not apply <strong>and</strong> the arrangement is temporary, then the Temporary Cessation of Care (TCC) provisions may apply while the child is in the care of the other carer. If the shared care provisions do not apply <strong>and</strong> the arrangement is not temporary, then the carer may have lost entitlement to CA if daily care is not being provided. This needs to be investigated.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> shared care provisions do not apply to CP. However, the shared care arrangement must be considered when determining eligibility or continuing eligibility for CP. See <a href="../carers/009-04030020-01.html">Eligibility for CP when a care receiver is aged 16 years or over</a> and <a href="../carers/009-04050010-01.html">Assessing CP when the care is shared</a>.</p>

<p>While there are similar rules for Family Tax Benefit (FTB), to qualify for FTB a customer requires an FTB child rather than a dependent child. FTB will be paid on the percentage of care provided even if the second carer does not claim or qualify for FTB.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
If 1 carer is already in receipt of CA for a care receiver and a second carer makes a claim, the care receiver does not have to be tested a second time against the List of Recognised Disabilities (LoRD) or DCLAD for child care receivers, or the Adult Disability Assessment Tool (ADAT) for adult care receivers. The second carer is not required to provide another medical report for the same care receiver</li>
		<li>
If both carers claim at the same time, the care receiver/s will only be tested once against the LoRDs or DCLAD for child care receivers, or the ADAT for adult care receivers, and the results will be used in the claims of both carers. Only 1 carer is required to provide the necessary medical reports</li>

<p>Where CA is shared, the <a href="../carers/009-06010000-01.html">temporary cessation of care (respite) provisions</a> do not apply during any period the carer would not normally provide care (because the care is shared with another carer, and the other carer is providing the care at the time). Where care is shared, but CA is not shared because only 1 carer claimed, the same rule applies.</p>

<p>Under shared care provisions, temporary cessation of care absences are either applied to both carers or to neither&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the care receiver ceases to receive care and attention from both carers for a period of 24 hours or more, record the absence on 1 carer's record and it will be automatically recorded on the other, if both are in receipt of CA. See <a href="../carers/009-06040050-01.html">Coding absences for CA where care of the care receiver is shared</a></li>
		<li>
If 1 carer relieves the other carer at a time the other carer would normally provide care, this is not temporary cessation of care. No absence should be coded on either carer's record. However, where relief is provided for an extended period, shared care provisions may cease to apply. These cases should be referred to the Carer Helpdesk</li>
		<li>
If care is shared between a carer and an institution (e.g. the carer provides care on weekdays and the institution provides the care on weekends) this is not shared care for the purpose of CA. A person cannot qualify for CA if at the time of claim they share care with an institution and <strong>daily</strong> care and attention is not provided in the private home</li>
		</ul>
<p>Subsequent to being granted, respite may be accessed on a regular basis, including when a child care receiver is attending <a href="../carers/009-06040030-01.html">education, training or treatment</a>.</p>

<p>When the care receiver is an <strong>adult</strong> and care is shared, the proportion of care provided by all the carers must total 100% for any of them to be eligible for CA. Thus there is a <strong>collective</strong> requirement on all carers. For example, if 1 person provided care on Monday to Friday and the other person provided care on Saturday only, neither would qualify for CA as 100% of the care receiver's care needs are not met.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> while shared care provisions do not apply to CP, the shared care arrangement must be considered when determining eligibility or continuing eligibility for CP. See <a href="../carers/009-04030020-01.html">Eligibility for CP when a care receiver is aged 16 years or over</a>.</p>

<p>When the care receiver is a <strong>child</strong> and care is shared, each person who claims CA for the child must provide care and attention <strong>because of the child's disability</strong>. Thus there is an <strong>individual</strong> requirement on each carer. If either person does not meet the requirement, only that person fails to qualify for a share of CA and the full rate (100%) of CA will be paid to the person who does claim the payment and meet the requirement.</p>

<p>Where there are more than 2 carers who provide care, CA may be paid to 1 or 2 carers (depending on whether 1 or 2 people claim) for the same care receiver even if these carers combined are not providing 100% of the care in a fortnight.</p>

<p>Where there are 3 or more carers caring for the same care receiver, and 2 of them are receiving a share of CA, those 2 carers do not lose their qualification or payability for CA just because there is a third person providing care. For example, Mary, Sue and Kate share the care of their disabled mother during a typical fortnight. Mary and Sue decide to claim CA. Given that their mother is receiving care and attention on a daily basis, and that all the other qualifying criteria have been met, Mary and Sue would be entitled to share 100 per cent of the CA rate even though they do not provide 100 per cent of the care.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> under Section 954A, if care is provided to the care receiver by anyone else besides the 2 qualified carers, this will not be counted towards the total of 20 hours a week required to be provided by both qualified carers.</p>

Frank and Jenny both care for William. However, Frank is the only carer who has claimed payment and he provides 65% of the care.

<p>When a declaration is made under Section 981 to pay a second carer a part rate of CA, or to change the rate of CA being paid to 2 carers, the percentage of care provided must be coded (before the review period commences) to reflect that the person with the greater amount of care is the primary carer.</p>

<p>The application of respite and hospitalisation provisions for shared care arrangements may lead to complications which need to be discussed with the carers.</p>

<p>When the care receiver is in the care of 1 of the carers as part of a regular shared care arrangement occurring on a fortnightly basis, absence days should <strong>not</strong> be recorded against the other carer who is not providing the care.</p>

<p>If 1 carer relieves the other carer at a time the other carer would normally provide care, this is also <strong>not</strong> temporary cessation of care. However, where relief is provided for an extended period, shared care provisions may cease to apply. These should be referred to the Carer Helpdesk.</p>

<p>If the rate of CA is shared between 2 carers, hospitalisation absences recorded on 1 carer's record will be automatically recorded on the other carer's record.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> there is no limit to hospitalisation absences for CA (child), however, the 63 day limit still applies to CA (adult), and all absences must be coded.</p>

<p>If 1 parent qualifies for CA (child) payment level under the CDAT 2001 and the other parent claims CA under the shared care provisions but only qualifies for CA HCC only (under the DCLAD 2010) the first carer continues to receive 100% of the CA payment under the CDAT 2001.</p>

<p>The CDAT carer is not reviewed until they have a change in circumstance such as cancellation or they are selected for their milestone medical review. The basis of this 'grandfathering' was to ensure carers would not be adversely effected by the change in assessment tool until they came up for review.</p>
