<p>This page contains the process to manually reconcile an estimate of income from 1 July 2011. Most reconciliations are automatically performed by Cuba. If manual intervention is required as a result of an exception to the auto reconciliation process, an intray will automatically generate. This page also contains the processes to follow in other specific circumstances. For example, a customer disputes the reconciliation outcome. </p>

<p>Generally, if the actual Adjusted Taxable Income (ATI) is higher than the estimated ATI, the estimate will be reconciled. If the actual ATI is lower than or equal to the estimated ATI, the estimate will generally be set to ‘Recon No Change’. However, some exceptions may apply.</p>

<p><strong>In cases where reconciling an estimate with a higher income would benefit the estimating parent, the estimate should not be reconciled.</strong> The status of these estimates should be set to <strong>Recon-No Change</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, if the estimating parent was assessed to pay the Fixed Annual Rate (FAR), reconciling with a higher income may produce an unintended result. The liability of a paying parent could reduce or the entitlement of a receiving parent could increase, even though their actual income was higher than their estimate. In these circumstances, the estimate should be set to <strong>Recon-No Change</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Identify the exception which requires manual intervention</strong></p>

<p>There are exceptions to the automatic reconciliation of an estimate. When these exceptions occur, automatic reconciliation is prevented. Manual intervention is required by a Service Officer with the estimate reconciliation skill set.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> more than one exception can exist for the same estimate. If required, consult a Service Support Officer (SSO) for assistance managing multiple exceptions.</p>

<p>From the list below, identify the reason/s why manual intervention is required. Follow the link to the relevant table. </p>

<p>To identify if PSI has been excluded from the estimate, look for an entry in the Post Separation Income window that has a start date between the date the estimate was lodged and the end of the financial year of the estimate. Select that entry. Confirm the assessment income selected is the estimated income.</p>

<p>If the PSI start date is prior to the estimate period, then PSI has not been excluded from the estimated income.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> where PSI is excluded only in the Year to Date period, verifying the accuracy of the estimate does not require any inclusion of PSI. Manually load the actual ATI into the estimate reconciliation calculator to determine if the estimate of income should be reconciled or set to a status of <strong>Recon-No Change</strong>.</p>

<p>If the PSI exclusion is not being applied against the estimated income compare the source of estimated income with the source of the PSI income to determine if the PSI amount should have applied to the estimated income. If PSI exclusion should have been applied to the estimated income, seek help from an SSO. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-09140000-01.html">Technical support in Child Support</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>Customer applied for PSI to be excluded from their ATI, based on income from a second job. Customer has always worked 10 hours per week overtime in their first job. The overtime in the first job has ceased and the customer has lodged an estimate. The customer is still working the second job and as such, the PSI will continue to apply against the estimated income.</p>

<p>In Cuba, PSI is excluded from a specific income record (such as ATO assessed taxable income). When that income is replaced by the estimate, the system ends the PSI exclusion. As the PSI exclusion is still relevant, it should be applied to the estimated income and a new PSI exclusion entry should be recorded against the estimate.</p>

<p>A determined ATI is compiled from information gathered from the customer, any third party or Child Support/ATO computer systems.</p>

<p>Ensure all relevant estimates within the relevant financial year have been processed correctly, including clear documentation reflecting the customer’s circumstances at the time of making the estimate.

<p>A reverse case occurs when both parents are (or have been) assessed to pay child support for a child. Cuba generates 2 linked cases to show each parent’s liability reflected in a single assessment.</p>

<p>Manual intervention is usually required because the existing case and the reverse case have different child support periods or different incomes or both. <a href="../separated-parents/277-07060020-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Reverse_case_es">Resources</a> has an example of 'Estimate reconciliation&#58; Reverse case'.</p>

<p>If a customer provides an incorrect YTD figure when lodging their initial estimate, they can update it prior to reconciliation. Once the estimate has been reconciled, a customer can no longer update an incorrect YTD amount.</p>

<p>However, the Registrar may determine a new YTD at any time (s63AE). If a customer contacts about a reconciliation outcome and it appears that the YTD may be incorrect, perform an administrative review. Consider whether the YTD is inaccurate <strong>and </strong>whether it is appropriate for a new YTD to be determined under s63AE.</p>

<p>If a new YTD is determined, the estimate may require re-reconciliation.</p>

<p>The Registrar should consider all the circumstances of the case to determine whether it is appropriate to exercise the discretion to determine a new YTD amount. Each case should be considered on its merits, but as a general rule the Registrar will usually exercise the discretion if satisfied that&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the YTD amount is incorrect</li>
		<li>
Child Support contributed to the YTD amount being incorrect, and</li>
		<li>
customer contact about the YTD occurred within a reasonable time</li>
		</ul>
<p>Generally, customers will contact within a reasonable time after receiving notification of reconciliation of their estimate. Reasonable time will differ depending on individual customer circumstances. For example, customers in remote locations may only collect mail once a month. Escalate to an SSO if unsure whether the timeframe between notification and contact was reasonable.</p>

<p>However, <strong>there may be circumstances that warrant the use of the discretion even when all of these conditions are not satisfied.</strong> For example, where Child Support did not contribute to the YTD being incorrect, it may still be appropriate to administratively review the YTD once the customer’s circumstances have been considered in their entirety. Consider the information provided by the customer and all other available evidence.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>A Service Officer accepts an estimate and the parent provides, in good faith, what they believe to be accurate information at the time. The YTD is not accurate, through no fault of the agency, and the estimate is later reconciled. The reconciliation results in a debt because the YTD was not correct. </p>

<p>The parent contacts us within a reasonable time regarding the reconciliation and explains that they lost their income information in a fire, which prevented them from providing an accurate YTD earlier. They were only recently able to obtain the necessary information again from their employer. In these circumstances, despite no error having been made by the agency, it may be appropriate to change the YTD via administrative review<strong>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> an estimating customer may elect a new YTD amount for a year of income at any time prior to the reconciliation of their estimate(s) under (s63AC).</p>

<p>Customers may incorrectly record their Centrelink or DVA tax free pension or benefit as taxable income on their tax return. The tax free pension or benefit amount is recorded separately on Cuba.</p>

<p>When the taxable income is received from the ATO the estimate will be reconciled with the customer’s ATI which will include a double count of the tax free pension or benefit amounts. This is the correct application of the law and should not be considered an error. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-07010010-01.html">Australian Tax Office (ATO) income for Child Support customers</a>.</p>

<p>Do not make any adjustments to the original reconciliation. </p>

<p>Where this has occurred, encourage the customer to lodge an amended tax return. The amended taxable income may be used to re-reconcile the estimate if it meets the requirements described in <a href="../separated-parents/277-07060020-03.html#bp03_L3TT_The_ATO_issues_01">ATO issues an amended taxable income</a>. A change of assessment in special circumstances may also be an option. Where a customer makes an application, the Registrar can only make a change to the assessment for a period up to 18 months prior to the application. For periods more than 18 months and up to 7 years the customer would need to apply to court for leave.
