<p>This page contains the process to manually reconcile an estimate of income from 1 July 2011. Most reconciliations are automatically performed by Cuba. If manual intervention is required as a result of an exception to the auto reconciliation process, an intray will automatically generate. This page also contains the processes to follow in other specific circumstances. For example, a customer disputes the reconciliation outcome.</p>

<p>Generally, if the actual Adjusted Taxable Income (ATI) is higher than the estimated ATI, the estimate will be reconciled. If the actual ATI is lower than or equal to the estimated ATI, the estimate will generally be set to ‘Recon No Change’. However, some exceptions may apply.</p>

<p><strong>In cases where reconciling an estimate with a higher income would benefit the estimating parent, the estimate should not be reconciled.</strong> The status of these estimates must be set to <strong>Recon-No Change </strong>to prevent an unintended outcome.</p>

<p>For example, if the estimating parent was assessed to pay the Fixed Annual Rate (FAR), reconciling with a higher income may produce an unintended result. The liability of a paying parent could reduce or the entitlement of a receiving parent could increase, even though their actual income was higher than their estimate. In these circumstances, the estimate must be set to <strong>Recon-No Change</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Example notepad</strong></p>

<p><strong>Subject&#58;</strong> Recon No Change</p>

<p><strong>Text&#58;</strong> The customer was assessed to pay at the Fixed Annual Rate (FAR) based on their estimate and reconciliation would result in an assessment of less than the FAR.</p>

<p>In cases where reconciling an estimate with a higher income would benefit the estimating parent, the estimate must not be reconciled.</p>

<p>The status of the estimate has been set to Recon-No Change.</p>

<p>If the,’Assmnt Income’ field for the PSI entry shows any income code other than EST, REP or REV. then the PSI was not excluded from the estimate.</p>

<p>If the PSI was excluded from another type of income such as ‘’TAX’, ‘CDER’ or ”REC then more checks are required. We must check how the PSI decision was made and whether it should also have been applied to the estimate period.</p>

<p><strong>If the PSI was excluded from an estimate that had already been reconciled</strong></p>

<p>If the PSI was excluded from a reconciled estimate, the ‘Assmnt Income’ field for the PSI entry will show as ‘REC’. No manual workarounds are required. The reconciling income was already used in the assessment when the PSI decision was made. The correct PSI amount should already have been applied. No more action is needed, unless there appears to have been an error in the reconciliation or the PSI decision. Consult an SSO if there appears to have been an error. The Correcting Errors process may be required.</p>

<p><strong>If the PSI was excluded from another income type</strong></p>

<p>PSI is excluded from a specific income record, such as ATO assessed income. When that income is replaced by an estimate, the system ends the PSI exclusion. If the PSI exclusion is still relevant, it should also be applied to the estimated income. A new PSI exclusion entry should be recorded against the estimate.</p>

<p>Compare the source of the estimated income with the source of the PSI income. Check all the details in both the PSI decision notepad and the estimated income notepad. Determine if the PSI amount should have also been applied to the estimated income. This should happen if there was still valid PSI being earned in the estimate period.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>Customer had successfully applied for PSI to be excluded from their ATO supplied ATI, due to income from a second job they started after separation. Customer had normally worked overtime in their first job. The overtime in the first job has ceased and the customer had lodged an estimate. The customer was still working the second job, so the PSI that related to the second job should have continued to be excluded from the estimated income.</p>

<p><strong>If the PSI should have been excluded from the estimate but was not</strong>, seek help from an SSO. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-09140000-01.html">Technical support in Child Support</a>. The Correcting Errors process may need to be followed. Once any required corrections have been processed, <a href="../separated-parents/277-07060020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Post_Separation_Step05">go to Step 5</a>.</p>

<p>Where the PSI exclusion applies to only part of the estimate period or there are multiple PSI exclusion amounts and reconciliation is required, the PSI cannot be entered into the reconciliation calculation directly. This is because the calculator does not allow the PSI to be entered for the relevant portion of the estimate period and would incorrectly count it as applying to the entire estimate period.</p>

<p>The approved workaround is to delete the PSI entry entirely, to give effect to the reconciling result then re-key the PSI entry. Deleting and re-keying the PSI entry will make sure the final assessment is calculated on the correct income.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the PSI accepted amount can only be up to 30% of the income being used in the assessment. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-07100000-01.html">Post separation income for Child Support customers</a> for more details.</p>

<p>In most cases, receipt of an ATO Amended Taxable income will create a ‘Pending Auto Reconciling Inc’ intray or a ‘Reconciliation Required’ intray. Manual intervention is required to determine if the amended taxable income will be used to reconcile or re-reconcile an estimate.</p>

<p>In some cases, an intray will not automatically create. An internal referral may then be received via an 'Estimate Rec' intray. Check the intray notepad for details about the referral.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> BSI or the ATO ICP system may indicate that an ATO income has been, or will be, cancelled. BSI will remove cancelled ATO incomes from Cuba after confirmation from the ATO. If an estimate was reconciled based on an ATO income that is now cancelled, the reconciling income must also be cancelled. If a valid ATI is available, consider if re-reconciliation is required.

<p><strong>If a customer’s actual ATI is not available 12 months after the end of a financial year</strong> in which the customer lodged an estimate, the estimate period may be reconciled using a determined ATI.</p>

<p><strong>A determined ATI cannot be used to reconcile an estimate earlier than 12 months</strong> after the end of the financial year of the estimate.</p>

<p>A determined ATI is compiled from information gathered from the customer, any third party or Child Support/ATO computer systems.</p>

<p>Make sure all relevant estimates within the relevant financial year have been processed correctly, including clear documentation reflecting the customer’s circumstances at the time of making the estimate. If there has been an error, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-09030000-01.html">Correcting errors on Child Support cases</a> when considering the decision.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> be alert to other issues that may affect reconciling the estimate. There may be other reasons for manual intervention.</p>

<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
If there is a Deceased Customer indicator, consultation with the Deceased Customer Management team (DCM) is required. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-07060020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Deceased_indica_Step">Table 13</a></li>
		<li>
If an Income Amount Order (IAO) is in place for one day or more in the estimate period an estimate cannot be reconciled, however it can be reviewed. If there is an IAO, see the <a href="../separated-parents/277-07060020-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Income_Amount_O">Income Amount Order</a> table</li>

<p>A reverse case occurs when both parents are (or have been) assessed to pay child support for a child. Cuba generates 2 linked cases to show each parent’s liability reflected in a single assessment.</p>

<p>The customer may indicate that an income issued by the ATO is incorrect. ATO incomes can only be amended or cancelled by the ATO.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Encourage the customer to contact the ATO to discuss the issue</li>
		<li>
Do not make any adjustments to the reconciling income unless the ATO income in question is amended or cancelled by the ATO</li>
		<li>
If the income in question is already showing as cancelled in the ATO ICP system, but not in Cuba, notify BSI. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-07010010-01.html">Australian Taxation Office (ATO) income for Child Support customers</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>If an Amended ATO Taxable income is received, an intray will generate and a specialist estimate reconciliation officer will determine if a re-reconciliation is required. The estimate will be re-reconciled if it meets the requirements described in <a href="../separated-parents/277-07060020-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Amended_taxable">Table 9</a> ATO issues an amended taxable income.</p>

<p>If an ATO Taxable income has been <strong>cancelled</strong> in Cuba, the <a href="../separated-parents/277-09030000-01.html">Correcting errors on Child Support cases</a> procedure must be followed by a specialist estimate reconciliation officer. Any reconciling income that was based on the now-cancelled ATO income must be deleted. Re-reconciliation of the estimate, or setting it to Recon-No Change, should occur if a valid Reconciling income is available.</p>

<p><strong>Tax free pension and benefit amounts reported as taxable income </strong></p>

<p>Customers may incorrectly record their Centrelink or DVA tax free pension or benefit as taxable income on their tax return. The tax free pension or benefit amount is also recorded separately on Cuba.</p>

<p>When the taxable income is received from the ATO the estimate will be reconciled with the customer’s ATI which will include a double count of the tax free pension or benefit amounts. This is the correct application of the law and must not be considered an error. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-07010010-01.html">Australian Tax Office (ATO) income for Child Support customers</a>.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Do not make any adjustments to the original reconciling income</li>
		<li>
Encourage the customer to lodge an amended tax return. The amended taxable income may be used to re-reconcile the estimate if it meets the requirements described in Table 9 ATO issues an amended taxable income</li>
		</ul>
<p>A change of assessment in special circumstances may also be an option. Where a customer makes an application, Child Support can only make a change to the assessment for a period up to 18 months before the application. For periods more than 18 months and up to 7 years the customer would need to apply to court for leave. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-03120010-01.html">Change of assessment enquiries</a>.</p>

<p>If a new financial year or Child Support Period is using/will use the incorrect income, the customer may be able to lodge a new estimate. This will not change the reconciled estimate but may change the ongoing assessment. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-03120010-01.html">Child Support estimates</a>.</p>

<p>If an ATO income is not available 12 months after the end of the estimate year, the estimate may be reconciled using a determined ATI.</p>

If needed, refer to a <a target="_blank" href="../utils/CustomerReferralGuidelines/Customer-Referral-Guidelines.html?estimate-review-reconciliation-specialised-estimates.html">Specialist Estimate Reconciliation Officer</a>.</p>

<p>If a clear error is found in the calculation of the determined income, this could potentially be corrected under the correcting errors process.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the customer will normally need to have lodged their actual income for the estimate year and have a satisfactory reason for the late lodgement, before an error correction would be considered.

<p><strong>Prior to estimate reconciliation</strong>, a customer or Child Support can update a YTD income. See the <a href="../separated-parents/277-07040000-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Amending_a_YTD_">Amending a YTD income</a> table.</p>

<p><strong>After estimate reconciliation</strong>, a customer cannot update a YTD income themselves. However, Child Support <strong>may</strong> update a YTD after reconciliation. When Child Support reviews a YTD to decide if it should be changed, this is called a Section 63AE YTD review.</p>

<p>If a YTD income is not accurate, the income used in the assessment after reconciliation may not reflect the customer’s actual income.</p>

<p>It is important to <strong>manage customers’ expectations</strong> about the potential outcomes of a YTD review. The review will not always result in a change to the assessment. Child Support must be satisfied that the YTD is inaccurate <strong>and</strong> that it is appropriate for a new YTD to be determined. If a new YTD is determined, it may not always change the assessment.</p>

<p>YTD reviews are done by Service Officers with specialist training.</p>

<p><strong>For Service Officers who are not trained to complete YTD Reviews</strong></p>

<p>Before referring to a specialist team, ask the customer&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
why they think the YTD income may be inaccurate; and</li>
		<li>
to provide evidence, if possible, to show what their actual income was in the YTD period (for example, payslips, payroll information or a letter from their employer/s showing dates and amounts of payments); and</li>
		<li>
to provide the evidence within an appropriate timeframe. Use the <a class="modal-link" href="../separated-parents/277-01010000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Make_an_effecti_Step03">Standard response times</a> as the maximum due date or an earlier date that customer has agreed to</li>
		</ul>
<p>Create and route an <strong>Auto Rec Review</strong> intray in accordance with the Customer Referral Guidelines, Estimate Reconciliations, ‘Review of YTD income amount and estimate reconciliation has occurred’.</p>

<p><strong>For Service Officers trained to complete YTD Reviews,</strong> see <a href="../separated-parents/277-07060020-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Section_63AE_YT">Table 21</a>.</p>

<p>Customers can object to the particulars of an assessment, including the ATI used in an estimate reconciliation.</p>

<p>When an estimate is reconciled, the ATI used in the assessment is affected by the YTD amount. A customer may object on the basis that the ATI is incorrect because the YTD amount is incorrect.</p>

<p>Considering an objection to the ATI used will include verifying the accuracy of the YTD amount.</p>

<p><strong>If the customer has already lodged an objection to the estimate reconciliation&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer may, but should <strong>not</strong> be encouraged to, withdraw the objection if a YTD review is also an option</li>
		<li>
a YTD review may still proceed without withdrawing the objection</li>

the customer may, but is not obliged to, withdraw their objection if the YTD review results in an amendment. This is because they may not agree with the YTD review outcome and/or they may be objecting to other aspects of the reconciliation</li>

<p>To request more information contact the estimating customer by phone. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-01010000-01.html">Contact with Child Support customers</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> in most circumstances, the customer must provide supporting information for the Section 63AE review themselves. In some circumstances, it may be appropriate to issue a Section 161 notice. For example, if it is not possible for the customer to obtain the required information from an employer themselves, sending a Section 161 notice may be appropriate. </p>

<p><strong>If phone contact is successful</strong>, ask the customer to provide the required information. The required information will vary from case to case, but could include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
why the YTD amount provided was incorrect</li>
		<li>
why the YTD was not updated earlier</li>
		<li>
evidence of the correct amount, such as&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
pay slips</li>
			<li>
a letter from their employer</li>
			<li>
payroll data</li>
			<li>
profit and loss statements from an accountant</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>Set a clear timeframe for the return of any required evidence. Make sure that the customer acknowledges the due date. In most cases, the due date will be in accordance with the <a class="modal-link" href="../separated-parents/277-01010000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Make_an_effecti_Step03">Standard response times</a> for customer contact. However, the response time may need to be different due to the specific circumstances of the customer. </p>

<p>Tell the customer the estimate will remain reconciled using the original YTD amount if the required evidence is not provided by the due date.</p>

<p><strong>If phone contact is unsuccessful</strong>, send a <a href="../separated-parents/277-30010400-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Create_a_CAL">Request for Client to Contact CSA (MX1-1)</a> letter. Allow the <a class="modal-link" href="../separated-parents/277-01010000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Make_an_effecti_Step03">Standard response time</a>. Add a notepad to the customer record. Document exactly what information is required from the customer and when it is due by.</p>

<p>When the due date has been reached for all requested information, <a href="../separated-parents/277-07060020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Section_63AE_YT_Step05">go to Step 5</a>.</p>

<p>Consider whether Child Support contributed to the YTD being incorrect.</p>

<p>Check all documentation on the original estimate and any other customer communication documents. Check for the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Why does the customer think that the YTD is incorrect?</li>
		<li>
Is there evidence that the customer notified of a different YTD amount or that they called back and provided updated YTD information?</li>
		<li>
Was the estimate accepted in error? For example, the customer was to provide YTD details however the estimate was accepted with a $0 YTD</li>
		<li>
Has the YTD been correctly recorded or updated?</li>
		<li>
Are there any keying errors? For example, customer advised their YTD was $41,000 and this was keyed as $14,000</li>
		<li>
Are there any other errors? For example, customer provided correct information but the Service Officer miscalculated the YTD or did not record the YTD </li>
		<li>
Does it appear that Child Support provided incorrect or incomplete information about which income must be included in a YTD?</li>
		<li>
In some cases, investigation may require accessing call recordings. Service Officers must discuss this with an SSO to determine if it is needed. If the call recording is needed, see <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-17081500-01.html">Call and screen recording - information and access</a></li>		</ul>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> an estimating customer may elect a new YTD amount for a year of income at any time before the reconciliation of their estimate(s) under (s63AC). However the customer may not have known that their YTD was inaccurate until the reconciliation occurred.</p>

<p>Service Officers must consider whether the estimating customer contacted within a reasonable time after receiving notification of the reconciliation.</p>

<p>Consider all the circumstances of the case to determine whether it is appropriate to exercise the discretion to determine a new YTD amount. Each case must be considered on its merits, but as a general rule Child Support will usually exercise the discretion if satisfied that&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the YTD amount is incorrect</li>
		<li>
Child Support contributed to the YTD amount being incorrect, and</li>
		<li>
customer contact about the YTD occurred within a reasonable time</li>
		</ul>
<p>Child Support <strong>must</strong> be satisfied that the YTD amount is incorrect before amending it. However, <strong>there may be circumstances that warrant the use of discretion if the other two conditions are not satisfied</strong>. For example, where Child Support did not contribute to the YTD being incorrect, it may still be appropriate to amend the YTD once the customer’s circumstances have been considered in their entirety. Consider the information provided by the customer and all other available evidence.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>A Service Officer accepts an estimate and the parent provides, in good faith, what they believe to be accurate information at the time. The YTD is not accurate, through no fault of CSA, and the estimate is later reconciled. The reconciliation results in a debt because the YTD was not correct. </p>

<p>The parent contacts us within a reasonable time regarding the reconciliation and explains that they lost their income information in a fire, which prevented them from providing an accurate YTD earlier. They were only recently able to obtain the necessary information from their employer. In these circumstances, despite no error made by CSA, it may be appropriate to amend the YTD.</p>
