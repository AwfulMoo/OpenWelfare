<p>This tool is used where a customer in exceptional circumstances needs to make a repayment but cannot access the internet (Online Account) or attend an Australia Post outlet. This would allow the customer to make a repayment towards their advance and subsequently, if eligible, apply for a new advance.</p>

<p>It is not a breach of customer privacy to receive this information verbally as it was being provided by the customer as part of their query. </p>

<p>The credit card details cannot be retrieved from the system. <strong>The card number and security code must not be written down.</strong> They must be immediately entered into the system. If the information cannot be entered into the Advance Payment service at the time of contact, the customer must be advised to call back at a later time.</p>

<p>With regard to call recording, special arrangements have been made so these calls are removed from the normal service and stored separately.</p>

<p>It is not possible to code a repayment that is greater than the outstanding balance of the advance payment.</p>

<p><strong>Problem&#58;</strong> Customer has an outstanding balance on their advance payment of $78.03. The Service Officer incorrectly rounds this amount up $78.05 and issues a receipt to the customer for this amount. However, the outstanding balance will not update when the Advance Payments workflow is run.</p>

<p><strong>Solution&#58;</strong> Do not round up the amount outstanding, or accept a repayment that is greater than the actual outstanding balance. In this example, the customer could repay the outstanding amount by a cheque for $78.03, or by cash of no more than $78.00. If cash of $78.00 is accepted, then there will still be $0.03 cents outstanding, which will be recovered from the next fortnightly payment. This is correct processing.</p>

		<ul>		<li>

If customer, pays <strong>less</strong> than the outstanding balance, update advance balance. Customer will not be able to claim a new advance using self-service channels as the current advance will still have an outstanding balance (4 cents).

		<li>
If customer pays <strong>more</strong> than outstanding balance, update advance balance. If the excess funds are <strong>less </strong>than $10 and customer has other advance payments of same type, reduce the balance by the excess funds. If no other current advance payments, <strong>DOC</strong> record to follow up within 28 days. If excess funds is <strong>more</strong> than $10, repay funds via the <strong>PYAJ</strong> screen and <strong>DOC</strong> record.

<div class="showcont">


<p>The Advance Payments workflow requires an ESSentials receipt number in order to update the outstanding balance of the advance payment. This means that the cash repayment needs to be recorded in ESSentials as soon as possible to enable the outstanding balance to be updated as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Delays in recording the receipt in ESSentials, and in updating the outstanding balance, can mean that further deductions are made from the customer's payments to repay the advance payment.</p>

<p><strong>Problem&#58;</strong> Customer had an outstanding advance payment of $420.00. They attended the Service Centre and repaid the amount, but this was not recorded in ESSentials until 2 days later. Another deduction was made from their fortnightly payment. The Service Officer was then unable to update the outstanding balance, as the balance was now lower than the amount repaid.</p>

<p><strong>Solution&#58;</strong> Record the repayment in ESSentials and update the outstanding balance of the advance payment as soon as possible after the cash is received. It is the responsibility of Service Centre staff to ensure that they have sufficient Service Officers with access to ESSentials receipting to enable this function to be undertaken in a timely manner.</p>

<div class="showcont">


<p>Repayment methods available for debts differ to those available for advance payments. The <strong>Australia Post Billpay arrangements that are in place for debt repayments cannot be used for the repayment of an advance payment</strong>. Debt repayments can be made using the Australia Post Billpay facility via the telephone or internet. This facility is not available for repaying an advance payment.</p>

<p>Advance payments can only be repaid by deduction from the customer's fortnightly payment, by cash/cheque repayment at the Service Centre, by credit/debit card using Centrelink Online services or Express Plus Centrelink mobile app or by taking a Post Billpay receipt into an Australia Post outlet.</p>

<p><strong>Example&#58;</strong> Customer contacts the Call Network to discuss options for repaying the advance payment. They are incorrectly advised of the BPAY® account number that is used for debt recovery, and uses this to make a payment directly from their bank account. However, this payment goes into an 'unidentified funds' register to await customer contact and the Call Centre or Service Centre to initiate an investigation into the repayment made via BPAY®.</p>

<p><strong>Solution&#58;</strong> Do not under any circumstances advise a customer to repay an advance payment using the BPAY® facilities assigned for debt recovery.</p>

<p>There are no provisions within the advance payment legislation to round cash repayments up or down due to the lack of 1 and 2 cent coins in Australia's currency.</p>

<p>This means that if a customer has an outstanding advance payment with a balance that is not a multiple of $0.05 the full amount cannot be repaid in cash. This will mean that after the repayment is recorded, the customer may still have an outstanding balance of less than $0.05. This is correct processing.</p>

<p>The amount will be recovered from their next fortnightly payment, and this may mean that a customer is not able to access a further advance payment until the full amount of the outstanding balance has been recovered. The customer may wish to reconsider if they want to proceed with the repayment if it will not enable them to apply for a new advance payment earlier.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> an outstanding Family Tax Benefit (FTB) advance payment balance of less than $0.05 will be disregarded when calculating entitlement for a new FTB advance payment.</p>

<p><strong>Problem&#58;</strong> Customer has an outstanding social security payment advance payment of $114.06. The Service Officer accepts $114.05 and issues an ESSentials (formerly Infolink) receipt for this amount. Then the Service Officer incorrectly records that $114.06 was the amount received in the Advance Payments workflow.</p>

<p><strong>Solution&#58;</strong> The amount recorded on the customer's record must be equal to the actual amount received and to the receipted amount. There are no rounding provisions available.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> this scenario may also arise where repayment has been accepted for more than the outstanding balance or there has been a delay in recording the receipt in ESSentials. In this case, systems may advise to record a different amount in the workflow to the amount of cash physically received and receipted. If this is the case, annotate the <strong>DOC</strong> with the Service First number and full details of the workaround undertaken.</p>

<p>In cases where a customer has more than 1 advance payment, and wishes to repay 1 of these in order to apply for another, the following workaround may assist with the rounding issue.</p>

<p><strong>Problem&#58;</strong> Customer has outstanding advance payments of $114.06 (advance 1) and $59.50 (advance 2) and wants to repay the oldest (advance 1) in order to apply for another advance.</p>

<p><strong>Solution&#58;</strong> The Service Officer accepts $114.10 and issues an ESSentials receipt for this amount. Then the Service Officer records that $114.06 was the amount received in the advance payments workflow for advance 1. They then run the workflow again and record that $0.04 was the amount received for advance 2. The same ESSentials receipt number can be used for both of these updates. The workflow must be run separately for each update.</p>

<p>Once the balance has been reduced to nil, the advance payment is 'closed' and no further changes can be made to the balance.</p>

<p><strong>Problem&#58;</strong> Customer attends a Service Centre to repay an outstanding advance to enable a new advance application to be granted. The Service Officer accepts the cash, issues the receipt, and uses the workflow to update the outstanding balance to nil. The Service Officer then processes a new advance payment application, which rejects because there were other reasons preventing the payment of an advance.</p>

<p>In an attempt to solve this, the Service Officer then returns the cash to the customer and cancels the receipt. The Service Officer then discovers that they are not able to restore the balance of the advance that was just repaid to its previous amount, as once the balance becomes nil no further alterations can be made.</p>

<p><strong>Solution&#58;</strong> Before accepting a cash repayment, ensure that there are no other issues affecting eligibility for an advance payment, in addition to the outstanding advance, that will prevent a new advance being granted. The customer may not wish to proceed with the cash repayment if it will not assist them to obtain another advance payment.</p>

<p>The customer makes a payment of $114.10. The Service Officer accepts this and issues an ESSentials receipt number for this amount.</p>

<p>However, the Service Officer records that $59.50 was the amount received in the Advance Payments workflow for advance 2. The Service Officer will need to run the Advance Payments workflow again and record $54.56 against advance 1, leaving a balance of $59.60. The same ESSentials receipt number is used for both of these updates.</p>

<p><strong>Solution&#58;</strong> Both advance payments will need to be modified to show the correct balances.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Advance 1&#58; payment to be recorded for $59.60 to leave a $0 balance</li>
		<li>
Advance 2&#58; negative payment of $-59.50 to be recorded to return the balance to the correct level</li>
		</ul>
<p>The workflow must be run separately for each activity.</p>

<p>When a cash payment is made to repay a debt to the Commonwealth, there are specific processes in place to 'clean up' any residual amounts of less than $0.05 that may still be outstanding. As the exact amount receipted in ESSentials for a debt repayment transfers across to the balance of the debt, no rounding of amounts less than $0.05 occurs at the time that the payment is being made.</p>

<p>There are no equivalent processes in place to 'clean up' or remove the effect of any residual amounts of less than $0.05 that may still be outstanding after a cash repayment has been made for an advance payment. These amounts are to be recovered from the following fortnightly payment.</p>

<p>For <strong>FTB advance payments</strong> only, an outstanding advance balance of less than $0.05 is disregarded when calculating the maximum advance payment amount available to a customer but the amount is still recovered from the customer's next payment of FTB Part A.</p>

<p>For social security payment advance payments, any outstanding amount (even where less than $0.05) is taken into account in the calculation of the available amount when determining entitlement to a new advance</p>

<p><strong>Example&#58;</strong> Customer on maximum rate DSP wishes to claim another advance. Maximum advance amount was $1192.80 and customer was previously paid an advance of $795.00. This left an amount of $397.80 still available. Customer has repaid all but $0.04 of the first advance. Available amount today is only $397.76 as amount is reduced by outstanding balance of previous amount. As this is more than the minimum amount of $397.60, customer can be paid advance amount. (Rates current at March 2014).</p>
