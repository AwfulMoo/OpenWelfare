Deduct the number of weeks from the full timing limit for the relevant AQF level, as below&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Secondary course / Preparatory course / Certificate II / Certificate III / Certificate IV / Diploma / Advanced Diploma or Associate Degree&#58; <strong>104 weeks for full time study for each level of the AQF</strong></li>
			<li>
Bachelor Degree&#58; <strong>156 weeks for full time study</strong></li>
			<li>
Bachelor Honours Degree / Graduate Certificate / Graduate Diploma&#58; <strong>104 weeks for full time study</strong></li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Susie is studying part time for a Certificate III course. However, Susie also received JETCCFA for 66 weeks of part time study for a prior Certificate III course.</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Calculate weeks of prior JETCCFA funding at full time equivalent. As Susie previously studied part time, the number of weeks are divided by 2, i.e. 66 weeks part time divided by 2 is equivalent to 33 weeks full time<br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> where the calculation of full time equivalent does not result in a whole number, the figure can be rounded down.</li>
			<li>
Minus the JETCCFA full time equivalent weeks already received from the total number of ACCS (Transition to Work) funding for this type of study (104 – 33 = 71)</li>
			<li>
Susie has 71 weeks full time ACCS (Transition to Work) funding</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>A determination will need to be assessed as to whether the JETCCFA weeks will affect the ACCS (Transition to Work) reassessment and need to be deducted. Where the number of weeks already received for JETCCFA will not result in ACCS (Transition to Work) entitlement exceeding the study time limit, the JETCCFA weeks do not need to be deducted from the Grant Weeks, because the combined grant weeks are less than the maximum time limit for the activity.</p>

<p>For example, if the customer is due to finish their Cert II course in 6 weeks' time, yet had previously had 4 weeks of JETCCFA, the amount of JETCCFA will not have any bearing on the ACCS (Transition to Work) timing limit.</p>

<p>When ACCS (Transition to Work) a review may be scheduled for Study, if the course is in excess of 12 months duration, a review is required to confirm the customer is progressing in their study</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> <strong>no reviews will be undertaken pending system enhancements to allocate these reviews and process outcomes.</strong></p>

<p>However, if there are concerns the customer is no longer undertaking their ACCS (Transition to Work) activity, Service Officers can request evidence to confirm they are still participating in the activity. If this is not provided, ACCS (Transition to Work) can be cancelled on the basis the customer is no longer meeting activity requirements for the payment. Staff should follow the process relevant to ending an activity.</p>
