<p>If the customer has advised they are sharing accommodation with a person who is not an immediate family member and is aged 16 years or over, the <strong>Sharer Details</strong> must be completed.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> as sharer details cannot be updated once the Living Arrangements question set has been finalised, care must be taken when coding sharer details to make sure all information is correct in the first instance.</p>

<p>In the majority of cases, the Customer First Living Arrangements or Change in Contact Details workflows will be used. There are limited circumstances when it will be necessary to manually code the details, for example Age Pension claims.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Do you share your accommodation with anyone other than an immediate family member who is 16 years of age or older?&#58;</strong> field, Yes</li>
