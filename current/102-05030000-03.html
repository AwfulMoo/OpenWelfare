<p>If the customer has advised they are sharing accommodation with a person who is not an immediate family member and is aged 16 years or over, the <strong>Sharer Details</strong> must be completed.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> as sharer details cannot be updated once the Living Arrangements question set has been finalised, care must be taken when coding sharer details to make sure all information is correct in the first instance.</p>

<p>In the majority of cases, the Customer First Living Arrangements or Change in Contact Details workflows will be used. There are limited circumstances when it will be necessary to manually code the details, for example Age Pension claims. To complete coding manually in Customer Record, see <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-05030000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Manual_coding_o_Step">Table 4</a>.</p>

<p>When using the Customer First Workflow, on the <strong>Sharer Details (SDQ)</strong> page complete the following fields&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Do you share your accommodation with anyone other than an immediate family member who is 16 years of age or older?&#58;</strong> field, Yes</li>
		<li>

		<li>
<strong>Date commenced sharing&#58;</strong> field, record date customer commenced sharing</li>

<strong>Relationship to You&#58;</strong> field, this question is asked to establish how the customer sees the relationship between themselves and the sharer. Select the relevant options&#58;</li>

'<strong>BGF</strong>' - Boyfriend/Girlfriend</li>

the customer is not partnered and,</li>
		<li>
they shared accommodation with a person who is not an immediate family member and is over the age of 16</li>

<p>If the customer is sharing with more than one person, the questions must be asked for <strong>all</strong> sharers and responses recorded accordingly. There are 5 questions that must have responses recorded as well as a safety concern question.

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> customers only in receipt of Family Tax Benefit, Child Care Subsidy, or Carer Allowance - the system will not automatically navigate to the Living Arrangements question set following an update to the customer’s accommodation details.

<strong>SDQ</strong> - Sharer Details question - is used to determine whether a customer is sharing with anyone 16 years of age or older who is not an immediate family member</li>

<strong>SHD</strong> - Sharer Details - is used to add a sharer, correct sharer details, end a sharing arrangement and delete sharer details</li>
		<li>
<strong>SDS</strong> - Sharer Details Summary - displays all current sharers or those that have been added to the customer's record, except those that have been end-dated</li>
