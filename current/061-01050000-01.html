<p>This document explains the procedure for a Service Officer to follow to decide if a customer is eligible for a discretionary portability extension. If a customer or child is outside Australia and is unable to return to Australia because of unforeseen circumstances, they may be able to continue to receive payment for a specific period. This is known as a discretionary portability extension.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A discretionary decision can only be granted when the customer is still qualified for their payment.</p>

<p>It is important to ensure that correct information is given to the customer regarding a potential discretionary portability extension. Not providing the information or giving incorrect information can be financially damaging to the customer and may lead to a claim under the Compensation for Detriment caused by Defective Administration (CDDA) scheme. Certain Service Officers in Centrelink International Services (CIS) are the only staff with the delegation to make portability extension decisions.</p>

<p>If a person receiving a payment under the New Zealand 10 year residence exemption has a break in entitlement, their payment cannot be restored at all.</p>

<p>When a customer or their nominee or agent, contacts Services Australia about extending their period of portability, ensure current contact details are recorded.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Age Pension, and Disability Support Pension (DSP) in some limited circumstances, may be paid indefinitely outside Australia, however after 26 weeks, the rate is generally paid according to the person’s Australian <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-06030000-01.html">Working Life Residence</a> (WLR). This is known as a proportional rate. See <a href="../australians-overseas/061-02010020-01.html">Australian pensions paid outside Australia, the proportional rate</a>.</p>

<p>From 1 July 2021, portability extensions of the non-proportional rate overseas are available for&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Age Pension (including when paid by virtue of the New Zealand (NZ) Agreement), and</li>
		<li>
DSP (for customers whose DSP is portable indefinitely overseas)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Age Pension and DSP customers may be eligible for an extension of the non-proportional rate for longer than 26 weeks overseas when they cannot return to Australia due to unforeseen circumstances, such as a natural disaster or serious illness of the customer or family member.</p>

<p>Age Pension paid by virtue of the NZ Agreement has limited portability. A customer receiving Age Pension by virtue of the NZ Agreement may also be considered for a portability extension if they are in a third country and unable to return to New Zealand or Australia after 26 weeks.</p>

<p>A new extension reason of ‘public health crisis affecting Australia or the country in which the person is located or both’ is available for Age Pension and some DSP recipients only. This reason <strong>only applies to pensioners with unlimited portability</strong> who are prevented from returning to Australia by a public health crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>For limited portability payments, the relevant event must have occurred or begun during the period of approved absence to determine a longer period. For Age Pension and DSP (with unlimited portability) customers, the relevant event must have occurred or begun during the first 26 weeks of the absence.</p>

<p>If the relevant event is political or social unrest, industrial action or war, then the payment recipient must not be willingly involved or a willing participant.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">

<p>Payment portability periods may be extended under section 1218AB Social Security Act (SSA) for the period of a family member's overseas posting for a DSP customer if they are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
severely disabled, and</li>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Duration_of_ext">Duration of extension</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>An extension must be to a specific date. For income support payments, there is no limit on the period, but it should be the minimum time before the customer expects to be able to return to Australia and should generally not exceed 3 months.</p>

<p>For Family Tax Benefit (FTB), Child Care Subsidy (CCS) (parent overseas), Parental Leave Pay (PPL), Dad and Partner Pay (DAP) and Double Orphan Pension (DOP), the maximum extension period is 3 years.</p>

<p>For CCS there is no child only portability. Where a child is overseas with the parent, an extension may be considered. However, when a child has not attended child care for a continuous period of 14 weeks, enrolment in child care will be automatically ceased. Extensions do not override this. Any amounts paid since the child last attended child care will be recovered from the service. Consider the interaction of any possible extension and the entitlement to CCS. If the child will return to care before the 14 weeks are up an extension will be beneficial. If the child will not attend for a continuous period of 14 weeks, any extension will be recovered from the service who may pass the costs to the customer. An extension of CCS cannot go beyond a total of 14 weeks absence from care. The 14 week non-attendance period may have started before the child left Australia. See <a href="../families/007-17103134-01.html">Absences for Child Care Subsidy (CCS) and Additional Child Care Subsidy (ACCS)</a>.</p>

<p>A person receiving payment under the <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-06010030-01.html">New Zealand 10 year residence exemption</a> can only receive the payment for a maximum period of 6 months. If a person paid under this exemption is assessed as qualifying for a portability extension, the extension cannot take the payment beyond the 6 months total period of payment.</p>

<p>If the customer is still unable to return before the agreed end date of the extension, they can request a further extension.</p>

<p><strong>What happens at the end of the extension period?</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
If a person remains outside Australia after the end of their extension period and their payment ceases, the payment (excluding CCS) can be restored if they return to Australia within 13 weeks of their payment ceasing. However, if the person was receiving a Transitional rate of pension they will lose entitlement to that rate and will be paid under the new rules upon restoration</li>
		<li>
If a recipient is receiving Age Pension or DSP and has indefinite portability, their payment will reduce (proportionalise) based on their Australian <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-06030000-01.html">Working Life Residence</a> (WLR) and/or will lose entitlement to pension supplements or add-ons, e.g. Rent Assistance, Incentive Allowance or Pharmaceutical Allowance</li>
		<li>
If a CCS customer remains outside of Australia after the end of their extension period, their CCS will decrease to a zero rate. Once the customer returns to Australia, their CCS entitlement will reassess. Where a child has no CCS entitlement for 52 consecutive weeks, CCS will cancel with status reason N52. The customer would need to lodge a new claim for any child where the CCS has cancelled</li>
