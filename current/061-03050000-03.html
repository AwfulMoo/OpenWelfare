<p>Check to see if the customer's payment can have continuation of payment on their return to Australia.</p>

<p>If the customer has remained outside Australia after their payment has stopped for exceeding their maximum portability period, their payment can generally be restored from the date of return to Australia if they have returned to Australia within 13 weeks of their payment suspending. </p>

<p><strong>Special Benefit (SpB)</strong> customers should contact Services Australia on their return to Australia if their payment stopped while they were overseas and has not been automatically restored. </p>

<p><strong>Pensioner Education Supplement (PES)</strong> can only be restored if the qualifying payment is able to be restored and only by the appropriate Processing Services.</p>

<p>For information on restoration of PES, see <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-10040200-03.html">Restoration of Pensioner Education Supplement (PES), ABSTUDY PES and Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) PES payments</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Family Tax Benefit (FTB) and Double Orphan Pension (DOP)</strong> will generally be automatically restored on a customer's/child's return to Australia when that return is within 13 weeks of payment being cancelled for a portability reason. If the customer/child returns to Australia more than 13 weeks after their payments cancelled due to portability, then payment will need to be re-claimed. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> if FTB cancels because of income support payments stopping and is eligible to be restored. FTB should be restored first.</p>

<p>For more information on restoration of these payments, see&#58;</p>

<p><strong>Child Care Subsidy (CCS)</strong> will reassess on a customer's return to Australia. A child's absence from Australia does not affect CCS. However, if a child has 14 continuous weeks of non-attendance at child care, their enrolment automatically ceases and payment may be recovered from the customer. If a child has no entitlement for 52 consecutive weeks, CCS would cancel N52. The customer would need to lodge a new claim for any child where this occurs.</p>

<p><strong>Some reasons for restoring payment without a claim include&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Payment was suspended or cancelled incorrectly for example&#58; the customer was already back in Australia</li>
		<li>
Payment was suspended or cancelled waiting on more information, but on receipt of that information the customer was entitled to payment while outside Australia</li>
		<li>
The customer was eligible for a discretionary extension for example, they were hospitalised for the period between cancellation and return to Australia. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> this decision must be made by CIS</li>
		<li>
The customer has regained qualification and/or payability within 13 weeks of the suspension. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> generally, arrears may only be paid from the date of the customer's return to Australia</li>
		<li>
Payment will only continue from the date of entitlement which is usually the date of return to Australia</li>
		</ul>
<p>For more information see <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-10040000-01.html">Restoration of payments (CLK)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>A new claim will generally be required if the customer returns to Australia&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
and their income support payment is cancelled</li>
		<li>
and payment is FTB or DOP and the return to Australia is more than 13 weeks after the portability cancellation</li>
		<li>
and payment is CCS and the return to Australia is more than 52 consecutive weeks since a child has had any entitlement to CCS</li>
		<li>
after exceeding their portability period and their ongoing qualification is in doubt</li>
		<li>
after loss of qualification or payability for payment for reasons other than exceeding their maximum portability period, for example</li>
			<ul>			<li>
JobSeeker Payment (JSP) customer leaves Australia to live overseas then changes their mind and returns to Australia</li>
			<li>
Carer Allowance (CA) customer leaves Australia under the respite provisions (without their care receiver) and CA is cancelled before the maximum portability period is reached because the allowable 63 days respite have been exceeded</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>An abridged claim may be used depending on the rules applicable to the relevant payment type.</p>
