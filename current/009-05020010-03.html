<LI>the care receiver is aged 16 years or older at time of claim <STRONG>and</STRONG> the carer re-claims for the same care receiver within 26 weeks of CP and/or CA cancellation</LI>
<LI>the care receiver was previously assessed with a terminal illness, with a life expectancy of not substantially longer than 3 months</LI>

<P>Although the re-use provisions may apply, Service Officers must be satisfied that the carer meets the daily care and constant care requirements.</P>
<P>Only seek clarification of the provision of care if there are circumstances indicating the carer is <STRONG>not</STRONG> providing constant or daily care. In these instances, Service Officers must determine whether a person is qualified for CP and/or CA based on all the relevant material provided, and that <STRONG>all</STRONG> of the qualification criteria have been satisfied.

<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Question 11 on the SA332(a) consists of 3 sub-questions 11.1, 11.2 and 11.3.</P>
<P>If the THP has indicated:</P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Y</STRONG> at question 11.1, all correct answers at 11.2, and <STRONG>N</STRONG> at question 11.3, this cannot be recorded on the <STRONG>ADCF</STRONG> screen. An error message will appear: E23DL - at least 1 B2 response must be <STRONG>N</STRONG> if cognitively impaired. In this scenario the response to question 11.1 must be changed to a '<STRONG>N</STRONG>', this has no implications on the overall scoring regime for the ADAT</LI>
<LI><STRONG>N</STRONG> at question 11.1 and selected <STRONG>Y</STRONG> to 1 or more incorrect answers at 11.2, the THP must be contacted by either phone or fax to clarify the inconsistent responses</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Y</STRONG> at question 11.1, provided answers at 11.2 <STRONG>and also</STRONG> indicated they were <STRONG>not able</STRONG> to administer the Abbreviated Mental Test at 11.3, this cannot be recorded on the <STRONG>ADCF</STRONG> screen. An error message will appear 'E233DL - cannot enter responses to B2 if unable to administer test'. In this scenario the responses to question 11.2 must be disregarded and the response to 11.3 must be used</LI>
<LI>no answers at 11.1, but answered questions at 11.2 <STRONG>or</STRONG> they were unable to administer the Abbreviated Mental Test at 11.3, accept that the response at 11.1 would be <STRONG>Y</STRONG></LI></UL>
<P>If the ADAT produces a qualifying score and there are unanswered questions that have no bearing on the carer's qualification for CP or CA, do not contact the carer or THP, and document this on the carer's record.</P></DIV>
