<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Medicare eligibility for prisoners</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Healthcare for prisoners is the responsibility of the relevant state or territory governments. However, a prisoner’s eligibility for Medicare does not cease when they enter prison. As Australian residents, prisoners meet the definition of ‘eligible person’ under subsection 3(1) of the Health Insurance Act 1973, which governs Medicare. Prisoners who meet the definition under subsection 3(1) may be eligible for Medicare enrolment or the reissue/replacement of a Medicare card.</p>

<p>However, while prisoners may be considered an eligible person for Medicare purposes, they are generally not entitled to Medicare benefits unless in exceptional circumstances. Health services for prisoners are covered by the relevant state or territory governments.</p>

<p>Exceptions apply where a prisoner is on day release or home detention, and medical treatment has been sought by the prisoner without that treatment having been provided, arranged or required to be provided by the prison authorities.  In this situation, Medicare benefits are payable. To obtain benefits, the prisoner must be assessed as eligible for Medicare.</p>

<p>Services Australia will receive Medicare number requests, or replacement or reissued Medicare card requests, for prisoners where they require access to Highly Specialised Drugs whilst incarcerated or prior to their release from prison.</p>

<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Access to Highly Specialised Drugs under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS)</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Under PBS, prisoners can have access to medications listed under the Highly Specialised Drugs programme. This requires the treating prescriber to contact the agency (on a designated phone line for health professionals) for authority approval to prescribe the medicine. To obtain approval, a prisoner must have a valid Medicare number.</p>

<p>Prisoners may not know their Medicare number or if their number is still valid. Medical practitioners and pharmacists can contact the agency (on a designated phone line for health professionals) to confirm Medicare eligibility for a prisoner and obtain the Medicare number.</p>

<p>Where the Medicare card is valid (meaning it has not expired as per the most recent card issued in CDMS), the medical practitioner or pharmacist will confirm the number and no further action will be required.</p>

<p>Where the Medicare card is expired (card number no longer valid in CDMS), the health professional will be advised that the prisoner does not have a valid Medicare number and the prisoner will need to submit a request for their Medicare number to be re-issued.  This is consistent with the standard policy for all Medicare customers. A Medicare enrolment application form will need to be completed and submitted with supporting documents to confirm their identity and eligibility. In situations identity documents can’t be provided, a letter from the prison, on prison letterhead, which confirms the prisoner’s identity is required.</p>

<p>Where a prisoner has <strong>never been enrolled</strong> in Medicare, they must complete a Medicare enrolment application form and provide a letter from the prison, on prison letterhead, which confirms the prisoner’s identity along with identity and eligibility documents. Eligibility must be confirmed before they can be enrolled.</p>

<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Releasing a prisoner’s Medicare card number</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Service Officers can only release Medicare card numbers to health professionals who have contacted the agency by calling either Medicare Provider enquiries or the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme Improved Monitoring of Entitlements (IME) Enquiry line via the PBS general enquiries line following existing processes. Information for health professionals can be found on the Services Australia website. The <a href="../your-health/011-19012231-05.html">Resources</a> page has a list of all contact details.</p>

<p>Medicare numbers for prisoners cannot be released to a third party, such as staff from Correctional Services facilities unless verbal consent has been obtained from the prisoner at the time of the phone call.</p>

<p>Information can only be provided to a third party without the prisoner’s verbal consent where it is confirmed they hold <a target="_blank" href="../your-health/011-40030000-01.html">Power of Attorney (POA), have a Guardianship and/or Administrative Order or are registered as an Authorised Representative for Medicare</a> purposes. This is consistent with the current Medicare policy for all Medicare customers.</p>

<p>Any forms or written requests (other than a legal POA, Guardianship, Administrative Orders, or a Medicare Authorised Representative arrangement) giving authority for Medicare to provide prisoner information to Prison Correctional Staff <strong>must not</strong> be actioned and notated in CDMS.</p>

<p>Prisoners may call the Medicare general enquiries line to obtain their Medicare number and/or request a replacement card (however, this may be difficult for a prisoner due to phone restrictions during incarceration). The <a href="../your-health/011-19012231-05.html">Resources</a> page has a link to the Medicare general enquiries line.</p>

<p>Where a prisoner cannot contact the agency themselves, a Medicare enrolment application form will need to be completed and submitted with a letter provided by the prison on prison letterhead.</p>

<p>Prisoners must submit a Medicare enrolment application form with a letter issued by the prison on prison letterhead which confirms the prisoner’s identity. If the <a href="../your-health/011-19012231-01.html#bp01_L2GT_Prisoner_has_ne">prisoner has never been enrolled in Medicare</a>, eligibility documents will also need to be provided. The Medicare enrolment application form (MS004 or 3101) and all required documents can be returned by email or post. Details can be found on the form. The <a href="../your-health/011-19012231-05.html">Resources</a> page has a link to the form.</p>

<p>As the current Medicare enrolment form (MS004) may not necessarily meet the needs of prisoners, authority from Medicare Public Eligibility - National Office has been given to Correctional Services Officers to submit the previous version of the form Medicare enrolment form (3101) until otherwise advised by the agency. This form is no longer available online, however has been made available to Correctional Services Officers through separate correspondence.</p>

<p>Once the enrolment application has been assessed and processed, a valid Medicare card will be sent to the prisoner via the address outlined on the application form. This may be either the prison address or the prisoner’s preferred mailing address. However, if the prisoner is enrolled on a family card, refer to additional information under <a href="../your-health/011-19012231-01.html#bp01_L2GT_Prisoner_enroll">Prisoner enrolled on a family Medicare card</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander prisoners may complete either the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander enrolment and amendment form (MS018), or the Medicare enrolment form, however a cover letter from the prison on prison letterhead must also be provided confirming the prisoner’s identity.

<p>Where a prisoner requests a Medicare card to be sent to a prison address (as per address notated on the Medicare enrolment form) and they are enrolled on a Medicare card with other people, in most cases they will need to be copied or transferred onto a card of their own.  They will use this card during the term of their incarceration. Examples of when a prisoner should be either copied or transferred is outlined below&#58;</p>

<p><strong>Enrolled with other adults&#58;</strong></p>

<p>A prisoner’s Medicare card <strong>cannot be sent to a prison address</strong> if other adult family members are enrolled on the same card. This includes people aged 15 years and over.</p>

<p>If the prisoner has not requested to be transferred or it cannot be confirmed if they wish to be transferred to their own card, they must be <strong>copied</strong> onto their own card.</p>

<p><strong>Enrolled with children (under the age of 15 years)&#58;</strong></p>

<p>Where the prisoner is the only adult on the Medicare card, but is enrolled with their children (under the age of 15 years), who are enrolled onto both the prisoners card and another card, the prisoners card (that includes their children) can be sent to the prison address.</p>

<p>In this instance, the prisoner does not need to be copied or transferred onto their own card.</p>

<p>If the children were only enrolled on the prisoner’s card (and they were not enrolled on another card as well), the prisoners Medicare card (which includes his/her children) must <strong>not</strong> be sent to the prison address.</p>

<p>The prisoner must be <strong>copied</strong> from the card they share with the children to their own card. The children cannot be included on the Medicare card being sent to the prison.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
only where children are enrolled on more than one Medicare card can the prisoner remain on a Medicare card with their children and have the card sent to the prison address. The prison address cannot be recorded as the mailing address for the children if they are <strong>only</strong> enrolled on one Medicare card with the prisoner</li>
		<li>
where a prisoner has indicated all family members and a mailing address <strong>other</strong> than the prison address on the Medicare enrolment application form, the prisoner does not need to be copied to their own card</li>
