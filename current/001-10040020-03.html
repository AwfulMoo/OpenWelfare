<p>The effect of the disaster/emergency on the job seeker's capacity to meet their compulsory requirements should be considered.</p>

<p>Factors may include, but are not limited to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
how the job seeker was personally affected</li>
		<li>
impacts on their primary residence or action the job seeker needed to take to make their property safe</li>
		<li>
transport and accessibility issues in the area</li>
		<li>
impacts on care arrangements for children</li>
		<li>
impacts on communication networks</li>
		<li>
involvement in a recovery effort through a registered organisation, and</li>
		<li>
effect of the disaster/emergency on their provider or the location of a requirement</li>
		</ul>
<p>If appropriate, an <a href="../job-seekers/001-09120000-01.html">exemption from mutual obligation requirements</a> may need to be considered.</p>

<p>Where an exemption is granted, any outstanding compliance action is automatically finalised by background processing and the Employment Services System will automatically remove any demerits or penalties accrued over the period of the exemption.</p>

<p>The <strong>Circumstances Impacting Compliance</strong> screen should be reviewed and any job seeker circumstances updated. For more information, see <a href="../job-seekers/001-10050000-01.html">Circumstances impacting capacity to comply with compulsory requirement</a>.</p>

<p>Once the compliance action is complete, if the job seeker needs immediate social work crisis intervention, a general referral may be appropriate. For more information, see <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-12010000-01.html">Social work service referral</a>.</p>

<p>When a job seeker has been personally affected by a natural disaster or declared emergency, the job seeker's statement should be accepted as sufficient evidence of their circumstances and the impact this had at the time of the requirement, unless there is reason to doubt the validity of their statement.</p>

<p>Providers are responsible for notifying and managing reconnection requirements when a mutual obligation failure or work refusal failure has been committed, and notifying Services Australia when the conditions have been met to lift a participation suspension.</p>

<p>Job seekers affected by a natural disaster or declared emergency who have an outstanding participation suspension are required to contact their provider as soon as possible to discuss any impacts on their capacity to comply.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the job seeker is due to report but is unable to contact their provider because of impacts affecting the provider site, the job seeker should be referred to the Department of Education, Skills and Employment for assistance.</p>

<p>When contact with the provider occurs, providers may decide a reconnection requirement will not be notified due to provider or other external circumstances. When a reconnection requirement has already been notified, the provider will consider unexpected changes to personal or local circumstances, including site closures, and whether it is still appropriate to maintain the participation suspension until the job seeker meets the reconnection requirement.</p>

<p>When a reconnection requirement is not, or no longer, required this is recorded in the Employment Services System (ESS), finalising the suspension report. An electronic transaction is sent to Services Australia and the participation suspension is automatically lifted.</p>

<p>Providers have responsibility for advising the Department of Education, Skills and Employment when local conditions are affecting provider sites. The Department of Education, Skills and Employment are responsible for identifying job seekers with current participation suspensions from areas affected by a natural disaster or declared emergency. The Department of Education, Skills and Employment may bulk finalise outstanding participation suspensions when impacts are more widely spread. When this occurs, Services Australia are notified of any action taken.</p>

<p>Services Officers do not have authority to manually lift participation suspensions unless directed to do so by the Compliance Framework Team, following activation of contingency arrangements by the Department of Education, Skills and Employment.</p>

<p>When the provider has notified a Capability Assessment requirement, the job seeker must contact Services Australia to arrange a Capability Assessment. When a Capability Assessment is outstanding, the job seeker must be referred to the Participation Solutions Team (PST). Generally, the Capability Assessment should be completed at the time of initial contact. Any impacts the natural disaster or declared emergency are likely to have on the job seeker's capacity to meet their current requirements on an ongoing basis should be considered and recorded during the Capability Assessment.</p>

<p>When the job seeker is due to report and it is not possible or appropriate to complete the Capability Assessment due to the natural disaster or declared emergency, the PST-skilled Service Officer may ask the job seeker to call back as soon as possible before or on the next reporting day to complete the assessment.</p>

<p>The job seeker has met the reconnection requirement to arrange a Capability Assessment once the purpose of the Capability Assessment has been explained and privacy provisions have been read. On the <strong>Capability Assessment</strong> page, the PST-skilled Service Officer (WNPPD) must select the '<strong>Can't conduct assessment today</strong>' option and use the <strong>Save and Exit</strong> workflow to record the appropriate reason. The job seeker will then be able to finalise their current reporting, however, a contact trigger will prevent further payment until the Capability Assessment is completed.</p>

<p>For more information about recording that a Capability Assessment cannot be completed during contact with a job seeker, see <a href="../job-seekers/001-18030203-03.html">Capability Assessments</a>.</p>

<p>The impact of the natural disaster or declared emergency on the job seeker's capacity to comply, including capacity to make prior contact, should be considered as part of a compliance investigation.</p>

<p>Where the Department of Education, Skills and Employment have started contingency arrangements, penalty reports for mutual obligation failures are ended.</p>

<p>Where a compliance penalty investigation for a mutual obligation failure is already active, priority should be given to finalising these compliance investigations. Job seekers are unable to finalise reporting until a determination has been made about the failures. Where the job seeker has been affected by the natural disaster or declared emergency, rejection of the financial penalty is appropriate under contingency arrangements. When a decision is made to reject a failure because of a disaster/emergency, the rejection code '<strong>ERB</strong>' -Disastrous event or severe weather conditions - unable to comply, should be recorded.</p>

<p>When an unemployment failure or work refusal failure is preventing the job seeker from reporting and they have been impacted by a natural disaster or declared emergency, these failures will still require investigation. Services Australia may temporarily lift the contact trigger allowing the job seeker to report. In the <strong>Participation Compliance</strong> workflow, the <strong>Save and Exit</strong> option '<strong>Unable to complete on day of contact</strong>' must be used to record the reason the compliance investigation cannot be completed. This save and exit reason will temporarily remove the contact trigger on the day of contact only, and will reinstate the trigger the next day.</p>

<p>When the job seeker is not due to report and they have contacted about an active work refusal failure or unemployment failure, the contact trigger does not need to be temporarily removed. Tell the job seeker to call back as soon as possible before or on their reporting day to discuss the non-compliance. If the emergency is affecting the report day, the contact trigger may then be temporarily removed.</p>

<p>When payment is cancelled due to persistent mutual obligation failures, an unemployment failure or work refusal failure, a post-cancellation preclusion period prevents job seekers who reclaim from immediately returning to payment. When an unemployment failure occurred before claim, the new claim start date is affected by an unemployment preclusion period.</p>

<p>Waiver and hardship provisions do not apply during a post cancelation non-payment period or unemployment preclusion period.</p>

<p>If the job seeker requests assistance due to hardship, often the most appropriate action is to <a target="_blank" href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-11040000-03.html">refer the customer to a welfare agency</a>.</p>

<p>A <a target="_blank" href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-12010000-01.html">referral for immediate social work crisis intervention</a> may also be appropriate.</p>

<p>Outstanding NARs are automatically finalised when an exemption from mutual obligation requirements is recorded and extends 3 or more working days into the future.</p>

<p>When a NAR is outstanding, Community Development Program (CDP) participants must be advised to contact their provider after all other outstanding compliance action has been finalised.</p>

<p>When provider contact occurs, the provider will consider if a re-engagement appointment is required&#58; If a re-engagement appointment is&#58;</p>

required, payment will automatically restore after the CDP participant complies with this requirement</li>
		<li>

<p>Once payment is restored, the CDP participant will be able to finalise any outstanding reporting requirements.</p>

<p>If the provider is unavailable because of the disaster or emergency, the CDP participant should be referred to the Department of Education, Skills and Employment for assistance.</p>

<p>When the Department of Education, Skills and Employment has made a decision that all outstanding NARs in an affected area will be finalised, a bulk update will be arranged by that department. Services Australia Service Officers should not individually finalise NARs for affected CDP participants.</p>

<p>The assessment of outstanding failures for CDP participants who are personally affected by or are assisting with the recovery effort through a registered organisation should be given priority. This includes CDP participants who have a contact trigger or an <a href="../job-seekers/001-10080000-01.html">automatic payment suspension (participation (APA) suspension)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Participation suspensions</strong></p>

<p>Participation Solutions Team (PST)-skilled Services Officers are responsible for lifting a participation (APA) suspension for CDP participants affected by a natural disaster or declared emergency once contact is established and they agree to re-engage. When the PST-skilled Service Officer determines re-engagement is not possible or appropriate, payment may also be restored.</p>

<p>For more information, see <a href="../job-seekers/001-10090050-01.html">Finalising Community Development Program (CDP) re-engagement requirements</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Failure investigations</strong></p>

<p>If a CDP participant was unable to comply with a requirement because of a natural disaster or declared emergency, their verbal statement provides the required level of evidence to make a determination of reasonable excuse. The impact of the disaster/emergency is also likely to have affected the CDP participant's ability to contact prior to an appointment or activity.</p>

<p>When the failure event date was before the disaster/emergency and the CDP participant has been personally affected by the disaster/emergency, consideration should be given to the impacts of applying the failure given the CDP participant's current circumstances. In these cases, discretion may be used to reject the failure.</p>

<p>Rejecting a failure as a result of a disaster/emergency</p>

<p>When a decision is made to reject a failure because of a disaster/emergency, the rejection code '<strong>ERB</strong>' - Disastrous event or severe weather conditions - unable to comply, should be recorded.</p>

<p>When a decision is made to reject a failure that occurred before the disaster/emergency, record free text information to advise the provider the failure was rejected because the CDP participant was personally affected by the disaster/emergency and the short-term benefits of applying the failure would not have long-term benefits.</p>

<p>Sensitivity should be shown when a CDP participant's capacity to re-engage is affected by the disaster or emergency, including when a provider's premises is affected.</p>

<p>CDP participants who are unable to return to an activity because of a disaster/emergency should be advised to speak with their provider as soon as possible.</p>

<p>When a compliance investigation, including a Comprehensive Compliance Assessment (CCA), identifies a CDP participant's capacity to comply with mutual obligation requirements has been affected by a disaster/emergency, an exemption from their mutual obligation requirements should be considered.</p>

<p>See&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<a href="../job-seekers/001-09120030-01.html">Exempting a job seeker from mutual obligation requirements due to special circumstances</a>, or</li>
		<li>
<a href="../job-seekers/001-09120090-01.html">Mutual obligation requirements exemptions during disasters</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>If appropriate, an <a href="../job-seekers/001-09120000-01.html">exemption from mutual obligation requirements</a> should be considered. If an exemption has been granted, a no re-engagement code of '<strong>RNH</strong>' - No re-engagement, current exemption, should be recorded if required.</p>

<p>If the exemption from mutual obligation requirements will end&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
within the next 14 days, re-engagement is required</li>
		<li>
more than 14 days in the future, re-engagement is not required</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the provider's premises are not impacted by the disaster or emergency and the CDP participant has not been granted an exemption from mutual obligation requirements, the impact of the disaster/emergency should still be considered. This will determine if it is appropriate to re-engage the CDP participant back to their provider during the disaster or emergency period.</p>

<p>When a CDP participant would normally be issued with a reconnection requirement but it is clear the disaster/emergency has had a significant impact on the CDP participant, a no-re-engagement code of '<strong>RNF</strong>' - No formal re-engagement, should be used. Advise the CDP participant to restart their activity/program as soon as possible or following contact by their provider and clearly document why no re-engagement has occurred in the <strong>Participation Compliance</strong> workflow.</p>

<p>CDP participants who advise they are affected by a disaster or emergency should be given priority to ensure payments are reinstated as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>CDP participants who contact Services Australia and advise they are affected by a disaster or emergency, but have an outstanding Comprehensive Compliance Assessment (CCA), should have a CCA completed by a CCA Specialist where possible.</p>

<p>Where the CDP participant is unable to participate in the phone CCA due to the disaster/emergency, the CCA Specialist may complete the CCA using information already available on the CDP participant's record. Interventions should include crisis intervention and non vocational assistance to assist with disaster recovery where appropriate.</p>

<p>Where a CCA was unable to be completed, the PST-skilled Service Officer should record that the CCA was not fully undertaken due to the CDP participant being directly impacted by the emergency or disaster and use the 'Nationally declared disaster' rejection reason. For more information, see <a href="../job-seekers/001-10040090-01.html">Rejecting a compliance action</a>.</p>

<p>The PST-skilled Service Officer should consider if an exemption from mutual obligation requirements is appropriate.</p>

<p>Where a serious failure has been applied, consideration should be given to whether payment can be made under serious failure hardship provisions.</p>

<p>Where a CDP participant has capacity to participate in a Compliance Activity but is unable to do so due to the impacts of the disaster/emergency (for example, provider closed), consideration should be given to booking a Compliance Activity appointment at the first suitable time. If a suitable appointment is not available consideration should be given to waiving the penalty. See <a href="../job-seekers/001-10120060-01.html">Waiving a serious failure period</a>.</p>

<p>If a CDP participant refuses, fails to accept or commence a suitable job offer, reasonable excuse will apply when this was due to a disaster/emergency. In these cases the CDP participant's statement about how the disaster/emergency affected their ability to accept or commence the job should provide enough information to make a determination unless there is reason to doubt the CDP participant's statement. When reasonable excuse is established the serious failure should be rejected.</p>

<p>When the serious failure event occurred prior to the disaster/emergency, a serious failure will need to be investigated. However, when the CDP participant has been personally affected by the disaster/emergency, consideration should be given to the impacts of applying the failure given the CDP participant's current circumstances. In these cases, discretion may be used to reject the failure using the rejection reason code '<strong>NDE</strong>' - Naturally declared disaster.</p>

<p>When a decision is made to apply the failure and the CDP participant does not have capacity to participate in a Compliance Activity due to the disaster/emergency, (for example, provider closed), consideration should be given to booking a Compliance Activity appointment at the first suitable time. If a suitable appointment is not available consideration should be given to waiving the penalty. See <a href="../job-seekers/001-10120060-01.html">Waiving a serious failure period</a>.</p>

<p>An appropriate level of discretion should be applied when considering the CDP participant's financial circumstances. For example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
When a CDP participant is unable to provide evidence or advises that they are homeless because of the disaster/emergency, their statement should be considered appropriate evidence, unless there is reason to doubt the statement</li>
		<li>
CDP participants may be unable to provide current financial information. In these cases, the Services Australia record should be used unless disputed by the CDP participant</li>
		<li>
When a CDP participant advises that, because of the disaster or emergency, they have used a significant amount of their savings and investments, this expenditure should be considered to have been unavoidable or reasonable</li>
		</ul>
<p>Unless otherwise advised for a specific natural disaster, payment is reinstated under hardship provisions for CDP participants personally affected by a disaster/emergency from the date all the following are satisfied&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The CDP participant asks to have the UNPP ended under hardship provisions</li>
		<li>
The CDP participant is a vulnerable CDP participant who falls within a class of person specified by the Secretary of the Department of Education, Skills and Employment, and</li>
		<li>
The CDP participant would be in severe financial hardship as a result of the UNPP</li>
		</ul>
<p>It is not appropriate to back date hardship provisions prior to the CDP participant meeting all the above criteria.</p>
