<p>Staff must ensure income estimates are recorded as accurately as possible so that a person's entitlements are correctly assessed and the risk of overpayments reduced.</p>

<p>The couple will need to decide who will receive FTB. That person will need to claim FTB for each child of the family for whom they do not currently receive FTB.</p>

<p>If their <strong>partner is FTB current</strong>, before linking the couple, cancel the partner's FTB by coding the children as '<strong>TOP</strong>' (transfer out to partner) from the relationship start date on the Child Override/Claim (<strong>CHOC</strong>) screen. Record details on a <strong>DOC</strong> and finalise activity on the Assessment Results (<strong>AR</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>If the <strong>couple are linked and there is no shared care</strong> the Blended Family Assessment may be ended and the partner's FTB cancelled, by coding '<strong>TOP</strong>' on the <strong>CHOC</strong> screen for the partner only from the later DPT + 1 of both members of the couple. Record details on a <strong>DOC</strong> and finalise activity on the Assessment Results (<strong>AR</strong>) screen. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a shared care assessment is currently coded on FSC/SSC (between the blended family couple) this will need to be updated prior to coding TOP on CHOC.</p>

<p>If a <strong>child is not linked</strong> to the record of the person who will receive the FTB, link the child via the Link Child screen (LCH), see <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-05050120-03.html">Linking a child to a customer's record for more details</a>.</p>

<p>If there is <strong>shared care</strong> for the step child of the person now receiving FTB, a problem (P24845) has been identified where shared care is not being correctly applied when a child is in the care of a parent who has transferred their FTB to their current partner (step-parent). See Table 4 in <a href="../families/007-02040020-03.html">Notification and assessment of shared care arrangements for Family Tax Benefit (FTB) for coding</a>.</p>

<p>Each member of a blended family must receive FTB in the same way (fortnightly or as a lump sum).</p>

<p>They each need to claim for their child/ren only. If a child is from a previous relationship, ideally one person should claim for that child and their partner should claim for the children from the current relationship. This will ensure that if the child from the previous relationship ceases to be a dependant, FTB is cancelled for one member of the couple and the blended family assessment ended.</p>

<p>Each member of the couple must be entitled to FTB. They each must have an <a href="../families/007-07040050-01.html">FTB child</a> to be able to blend their payments. From 1 July 2016, FTB Part B is not payable when their youngest child turns 13 years of age, unless the person is a grandparent carer.</p>

<p>For information about claiming, see <a href="../families/007-01010000-01.html">Initial contact by customers claiming payments for families</a>.</p>

<p>Advise the customer if they are also claiming Parental Leave Pay (PPL) for a child that FTB Part B will not be paid&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
during the PPL period, or </li>
		<li>
on any days that they receive Flexible PPL</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Backdating limit for FTB claims</strong></p>

<p>An FTB claim for an additional child for a period the person received FTB instalments can only be backdated to 1 July of the preceding financial year. They would need to claim by 30 June 2019 for 2017-18.</p>

<p><strong>FTB claim lodgement timeframes</strong></p>

<p>Customers have until the end of the lodgement year to lodge a lump sum FTB claim, for example by 30 June 2019 for 2017-18.</p>

<p>From the 2012-13 financial year onwards, a customer prevented from lodging their lump sum claim by the end of the lodgement year due to special circumstances may be granted a lodgement extension. See <a href="../families/007-07030010-01.html">Assessing special circumstances extensions for families unable to meet lodgement and other specific requirements for Family Tax Benefit (FTB) and Single Income Family Supplement (SIFS)</a>.</p>

<p>For financial years 2011-12 or earlier, customers had until the end of the extended lodgement year to lodge a lump sum claim. For example, by 30 June 2014 for the 2011-12 financial year.</p>

<p><strong>Agreed percentage</strong></p>

<p>When claiming, the couple should nominate the percentage of the family's total FTB rate each is to receive, between 1-99%. The total must equal 100%. The percentage does not need to reflect the number of children each claims.</p>
