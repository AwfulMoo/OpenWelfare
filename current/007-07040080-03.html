<P>Each member of a blended family must receive FTB in the same way (fortnightly or as a lump sum).</P>
<P>They each need to claim for their child/ren only. If a child is from a previous relationship, ideally one person should claim for that child and their partner should claim for the children from the current relationship. This will ensure that if the child from the previous relationship ceases to be a dependant, FTB is cancelled for one member of the couple and the blended family assessment ended.</P>
<P>Each member of the couple must be entitled to FTB. They each must have an <A href="../families/007-07040050-01.html">FTB child</A> to be able to blend their payments. From 1 July 2016, FTB Part B is not payable when their youngest child turns 13 years of age, unless the person is a grandparent carer.</P>
<P>For information about claiming, see <A href="../families/007-01010000-01.html">Initial contact by customers claiming payments for families</A>.</P>
<P>Tell the customer if they are also claiming Parental Leave Pay (PPL) for a child that FTB Part B will not be paid:</P>
<UL>
<LI>during the PPL period, or </LI>
<LI>on any days that they receive Flexible PPL</LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>Backdating limit for FTB claims</STRONG></P>
<P>An FTB claim for an additional child for a period the person received FTB instalments can only be backdated to 1 July of the preceding financial year. They would need to claim by 30 June 2019 for 2017-18.</P>
<P><STRONG>FTB claim lodgement timeframes</STRONG></P>
<P>Customers have until the end of the lodgement year to lodge a lump sum FTB claim, for example by 30 June 2019 for 2017-18.</P>
<P>From the 2012-13 financial year onwards, a customer prevented from lodging their lump sum claim by the end of the lodgement year due to special circumstances may be granted a lodgement extension. See <A href="../families/007-07030010-01.html">Assessing special circumstances extensions for families unable to meet lodgement and other specific requirements for Family Tax Benefit (FTB) and Single Income Family Supplement (SIFS)</A>.</P>
<P>For financial years 2011-12 or earlier, customers had until the end of the extended lodgement year to lodge a lump sum claim. For example, by 30 June 2014 for the 2011-12 financial year.</P>
<P><STRONG>Agreed percentage</STRONG></P>
<P>When claiming, the couple should nominate the percentage of the family's total FTB rate each is to receive, between 1-99%. The total must equal 100%. The percentage does not need to reflect the number of children each claims.</P></DIV>
