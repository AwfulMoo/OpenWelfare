<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Calculating_the01">Calculating the rate of DFISA for periods before 1 January 2022</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>If a customer's social security pension or benefit is reduced because of income received from a Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) Adjusted Disability Pension, a calculation automatically takes place on their record to assess entitlement to DFISA, which is paid by DVA.</p>

<p>From 1 January 2022, Adjusted Disability Pensions became exempt income under the Social Security Act 1991 for income support payments. As such, DFISA is no longer required.</p>

<p>Calculation of DFISA is still required for customers who are retrospectively granted an Adjusted Disability Pension before 1 January 2022 or for reassessments of DFISA already paid to customers.</p>

<p>A person's rate of DFISA is equal to the difference between the <strong>actual rate</strong> of social security pension or benefit the person receives, and their <strong>notional rate</strong>, which is the rate they would receive if the Adjusted Disability Pension from DVA is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
exempted from the pension or benefit income test, but </li>
		<li>
included as income in the assessment of Rent Assistance (RA) entitlement (that is, the DVA disability income rent test is applied)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>DFISA rate = notional rate minus actual rate</strong></p>

<p>A manual DFISA calculation will be needed for customers who are on a <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-08180000-01.html">manual rate of payment</a> for their pension or benefit, or where the system cannot perform an automatic rate calculation. Manual DFISA calculations are done by the DVA Clearance Team.</p>

<p>For information on how to calculate DFISA, see the <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-03060010-03.html">Process</a> page.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Changes_to_the_">Changes to the rate of DFISA</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>DFISA will be automatically recalculated whenever there is a change in circumstances that could affect a customer’s rate of pension or benefit. New DFISA rates are transmitted to DVA at the end of every business day, where they are updated on the customer’s record. DVA will generally pay DFISA fortnightly, and any change to a customer’s DFISA rate may result in a debt or arrears payment with DVA.</p>

<p>It is important to note the rate of DFISA can change even when a customer’s pension or benefit rate has not changed or is a nil rate (current zero rate (CZR)). It is therefore essential any change in circumstances is accurately recorded, as this will directly affect the rate of DFISA.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>When a customer's income precludes entitlement, their pension or benefit is normally rejected or cancelled. Before 1 January 2022, if a customer or their partner are paid an Adjusted Disability Pension from DVA, a DFISA calculation will be done before this occurs. If DFISA is greater than zero their pension or benefit is held as <strong>Current Zero Rate (CZR DFISA)</strong>. These customers were regarded as receiving the pension or benefit for which they qualify and are entitled to the associated benefits and concessions relevant to their payment.</p>

<p>CZR DFISA customers must have continued to qualify for their pension or benefit, and meet the obligations associated with their particular payment. Customers will cease to be CZR-DFISA from 1 January 2022 as Adjusted Disability Pension from DVA will no longer be assessed under the income test for income support payments.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>DFISA payments for stimulus reporters were calculated and transmitted to DVA when the customer reported their income at the end of every entitlement period up until 1 January 2022. This was to ensure all income is taken into account when DFISA is calculated, and to reduce the risk of overpayment. DVA will pay DFISA for the entitlement period retrospectively.</p>

<p>A zero DFISA rate was then transmitted to DVA at the start of every entitlement (reporting) period. This occurs in the background. </p>

<p>The <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-03060010-05.html">Resources</a> page contains an example of how DFISA rates will display for reporting customers.</p>

<p><strong>Pension customer partnered with an allowance customer, or both pensioners</strong></p>

<p>When a couple includes at least 1 pensioner, their incomes are combined and then halved to establish their assessable income. Their respective rates are calculated using this income information. These rules remain unchanged with DFISA, meaning half the total combined DVA Adjusted Disability Pension is assessed as income against each customer for periods before 1 January 2022.</p>

<p><strong>For pension/allowance couples with Rent Assistance (RA)</strong>, the RA is paid to the pension customer. To establish the amount of DFISA payable, the notional rate of pension and notional RA are added together to obtain the pension customer’s total notional rate. The notional RA amount is calculated using the DVA disability income rent test, in which the couple’s combined Adjusted Disability Pension income is halved in order to obtain the RA reduction amount used in the calculation.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p><strong>Allowance customer partnered with a Parenting payment customer, another allowance customer, an ABSTUDY customer, or partner not on benefits</strong></p>

<p>When a partner’s <strong>ordinary income</strong> exceeds the Partner Income Free Area (which is the cut-out point where the partner’s benefit is no longer payable), it reduces the rate of allowance payable to the customer. To calculate the amount of partner excess income to deduct from the customer’s fortnightly payment, the Partner Income Free Area is deducted from the partner's income and multiplied by 0.6. See the <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-03060010-03.html">Process</a> page for further information.</p>

<p>A partner’s <strong>compensation direct deduction excess income</strong> is treated as ordinary income for the customer.</p>

<p>For the calculation of DFISA, all steps in the calculation of a customer’s rate must be mirrored in the <strong>notional rate calculation</strong>, for example, if there is compensation direct deduction excess in the actual calculation, this must be included in the notional calculation. </p>

<p>The exceptions to this are the <strong>notional partner excess income</strong> and <strong>notional rent assistance</strong> calculations, which require special treatment as described below.</p>

<p><strong>Notional partner excess income</strong></p>

<p>If a customer’s fortnightly allowance is reduced by their partner’s excess income, and the partner also receives an Adjusted Disability Pension from DVA before 1 January 2022, the <strong>notional partner excess income</strong> must be included in the customer’s DFISA calculation. </p>

<p>To obtain the notional partner excess income amount, the partner’s Adjusted Disability Pension from DVA is simply excluded from the calculation of partner excess income. This calculation does <strong>not</strong> include the partner’s Rent Assistance or the DVA disability income rent test. </p>

<p>The notional partner excess income amount is included in the notional rate calculation for the customer, where it is applied as a direct deduction after the customer’s notional income test has been applied. If the customer receives RA, see below as a further step is required to obtain the customer’s notional rate.</p>

<p><strong>Notional Rent Assistance calculation for partner with excess income</strong></p>

<p>The partner’s Adjusted Disability Pension from DVA excess income must be included in the calculation of notional Rent Assistance (RA) for the customer. </p>

<p>Partner Adjusted Disability Pension from DVA excess income is obtained by subtracting notional partner excess income from the actual partner excess income. </p>

<p>The resulting amount is subtracted from the customer’s notional RA as a final step in the DVA disability income rent test.</p>

<p><strong>Once the final notional Rent Assistance amount has been calculated</strong>, the full notional calculation can be done for the customer.</p>

<p>The full notional calculation for cases involving partner excess income is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
add the partner’s final notional RA to the customer’s maximum basic rate</li>
		<li>
apply the notional income test (by excluding the DVA Adjusted Disability Pension income)</li>
		<li>
deduct the notional partner excess income amount</li>
		</ul>
<p>The result will be the final notional entitlement.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>From 20 September 2009 changes to the pension income test were made as a result of the Pension Reform. As part of this reform, <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-03010070-01.html">transitional rules</a> were put in place to ensure no pension customer was worse off following the introduction of the new income test.</p>

<p>To qualify for their payment to be calculated under the transitional rules, a customer must have been on a relevant pension payment and been payable as at 19 September 2009, and have had no break in entitlement. They will continue to be paid under <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-03010070-01.html">transitional rules</a> until they are entitled to an equal or higher rate under the new rules implemented on 20 September 2009. Once this occurs they move to the new income test rules permanently.</p>

<p><strong>The DFISA rate must be included when the comparison is conducted</strong> between the rate payable under transitional rules and the rate payable under the new rules (that is, the current income test), as DFISA is part of the total income support payment received by the customer. </p>

<p>These rate comparisons will be made by the system. Where an automatic calculation cannot occur a manual rate calculation will be completed by staff within the DVA Clearance Team.</p>

<p><strong>Payments that attract DFISA and were eligible for transitional rules are&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Age Pension</li>
		<li>
Bereavement Allowance</li>
		<li>
Carer Payment</li>
		<li>
Disability Support Pension (except for customers under 21 years who have no affecting income and/or no dependent children)</li>
		<li>
Widow B Pension</li>
		<li>
Wife Pension</li>

<p><strong>Historical Note&#58;</strong></p>

<p>The DFISA-attracting payment Community Development Employment Project Scheme Participation Supplement ceased on 30 June 2015. In respect of Newstart system (NSS) customer partnered with Parenting system (PGA) customer, or both NSS customers, or partnered to an ABSTUDY customer excess wages were treated as ordinary income or employment income, for the partner, not as direct deductions.</p>
