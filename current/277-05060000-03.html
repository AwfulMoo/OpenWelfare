<p>The following types of court orders or (court-registered agreements) may start a registrable maintenance liability&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Child maintenance orders, including adult child maintenance orders where a parent or non-parent carer of the child is the payee</li>
		<li>
Step-child maintenance orders</li>
		<li>
Spousal maintenance orders</li>
		<li>
De facto maintenance orders</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> from 1 July 2008 a child maintenance order where the maintenance is payable directly to the child cannot be registered with Child Support.</p>

<p>A payee who notifies Child Support about a court order or court-registered agreement can elect for Child Support to collect on their behalf or collect privately.</p>

<p>A payee or payer may contact by telephone to advise of a court order or court-registered agreement. Alternatively, a Service Officer may receive a copy of a court order or agreement sent to Child Support by a payee or payer. Customers may also use the Application for collection of child support (AFC) (CS1979) form; see <a href="../separated-parents/277-05060000-05.html#bp05_L2LL_Forms">Resources</a> for a link to the form.</p>

<p>If Service Officers have not received a sealed copy of the court order or court-registered agreement in the initial contact, ask the customer to provide a copy. If a Service Officer is unable to contact the customer or he/she cannot provide a copy of the court order or agreement, Child Support can obtain 1 directly from the court. Service Officers will need the following details&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The date the order was made</li>
		<li>
The customer's court reference number (usually located on previous court orders that the customer may have), and</li>
		<li>
The court the order was made in</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> it may be necessary to make the request to the court in writing. Allow 14 days response time.</p>

<p>If Service Officers cannot obtain a sealed copy of the court order or court-registered agreement advise the customer by telephone that Child Support cannot take any action until the order or agreement has been sited. If telephone contact cannot be made, notify the customer in writing. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-05060000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Finalise_the_re01_Step03">Step 3 in Table 4</a>.</p>

<p>The applicant or the other party may have advised Child Support of the court order or agreement in the past. It is important to find out if this has occurred prior to creating a registration record with the court order. It is also important to check if they have a pre-existing Stage 2 Child Support Assessment.</p>

<p>There are a number of searches that a Service Officer should perform using the details of the applicant, the children (if applicable) and the person from whom the maintenance is sought.</p>

<p>Search Cuba using&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
any case number provided by the customer</li>
		<li>
any reference numbers (TFN, CRN, or CSID) provided by the customer</li>
		<li>
the customer’s current and previous names (including maiden names)</li>
		<li>
the customer first name and a surname of unknown (this may identify customers who were children in a previous case)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Do not </strong>use the customer’s middle names. This will prevent the display of any customer records without the exact middle name listed.</p>

<p>For more information see <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-19061125-01.html">Application for assessment - search for and create a customer record</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> for s66L orders (adult child maintenance) the court may order a parent to pay maintenance for a child who is over 18. Sometimes 1 parent makes the application on behalf of the child, and Child Support may have an existing stage 2 case for the parents and child.</p>

<div class="showcont">


<p>Search the ATO system via Cuba using&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer’s current and previous names and their date of birth to obtain a TFN for the customer and then perform a Child Support system search using the TFN that the Service Officer has located</li>
		</ul>
<p>See <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-30010210-01.html">Customer records Cuba Process Help</a> to search Cuba and the ATO systems for an existing customer record.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the customer does not have an existing case, for data integrity purposes the initial search must be conducted through Cuba by requesting data from the ATO. This is done by selecting the ATO radio button in the Customer window, which will cause an underlying legal notice to automatically issue. If further searches are required using ATO applications, or if Service Officers need to look at the details of several potential matches via Cuba in order to locate/find the customer, the legal notice issued from the Customer window will cover these searches.</p>

<p>For further help searching the ATO systems see the <a href="../separated-parents/277-04370000-01.html">External searches guide</a>.</p>

<p>If the customer has an existing customer record check the details of the case to find out if it is the same case and court order.</p>

<p>Look for any existing case records for both customers and the child/ren. If a Service Officer finds any existing case records check if the order is a duplicate or if there is an existing Stage 2 assessment or agreement in place.</p>

<p>To check if the order is a duplicate, view the court order details recorded in the Additional Registration Information window to find out if this is the same court order or agreement. See <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-30010030-03.html#bp03_L2GT_Record_and_upda01">Agreements Cuba Process Help</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> for older cases Service Officers should also check the Communication window for both customers for relevant details.</p>

<div class="showcont">


<p>Where the order is a duplicate of an order already recorded, record the application and the order in the Communication window. See <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-30010300-01.html">Documentation Cuba Process Help</a> for more information. Contact the customer to find out why they have resent the order.</p>

<p>If the Service Officer confirms that this is a Duplicate record, this is the end of the process.</p>

<p><strong>Duplicate Registration</strong></p>

<p>A registration must not be duplicated. A new registration cannot be saved where there is an existing registration with exactly the same details. A message box will be displayed advising that an existing registration exists with the same information. Service Officers can then view that case.</p>

<p>If Service Officers select the existing case the data they have just entered will be lost. To prevent this a Service Officer should check to existing case by recording the case number and viewing it in a new session.</p>

<div class="showcont">


<p>Where there is an existing Stage 2 assessment or agreement, check if the order is to vary an assessment or an original order for maintenance.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the most common scenario where customers would have a stage 2 assessment and a stage 1 court order is where a child of the relationship has turned 18 and is now undertaking tertiary study. Under s66L of the FLA a court can order that a parent pay maintenance for an adult child if that child has a disability or to enable the child to complete their education. If there are younger children the stage 2 case continues and the order gives rise to a stage 1 case.</p>

<p>If it is an order to vary the assessment, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-05010000-01.html">Court varied assessments (CVA) including lump sum orders</a>. If it is an original order for maintenance, continue with this process.</p>

<p>For a new case, after Service Officers have recorded the details of the people involved, they need to record the case. This process will allocate the case number to the case.

<p>Check the court order or court-registered agreement to determine if there is a registrable maintenance liability. A court order or agreement creates a registrable maintenance liability if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
there is a periodic amount specified to be paid by a parent or a step-parent for the maintenance of a child (including an adult child), or</li>
		<li>
there is a periodic amount specified to be paid by a party to a marriage for the maintenance of the other party to a marriage (spousal maintenance), or</li>
		<li>
from 1 March 2009, there is a periodic amount specified to be paid by a party to a de facto relationship for the maintenance of the other party to a de facto relationship</li>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> from 1 July 2008, if the periodic amount is to be paid directly to the child (including an adult child) the maintenance order cannot be registered with Child Support for collection.</p>

<p>If the court order or agreement does not create a registrable maintenance liability, Service Officers should advise the customer by telephone. If telephone contact cannot be made, notify the customer in writing. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-05060000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Finalise_the_re01_Step03">Step 3 in Table 4</a>.</p>

<p>In order for the customers and Child Support to achieve the maximum benefit from the interview it is vital that Service Officers are properly prepared. As no 2 cases will be exactly the same, all interviews will need to be tailored to meet the specific needs of each customer.</p>

<p>Examine the information already supplied carefully. Highlight areas where more information is required or where the Service Officers need to clarify any details that have been provided. In some cases Child Support will require further information about the liability whilst in others information to help Child support to locate the other party and/or collect the liability may be required.</p>

<p>Service Officers should ensure they are familiar with information which is already available to them from the application or via ATO systems. This will ensure that important points are not missed during the interview and may avoid the need for further calls.</p>

<p><strong>What if there is no telephone number for the customer?</strong></p>

<p>Where a current telephone number is not available, conduct relevant searches to obtain a number including telephone directories, the external information screen and CSU (if applicable). Service Officers should also ask the customer if they have a number for the other party during the pre-registration interview.</p>

<p><strong>What to do if a Service Officer cannot contact the customer by telephone?</strong></p>

<p>If a Service Officer are unable to make phone contact with the customer within 48 hours, send an MX 0-1 Request for customer to contact CSA letter. See <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-30010400-01.html">Letters Cuba Process Help</a>. Ensure Service Officers include in the free text area what will occur if the customer doesn't contact Child Support, using the suggested letter text in Letters Cuba Process Help. Attempts at phone contact should continue after the letter has been sent. The customer should then be allowed a reasonable period (7-14 days) to respond to the letter before the Service Officer will move on to the next step.</p>

<p>Customer contact is an important part of the registration process because it provides the opportunity to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
establish personal contact with customers early in the life of the case and provide a contact should the customer have further questions</li>
		<li>
confirm current information and obtain any missing information from the customer</li>
		<li>
ensure that customers are adequately informed of their options, rights and responsibilities, and</li>
		<li>
discuss important issues regarding the extent of Child Support involvement in their case</li>
		</ul>
<p>Contacting both customers is a compulsory step in for all cases.</p>

<p>The pre-registration interview is critically important as it is generally the first contact between the customer and Child Support, and establishes the basis for all future dealings. Proper preparation is vital as it allows for the interview to focus on the individual circumstances of each customer.</p>

<p>Although a range of topics can be covered with both the payer and payee the following issues must be discussed in every case.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
For payees, it is important that they are given a full explanation about the benefits of private collection and the availability of a safety net in the event that this option does not work. Many payees initially elect for their case to be collectible because they don't think they have a choice. Where the payee chooses to elect for Child Support to collect, explain the payment cycle and that if the payer is compliant RIPC may be considered after 6 months. If a payee elects for Child Support to collect payments, obtain bank account details</li>
		<li>
For payers, the most important issue that needs to be discussed relates to the payment of their liability. Explain the amount of their liability and when will it be due? What payment options are available, what to do if they can't pay the liability or full amount of the initial debt by the due date. Also outline the action Child Support can take if payments aren't made by the due date. Whilst these issues need to be discussed in a sensitive manner they are critical issues if early compliance is to be achieved. Service Officers need to understand any issues affecting the payer’s capability to pay to be able to offer appropriate options, including referrals to external services if appropriate</li>
		</ul>
<p>During the interview Service Officers will need to make a judgement about which topics are relevant to each customer and also the level of detail that needs to be provided at the pre-registration stage. It is important that Service Officers use active listening skills to ensure that Service Officers fully address the customer's questions and concerns. Not all topics will be relevant to all customers and in many cases it is counterproductive to provide too much detail at this time.</p>

<p>Inform the paying parent of the liability, the amount of their first payment and when it will be due.</p>

<p>If the payer is unable to pay the liability, the Service Officer should discuss the payer’s circumstances which lead to the inability to pay, and offer possible options. For example, if it is a short term inability to pay, a payment arrangement may be appropriate or a referral to external services. If the payer is just unable or unwilling to pay the court ordered amount, they may be able to apply for a LINE. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-05060000-04.html#bp04_L2GT_Policy">References</a> for a link to The Child Support Guide 3.4.5, Suspension for unemployment (low-income non-enforcement period) or ask the courts to vary the order.</p>

<p>Advise the payer of their right to seek a <a href="../separated-parents/277-04330000-01.html">stay order</a> for the period until a decision is made on the new court order. Note that the court will not automatically grant a stay. Ensure they understand that Child Support may take enforcement action if they do not make payments and no stay order is in place.</p>

<p>The payer may be unable to pay as they also have a stage 2 liability and do not have sufficient financial capacity to pay for both cases. Discuss the possibility of the payer making an application for a change of assessment on the stage 2 case (under reason 9) to have the stage 1 liability taken into consideration when setting the stage 2 liability.</p>

<p>Discuss <a href="../separated-parents/277-04280000-01.html">payment options with the customer</a>.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Linking to employer for automatic deductions from salary (EW)</li>
		<li>
If payer does not want to be linked they must make an election for salary deductions not to apply. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-03090000-01.html">Fixed annual rate not to apply applications</a></li>

NAPs including prescribed NAPs (S71C). Not available if the liability is for spousal/ de facto maintenance</li>
		<li>
Centrelink Deductions - Include advice that Centrelink Deductions will automatically start if the payer is in arrears and on Centrelink Benefits. Not available if the liability is for spousal/ de facto maintenance</li>
		</ul>
<p>Also ask the payer if they have made any payments to the payee since the lodgement date of the application. Do not forget to include any prescribed payments that the payer may be able to claim.</p>

<p>When the payer will be paying by Employer Withholding, explain the delays in commencing deductions and of the need for them to make payments direct to Child Support during the interim period.</p>

<p>Service Officers must record on the Bank details window how the payee would like to have payments made to them – direct deposit into a bank account or cheque. To record these details, see <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-30010290-01.html">Disbursement Cuba Process Help</a>.</p>

<p>Direct deposit into the payee’s bank account is the Child Support preferred method and reduces the risk of lost cheques for the payees. Service Officers will need to make sure they have the payee’s bank account details if direct deposit is the chosen method.</p>
