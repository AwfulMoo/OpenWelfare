<p><strong>Principal home sold during a period of temporary absence</strong></p>

<p>If the customer, or their partner, sells the principal home during a period of <a target="_blank" href="../ongoing-contact/102-03010030-01.html">temporary absence</a> and intends to apply the proceeds to purchase, build, rebuild, repair or renovate a new principal home, the proceeds to be used for the new home are not counted as an asset for 12 months from the date of sale. The income support recipient remains a homeowner throughout the exemption period.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>Customer vacated home on 12 July 2007 for an extended trip around Australia and continues to be assessed as a homeowner (so their home is exempt from the Assets Test) for up to 12 months from that date. On 15 December 2007, while the customer is absent, their principal home sells. The customer intends to purchase a new principal home from the proceeds of the sale within the next 12 months. The 12 months exemption of the proceeds of sale exemption commences from the date of sale, which is 15 December 2007.</p>

<p><strong>Customer moves into investment property or a caravan</strong></p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-04130020-01.html">Customer moves into investment property or a caravan they own</a> and intends to obtain a new principal home.</p>

<p>A customer cannot have both an exemption for the proceeds of the sale of their former home as well as an exemption for a current principal home they own and are living in.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>Joan sells the principal home and moves into either another home, which was previously an investment property, or a caravan Joan owns. Joan cannot gain a principal home exemption on the home being lived in as well as having the sale proceeds exempt from the Assets Test. In this case, Joan wants the proceeds from the original home (or caravan) to be exempt while using them to build the new home. Therefore, given Joan does not intend the home (or caravan) currently being lived in to be the principal home it will be assessed as an asset. The sale proceeds that will be used to build a new principal home will be exempt from the Assets Test.</p>

<p><strong>Customer purchases land with intention to build new principal residence</strong></p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>Mike sells the principal home for $500,000 and purchases a block of land for $200,000 where Mike will build a new principal home. Mike invests the balance of $300,000 in a term deposit. As this land will be Mike's new principal home, it is exempt from the Assets Test for up to 12 months and is not coded on <strong>REBS</strong>. Provided Mike advised the remaining $300,000 is exclusively to build the new principal home, it will also be exempt from the Asset Test for up to 12 months.</p>

<p><strong>Attempts to obtain a new principal home not within a reasonable time</strong></p>

<p>An extended exemption does <strong>not</strong> apply if the customer has not made reasonable steps to obtain a new principal home within 6 months of the sale of the old principal home.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>Sam and Jenny sold their principal home on 20 December 2016. They went overseas and came back to Australia on 30 October 2017. They entered into a contract of sale to purchase a new home on 15 December 2017 and settlement will occur on 15 March 2018. In this case, although Sam and Jenny made reasonable attempts (that is, they entered into a contract of sale to purchase a new home within 12 months) they did not make those attempts within a reasonable period (that is, within 6 months) from the date of sale. In this case, Sam and Jenny <strong>cannot</strong> gain an extended exemption for principal home sale proceeds.</p>

<p><strong>Delays out of customers control to obtain a new principal home within initial 12 months of sale</strong></p>

<p>Examples include <strong>but</strong> are not limited to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Delays in obtaining building approval from local shire council. This has in turn delayed entering an agreement with a builder</li>
		<li>
Caring for a close family member in a separate location to the place the customer is to build their new principal home</li>
		<li>
Customer is hospitalised for an extended period</li>
		<li>
Demands on the building industry are stretched in a particular area, for example due to a natural disaster like a flood or cyclone damage to area</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>The Smiths sold their principal home in October 2017. They purchased a block of land in January 2018 and were unable, due to delays with developers, to commence building on the land until June 2018. The Smiths signed a contract in June 2018 for building completion by January 2019. The builder experienced delays and the new home was only partially complete by January 2019. The builder estimates home completion by March 2019 In this case, given the Smiths&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
made reasonable attempts (that is, buying a block of land and signing a contract to build a home within 12 months)</li>
		<li>
made those attempts within a reasonable period (buying a block of land within 6 months), and</li>
		<li>
experienced delays beyond their control (developer and builder delays)</li>
		</ul>
<p>They would gain access to the extended exemption for the period of October 2018 to the end of March 2019</p>

<p><strong>Evidence</strong></p>

<p><strong>When does exemption end?</strong></p>

<p>The principal home sale proceeds exemption ends when the <strong>first</strong> of 1 of the following events occurs&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The new principal home is purchased, or the building or rebuilding, repair or renovation is complete</li>
		<li>
The customer no longer intends to purchase, build or rebuild, repair or renovation another principal home from the proceeds of the sale</li>
		<li>
When the approved exemption period expires, for example after initial 12 months if an extended exemption does not apply or after 24 months when the extended exemption expires</li>
		<li>
Were a customer has sold their principal home via instalments or deferred payments the exemption ends 12 months from the date of sale. This is because only the payments received within 12 months of the sale are exempt</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>On 10 January 2017, the Joneses sold their principal home with the intention of purchasing a new principal home. However, on 20 June 2017 the Joneses decide they no longer want to purchase a new principal home but would rather purchase a campervan and travel around Australia. The principal home sale proceeds exemption ceases on 20 June 2017, when the intention to purchase a new principal home ceased.</p>

<p><strong>Not all proceeds from the sale are used for the purchase or building of a new home</strong></p>

<p>Customer receives $450,000 from the sale of the principal home, and intends to use $375,000 of this to purchase a new principal home. The customer plans to use the balance ($75,000) to purchase a new car, furniture and an overseas holiday.</p>

<p>In this case, only $375,000 is exempt as the customer intends to use this amount to purchase the new principal home.</p>

<p><strong>Assessment of land already owned by the customer to be used to build a new home - from 1 July 2007</strong></p>

<p><strong>Assessment from 1 July 2007</strong></p>

<p>The maximum total asset value, which may be exempt, is the value of the proceeds of the sale of the old principal home.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>

<p>Sally purchased a block of land for $100,000 with a $100,000 (100%) mortgage prior to selling the principal home. Sally sold the principal home and received $350,000 on 30 July 2017. Sally used some of the proceeds to pay off the mortgage on the block of land. Sally placed the balance of the settlement funds in a bank account. Sally intends on using the funds to build a new principal home on the block of land. In this case, the block of land and the funds in the bank account can be exempt from 30 July 2017.</p>

<p>The exempt value of the land and the funds in the bank account would be the lesser of the amount received for the old house and the amount Sally will spend on the new one, including the land.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>

<p>John has a block of land worth $200,000 with a $100,000 mortgage. John sells the principal home for $300,000 and intends to build on the block of land. John uses $100,000 from the sale proceeds to pay off the mortgage on the land and intends to use the balance of the funds ($200,000) to build a new principal home.</p>

<p>The value of equity in the land and money from the proceeds of the sale is $400,000; this is $100,000 more than the amount received from the sale. An exemption applies only to $300,000 (the amount the principal home sold for). The exemption would apply to the amount paid to pay off the land ($100,000) and the balance of funds from the sale ($200,000). The $100,000 equity previously owned for the land is still an assessable asset, as the exemption amount cannot be more than the proceeds from the sale of the old principal home.</p>

<p><strong>Example 3</strong></p>

<p>Prue sells the principal home for $300,000. Prue owns outright a block of land on which the intention is to build a new home. The land is worth $100,000. Prue spends $100,000 of the proceeds from the sale of the home on a caravan and 4 wheel drive to travel around Australia while the new home is being built. Prue intends to use the remainder of the proceeds to build the new home. In this case, the block of land worth $100,000 and the $200,000 to build the new home are exempt. The total exemption allowable in this case is $300,000, which equals the sale proceeds of the former principal home.</p>

<p>The customer must uniquely identify the location of any real estate or business site they own or in which they have an interest.</p>

<p><strong>Example of funds being used to purchase new principal home</strong></p>

<p>Updates can be made to the savings account as it decreases in value when the customer uses the funds, for example progressive payments for a house being built. Remember to adjust the <strong>Asset test deduction amount&#58;</strong> field on the Deposits Account (<strong>SVDA</strong>) screen by the equal value.</p>

<p><strong>At time of sale</strong></p>

<p>A customer sells their home for $350,000 and intends to use $275,000 on a new home soon to be under construction. The <strong>SVDA</strong> screen at the time of sale was updated with a $350,000 balance and $275,000 to be used on the new home is the asset test deduction amount.</p>

<p><strong>Two months later</strong></p>

<p>The customer advises they paid $100,000 as a progressive payment for the building of the home. The balance of the account is now $250,000.</p>

<p>The<strong> SVDA</strong> screen is updated with a balance of the account, at $250,000, with the asset test deduction amount decreasing by the $100,000 used on the house to $175,000.</p>

<p><strong>Additional 3 months later</strong></p>

<p>The customer advises they paid another $50,000 for the building of the home. The balance of the account is now $200,000.</p>

<p>The<strong> SVDA</strong> screen is updated with a balance of the account, at $200,000, with the asset test deduction amount decreasing by the $50,000 used on the house to $125,000.</p>

<p>The asset test deduction amount decreases by the amount the customer uses on the home. It is important the asset test deduction amount is the amount intended for the new home only. It cannot be more than the funds from the sale of the home. If the customer at a later time states the home will not cost the original $275,000 as advised and will now only be $250,000, the asset test deduction amount reduces by the $25,000 reduction in the cost of the new home.</p>
