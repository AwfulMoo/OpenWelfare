<p>A BasicsCard can be issued by Service Officers at&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Centrelink Service Centres</li>
		<li>
Remote Service Centres</li>
		<li>
Remote Servicing Teams (RSTs) with Centrelink system connectivity and BasicsCard stocks in a face-to-face interview with the customer</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Confirm Customer Identity</strong></p>

<p>If customer not already authenticated, confirm the customer's identification before proceeding with interview. As a result of the risk of issuing funds to third parties in error, it is essential that this step is carried out thoroughly and carefully.</p>

<p>Issuing the BasicsCard to a third party in error can result in hardship for the customer and financial loss to Services Australia.</p>

<p>If in any doubt, <strong>do not issue the BasicsCard</strong> and consult a Centrelink social worker, or the Income Management helpdesk for further assistance.</p>

<p><strong>Payment nominees</strong></p>

<p>If an income managed customer has a payment nominee the payment nominee will be issued the BasicsCard on behalf of the customer. See <a href="../payment-delivery/103-01010020-01.html">Nominee arrangements under Income Management</a></p>

<p>If the customer does not wish the payment nominee to be issued the BasicsCard, the customer must to cancel the nominee arrangement prior to being issued a BasicsCard.</p>

<p>For information on where the customer can use the BasicsCard in their community, search for TPO.</p>

<p>Customers can access information on organisations where they can use their BasicsCard using the <a href="../self-service/133-04130000-01.html">Business and Organisation search tool</a> located on the Services Australia Website (servicesaustralia.gov.au/basicscard). See the <a href="../payment-delivery/103-01230010-05.html">Resources</a> page for a link to the Organisation Finder service.</p>

<p>Provide the customer with information on where the BasicsCard can be used, the general terms and conditions of use and benefits of the card for example, automatic transfer of funds to card. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> the Customer Information Pack is not given to the customer at this stage. Only after the card is issued to the customer should this be provided.</p>

<p>Does the customer accept the offer of a BasicsCard?</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>, run the Issue card workflow. See <a href="../payment-delivery/103-01230010-03.html#bp03050002_1">Step1 in the Issue of initial BasicsCard workflow</a> table</li>
		<li>
<strong>No</strong>, determine if the customer is eligible for any other assistance, for example, a one-off or regular payment to a registered Third Party Organisation (TPO). Record the reason why the customer refused the BasicsCard. The two options are 'customer vulnerability' or 'special circumstances'. Record details on a <strong>DOC</strong> as to why the BasicsCard was refused. Procedure ends here</li>		</ul>

When the <strong>card is issued to a payment nominee</strong>, write the nominees first name followed by '(NOM)'. This will indicate to merchants that the cardholder is a payment nominee for an income managed customer(s) and is permitted to hold more than one BasicsCard.

<p>Third Parties who are not payment nominees cannot be issued the BasicsCard on behalf of the customer.</p>

<p><strong>All customers</strong></p>

<p>The BasicsCard is another allocation method for income managed funds. Service Officers must review current expenses to ensure the customer's priority needs are met via appropriate allocation methods.</p>

<p>Customers are able to contact the Income Management Line seven days a week between 8am and 5pm local time to transfer funds to their BasicsCard.</p>

<p><strong>Daily Spend Limit&#58;</strong> A customer can request to set this limit between $20 and $1,500.

<p><strong>Maximum Card Balance&#58;</strong> A customer can request to set this limit between $100 and $3,000. A customer may request to lower the daily spend or maximum card balance limits of their BasicsCard, however, if that customer is deemed as 'vulnerable', appropriate referrals should be made. While there is no longer a requirement for a Service Officer to make contact with a Service Officer from the customer's local office or a senior officer involved in the initial decrease of the limits, Service Officer should ensure a full assessment of the customer's circumstances is undertaken and any appropriate referrals made.</p>

Remote Servicing Teams (RSTs) with Centrelink system connectivity and BasicsCard stocks in a face-to-face interview with the customer</li>

<p><strong>Confirm Customer Identity</strong></p>

<p>If customer not already authenticated, confirm the customer's identification before proceeding with interview. As a result of the risk of issuing funds to third parties in error, it is essential that this step is carried out thoroughly and carefully.</p>

<p>Issuing the BasicsCard to a third party in error can result in hardship for the customer and financial loss to Services Australia.</p>

<p>If in any doubt, <strong>do not issue the BasicsCard</strong> and consult a Centrelink social worker, or the Income Management helpdesk for further assistance.</p>

<p><strong>Payment nominees</strong></p>

<p>If an income managed customer has a payment nominee the payment nominee will be issued the BasicsCard on behalf of the customer. See <a href="../payment-delivery/103-01010020-01.html">Nominee arrangements under Income Management</a></p>

<p>If the customer does not wish the payment nominee to be issued the BasicsCard, the customer must cancel the nominee arrangement prior to being issued a BasicsCard.</p>

They can make multiple purchase transactions and pay for each one individually using a different BasicsCard</li>
		<li>
Where a BasicsCard has been issued to a payment nominee, the payment nominee should advise the customer of the changes and to destroy any existing card if the customer is not present</li>
		<li>
Remind the nominee that they must act in the best interests of the customer when using the BasicsCard and income managed funds must only be used for the benefit of the customer and their dependents</li>
		<li>
