<p>Temporary absence from employment can be indicated by the fact no separation certificate has been issued, leave continues to be paid periodically, or the employee intends to return to same employer immediately afterwards.</p>

<p>Leave payments (including any leave loading representative of the leave period) received for a temporary absence from employment are <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010000-01.html">employment income</a>.</p>

<p>The customer must advise the amount of income paid for time off in each entitlement period as well as for work done. There is no need to separate these amounts. Record both leave and work on the Employment Income Paid Details (<strong>EAPP</strong>) using 1 entry per employer, per entitlement period.</p>

<p>If required, code the number of hours ‘worked’ equivalent to the number of hours for which leave was paid, for the relevant entitlement period. Hours to be coded as ‘<strong>HOP</strong>’ with DOV = the EPED of the relevant period.</p>

<p>Income Bank and Working Credits allow certain income support recipients of workforce age to offset income from employment against credits accrued during periods of low or no income.</p>

<p>The Work Bonus is a discount applicable to the assessment of eligible income earned by Age Pension age pensioners. Work Bonus does not apply to Parenting Payment Single customers who are Age Pension age.</p>

<p>If the customer’s assets change as a result of receiving a leave or termination payment, assets should be updated. See <a target="_blank" href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-04010000-01.html">Coding income and assets for Centrelink payments and services</a>.</p>

<p>Leave payments where the employee does not go on the leave and is still in employment are remunerative lump sums.</p>

<p>No Employment Separation Certificate (SU1) is issued, and any leave paid occurs at the same time as normal wages can indicate this.</p>

<p>In this case, record the employee’s actual wages on the Employment Income Paid Details (<strong>EAPP</strong>) as <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010000-01.html">employment income</a> as usual. The paid out accrued leave entitlements are assessed as a remunerative lump sum for up to 52 weeks from the date the leave payments are paid.</p>

<p>Record the amount of the leave payment on the <strong>EAPP</strong> screen as a new employer (for example, Employer name - paid out leave). Record the Type of Employment income as <strong>EAR</strong> with the event date being the date the leave payment was paid and the frequency as <strong>LOP</strong>. Code the start and end date for the same period of time for which the income was paid, up to 52 weeks.</p>

<p>Working Credit allows certain income support recipients of workforce age to offset income from employment against credits accrued during periods of low or no income.</p>

<p>The Work Bonus is a discount applicable to the assessment of eligible income earned by Age Pension age pensioners. Work Bonus does not apply to Parenting Payment Single (PPS) customers who are Age Pension age.</p>

<p>For ABSTUDY customers who receive lump sum termination payments due to a cessation of employment on or after the date of grant. These amounts are coded on Other Income (<strong>OIN</strong>) as follows&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Type&#58;</strong> OTH</li>
		<li>
<strong>Description&#58;</strong> Employers name</li>
		<li>
<strong>Reference&#58;</strong> Employer reference (if applicable)</li>

<strong>Start Date/Event date&#58;</strong> Date the lump sum termination payment was paid</li>

		<li>
<strong>Freq&#58;</strong> field coded as <strong>ANN</strong></li>

<p>In New South Wales (NSW), non-teaching support staff (teacher’s aides, library assistants or other non-teaching staff), are employees of the NSW Department of Education. As they are unable to work during term breaks, they receive a stand down payment, based on them meeting certain criteria.</p>

<p>Stand down payments have never been considered leave payment for Social Security purposes&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Before 20 April 2010, stand down payments were assessed as a remunerative lump sum and held for a 52-week period from the date the customer received it</li>

From 20 April 2010, these payments are <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010010-01.html">assessed as ordinary employment income earned in the customers entitlement period</a></li>
