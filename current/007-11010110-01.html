<p>An FTB lump sum claim cannot be finalised until actual income details for both the customer and their current partner are available. If a lump sum customer or their partner has lodged a tax return with the ATO, income details can only be obtained after the claim has been processed. Claim processing allows a link to be established with the ATO.</p>

<p>If actual income details are not available when the claim is processed, the lump sum claim will be assessed but no entitlement paid (Assessed Awaiting Income (ASS-AIU)).</p>

<p><strong>2012-13 and later financial years&#58;</strong></p>

<p>If an FTB lump sum claim has been lodged within the allowable time and either the customer or their partner does not confirm their income by lodging a tax return with the ATO, or advising they are not required to lodge a tax return for the relevant financial year, within the allowable time, the FTB lump sum claim will be rejected.</p>

<p>If a customer or their partner lodge tax returns after the end of the lodgement year, the customer will be assessed as a late lodger and the lump sum claim will be automatically rejected as 'late income confirmation'. For more information on FTB lump sum claim status codes, see <a href="../families/007-07090010-01.html">Cancellation, rejection and Current Zero Rate codes for Family Tax Benefit (FTB)</a>.</p>

<p>If an income confirmation<strong> request</strong> is sent to the ATO for the customer and/or their partner after the end of the lodgement year, and the ATO advise no income tax return has been lodged by the individual, the claim will be automatically rejected as 'income not available'.</p>

<p><strong>2011-12 or earlier financial years&#58;</strong></p>

<p>If an FTB lump sum claim was lodged within the allowable time but the customer or their partner lodges their tax return late, payment can generally still be made on the claim. However, the following will <strong>not </strong>be included&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
FTB Part A or FTB Part B supplements</li>
		<li>
return to work assistance (FTB Part B quarantine)</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the partner did not lodge their tax return with the ATO by the end of the extended lodgement year, the rate paid will be the lower of the rate calculated using estimated income and rate based on actual income.</p>

<p>If the claimant lodges a tax return after the end of the allowable time having previously advised they or their partner did not need to lodge a tax return, the FTB lump sum claim will be considered not effective and a debt will be raised for any FTB (excluding SIFS) previously paid.

These activities will be managed by the Manual Intervention (MIV) team. </p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> for the 2017-18 and later financial years, customers will only be eligible to receive SIFS if they meet grandfathering provisions.</p>
