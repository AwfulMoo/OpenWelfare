<p>At reconciliation, Joe meets all eligibility criteria for SIFS and maintains SIFS grandfathering status. Joe automatically receives 100% of the family's SIFS entitlement in respect of the child in his care.

<p>For the period where Phil was overseas, Liz was paid the full entitlement of SIFS for her own children.</p>

<p>Services Australia later finds out that Phil had returned from the overseas trip after less than 6 weeks away. In this very uncommon situation, the system would recalculate the entitlement for both customers and the 'blended' decision would be reinstated.</p>
