<p>This document outlines information to assist Service Officers process a lump sum repayment of an advance payment. A customer is able to make repayments via credit or debit card using their Centrelink online account or via Post Billpay at any Australia Post outlet. </p>

<p>Discuss the reason for making the lump sum advance repayment, as it may cause an unexpected disadvantage to the customer if they have not fully considered the impacts.</p>

<p>If the customer wants to repay the outstanding advance payment in order to apply for a new advance payment, ensure that the amount is paid in full. If there will be rounding amounts outstanding after the repayment, these amounts will be recovered from the next payment and may continue to impact on any new advance payment application. These amounts cannot be waived and must be recovered, as the customer still has a legal liability to repay the full advance amount. This applies even if the amount outstanding is less than $0.05.</p>

<p>These repayments will be accepted immediately as paid and on the customer's record, allowing the customer to be granted, if otherwise eligible, a new advance payment.</p>

<p>Customers should be strongly encouraged to use their Centrelink online account to make a repayment in the first instance.</p>

<p>Customers are also able to print an Australia Post Billpay barcode from their online account which they can take to an Australia Post outlet to make a payment. If the customer is using the Express Plus Centrelink mobile app, the barcode can be saved to the vault.</p>

<p>Staff will be able to&#58;</p>

<p>For Family Tax Benefit (FTB) advance payments, an outstanding advance balance of less than $0.05 is disregarded in the system calculation of the maximum advance amount available to the customer, but is still payable and will be deducted from the customer's next payment of FTB Part A. Therefore, the customer will be able to access a further FTB advance amount whilst they have an outstanding residual FTB advance amount of less than $0.05.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A customer may wish to repay an outstanding advance in order to obtain a new advance that is only slightly higher. This is a form of credit cycling that may indicate that the customer is experiencing financial hardship. A referral to Financial Management Support Services may be more appropriate in these circumstances.</p>

<p>Service Officers are not to accept a repayment that is greater than the amount outstanding, even by a few cents, as the repayment will not record correctly on the system.</p>

<p>Service Officers must ensure the customer is certain they wish to proceed with the repayment. Once the outstanding balance of the advance payment shows as fully recovered, it can take up to 7 days to reverse the transaction and refund the money to the customer. This is because Services Australia must receive the payment before it can be refunded to the customer. See <a href="../payment-delivery/103-05040050-01.html#bp01_L2GT_Refunds_of_lump">Refunds of lump sums paid</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> before accepting/making the lump sum repayment for any advance payment type, it is important to check that there are no other barriers that may prevent a new advance payment being granted. If the customer will not be able to get an advance payment following the lump sum repayment of an outstanding advance payment, then consider whether accepting the repayment is appropriate.</p>

<p>Repaying an advance payment early will not allow a pension customer to receive another one unless the advance payment has been outstanding for a period over 13 fortnights from the date of grant.</p>

<p>A customer may contact to advise that they made the repayment on the wrong advance and would like to have the funds transferred to the correct advance. Payments can be transferred if&#58;</p>

Once the repayment has been made, the customer will then discover they are not eligible for either the advance or the amount they expected.</p>

<p>The funds <strong>cannot</strong> be refunded to the customer until the payment has been received by Services Australia (that is, the funds have been credited to the agency's bank account and are not just pending transfer). It can take up to 7 days for the funds to be returned to the customer's financial institution.</p>

<p>Payments made should <strong>only</strong> be refunded in exceptional circumstances, as the customer must complete a check box that states 'I acknowledge that paying off an advance today may mean I am not entitled to another advance immediately'.</p>

<p>Payments can be refunded if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer requests the transfer within 24 hours of the payment having been made (take into consideration only working days when calculating this timeframe)</li>
		<li>
another advance payment (of the same type) has <strong>not</strong> been granted</li>
		<li>
the customer will be in severe financial hardship if the payment is not refunded</li>
		</ul>
<p>The payment will be refunded into the customer's recorded payment destination (where their regular payments are made) <strong>except</strong> for credit card payments which are to be refunded back to the credit card, this action will be done by the specialist team.</p>

<p>If a previous advance has been over-recovered, the excess funds are to be repaid to the customer by the Payment Adjustment (<strong>PYAJ</strong>) screen. See <a href="../payment-delivery/103-05040060-01.html">Changes to the repayment rate of an advance payment</a>. A refund <strong>must not</strong> be requested.</p>

<p>Cash repayments should <strong>only</strong> be accepted where there is no other way for the customer to make the lump sum repayment, for example, they do not have a credit or debit card and there is no Australia Post outlet nearby.</p>

<p>Normal cash repayment procedures will need to be followed including recording of the receipt in ESSentials and update the balance of the customer's advance in <strong>Manage Advances</strong> in Process Direct when a cash payment is received. The customer cannot repay more than the outstanding balance, for example&#58; if the balance is $67.67, the customer can only pay $67.65 if paying by cash and will need to wait for the outstanding $0.02 to be repaid.</p>
