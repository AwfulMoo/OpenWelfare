<P>For <STRONG>JSP</STRONG> or <STRONG>YA job seekers</STRONG>, determine if the customer has ongoing entitlement to payment. They must still be able to satisfy the sufficient work test, mutual obligation requirements and continue to report on their normal reporting due date.</P>
<P><STRONG>JSP job seekers who have returned to full-time work who may still be eligible for payment </STRONG></P>
<P>The most common examples of full-time workers who might qualify for JSP payment without further activity requirements are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>job seekers with a pensioner partner (the income test for these couples results in a cut-off point for JSP which is considerably higher than applies to individuals and couples where both receive an income support payment such as JSP)</LI>
<LI>long term single JSP customers aged 60 or over who receive Rent Assistance (RA) (the cut-out point for such cases can also exceed full-time minimum wages)</LI>
<LI>JSP single principal carers (the income test for these customers may allow them to continue to be entitled to part rate of JSP after all Working Credits have been exhausted)</LI>
<LI>job seekers with a working credit balance at the entitlement period start date that they are paid employment income, see <A href="../ongoing-contact/102-07030080-03.html#bp03_tbl_Unfavourable_decisio_Step01">Step 1 in Table 2</A></LI></UL>
<P>For information on sufficient work test and mutual obligation requirements, see <A href="../job-seekers/001-09070070-01.html">Paid work as an approved activity</A>.</P>

<P>When a provider advises a job seeker has been placed in full-time ongoing employment, an electronic transaction will be sent via the Department of Education, Skills and Employment system to Services Australia, which updates the job seeker's record.</P>
<P>The transaction will also automatically update the Employment Status with the '<STRONG>FTO</STRONG>' code on the Customer Employment Status (<STRONG>EAES</STRONG>) screen.</P>
<P>When this occurs, record the employment income as ongoing income so the customer can access their Working Credit balance. If there is no ongoing income recorded "after three reporting periods", the job seeker's payment is auto-cancelled. After the depletion of the Working Credit, their payment will be auto cancelled.</P>
<P>If there is no ongoing income recorded, the job seeker's payment is auto cancelled under reason of '<STRONG>FTE</STRONG>' from the date they commenced full-time employment. The job seeker is not able to utilise their Working Credit balance unless employment income is reported and payment is restored.</P>
<P>If it is confirmed that the job seeker has commenced full-time ongoing employment, to restore payment and apply Working Credit provision correctly:</P>
<UL>
<LI>restore the payment via the Benefit Action (<STRONG>BA</STRONG>) screen. Before finalising, code employment income from the date the job seeker is first paid and then finalise the activity</LI>
<LI>if payment is current, check if the job seeker is still required to report for the next entitlement period. If so, advise the job seeker of the requirement to still report on the report due date and that their payment will automatically cancel once their Working Credit is depleted</LI>
<LI>record details on a <STRONG>DOC</STRONG></LI></UL>
<P>If the job seeker disputes that they have not commenced work or the work is non-ongoing (i.e. casual or only part-time), see <A href="../job-seekers/001-02070040-01.html">Jobactive/Community Development Program (CDP) registration inactivated and cancellation of income support in error</A>.</P>

<LI>Tell the customer to keep reporting and to include any employment income paid on their normal reporting day. If income will be too high, the nil rate period process may apply. See <A href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010160-01.html">Employment income nil rate period</A></LI>
<LI>Record details on a <STRONG>DOC</STRONG>. Procedure ends here</LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>For customers with full-time ongoing employment who still qualify for payment</STRONG></P>
<P>This process may apply to the following job seekers:</P>
<UL>
<LI>customer with a pensioner partner (the income test for these couples results in a cut-off point for JSP considerably higher than applies to individuals and couples where both receive an income support payment such as JSP)</LI>
<LI>long term single JSP customer aged 60 or more who receives Rent Assistance (RA) (the cut-out point for such cases can also exceed full-time minimum wages)</LI>
<LI>JSP single principal carers (the income test for these customers may allow them to continue to be entitled to part rate of JSP after all Working Credits have been exhausted)</LI></UL>
<P>To restore payment for this cohort:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Code a new entry of '<STRONG>NFT</STRONG>' (Not full-time ongoing employment) with the date being the <STRONG>day after</STRONG> coding '<STRONG>FTO</STRONG>'. Do not delete the '<STRONG>FTO</STRONG>' details from the <STRONG>EAES</STRONG> screen. An activity will be sent to the provider advising of a change in employment status for the customer</LI>
<LI>Process outstanding reports. Assess <STRONG>all</STRONG> employment income paid during the entitlement period as <STRONG>IOP</STRONG> or <STRONG>LOP</STRONG>. See <A href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010010-01.html">Recording and correcting employment income details</A></LI>
<LI>Restore the payment via the Benefit Action (<STRONG>BA</STRONG>) screen and finalise the activity</LI>
<LI>Check and ensure that the customer's Job Seeker Registration is reactivated</LI>
<LI>Negotiate/renegotiate the job seeker's Job Plan with compulsory activity '<STRONG>Paid Work</STRONG>' and with the relevant number of working hours included. See<A href="../job-seekers/001-09100010-01.html"> Negotiating Job Plans</A></LI>
<LI>Once the Job Plan is completed, check that the Activity and Exemption Summary (<STRONG>AEX</STRONG>) screen is populated with the '<STRONG>PTW</STRONG>' approved activity. Job seeker should then be 'suspended' from their services with their employment services provider and is Centrelink managed</LI>
<LI>Tell the customer to keep reporting and to include any employment income paid on their normal reporting day. If income will be too high, the nil rate period process may apply. See <A href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010160-01.html">Employment income nil rate period</A></LI>
