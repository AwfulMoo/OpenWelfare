<p>If a customer contacts to tell they have commenced employment and it is <strong>not</strong> their reporting day, record a <strong>DOC</strong> with employment details. Tell the customer to report on their reporting day with all the details of their employment. Explain to them how to report correctly.</p>

<p>Obtain the following details from the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
date of commencement of employment</li>
		<li>
type of employment&#58; part-time, casual, full-time ongoing</li>
		<li>
employer's name and Australian Business Number (ABN)</li>
		<li>
employer's phone number</li>
		<li>
gross employment income per week/fortnight</li>
		<li>
period of employment, if known</li>
		<li>
ensure the customer is now a 2 weekly reporter and advise the customer of any changes to their reporting requirements, for example, they are now required to report every 2 weeks</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>DOC minimum standards</strong> only require the collection and recording of enough information about the employer (for example, contact name and address or phone number) to allow income assessment, as well as contact with the employer if necessary. Contact may be necessary to verify income details provided or to conduct reviews resulting from Data Matching with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). Some customers (for example, those who work in sensitive areas like women's refuges) may not want all employment details (for example, business name) recorded on a <strong>DOC</strong>. This does not affect the requirement to collect sufficient information for assessment or review purposes.</p>

<p>For <strong>JSP</strong> or <strong>YA job seekers</strong>, determine if the customer has ongoing entitlement to payment. They must still be able to satisfy the sufficient work test, mutual obligation requirements and continue to report on their normal reporting due date.</p>

<p><strong>JSP job seekers who have returned to full-time work who may still be eligible for payment </strong></p>

<p>The most common examples of full-time workers who might qualify for JSP payment without further activity requirements are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
job seekers with a pensioner partner (the income test for these couples results in a cut-off point for JSP which is considerably higher than applies to individuals and couples where both receive an income support payment such as JSP)</li>
		<li>
long term single JSP customers aged 60 or over who receive Rent Assistance (RA) (the cut-out point for such cases can also exceed full-time minimum wages)</li>
		<li>
JSP single principal carers (the income test for these customers may allow them to continue to be entitled to part rate of JSP after all Working Credits have been exhausted)</li>
		<li>
job seekers with a working credit balance at the entitlement period start date that they are paid employment income, see <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-07030080-03.html#bp03_tbl_Unfavourable_decisio_Step01">Step 1 in Table 2</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>For information on sufficient work test and mutual obligation requirements, see <a href="../job-seekers/001-09070070-01.html">Paid work as an approved activity</a>.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
if the job seeker does <strong>not have</strong> continuing entitlement and payment has not been cancelled, see <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-07030080-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Unfavourable_decisio">Step 1 in Table 2</a></li>
		<li>
if the job seeker does <strong>not have</strong> continuing entitlement and payment has been cancelled under reason '<strong>FTE</strong>' (Full time employment, paid income not advised), <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-07030080-03.html#bp03_tbl_Determining_entitlem_Step08">go to Step 8</a></li>

if the job seeker <strong>does have</strong> continuing entitlement, including wherepayment has been cancelled under reason '<strong>FTE</strong>' (Full time employment, paid income not advised), <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-07030080-03.html#bp03_tbl_Determining_entitlem_Step09">go to Step 9</a></li>		</ul>

<p>When a provider advises a job seeker has been placed in full-time ongoing employment, an electronic transaction will be sent via the Department of Education, Skills and Employment system to Services Australia, which updates the job seeker's record.</p>

<p>The transaction will also automatically update the Employment Status with the '<strong>FTO</strong>' code on the Customer Employment Status (<strong>EAES</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>When this occurs, record the employment income as ongoing income so the customer can access their Working Credit balance. If there is no ongoing income recorded &quot;after three reporting periods&quot;, the job seeker's payment is auto-cancelled. After the depletion of the Working Credit, their payment will be auto cancelled.</p>

<p>If there is no ongoing income recorded, the job seeker's payment is auto cancelled under reason of '<strong>FTE</strong>' from the date they commenced full-time employment. The job seeker is not able to utilise their Working Credit balance unless employment income is reported and payment is restored.</p>

<p>If it is confirmed that the job seeker has commenced full-time ongoing employment, to restore payment and apply Working Credit provision correctly&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
restore the payment via the Benefit Action (<strong>BA</strong>) screen. Before finalising, code employment income from the date the job seeker is first paid and then finalise the activity</li>
		<li>
if payment is current, check if the job seeker is still required to report for the next entitlement period. If so, advise the job seeker of the requirement to still report on the report due date and that their payment will automatically cancel once their Working Credit is depleted</li>
		<li>
record details on a <strong>DOC</strong></li>
		</ul>
<p>If the job seeker disputes that they have not commenced work or the work is non-ongoing (i.e. casual or only part-time), see <a href="../job-seekers/001-02070040-01.html">Jobactive/Community Development Program (CDP) registration inactivated and cancellation of income support in error</a>.</p>
