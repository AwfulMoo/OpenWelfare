<p>Ministerial order No.798 enables the applicant of a Temporary Retirement visa (subclass 410) before 1 December 1998 to be eligible for Medicare under the conditions of their relevant Reciprocal Health Care Agreement (RHCA).</p>

<p>The holder of a visa subclass 410, who <strong>applied or had their visa issued before 1 December 1998</strong> and who was a resident of a RHCA country prior to arriving in Australia has an option to either&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
enrol in Medicare under the terms of the relevant RHCA,<strong> </strong>(their Medicare record in CDMS must notate RHCA ACCEPTANCE)</li>
		<li>
apply annually for an exemption from the Medicare levy by lodging an application for a Medicare Entitlement Statement</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>New enrolments</strong></p>

<p>410 visa holders, who have not enrolled in Medicare before and had <strong>applied or had their visa issued before 1 December 1998</strong>, must complete a <strong>410 Option form</strong> to declare whether they are opting to be enrolled in Medicare or apply annually for an exemption to the Medicare levy. These forms can be obtained from Medicare Consumers Program Support.</p>

<p>These application requests must be forwarded to Medicare Consumers Program Support, where a 410 Option form will be sent to the 410 visa holder for completion.</p>

<p>Medicare Consumers Program Support will action these initial requests.</p>

<p><strong>Eligibility extension</strong></p>

<p>410 visa holders who had applied or had their visa issued before 1 December 1998 and are already enrolled in Medicare (Group comments should state 'RHCA ACCEPTANCE'), do not need to complete a new 410 Option form. Service Officers can extend their Medicare entitlement for a period of 5 years or till the end of their visa (whichever comes first).</p>

<p>Where the 410 visa holder has a Medicare card, but 'RHCA ACCEPTANCE' is not notated in their Medicare record on CDMS in the comments tab, contact Medicare Consumers Program Support.</p>

<p><strong>Re-enrolment</strong></p>

<p>410 visa holders, who are re-enrolling in Medicare and had <strong>initially applied or had their visa issued before 1 December 1998</strong>, do <strong>not</strong> need to complete a 410 Option form. Where they have been residing outside Australia and their 410 visas do not run consecutively, they cannot be re-enrolled in Medicare.</p>
