<p>The SSS will be paid automatically to eligible customers. Customers do not need to claim SSS.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> from 1 July 2017 no SSS will be paid automatically for any customers, including those who were previously grandfathered.</p>

<p>The system identifies whether a customer meets the grandfathering rules for SSS and will pay eligible students who have been on continuous payments prior to 1 January 2016.</p>

<p>Customers must receive at least $1 of basic benefit during the period in order to qualify for SSS. Receipt of Rent Assistance (RA) and/or Pharmaceutical Allowance (PhA) (or other supplements) alone do not qualify the customer for the SSS. This means if reported income reduces basic benefit to nil, then the scholarship will not pay. Services Australia issues letters informing customers of the expected pay date for scholarships.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
SSS payments are not included when calculating a customer's advance payment entitlements</li>
		<li>
SSS payments are not taxable</li>
		<li>
SSS is usually paid as a lump sum, however, where a customer's YA, Austudy or ABSTUDY payment is <strong>income managed</strong>, the SSS will be income managed at 100%</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a customer has ceased receiving a Commonwealth Education Costs Scholarship (CECS), the CECS <strong>must</strong> be end dated on the Higher Education Scholarship (<strong>!HES</strong>) screen or the SSS will not be granted for the new course or education institution. The end date that must be used is either 30 Jun or 31 Dec in the study period in which CECS ceased, regardless of the actual date that the customer ceased receiving it.</p>

<p>For <strong>continuing students</strong> (such as customers whose student start date is before the current period) who qualify in a particular period, the automatic payment will be issued in late February or early March for the first period and in late July for the second period (as long as they qualify in both periods).</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> no SSS will be paid for a date of effect on or after 1 July 2017. This step should only be followed if a customer was deemed eligible for SSS prior to 1 July 2017 and was not automatically paid by the system.</p>

<p>This also applies if the customer was qualified for a CECS during that period but did not receive it only because their CECS was suspended (for example, because the customer failed to meet CECS performance requirements in a preceding period).</p>

<p>There are 2 categories of CECS&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Indigenous CECS - funding for up to eight scholarship periods to assist students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate diploma (or equivalent post graduate study)</li>
		<li>
Indigenous Enabling CECS - funding for up to two scholarship periods to assist students to undertake an eligible enabling course. Written evidence provided by customers may not identify that the scholarship is a Commonwealth Education Costs Scholarship (CECS) and may refer only to the category (for example, National Priority Scholarship)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> CECS takes precedence over SSS. This means that if a person receives both a CECS and a SSS within a 6 month period, the SSS will be a debt.</p>

<p>Some overpayments will be raised automatically by the system based on coding on the Education Course Details (<strong>EDC</strong>) screen. The student end date is compared with the student start date to determine whether the student is studying in an approved scholarship course on day 35. See <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-07030050-01.html">Scholarship study requirements</a> for more information.</p>

<p>All students with a student start date in the same period (for example, same semester, same year etc) will have their overpayment calculated automatically by the system.</p>

<p>Continuing students or students with a student start date in an earlier period will need to be checked to ensure that the overpayment is raised correctly. These students must have re-commenced studies in the new year/semester and be studying in an approved scholarship course for 35 days to remain eligible for the SSS payment. If the student is not studying on day 35 after they have commenced or re-commenced an approved scholarship course, the system does not automatically raise the SSS as an overpayment. The SSS payment will need to be manually raised as an overpayment.</p>

<p>The system will automatically use a default study start date in order to ensure scholarship payments are generated during each scholarship period. As a result, when updating a study end date, the system may determine a particular customer is eligible or not eligible for a scholarship payment based on this default study start date. As this date is not an accurate reflection of the actual start date for the customer in any ongoing semester/study period, a debt should be raised, and the Higher Education Scholarship (<strong>!HES</strong>) screen updated accordingly. Conversely, when it is identified that a debt should not have been raised, the record should be documented clearly for the teams managing these debts to be aware of the circumstances and investigate accordingly.</p>

<p>If a student's start date is in a previous period, the system will try to determine whether the student qualifies in the current period by calculating 35 days from the default study start date. However, the default study start date may not be the same as the student's actual institution start date in the current period. Therefore, when coding a course end date for a continuing student, determine the actual institution start date for the current period, and ensure the customer is studying in an approved scholarship course on day 35 since that date. If there are less than 35 days between the actual start date and the student's end date in the relevant period, an overpayment of SSS must be manually raised for the period.</p>

<p>Even if the system automatically creates a debt shell when a course end date is coded for a continuing student, the actual institution start date must still be confirmed, in order to determine whether the customer is currently studying on day 35 in this period.</p>

<p>For example, some institution start dates may occur prior to the default study start date. In these cases a student may actually have undertaken 35 days of study, despite the system automatically creating a debt shell when an end date is coded within 35 days of the default study start date.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; there is a known system issue where the SSS payment is paid when a student is granted payment retrospectively and is yet to report their income. If the customer reports income which results in nil (basic) payable then an undetermined debt activity will be created. This is because the customer is not qualified for the SSS until all of the eligibility conditions are met. The activity should be held to check if the customer meets qualification in a future period.</p>
