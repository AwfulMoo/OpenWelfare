	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>An amended NOCH or NOPB can be considered in certain circumstances. Criteria for review will depend on whether&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the claim is pre or post settlement</li>
		<li>
the notice was from a verified statement or all services were taken</li>
		<li>
the notice was valid or expired at the date of review request or date of judgement or settlement (DOJ/DOS)</li>
		</ul>
<p>While additional specific review circumstances are outlined later, general circumstances for review of a notice include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
there is an identified <strong>processing error</strong> and services or costs have been incorrectly included</li>
		<li>
in response to a request from the compensation payer when they have <strong>already paid the account</strong></li>
		<li>
a care cost amount (in full or in part) <strong>does not relate</strong> to the compensable injury or illness. Medical evidence is required to remove previously identified care costs and <strong>must be escalated to Programme Management</strong></li>
		<li>
some or all of the identified services <strong>do not relate</strong> to the compensable injury or illness</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Remove previously verified services</strong></p>

<p>Where a request is received to amend a NOCH or NOPB by processing a new statement by claimant to remove previously verified services, the statement must be clear. Either&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the services to be removed are crossed out or have a line through them</li>
		<li>
some of the previously verified services are re-ticked, others left unticked, or</li>
		<li>
it has a comment beside the service indicating it does not relate</li>
		</ul>
<p>Initials are not required when services are to be removed.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>General reasons for review also apply as listed above, however Services Australia may consider that a completed statement by claimant should <strong>not be used</strong> to amend a valid NOPB - all services taken. The agency will evaluate the completed statement by claimant on a case-by-case basis. Factors to consider include whether&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the statement by claimant is substantially correct</li>
		<li>
<strong>written evidence has been provided</strong> from the compensation payer or claimant’s solicitor that the case cannot be finalised by judgment or settlement without an accurate notice, as the claim must be&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
endorsed by a judge and a trial date has been set, <strong>or</strong></li>
			<li>
endorsed or sanctioned by the Public Trustee</li>		</ul>
		<li>
the notice is due to expire prior to an upcoming trial date or sanctioning conference</li>
		<li>
the injured person has claimed further eligible benefits consistent with the compensable injury or illness, since the Medicare history statement (MHS) was issued</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the agency determines the statement by claimant should <strong>not be used</strong> to amend the NOPB - all services taken, a new MHS may be issued to the injured person or claimant.</p>

<p>Service Delivery APS5 can approve to process a statement by the claimant with&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a recompleted statement by the claimant, and</li>
		<li>
written evidence from the compensation payer or claimant’s solicitor that the case cannot be finalised by judgment or settlement without an accurate notice, as the claim must be&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
endorsed by a judge and a trial date has been set, <strong>or</strong></li>
			<li>
endorsed or sanctioned by the Public Trustee</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>Where the agency determines the statement by claimant <strong>can be used</strong> to amend the NOPB - all services taken, a new verified NOPB will be issued. An APS5 or above must approve before using a completed statement by claimant to amend the valid NOPB - all services taken.</p>

<p>When a <strong>valid</strong> NOPB - all services taken is <strong>due to expire in less than 4 weeks</strong> and a judgment or settlement <strong>has not been fixed and is not likely to be fixed</strong> in the near future, suspend the case indefinitely. Upon receipt of a new request for MHS, issue a new MHS to the injured person or claimant.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A decision by Services Australia to <strong>refuse to give an amended notice</strong> normally occurs when the injured person has failed to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
satisfy the agency that not all of the services taken were related to the injury or illness, <strong>and/or</strong></li>
		<li>
seek a review of the amount within 2 years of a judgment or settlement being fixed</li>
		</ul>
<p>The delegation to refuse to give an amended notice - all services taken is at <strong>APS5 level and above</strong>.</p>

<p>Application may be made <strong>in writing</strong> by the injured person for a review of the decision to refuse to give an amended notice and must be made <strong>within 28 days</strong> after the injured person is notified of the decision. If an application for reconsideration is made, the subsequent review <strong>must not</strong> be reconsidered by the person who refused to give the amended notice and the case must be referred to Programme Management for further consideration.</p>

<p>The person reconsidering the decision must affirm or vary the decision <strong>with 28 days</strong> after the application for reconsideration is made. If a decision has been reconsidered, the injured person can then apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for further review of the decision as affirmed or varied.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p><strong>Role of the AAT</strong></p>

<p>The AAT provides an independent review of administrative decisions made by government departments, agencies and some non-government bodies.</p>

<p>Both individuals and government agencies use the services of the AAT.</p>

<p>Medicare Compensation Recovery, statements or amended statements that are determined to be not substantially correct under Sections 18, 23A or 23B of the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995, (the HOSC Act) are the only decisions that are appealable to the AAT.</p>

<p><strong>When an injured person or claimant disputes a decision</strong></p>

<p>An injured person or claimant may dispute a decision made by Services Australia, when&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the agency determines a statement by claimant under section 18 of the HOSC Act is not substantially correct (because seemingly related items have not been identified)</li>
		<li>
the agency determines a statement after judgment or settlement under section 23A of the HOSC Act is not substantially correct (because seemingly related Medicare benefits or care costs have not been identified), or</li>
		<li>
the agency refuses to give a notice under section 18(7) of the HOSC Act (because it has been more than 2 years since the date of settlement or judgment)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Internal review</strong></p>

<p>There is no avenue for internal review of a not substantially correct decision as opportunities to provide supporting evidence are given as part of the process. An injured person or claimant who is unsatisfied with such a decision may apply to the AAT for a ruling.</p>

<p><strong>Receiving notification of an AAT appeal</strong></p>

<p>Forward notification of an AAT appeal to the Programme Management mailbox as soon as it is received.</p>

<p>When the notification of an AAT appeal is the first notification of a dispute, all documentation and previous decisions made regarding the disputed case must be forwarded by Programme Management to the AAT.</p>

<p><strong>Formal AAT decisions</strong></p>

<p>When an AAT decision is made in favour of the agency, the compensation case will proceed and money will be recovered in accordance with that decision.</p>

<p>When the AAT decision is made in favour of the injured person or claimant, the agency is bound by the terms of the decision and will proceed accordingly.</p>

<p><strong>Charges for lodging an application</strong></p>

<p>The AAT will inform the injured person or claimant of any fee associated with lodging an application or whether the injured person or claimant is exempt from paying any such fees.</p>

<p>Contact the AAT&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
in person</li>
		<li>
by telephone, or </li>
		<li>
in writing (by letter, fax or email)</li>
		</ul>
<p>The AAT website has the contact details for each State and Territory. See the <a href="../your-health/011-15030070-05.html">Resources</a> page for a link to the AAT website (containing contact phone number and email address).</p>
