<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the customer was not claiming or receiving an eligible payment or concession card on the eligibility test date/s, the system will not have run a check on the customer's Economic Support Payment eligibility.

<p>If a customer had a pending (NCL) activity for a benefit type that attracts the <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-20033043-01.html">Coronavirus Supplement</a> on an Economic Support Payment test date, the system will not run an assessment for the Economic Support Payment until a later date. This is because customers receiving the Coronavirus Supplement at a rate of more than $0 are not eligible to receive the second, third or fourth Economic Support Payments and the customer has a pending NCL activity.</p>

<p>However, if that pending new claim is later rejected and the customer was receiving an eligible benefit or concession card on the test date, they will become eligible to receive the Economic Support Payment. A 12 week automatic review of the system will be undertaken following the scheduled Economic Support Payments test dates to pick up any remaining cases where eligible customers did not receive the payment and automatically issue the payment.</p>

<p>If the customer is in financial hardship and requests that their payment be issued before the automatic review of the system, please refer the case to Technical Peer Support (TPS) via the <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-05070010-01.html">Technical Peer Support (TPS) model</a>.</p>
