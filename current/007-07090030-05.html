<p><strong>Customer contacts on 10 September 2020 (2020-21 financial year) requesting restoration of FTB</strong></p>

<p>FTB was cancelled on 24 May 2019 (in the 2018-19 financial year).</p>

<p>This can be confirmed by checking the Benefit Status (<strong>XBS</strong>) screen in the FAO system.</p>

<p>As FTB was cancelled on 24 May 2019 (2018-19 financial year), it cannot be restored as the cancellation DOV is before 01 July 2019 and the customer has not contacted until the 2020-21 financial year. Therefore, the customer must lodge a new claim to start receiving FTB via instalments.</p>

<p>For this example, the <strong>XBS</strong> screen will read as follows&#58;</p>

<p>FTB 208 .................FTB…01JUL19……INC… CAN</p>

<p>FTB 208 ………......FTB…24MAY19…..NIE… CAN</p>

<p>FTB 161D208 …….FTB…24MAY19…..INC… CAN</p>

<p>FTB 95 …………….FTB…10DEC17…………. CUR</p>

<p><strong>How to read the XBS screen correctly</strong>&#58;</p>

<p>FTB instalments were granted from 10 December 2017 and remained current until 24 May 2019 when an estimate update has cancelled payments due to excess income (activity number 161).</p>

<p>FTB for the 2018-2019 financial year was reconciled in activity number 208 causing the FTB cancellation status to change from <strong>INC</strong> to <strong>NIE</strong> (no instalment entitlement) from 24 May 2019. Note that activity number 208 has <strong>D</strong>eleted activity number 161.</p>

<p>The same activity number (208) has also created a new line from 1 July 2019 with a cancellation status of <strong>INC</strong>. However, the correct cancellation date in this case is 24 May 2019 as the customer has not claimed or received instalment payments since that date.</p>

<p><strong>Customer separates - restoration in current financial year</strong></p>

<p>Megan and Tom are in receipt of FTB. On 7 July 2020, an uplift is applied to their estimate, increasing it to $60,000 each, a combined total of $120,000. This results in FTB <strong>CAN-INC</strong> (cancelled income).</p>

<p>On 13 October 2020, Megan and Tom separate and Megan lodges an FTB New claim on 3 November 2020. Megan provides an income estimate of $70,000 in the FTB new claim (NCL).</p>

<p>As Megan's FTB <strong>is CAN-INC </strong>in the current financial year, the new claim is considered a request for restoration.</p>

<p>After the separation details have been recorded, the FTB can be restored from 13 October 2020 (date of separation). The estimate provided is coded with a date of event (DOE) of 3 November 2020 (date of receipt of the new claim).</p>

<p>The period from 13 October to 2 November 2020 will be paid based on the previous estimate of $60,000. From 3 November 2020, the new estimate of $70,000 will be used to assess the FTB payment.</p>

<p>The non-payment period from 7 July 2020 to 12 October 2020 can only be assessed after the end of the financial year once income has been confirmed and the customer had lodged a lump sum claim.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the system is attempting to pay FTB arrears for the <strong>CAN-INC</strong> periods when being restored based on a previous estimate which is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Lower</strong> than the most recent estimate provided, the previous estimate should be corrected to match the estimate most recently supplied</li>

<p><strong>FTB cancelled income (CAN-INC) after an uplifted estimate has been applied – customer is requesting restoration in current financial year</strong></p>

<p>Sally is in receipt of FTB. A letter was sent asking Sally to provide an income estimate for Sally and partner Tim for the 2020/2021 new financial year.</p>

<p>Sally did not reply to the letter within 21 days. The Automatic Uplift of both Sally and Tim’s estimate was applied by the system. As a result their combined family income estimate exceeded the income threshold and FTB cancelled income (CAN-INC) on 3 July 2020.</p>

<p>On 30 October 2020 Sally contacts to provide a revised estimate and request restoration of FTB entitlement. Restoration can occur if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the revised estimate is considered reasonable and is provided in the current financial year;</li>
		<li>
Sally has remained eligible for FTB since the date of cancellation; and</li>
		<li>
there has been no change in circumstance since the date of cancellation</li>
		</ul>
<p>As Sally meets the above criteria, FTB is restored from 30 October 2020, the date the revised estimate is provided.</p>

<p>Sally’s entitlement for the CAN-INC non-payment period between 3 July 2020 and date of restoration can only be assessed after the end of the financial year when income has been confirmed allowing reconciliation to occur. Sally will be required to lodge a lump sum claim once actual income is known for the 2020/2021 year.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Sally must confirm income and lodge the lump sum claim by the end of the lodgement year (30 June 2022).</p>

<p><strong>Customer contacts on 1 August 2020 requesting restoration of FTB - has not remained eligible</strong></p>

<p>FTB was cancelled on 2 March 2020 due to an update of shared care, which reduced the customer's percentage to 0%. The customer's care of the child returned to 100% from 29 June 2020. As the customer has not remained eligible for FTB from the date of cancellation, the customer must lodge a new claim for the current financial year.</p>

		<li>
Within the new claim activity ensure the estimate is manually recorded for the current financial year (DOV = date of notification of the revised estimate) as the DOV will default to 1 July of current financial year</li>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> a non-payment period for the 2020/21 financial year will exist for the period 1 July 2020-11 October 2020. Once reconciliation has occurred for 2020/21, the customer is advised of this non-payment period via the reconciliation result letter. The customer's FTB reconciliation letter will advise them if they have not been assessed for the full financial year to lodge a lump sum claim so their entitlement for that period can be checked.</p></td>

<p><strong>Restoration following multiple cancellations in the current financial year </strong></p>

<p><strong>Example&#58;</strong> Income Support Payment (ISP) and FTB current customer travelled overseas 19 April 2021 and returned to Australia 7 June 2021. Automatic restoration of FTB was unsuccessful upon return.</p>

<p>The customers ISP cancelled from date of departure causing FTB to cancel Off Income Support (OIS) 10 May 2021 as a new income estimate was not provided. As customer was outside of Australia greater than 6 weeks, FTB then cancelled <strong>FTB/CAN-6WK</strong>.</p>

<p>Customer contacts 7 June 2021 to advise of return to Australia and the <strong>FTB/CAN-6WK</strong> is restored.</p>

<p>A second restoration activity is required for the FTB/CAN-OIS period. The customer will need to provide a revised income estimate to assess the gap in entitlement. The <strong>DOV</strong> of the estimate will be the date paid to plus 1 day (DPT+1).</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> this may also occur where the <strong>FTB/CAN-6WK</strong> cancellation restores automatically with the customers return to Australia, Restoration of the <strong>FTB/CAN-OIS</strong> period will still be required.</p>

<p><strong>DSP Customers&#58;</strong> The portability period for DSP is 28 days and FTB is 42 days. Where a DSP customer is overseas greater than 29 days, FTB will enter an Off Income Support review period. Where a mutual DSP and FTB customer is overseas longer than 42 days&#58;</p>

<p>A new income estimate will be required using a DOV = 1 July of the current financial year (earliest date) as current year estimates cannot be updated for a previous financial year. </p>

<p><strong>Arrears from 1 June 2021 will pay immediately</strong> if reconciliation is pending as the FTB rate is not subject to an income test.</p>

<p><strong>Example&#58;</strong> Income Support Payment (ISP) cancels resulting in FTB/CAN-OIS on 26 June 2021. Customer contacts to restore their FTB on 17 July 2021. The customer had a gap in their ISP as they were subject to an ISP nil rate after reporting their earnings.</p>
