<p>WP customers getting payment level Carer Allowance (CA) on 19 March 2020 were automatically transferred to CP if they were also receiving CA on 20 March 2020 and not in a bereavement period.</p>

<p>WP customers current on CA Health Care Card (HCC) only on 19 March 2020 were not eligible to be transferred to CP.</p>

<p>Some eligible WP customers paid under social security law by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA) were manually transferred to Centrelink administration.</p>

<p>Special rules applied if payment level CA was not payable on both 19 March 2020 and 20 March 2020.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>Most transfers from WP to CP occurred on and were effective from 20 March 2020.</p>

<p>WP customers in a bereavement period on 20 March 2020 are transferred to CP at the end of the bereavement period. Where payment level CA is not paid at the end of the WP bereavement period, CP is not payable, WP will cancel and the customer will need to claim an appropriate income support payment.</p>

<p>When WP is suspended on 19 March (and not in a bereavement period), the transfer will be effective from 20 March 2020 and completed at the time of restoration (provided this is within 13 weeks of 20 March 2020).</p>

<p>Some transfers to CP under WP provisions must be done manually. This is when action is taken after 20 March 2020 to grant or restore CA with a date of effect on or before 19 March 2020. WP customers became eligible to transfer from WP to CP retrospectively after they were already transferred to Age Pension or JobSeeker Payment on 20 March 2020. Manual Follow Ups (MFUs) are produced to manually grant CP under WP provisions from 20 March 2020. See the <a href="../carers/009-19081557-05.html">Resources</a> page.</p>

<p>CP (XWP) is CP paid under grandfathering rules to carers who were receiving WP and payment level CA on 19 March 2020, and payment level CA on 20 March 2020. The benefit status line shows CAR/CUR-XWP when current. This can be viewed in Process Direct and on Customer Summary in Customer First.</p>

<p>CP (Standard) is CP paid to carers who are not receiving CP under grandfathering rules.</p>

<p>The terms CP (Standard) and CP (XWP) are for internal use only. When assisting customers, both CP types should be referred to as ‘Carer Payment’.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>CP (XWP) customers remain entitled to CP under grandfathering provisions provided they continue to get payment level CA without a break in payment entitlement since 19 March 2020.</p>

<p>It’s not necessary for CA to be paid for the same care receiver since 19 March 2020. The continuity of CA can be maintained by different CA care receivers attracting payment level CA for the same or different periods, provided the customer is continuously entitled to payment level CA for any care receiver from 19 March 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Identifying eligibility for CP (XWP)</strong></p>

<p>Carers who have been eligible for CP (XWP) at some point can be identified on the Grandfathering Summary (<strong>GFS</strong>) screen with a grandfathering type <strong>2020 Former WP-CARER</strong>. If the customer is no longer eligible, the latest grandfathering status will be ‘<strong>NOT</strong>’ (not grandfathered). However, a NOT status is automatically deleted if payment level CA entitlement is re-instated without a gap. If currently eligible, the latest status will be <strong>GRF</strong>, <strong>GRO</strong> or <strong>BRV</strong>. Customers currently paid CP (XWP) also show <strong>CAR/CUR-XWP</strong> on the Benefit Status line.</p>

<p>The carer’s grandfathering status history is shown on the Grandfathering Override (<strong>GFD</strong>) screen. For an explanation of the codes, see Updating the <strong>2020 Former WP–CARER</strong> grandfathering type on <a href="../carers/009-19081557-05.html">Resources</a> page.</p>

<p>In most cases grandfathering status changes will be automatic. Manual updates to the <strong>GFD</strong> screen can be done by officers who are APS5 or above.</p>

<p>A CP that is currently assessed under Ex Wife Pension rules will show an Assessment Type of XWP on the Care Assessment Result Summary (<strong>SCRR</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>A Display on Access <strong>DOC</strong> will also indicate the carer has been transferred from WP to CP under grandfathering provisions. These <strong>DOC</strong>s are only created for CP XWP records as part of the bulk transfer. </p>

<p>The following do not apply to CP (XWP)&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
activity hours (employment, voluntary work, study) for example, the <a href="../carers/009-06030030-01.html">25 hour rule</a></li>

CP Care Receiver Income and Asset Assessment (CRIA) or</li>
			<li>
CP medical reviews (CA medical reviews will continue to apply)</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; carers paid under CP (XWP) provisions are still subject to existing CP assessments that are not linked to the care receiver or the care provided. For example, income, assets and portability assessments. All CA qualification and payability rules continue to apply. </p>

<p><strong>25 hour per week rule</strong></p>

<p>Self-service reporting channels do not request hours for paid employment and other activities for CP (XWP) customers or partners. </p>

<p><strong>Temporary cessation of care (respite and hospitalisation) rules</strong></p>

<p><a href="../carers/009-06010010-01.html">Temporary Cessation of Care</a> (respite and <a href="../carers/009-06010020-01.html">hospitalisation</a>) rules do not apply directly to CP (XWP). However they continue to apply to CA and may indirectly affect CP (XWP) entitlement.</p>

<p>When a carer has used their 63 Temporary Cessation of Care (TCC) days for respite, or their allowable 63 days for hospitalisation for a care receiver aged 16 and over, CA will cancel as per existing process. </p>

<p>Respite codes that relate only to CP should not be coded for a period the carer is receiving CP (XWP). However, if coded for a period the customer is getting CP (XWP), the days coded in that period will not affect entitlement. </p>

<p><strong>Other differences</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
CP (XWP) cannot be paid under an international agreement</li>
		<li>
Where the only or last CA care receiver permanently enters an institution, CP (XWP) is not payable for an additional 14 weeks</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Bereavement provisions</strong></p>

<p>The CP (XWP) 14 week bereavement continuation period only applies to CP (XWP) customers where the last or only care receiver dies.</p>

<p><strong>Taxability</strong></p>

<p>CP (XWP) is taxable if either&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the carer is Age Pension age, or </li>
		<li>
any of the care receivers the carer gets payment level CA for are Age Pension age</li>
		</ul>
<p>This means CP (XWP) can change from a taxable to non-taxable payment or from a non-taxable to taxable payment. </p>

<p>An example of a change from a taxable to non-taxable payment is as follows&#58; the carer is under Age Pension age. Payment level CA ceases for a care receiver who is Age Pension age and the carer continues to be paid for another care receiver under Age Pension age. </p>

<p>Carers will need to reclaim CP if their CP (XWP) has been cancelled and cannot be restored, for example due to income or asset changes or a break in payment level CA. A carer cannot claim CP (XWP) and will be required to claim and first be assessed under CP (Standard) provisions. </p>

<p>If there has not been any break in payment level CA since 19 March 2020, a carer will still be eligible for CP under WP grandfathering provisions.  If not eligible for CP (Standard), CP (XWP) will be auto granted if eligible. They are notified of the reason for rejection of CP (Standard) and the grant of CP (XWP) in the same letter.</p>

<p>A current CP (XWP) carer may wish to claim CP under Standard (non-grandfathered) provisions for benefits not available under CP (XWP) such as&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
14 weeks CP continuation if their only/last CA care receiver is likely to be permanently admitted to an institution</li>
		<li>

		<li>
caring for more than one care receiver and wishing to be paid an LBP for one who is not their partner</li>

<p>If a CP (Standard) customer is eligible for CP (XWP) and CP should be cancelled for a CP care receiver reason, constant care or failing the 25 hour rule, a warning is produced on the <strong>AWE</strong> screen.
