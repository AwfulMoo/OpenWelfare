<h3>Recording JobKeeper Payment for Employees</h3>


<p>Staff must find out the gross income earned by the customer, or their partner, including any payments made under JobKeeper Payment.</p>

<p>The assessment rules to follow will depend on if the period of JobKeeper Payment was paid before or after 7 December 2020, or paid as back pay.</p>

<p></p>
<a class="anchor" name="bp05_L3TT_Before_7_Decemb"></a>
<h3>Before 7 December 2020</h3>

		<ul>		<li>
Apportion the JobKeeper Payment income at a daily rate for the number of days the Reporting Period crosses over with the JobKeeper fortnight</li>
		<li>
Divide the relevant tier of JobKeeper Payment by 14 days to get a daily amount</li>
		<li>
Multiply the daily rate by the number of days of the JobKeeper Payment fortnight in the Centrelink reporting period</li>
		<li>
Add this income together with any employment income earned in the Reporting Period on the days before the fortnight that was only JobKeeper Payment income to find out the gross income</li>
		<li>
Use this method if the rate of JobKeeper Payment reduces in the reporting period that is, 28 September 2020 or 4 January 2021. Use the above calculation for each of the different JobKeeper Payment fortnights to come to the total amount for the reporting period</li>
		<li>
Review the historical version of this procedure for more information (pre-7 December 2020). Go to the <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010000-03.html">Process</a> page. Click the <strong>Page history</strong> button and select the relevant date</li>

<p>To determine the assessable earnings for the reporting period&#58;</p>

<p>In this case, the customer should have the higher amount of $600 due to JobKeeper Payment applied to their record as earnings. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> the presence of a JobKeeper Payment top up in the payslip may indicate&#58;</p>

<p>The assessable earnings for the reporting period is the combined amount of the two figures below&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The income and hours relevant to the days worked must be worked out as per the normal income reporting</li>
		<li>
Calculate the amount of JobKeeper Payment income relevant to each day in the reporting period</li>

<p><strong>For example&#58;</strong></p>

<h3>After 7 December 2020</h3>


<p>The assessment of JobKeeper income is based on the relevant payslip periods advised by the customer's employer and <strong>not</strong> the ATO fortnights.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Record the gross income paid to the customer/partner in the entitlement period</li>
		<li>
Record the actual hours the customer or partner has worked in the entitlement period. If no hours worked, record '0' (zero) hours</li>
		<li>
With the exception of the first and last periods of JobKeeper Payment income, customers will be reporting a minimum amount of income per fortnightly reporting period. For example, $650 or $1,000 if their only income from their employer is from JobKeeper Payment</li>
		<li>
In some cases it may be apparent that a person has been underpaid their JobKeeper Payment. In this situation, apply these instructions to the gross amount paid rather than the amount they should have received. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> JobKeeper Payment income should not be recorded as ongoing earnings as this may result in an underpayment to the customer if the JobKeeper Payment reduces or stops</li>
		</ul>
<p>Record any other earnings paid from non-JobKeeper employers separately as employment income in the entitlement period.</p>

<p></p>
<a class="anchor" name="bp05_L3GT_Back_pay_of_Job"></a>
<h3>Back pay of JobKeeper Payment</h3>


<p><strong>Back pay of JobKeeper received after 7 December 2020</strong></p>

<p>Back pay of JobKeeper Payment, received after 7 December 2020, is treated as a remunerative lump sum (see <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-05020020-03.html">Treatment of lump sums</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Back pay of JobKeeper received before 7 December 2020</strong></p>

<p>Back pay of JobKeeper Payment received before 7 December 2020 is treated as a remunerative lump sum (see <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-05020020-03.html">Treatment of lump sums</a>)<strong> unless</strong> the person had present legal entitlement for the period the back pay was received for.</p>

<p>A customer would not have had present legal entitlement for back pay if their employer had not yet applied for JobKeeper Payment at the time the back pay relates to, or where the customer was not aware that their employer had applied for JobKeeper for them. <br>For example, no present legal entitlement can be had for the first period of JobKeeper Payment due to there being a delay between the announcement of the scheme and employers claiming and then paying JobKeeper payments to their employees.</p>

<p><strong>Back pay received prior to 7 December 2020, where the person had present legal entitlement for the full period the back pay was received for&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
The back pay is assessed as employment income and recorded in the period(s) that the back pay was paid for, see <strong>Before 7 December 2020</strong> instructions above</li>
		<li>

		<ul>		<li>
The back pay is assessed as a remunerative lump sum and is recorded from the date the person becomes legally entitled to receive the payment</li>
		<li>
The lump sum is <strong>assessed over a 52 week period</strong> from the date it’s recorded as having been received or able to be received</li>
		<li>
See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-05020020-03.html">Treatment of lump sums</a> for instructions on how to record the back pay</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Back pay received prior to 7 December 2020, where the person had present legal entitlement for part of the back pay received&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
The amounts should be separated into the portion where present legal entitlement existed and where it didn’t</li>
		<li>
Each amount should be treated as per the above based on whether present legal entitlement did or didn’t exist</li>

<h3>JobKeeper Payment for Farm Household Allowance (FHA) Customers</h3>


<p>If an FHA customer is an employee or a contractor for a business that is <strong>not</strong> directly related to their Farm Enterprise, staff must assess JobKeeper Payment income as Non-Farm Business Income. Per existing arrangements, Non-Farm Business Income can be used to reduce any farm business losses.</p>

<p>If an FHA customer is a contractor for a business that <strong>is</strong> directly related to their farming enterprise <strong>or</strong> they are a sole trader, member of a partnership or through a private trust or company, the JobKeeper Payment will be assessed within the business income and a new estimate via the phone or Profit &amp; Loss will be required. See <a href="../rural-and-remote-australians/002-02050000-01.html">Assessing income and assets for Farm Household Allowance (FHA)</a>.</p>
