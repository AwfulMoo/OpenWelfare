<p>This document outlines how to manage compulsory Quarterly Participation Interviews (QTI activity type) for job seekers assessed as having a Partial Capacity to Work (PCW) or a Temporary Reduced Work Capacity (TRWC) of either 0-7 or 8-14 hours per week.</p>

<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Purpose of the QTI</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The purpose of the QTI is to ensure job seekers remain engaged with Services Australia and are aware of voluntary participation options. These interviews are conducted every 12 weeks.</p>

<p>Job seekers with a QTI requirement are still <a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-18120553-01.html">required to report</a> and should be encouraged to use <img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> self service options (online accounts, Express Plus Mobile Apps and phone self service) to complete their report. They can also report in person at a service centre or submit their report in writing (SU19 form).</p>

<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Exemption from QTI</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Job seekers do not require a QTI if they have a current <a href="../job-seekers/001-09120000-01.html">exemption from their mutual obligation requirements</a>. This includes job seekers granted a <a href="../job-seekers/001-09120010-01.html">temporary incapacity exemption</a> because they have lodged a medical certificate and their Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) confirms that they have a TRWC of 0-7 hours per week and are unable to participate in a suitable activity.</p>

<p>A job seeker will be required to attend a QTI if they have a TRWC of 0-7 hours per week and cannot be granted a temporary incapacity exemption for any reason, or if they do have a temporary incapacity exemption and it expires while they still have a TRWC of 0-7 hours per week.</p>

<h2 id="_Toc344898764">PCW job seekers</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A job seeker has a PCW of less than 15 hours per week if both their current and future work capacity with intervention (as assessed in an ESAt) is less than 15 hours per week.</p>

<p>Job seekers with a PCW of 15-29 hours per week are not required to attend a QTI, unless they also have a TRWC of less than 15 hours per week for longer than 12 weeks.</p>

<p>For more information about requirements for all job seekers with a PCW, see <a href="../job-seekers/001-09070180-01.html">Job seekers with a partial capacity to work or a temporary reduced work capacity</a>.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>Job seekers with mutual obligation requirements are required to attend QTIs every 12 weeks if they have an assessed work capacity of&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
PCW of 0-7 or 8-14 hours per week, or</li>
		<li>
TRWC of 0-7 or 8-14 hours per week that <strong>extends beyond 12 weeks</strong></li>
		</ul>
<p>The criteria includes Centrelink managed job seekers living in a designated <a href="../job-seekers/001-02140000-01.html">Community Development Program (CDP)</a> area. If the job seeker fails to attend the appointment, their payment should be suspended and be prompted to make contact with the agency.</p>

<p>The 'Attend Quarterly Appointment' activity must be included in the job seeker's <a href="../job-seekers/001-09100000-01.html">Job Plan</a> as their only compulsory activity. The QTI activity must also be coded on the job seeker's Activity and Exemption Summary (<strong>AEX</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>QTI requirements apply to all job seekers with a PCW or TRWC 0-14 hours per week who are not fully meeting their requirements through paid employment. A job seeker cannot end their QTI requirement early because they wish to be connected to a jobactive, CDP or Disability Employment Services (DES) provider. These job seekers can <a href="../job-seekers/001-02040020-01.html">volunteer to participate in employment services</a>. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> job seekers assessed with a TRWC 0-7 cannot volunteer with a DES provider.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> job seekers with an assessed TRWC of 0-7 or 8-14 hours per week of <strong>less</strong> than 12 weeks duration are <strong>not</strong> required to attend QTIs, as this will not be included in their Job Plan. They are however still required to report and to attend compulsory Services Australia interviews when requested. The 'Reduced Capacity Requirements' activity must be included in their <a href="../job-seekers/001-09100000-01.html">Job Plan</a> as their only compulsory activity. If the TRWC is extended beyond 12 weeks, then QTIs will be required and must be included in their Job Plans.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>If a PCW or TRWC job seeker is in paid employment or self-employment within their assessed bandwidth, they are fully satisfying their mutual obligation requirements, and will not be subject to QTI requirements. These job seekers must have the appropriate compulsory activity included in their Job Plan such as 'Paid Work' activity or 'Self-employment' activity, instead of the QTI requirement of 'Attend Quarterly Appointment' activity. These job seekers must have the appropriate Activity Type recorded on the <strong>AEX</strong> screen, for example '<strong>PTW</strong>' for paid work or '<strong>SEL</strong>' for self-employment.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>A job seeker can only be assessed as having a PCW or a TRWC recommended by an <a href="../job-seekers/001-02320000-01.html">Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) report</a>.</p>

<p>When the ESAt report is accepted by the agency and the job seeker has either a future work capacity with intervention or a TRWC of 0-14 hours per week, the 12 week count for the QTI will automatically begin.</p>

<p>The ESAt report will still display with a status of 'submitted' for 28 days until the Department of Education, Skills and Employment's system auto-updates this to 'finalised'. This does not affect the commencement of QTI requirements, as they are effective from the date the report was accepted by Services Australia.</p>

<p>The duration of the 12 week count will not change, regardless of the job seeker's recorded activity type, until the PCW/TRWC 0-14 hours per week status ends or changes. The requirement for the QTI is coded on the job seeker's record and a Job Plan is negotiated with the job seeker to include the appropriate compulsory activity. See the <a href="../job-seekers/001-09070190-05.html">Resources</a> page for types of activities to include.</p>

<p>When the ESAt report is accepted a Service Component will be 'STA'rted and an appointment will be automatically booked. This initial appointment is to ensure the Job Plan is updated with the compulsory activity and QTI requirement coding is completed as soon as possible after the acceptance of the ESAt report.</p>

		<li>
is in self-employment or paid employment that meets their mutual obligation requirements</li>

<h2 id="_Toc344898764">QTI cycles</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The start date for the first interview is 12 weeks after the ESAt report acceptance date. Subsequent interviews will be held 12 weeks after the previous interview. If an interview is rescheduled, or the job seeker did not attend and then later the interview is completed, the next interview is 12 weeks from the date of the original interview, not from the date the interview was completed.</p>

<p>The 12 week count continues uninterrupted regardless of any delays, rescheduling, or exemptions, therefore QTIs will be completed at 12, 24, 36 weeks etc. This start date also applies to TRWC job seekers who were originally assessed as less than 12 weeks duration but have had their period of reduced work capacity extended past 12 weeks.</p>

<p>Service Component 707 (Phone) or 708 (Face to Face) will automatically start when the ESAt report is accepted. This Service Component is to ensure the coding of the QTI requirement on the <strong>AEX</strong> screen and the updating of the Job Plan with the compulsory activity occurs.</p>

<p>Service Component 710 (Phone) or 711 (Face to Face) will automatically start once the <strong>AEX</strong> screen and Job Plan have been updated. This Service Component is for the purposes of conducting the ongoing quarterly (12 weekly) interviews, to discuss the job seeker's circumstances, options available to them and to ensure they understand their obligations.</p>

<p>While a QTI appointment type is booked for 2 weeks after the ESAt acceptance date, this appointment does not form part of the QTI cycle. This appointment is to negotiate a Job Plan to include QTI as an activity. QTIs do not commence until 12 weeks after the ESAt acceptance.</p>

<p>The agency must <a href="../job-seekers/001-09100010-01.html">negotiate a Job Plan</a> with job seekers who have been assessed as having a PCW or TRWC 0-14 hours per week. These job seekers are regarded as Centrelink managed job seekers regardless of whether they also volunteer to participate with a provider such as jobactive, DES or CDP.</p>

<p>The Job Plan must include at least one compulsory activity where a job seeker has a TRWC of 0-14 hours per week of 12 weeks or more or PCW of 0-14 hours per week. The compulsory activity for this customer group should be 'Attend Quarterly Appointment' (QTI), unless they are satisfying their mutual obligation requirements through paid work. Voluntary activities may also be added to the Job Plan if appropriate.</p>

<p>The compulsory QTI requirement must not be removed from the Job Plan even if the job seeker volunteers for employment services.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If a job seeker continues to participate in DES, the Job Plan should not be updated by the agency, as the provider will update the Job Plan with the QTI activity</li>
		<li>
If the job seeker has volunteered with a service provider and the provider has incorrectly removed the compulsory QTI activity from the Job Plan, the provider must be contacted to discuss adding the QTI back into the plan</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> incorrectly updating a job plan for a DES participant who has decided to continue with a DES provider will inadvertently suspend the customer from the provider.</p>

<p>For job seekers with a TRWC of less than 12 weeks, the Job Plan must include the compulsory activity of 'Reduced Capacity Requirements', unless they are satisfying requirements through paid work.</p>

<p>The job seeker may choose to continue to participate in their current activity during the TRWC period but it must only be included in their Job Plan as a voluntary activity (with the exception of paid work, which can be a compulsory activity). These job seekers may volunteer to be connected with a provider who may add voluntary activities to the Job Plan.</p>
