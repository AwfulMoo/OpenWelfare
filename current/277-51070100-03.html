<p>For <strong>arrears</strong> to be assessed for a period before 1 July of the previous financial year, special circumstances for backdating a maintenance action exemption must first be established.

<p>Consider if special circumstances exist, taking into consideration relevant information on the customer's record.</p>

<p>Things to look at when considering if special circumstances exist may include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>DOC</strong>s in Archiving and Culling Engine (ACE) and on the Document List (<strong>DL</strong>) screen from the child's date of birth or the date of separation from the other parent. The reason for this is to determine&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
what the customer has been advised in relation to maintenance action</li>
			<li>
what contact they have made in relation to maintenance action/obligations</li>
			<li>
if they have ever questioned the Family Tax Benefit (FTB) rate decrease and/or questioned the rate of FTB payable due to the '<strong>NMA</strong>' (no maintenance action) coding</li>
			<li>
if they have ever questioned their rate and been advised that it was restricted to the base rate due to failing the MAT</li>
			<li>
if they have ever contacted to discuss or question the letter advising them to take action (Q107/MARNL)</li>
			<li>
if they have ever contacted to discuss or question any subsequent letters telling them to take action (FAOWAR, FAONOT)</li>
			<li>
if they have claimed crisis payments for family and domestic violence or other reasons which might have indicated a discussion about an exemption may have been appropriate</li>
			<li>
if they have previously applied for an exemption and what the outcome was. Were they advised to provide documentation, that is a child's birth certificate for a parentage unknown exemption and if so, why was it not provided to support that application?</li>
			<li>
if there is anything else relevant that should be considered in a special circumstances determination</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Letters in Customer Archive Retrieval (<strong>CAR</strong>), Archiving and Culling Engine (<strong>ACE</strong>) Application and on History Summary (<strong>HS</strong>) screen to ensure the customer was sent a letter advising them of the need to take action (Q107 or a MARNL), and to ensure that FAOWAR/FAONOT letter(s), including the paragraph about needing to take action for a particular child, have been sent advising the customer they have failed the MAT and are required to take action</li>
		<li>
Checking historical Online Claims to substantiate a possible notification for an exemption from the MAT</li>
		<li>
Checking when FTB for the child was granted (in a few cases, it was found that FTB was granted and backdated for a period which meant by the time FTB was granted, the <strong>DMA</strong> period had already expired, therefore a Q107/MARNL was not sent and it may be reasonable to say the customer was not aware of their MAT obligations or a decrease in rate)</li>
		</ul>
<p>The results of the exemptions investigation should support the application of a backdated exemption under special circumstances, and details <strong>must be</strong> included in the <strong>DOC</strong>. The <strong>DOC</strong> should also contain if the customer wishes to discharge child support arrears.</p>

<p>Customers granted a full or partial exemption are able to discharge outstanding child support arrears without having them included in the Maintenance Income Test (MIT) for FTB purposes.</p>

<p>Do investigations support backdating <strong>before 1 July of the previous financial year</strong>?</p>

<p>The social worker must note in a <strong>DOC</strong> the date from which the exemption applies, the type of exemption, which child/ren the exemption is for, and what special circumstances existed. The <strong>DOC</strong> should also contain if the customer wishes to discharge any child support arrears.</p>

<p><strong>For social workers</strong> - In family and domestic violence cases if the customer elects not to discharge arrears a full exemption may not be appropriate. If the customer elects to collect the arrears they will be assessable under the Maintenance Income Test (MIT).</p>

<p>Customers who are granted a full or partial exemption are able to discharge outstanding child support arrears without having them included in the MIT for FTB purposes.</p>

<p>Consider if special circumstances exist. Investigate relevant information on the customer's record including&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer's comprehension level</li>
		<li>
emotional and personal circumstances which may have affected the customer's capacity at the time</li>
		<li>
language barriers</li>
		<li>
cognitive impairment</li>
		<li>
failure of duty of care in providing the customer with correct information or advice</li>
		<li>
if the customer has been sent letters advising them of the need to take action or contact if they have a reason for not taking action</li>
		<li>
if there are any <strong>DOCS</strong> (on <strong>DL</strong> or in ACE) to show that the customer has been advised of the need to take action</li>
		<li>
if the customer has previously been asked to provide evidence to support an exemption and has failed to do so</li>

<p>The SSO will liaise with the referring social worker or Service Officer if required. For example if the Service Officer investigation <strong>DOC</strong> does not support further backdating or there is insufficient information or evidence supplied.</p>

<p>Annotate the <strong>DOC</strong> on the customer's record stating the exemption period before 1 July of the previous financial year is being assessed by the SSO as per this procedure, and that an exemption <strong>will not</strong> be coded for the backdated period until a decision is made.</p>

<p>For arrears to be assessed for a period before 1 July of the previous financial year, special circumstances for backdating a maintenance action exemption must first be established. That is, there must be special circumstances which prevented the customer from applying for a formal review of their rate of payment and/or MAT failure within 52 weeks of it occurring. If special circumstances cannot be established, arrears are limited to 1 July of the previous financial year.</p>

<p>Consider if special circumstances exist, including looking at the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The documented results of the exemption investigation by the referring officer and if the circumstances might warrant further backdating. <strong>DOC</strong>s in Archiving and Culling Engine (ACE) and on the Document List (<strong>DL</strong>) screen from the child's date of birth or the date of separation from the other parent. The reason for this is to determine&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
what the customer has been advised in relation to maintenance action</li>
			<li>
what contact they have made in relation to maintenance action/obligations</li>
			<li>
if they have ever questioned the FTB rate decrease and/or questioned the rate of FTB payable due to the NMA</li>
			<li>
if they have ever questioned their rate and been advised it was restricted to the base rate due to failing the MAT</li>
			<li>
if they have ever contacted to discuss or question the letter advising them to take action (Q107/MARNL)</li>
			<li>
if they have ever contacted to discuss or question any subsequent letters telling them to take action (FAOWAR, FAONOT)</li>
			<li>
if they have claimed crisis payments for family and domestic violence or other reasons which might have indicated that a discussion about an exemption may have been appropriate</li>
			<li>
if they have previously applied for an exemption and what the outcome was. Were they advised to provide documentation, that is a child's birth certificate for a parentage unknown exemption, and if so, why was it not provided to support that application?</li>
			<li>
if there is anything else relevant that should be considered in a special circumstances determination</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Letters in Customer Archive Retrieval (CAR), Archiving and Culling Engine (<strong>ACE</strong>) Application and on History Summary (<strong>HS</strong>) screen to ensure the customer was sent a letter advising them of the need to take action (Q107 or a MARNL), and to ensure that FAOWAR/FAONOT letter(s), including the paragraph about needing to take action for a particular child, have been sent advising the customer that they have failed the MAT and are required to take action</li>
		<li>
Checking historical Online Claims to substantiate a possible notification for an exemption from the MAT</li>
		<li>
Checking when the FTB for the child was granted (in a few cases, it was found that the FTB was granted and backdated for a period which meant by the time FTB was granted, the DMA period had already expired, therefore a Q107/MARNL was not sent and it may be reasonable to say the customer was not aware of their MAT obligations or a decrease in rate)</li>
		<li>
Talking to the Service Officer or social worker to establish if they believe there was anything that prevented the customer from applying for a formal review within 52 weeks of reducing to the base rate</li>
		</ul>
<p>Once a decision has been made, code the appropriate start date for the exemption and annotate the <strong>DOC</strong>.</p>

<p>Advise the referring Service Officer/social worker of the decision.</p>

<p>Annotate the <strong>DOC</strong> on the customer's record. If the customer has arrears owing on the child support case which are to be discharged, include this in the <strong>DOC</strong>.</p>

<p>Code the exemption on the Maintenance Action Input (<strong>MNMA</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>Send the customer a Q052 advising a full exemption has been granted. Where the customer does not agree with the start date indicated in the letter, (including where the backdating of the exemption has been denied) they may apply for a formal review. Standard review and appeal rights apply. See <a href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/109-02000000-01.html">Request for an explanation or application for a formal review (CLK)</a>.</p>

<p>If there is a child support case to be ended, send an email to Child Support using the 'Maintenance Exemption Notification to Child Support Program' template to have the child support case ended. <a href="../separated-parents/277-51070100-05.html">Resources</a> has a link to the template.</p>

<p>The customer must also elect to end their case with Child Support. Refer the customer to Child Support immediately to request the case be ended. For contact details, see Child Support. Alternatively, the <a target="_blank" class="pdflink" href="https&#58;//www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/cs1671-1509en.pdf">Ending a child support assessment (CS1671) form</a> may be used.</p>

<p><strong>Private collect child support case</strong></p>

<p>It may be appropriate to backdate an exemption if there are family and domestic violence circumstances present. The backdating of the exemption is to offset the effect of child support that the customer was deemed to have received, but may not have received due to family and domestic violence. This enables Centrelink to re-assess their FTB entitlement based on the actual amount of child support they received during this period.</p>

<p>Customers can no longer ask Child Support to backdate the case end to align with the exemption start date. This means where a customer has a private collect case and they are granted a full exemption from a date in the past, additional coding is required by Centrelink to remove the uncollected child support from the Maintenance Income Test (MIT).</p>

<p>See <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-51030010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Recording_priva_Step05">Step 5 in Table 1 of Recording private maintenance income on Centrelink systems</a> for coding details to apply the MIT correctly in these cases.</p>

<p><strong>Child Support collect case</strong></p>

<p>If a Child Support collect customer is granted an exemption and they have a current collect case, there may be outstanding arrears owing on the child support case. Customers can no longer ask Child Support to backdate the case end to align with the exemption start date. However a customer can elect to discharge any arrears without having them assessed under the MIT. This effectively means there is <strong>no requirement to backdate exemptions in these cases</strong>.</p>
