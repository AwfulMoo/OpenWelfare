<P>If Child Support have determined the percentage of care, there is no need to calculate the percentage of care.

<P>Determine the assessment period to use. This may depend on the payment the customer is receiving.</P>
<P>If carers have agreed on the percentage of care, there is no need to calculate the percentage based on the agreed pattern of care or the available evidence.</P>
<P><STRONG>To calculate the percentage:</STRONG></P>
<UL>
<LI>add up the number of nights the child is in the customer's care during the assessment period based on the pattern of care</LI>
<LI>if the number of nights does not accurately reflect the time in care, the number of hours may be used. Add the number of hours for each part day the child is in care. Divide the total hours by 24 to get the number of days, and add this to the number of whole days in care to get the total days in care during the assessment period</LI>
<LI>divide the number of nights in care in the assessment period by the total number of days in the assessment period</LI>
<LI>multiply the result by 100 to get the shared care percentage</LI>
<LI>round to the nearest whole percentage (0.5 is rounded up) <STRONG>except</STRONG> where the percentage is close to the eligibility percentage, for example where a customer has 13.9% it is not rounded up to 14%. Exception for principal carer assessment: Percentages between 45.1 and 45.9 should all be rounded up to 46%. Having at least 45.1 of care means there is less than a 10% difference, therefore equal care policy applies. The system will only allow coding of whole numbers, so code 46%</LI></UL>
