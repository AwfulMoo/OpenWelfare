<p>If Child Support have determined the percentage of care, there is no need to calculate the percentage of care. The percentage advised by Child Support can be used for the principal carer assessment and determination of Social Security payment entitlements for Income Support Payments, see <a href="../families/007-02050000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Finalise_and_re_Step01">Step 1 in Table 2</a>.</p>

<p>If FCC Processing or Child Support staff have already determined the percentage of care for FTB purposes this percentage can be used for principal carer assessment and determination of Social Security payment entitlements, see <a href="../families/007-02050000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Finalise_and_re_Step01">Step 1 in Table 2</a>.</p>

<p>Determine the assessment period to use. This may depend on the payment the customer is receiving.</p>

<p>If carers have agreed on the percentage of care, there is no need to calculate the percentage based on the agreed pattern of care or the available evidence.</p>

<p><strong>To calculate the percentage&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
add up the number of nights the child is in the customer's care during the assessment period based on the pattern of care</li>
		<li>
if the number of nights does not accurately reflect the time in care, the number of hours may be used. Add the number of hours for each part day the child is in care. Divide the total hours by 24 to get the number of days, and add this to the number of whole days in care to get the total days in care during the assessment period</li>
		<li>
divide the number of nights in care in the assessment period by the total number of days in the assessment period</li>
		<li>
multiply the result by 100 to get the shared care percentage</li>
		<li>
round to the nearest whole percentage (0.5 is rounded up) <strong>except</strong> where the percentage is close to the eligibility percentage, for example where a customer has 13.9% it is not rounded up to 14%. Exception for principal carer assessment&#58; Percentages between 45.1 and 45.9 should all be rounded up to 46%. Having at least 45.1 of care means there is less than a 10% difference, therefore equal care policy applies. The system will only allow coding of whole numbers, so code 46%</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Is the percentage of care 55% and above, or 45% and below?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> a problem (P24845) has been identified where shared care is not being correctly applied when a child is in the care of a parent who has transferred their FTB to their current partner (step parent). This may impact on a record in multiple ways&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the other biological parent may have their FTB entitlement withdrawn for the shared care child, as the care percentage is being adjusted to 0%</li>
		<li>
the step parent may receive an incorrect percentage of care and therefore an incorrect rate of FTB</li>
		<li>
the care may transfer to the step parent's child support record (with incorrect child relationship details) causing inaccurate child support assessments and impacting multiple parties</li>

<p>If a principal carer determination has been made, advise all carers of the decision in writing. Use the Child - Change in Care Arrangements script to advise each carer. Consider relevant privacy issues when referring to the other carer in the letter.</p>

<p>Any <strong>disclosure of personal/protected information</strong> must comply with the confidentiality provisions in sections 201-208 of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 and Privacy Act 1988. The <a href="../families/007-02050000-04.html">References</a> page contains links to the legislation. Where a Service Officer feels it necessary under these provisions, the name of the other carer should be replaced with the term 'other carer'. The reasons for this should be documented.</p>
