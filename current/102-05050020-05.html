		<div class="block">

<p>The <strong>P24845</strong> system issue may impact in the following scenarios&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
A step parent is claiming Family Tax Benefit (FTB) that has been transferred to them from a biological parent, and the other biological parent also becomes entitled to receive FTB, for example, their percentage of care increases to above 35%, and they make a claim</li>
		<li>
The biological parent transfers their FTB to a step parent and they later separate. Care details for the child will not be transferred correctly to Child Support if a past period care refresh is requested</li>
		<li>
The care may transfer to the step parent's child support record (with incorrect child relationship details) causing inaccurate child support assessments and impacting multiple parties</li>
		</ul>
<p>As a result, if FTB is transferred out to partner ('<strong>TOP</strong>' is coded on the Child Override/Claim (<strong>CHOC</strong>) screen - from parent to step parent) and the customer is a Centrelink and Child Support mutual customer, these records are to be referred for investigation. See the <a target="_blank" href="../families/007-02040020-05.html">Resources</a> page of Notification and assessment of shared care arrangements for Family Tax Benefit (FTB) for more information and details of the workaround.</p>

<p><strong>Temporary absence of less than 8 weeks during school holidays</strong></p>

<p>The parents of a child are separated and the child is normally cared for by Parent A who is receiving Parenting Payment (PP).</p>

<p>The child goes to stay with Parent B for 6 weeks during the Christmas school holidays.</p>

<p>Because Parent A has only temporarily delegated the care of the child to Parent B, the child is taken to remain in Parent A's care under subsection 5(17) of the Social Security Act.</p>

<p><strong>Temporary absence of less than 8 weeks, customer in hospital</strong></p>

<p>The parents of the child are separated and the child is normally cared for by Parent A who is receiving JobSeeker Payment (JSP). Parent A is hospitalised for 7 weeks and the child is cared for by Parent B. Parent B lodges a claim for JSP (with child) rate and Family Tax Benefit (FTB) and seeks to be recognised as a principal carer.</p>

<p>As the absence is for less than 8 weeks, subsection 5 (17) of the Social Security Act applies. The child is still regarded as being in Parent A's care under subsection 5(17).</p>

<p>The parents' competing claims to be the principal carer would be assessed under the <a href="../families/007-02050010-01.html">shared care guidelines</a> as the child is considered to be the dependent child of both parents. In view of the fact that Parent A is already receiving payment, and the short period of the absence, Parent A would continue to be the principal carer.</p>

<p><strong>Temporary absence of 8-12 weeks, customer caring for sick relative</strong></p>

<p>The parents of a child are separated and the child is normally cared for by Parent A who is receiving Parenting Payment (PP).</p>

<p>Parent A must go interstate for 11 weeks to care for a sick relative and the child is cared for by Parent B.</p>

<p>Parent B lodges a claim for PP. A determination must be made with regard to subsection 5(17) of the Social Security Act as to whether Parent A is still the principal carer and should continue to receive PP, or whether Parent B should be granted PP.</p>

<p>Subsection 5(17) allows for the continuation of payment beyond eight weeks, if the absence is temporary. A decision as to which person is the principal carer and is qualified for PP must be made having regard to the nature of the absence.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that Parent A is already receiving payment, and the absence is temporary and has a defined end date, payment of PP would continue with Parent A.</p>

<p><strong>Temporary absence of 8-12 weeks, customer away from home to attend training</strong></p>

<p>Parent A, who is the principal carer and is receiving JobSeeker Payment (JSP), has joined the armed forces. As part of the induction and training course for new recruits, they must attend a residential training facility for 10 weeks.</p>

<p>While attending this training, Parent A has delegated the care of the child to Parent B. During this period, Parent A retains responsibility for the day-to-day care, welfare and development of the child through regular phone contact with Parent B and the child, and weekend visits. Because of the demonstrated ongoing involvement in the care and welfare of the child, Parent A can remain the principal carer of the child.</p>

<p>The length of the absence is not a determining factor as it is the existence of a continuing right of control, which is the dominant consideration as to whether Parent A remains, the principal carer.</p>

<p><strong>Temporary absence during training period, child in care of person who does not have legal responsibility for child</strong></p>

<p>The dependent child's mother has joined a state police force. As part of the induction and training course for new recruits, she needs to attend a residential training facility for 15 weeks.</p>

<p>While attending this training the mother has delegated the care of the dependent child to a close family friend. During this period, the mother retains responsibility for the day-to-day care, welfare and development of the child through regular phone contact with the child's temporary carer, weekend visits and being the nominated person to contact in an emergency.</p>

<p>The length of the absence is not a determining factor as it is the existence of a continuing right of control which is the dominant consideration as to whether the child remains in the care of and the dependent child of the mother.</p>

<p>In this example, it may be appropriate for the child to continue to be considered the dependent child of the mother, as the mother is able to show that she is still the adult responsible for the key decisions concerning the care, welfare and development of the child. However, as the temporary absence is more than 12 weeks a referral to the Level 2 policy helpdesk is needed with all details of the absence included in the request before making a principal care determination.</p>

<p><strong>Care is contested</strong></p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>

<p>An unknown person abducts a child. The parent notifies the police that the child has been taken. Parenting Payment (PP) can continue to be paid as long as the parent continues to take steps to seek return of the child. If the absence extends beyond 8 weeks, policy advice must be sought to determine if PP can be extended.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>

<p>Parent A and Parent B have a parenting order in place. Parent B receives PP for their dependent child. Parent A breaches the order by not returning the child to Parent B and Parent B starts legal action. PP can continue to be paid to Parent B during the legal action.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the start of legal action will need to be confirmed either through court documents or contact with Parent B's legal representative.</p>
