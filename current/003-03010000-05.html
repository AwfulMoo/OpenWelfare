<p><strong>General information</strong></p>

<p>This table contains&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
income to consider when assessing income loss. This is income a customer earned, received or derived before or after the disaster</li>
		<li>
information or evidence from the customer to document, or <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-10010030-01.html">scan</a> onto their record<br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> If information contained in an online claim or Assisted Customer Claim is sufficient to make an assessment, and there are no concerns about the validity of the claim, no additional evidence is required</li>
		<li>
minimum details to code relevant income screens. This may help when a customer self-declares their income but there is a need to code this income due to impacts on payment rate calculations</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer made a self-declaration of income and lodged no documentary evidence, coding the relevant income screens is not needed unless the income means the customer's total earned income may exceed the <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-03000000-05.html#bp05_tbl_Definitions_1">average weekly income amount</a>.</p>

<p>If a customer’s partner is receiving another income support payment, request and code income details as per standard process to make sure the customer’s partner receives the correct entitlement. See the relevant Operational Blueprint file that relates to the partner’s income support payment type.</p>

<p>Use the information from the customer (<a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-03010000-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Assessing_incom01">Process page, Table 3</a>) to decide the period to use when calculating their fortnightly average income <strong>before</strong> the disaster. For example&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
4 to 8 weeks, or</li>
		<li>
a different period for customers with irregular income, for example, self-employed or seasonal workers</li>		</ul>

<p>Payslips are the best form of evidence to determine gross employment income and any deductions such as salary sacrifice amounts. If a customer who is not self-employed provides bank statements as evidence, this will show their net income. Tell the customer the Australian Taxation Office's (ATO) tax tables may help to determine their gross income. The tax tables do not take into account amounts that have been salary sacrificed. The customer will need to provide this information. </p>

<p>A link to the ATO website can be found under the External Website heading on this page. Tell the customer to search for ‘tax tables’ and make sure the correct table is selected, such as weekly, fortnightly or monthly.</p>
