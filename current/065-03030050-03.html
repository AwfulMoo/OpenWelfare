<p>An online or ACC for Age Pension cannot be submitted until all required tasks have been completed (<a href="../self-service/133-02160000-01.html">exceptions apply</a>).</p>

<p>Verbal claims completed using ACC must not be submitted or finalised until a verbal declaration has been accepted by the customer or a signed Customer Declaration Form (CDF) has been scanned to their record. See ACC table in <a href="../older-australians/065-03010000-03.html">Claiming Age Pension</a>.</p>

<p>If a rejected claim needs to be opened and reassessed, reindex the original claim or create a SOA shell in Process Direct, as appropriate.

<p>Sometimes a system error may occur between submission of an online or assisted customer claim and the claim generation.</p>

<p>This may be a result of conflicting activities on the customer or partner record, or record locking at the time of claim submission. Review the records to check if this is the case.</p>

<p>Once there are no activities preventing the claim activity from creating, update the claim status from <strong>Submission Failed</strong> to <strong>In Process</strong>. Then update as required.</p>

<p>If the status remains as <strong>Submission Failed</strong>, raise an incident via the digital assistant.</p>

<p>New claims must be streamed on the day allocated via Workload Management. A progress of claim note must be created and/or updated, if the claim cannot be immediately finalised.</p>

<p><strong>Age Pension combined partner online claims</strong></p>

<p>These combined claims (sometimes referred to as 'dual claims') allocate as a single work item. They can only be assessed in Process Direct by staff who have the appropriate Age Pension combined partner online claim skill tags.</p>

<p><strong>Do not </strong>process Age Pension combined partner online claims as 2 separate single claims as the data for the partner claim may be lost.</p>

<p>To identify an Age Pension combined partner online claim&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
A specific message will display in the claim header in Process Direct '<strong>This claim is Customer Partner Combined claim</strong>'</li>
		<li>
Check for a keyword of <strong>DUALCLM</strong></li>
		<li>
View the claim note or AGE OLC Claim Progress <strong>DOC</strong>, where the words 'Awaiting partner review' will display within the text</li>
		</ul>
<p>If Service Officers <strong>without</strong> the appropriate skill tags are allocated an <a target="_blank" href="../older-australians/065-19012550-01.html">Age Pension combined partner online claim</a>, email the Workload Management team (with '<strong>AGE DUALCLM</strong>' in the subject line) to have the work item reallocated. Procedure ends here.</p>

<p>This process only applies to a combined partner online claim <strong>awaiting assessment</strong>. If the claim has been previously assessed, e.g. the claims status is <strong>Rejected</strong>, <a href="../older-australians/065-03030050-03.html#bp03_tbl_Reviewing_the_c_Step05">go to Step 5</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Online claim/ACC submitted</strong></p>

<p>When an online or ACC is submitted as a single person or combined partner claim, an Age Pension claim work item is created in Process Direct containing the claim information. The claim is reviewed in Process Direct.</p>

<p><a href="../older-australians/065-03030050-03.html#bp03_tbl_Reviewing_the_c_Step05">Go to Step 5</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Paper Claim for Age Pension (SA002 or SA412) lodged</strong></p>

<p>When an SA002 or SA412 is scanned to the customer's record, a SOA shell work item is generated on the customer's record. This contains no claim information apart from the CRN and personal details, and receipt date. Add the claim information into the work item using the scanned claim and documentation.</p>

<p>If both the customer and partner have claimed on the same claim form, the single SOA shell can be transformed to a combined customer-partner claim by using <img src="../resources/images/process_direct_small/more%20options.png" alt="more options" title="more options" /> &gt; <strong>Combined claim switch </strong>&gt;select <strong>Switch to combined claim</strong>. This action can be reversed to return the claim to a single claim if 'switched' in error.</p>

<strong>No</strong>, take the Age Pension and Pension Bonus claim off hold and reallocate it by re-categorising it as a PDB claim work item. See <a href="../older-australians/065-03030050-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Reallocating_Pe">Table 4</a></li>

<p>Only Service Officers trained in Pension Bonus assessments should complete the following.</p>

<p><strong>Claiming Pension Bonus but not registered</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
From 1 July 2014 the Pension Bonus Scheme closed to new registrations.<strong><br>Note&#58;</strong> a customer may incorrectly claim the Pension Bonus if not registered by lodging a paper claim SA002. The online claim only presents Pension Bonus questions to customers registered in the PBS</li>
		<li>
To reject a Pension Bonus claim from a person not registered in the PBS, go to the <strong>PBP </strong>screen in the AGE/NCL activity and enter the calculation Period End Date (normally the date before the customer claims Age Pension). The PBP claim will be rejected, reason <strong>PBR </strong>(PBS Not Registered). <strong>Note&#58;</strong> this cannot be done in Process Direct</li>
		<li>
If the <strong>PBP </strong>screen was not entered as part of the AGE/NCL it can be done in a separate activity by using the Pension Bonus Claim Assessment script in Customer Record</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Not claiming Pension Bonus but registered</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
If customer registered for Pension Bonus has not claimed Pension Bonus with their Age Pension claim, ensure <strong>to contact the customer</strong> to discuss the <a href="../older-australians/065-07030040-03.html">qualification and assessment of PBP</a> and confirm that they do want to apply for the Pension Bonus.

<p>There is a known system issue for Age Pension customers with vulnerable circumstances - the system incorrectly grants from the <strong>Age Pension Age Date</strong> if this date falls between the contact date and the date the claim was submitted. Check if the Assessment Date has changed <strong>after</strong> selecting Assess in Process Direct. If so&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Check if there was a later contact on the <strong>PRECLM</strong> screen before the claim was submitted. If the customer was qualified on that contact date, make this the Assessment Date</li>
		<li>
Otherwise change the Assessment Date to the date of receipt of the claim (unless other backdating provisions or deemed claim provisions apply)</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer is also<strong> claiming Pension Bonus Payment</strong> and no basic amount of Age Pension or pension supplement basic is payable, no Pension Bonus Payment will be payable. <strong>Note&#58; </strong>if not trained in Pension Bonus assessments, reallocate both claims as per <a href="../older-australians/065-03030050-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Reallocating_Pe">Table 4</a>.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Take care to record any employment income paid to the customer and partner in their first entitlement period if there is any possibility that employment income will preclude payability for this period. Confirm with the customer the amounts paid or expected to be paid&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
If the reporting date is in the past, code the income and check payability. If payable, stimulate payment</li>
			<li>
If the reporting date is in the future, code income expected to be paid to check payability and then delete coding. If payable, allow the customer to report the exact amount on their reporting day</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Where no Age Pension is payable, it may be possible to change the start date, or the customer may wish to withdraw both claims until an amount of Age Pension or pension supplement basic is payable. See <a href="../older-australians/065-07030040-01.html">Qualification and assessment of Pension Bonus Payment (PBP)</a>. The customer should be referred to a <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-05080000-01.html">Financial Information Service (FIS)</a> Officer.</li>
		</ul>
<p>Before finalising an Age Pension claim where a Pension Bonus entitlement has also been claimed, it is imperative to check rate details, including that the Age Pension basic amount or pension supplement basic amount is payable, on the following screens to ensure the expected results are reflected in the provisional data. Both Provisional and Prior data displays so the changes can be identified&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Pensions Income and Assets (<strong>PIAS</strong>)</li>
		<li>
Pensions Assessable Asset Summary (<strong>PAAS</strong>)</li>
		<li>
Pension Rate Calculator (<strong>PRC</strong>)</li>
		<li>
Factors Affecting Rate (<strong>PFAR</strong>)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Make any necessary updates such as manual rate adjustments on the Daily Rate Component (<strong>RAC</strong>) and Daily Rates Summary (<strong>RATS</strong>) screens.</p>

<p>Ensure the <strong>ELD</strong> screen details are correct.</p>

<p>The date the customer reaches Age Pension age is displayed on the Pensions General Information (<strong>PNGI</strong>).</p>

<p>The Pension Assessment (<strong>PNA</strong>) screen displays the Assessment Date. This date determines the date the claim will be assessed from. The system works out this date based on&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the date the claim was submitted</li>
		<li>
recorded contact dates (if applicable for claims lodged before 1 July 2018)</li>
		<li>
the derived date of receipt of the claim for customers with vulnerable circumstances (for claims submitted on or after 7 December 2020), and</li>
		<li>
the date the customer reached or will reach Age Pension age</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer had a vulnerable circumstance that needs to be recorded manually, add this on the <strong>PRECLM </strong>screen in Process Direct or to the <strong>CUPC</strong> screen in Customer First via the guided procedure. This will update the <strong>PNA</strong> screen.</p>

<p>The Assessment Date can be changed manually if applicable, for example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<a href="../initial-contact-general/106-18032700-01.html">vulnerable circumstances</a> exist for a claim submitted before 7 December 2020</li>
		<li>
vulnerable circumstances exist, the customer was not qualified on the contact date passed from Process Direct and was qualified on a later contact date before the claim was submitted</li>
		<li>
intention to claim provisions for vulnerable customers apply and the customer is eligible for an extension to lodge up to 13 weeks after the contact date</li>
		<li>
<a href="../initial-contact-general/106-03020010-01.html">backdating provisions</a> apply</li>
		<li>
the customer is qualified but not payable on the start date (e.g. the date they submitted the claim) but the customer has confirmed their income or assets will change within 13 weeks of the original claim date</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; after the system calculates the assessment results, it incorrectly assesses the claim from the date the customer turns Age Pension age for customers with a vulnerable circumstance who turn Age Pension age between the intent to claim contact date and the date the claim was submitted. To apply the correct Assessment Date manually&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Check if there was another contact on the <strong>PRECLM</strong> screen before the claim was submitted. If the customer was qualified on that contact date, make this the Assessment Date</li>
		<li>
Otherwise change the Assessment Date to the date of receipt of the claim (unless other backdating provisions or deemed claim provisions apply)</li>

<p>For Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) customers receiving a disability payment from the DVA, do not reject their claim based on income before checking whether they may be entitled to receive Defence Force Income Support Allowance (DFISA). See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-03060030-01.html">DFISA-like payments</a> for more information.</p>

<p>If the customer is also <strong>claiming Pension Bonus Payment</strong> and no basic amount of Age Pension or pension supplement basic is payable, no Pension Bonus Payment will be payable&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Take care to record any employment income paid to the customer and partner in their first entitlement period if there is a possibility that employment income will preclude payability. Confirm with the customer the amounts paid or expected to be paid&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
If the reporting date is in the past, code the income and check payability. If payable, stimulate payment</li>
			<li>
If the reporting date is in the future, code income expected to be paid to check payability and then delete coding. If payable, allow the customer to report the exact amount on their reporting day</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Where no Age Pension is payable, it may be possible to change the start date, or the customer may wish to withdraw both claims until an amount of Age Pension or pension supplement basic is payable. See <a href="../older-australians/065-07030040-01.html">Qualification and assessment of Pension Bonus Payment</a>. Offer the customer a referral to a Financial Information Service (FIS) Officer.</li>
		</ul>
<p>Before finalising an Age Pension claim where a Pension Bonus entitlement has also been claimed, it is important to, check rate details, including that the Age Pension basic rate and Pension Supplement Basic Amount are payable.</p>

<p>Check the following screens to ensure the expected results are reflected in the provisional data (both Provisional and Prior data display so the changes can be identified)&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Pensions Income and Assets (<strong>PIAS</strong>)</li>

<p><strong>Income management</strong></p>

<p>If the customer is under <strong>income management </strong>(Benefit status <strong>INM</strong>) and they have an arrears or lump sum payment entitlement, do <strong>not </strong>make any changes to the customer's record to allow this payment to be made. Contact the Income Management Team to allow income management to be turned on for the arrears payment <strong>before </strong>it is made.</p>

<p><strong>Energy Supplement</strong></p>

<p>If the customer receives Pension Supplement minimum, they will also receive the maximum rate of the Energy Supplement. If a frequency change is requested, check/update the Energy Supplement <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-03090000-01.html">payment frequency option</a>.</p>
