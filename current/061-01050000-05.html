<p><strong>Examples of situations where a discretionary portability extension would normally be granted</strong></p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>

<p>Autonomous Disability Support Pension (DSP) (not indefinitely portable) customer is due to return to Australia on 26 May. Payment will cease on 30 May. The customer is involved in a car accident on 24 May and hospitalised. The doctor provided a letter advising they expect him to be released in 2 months and to be able to travel 3 weeks later. A portability extension would be granted for 2 months and 3 weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>

<p>An Age Pension customer (not New Zealand Agreement) who ceases to be payable after 26 weeks absence from Australia due to having no Working Life Residence, contacts to advise they are unable to return to Australia due to an illness which is serious. A portability extension may be granted in this situation with evidence provided by the treating doctor.</p>

<p><strong>Example 3</strong></p>

<p>A Parenting Payment Single (PPS) customer is due to return home just prior to payment ceasing to be portable on 1 January. The customer's child becomes ill with pneumonia and the doctor recommends total bed rest for the next 4 weeks. A portability extension would be granted on verification of the situation when evidence is provided from the treating doctor.</p>

<p><strong>Example 4</strong></p>

<p>A Family Tax Benefit (FTB) customer is overseas with their child when the country is involved in a war and the borders are closed. The customer and child are unable to leave the country. A portability extension could be granted for a maximum of 3 months. A review should be recorded to check if the situation has changed and the customer and child are able to return to Australia. If not, a further extension could be granted. Verification would not normally be required as the situation would generally be known through media channels. Media information could include which areas of the country were affected and which airport/s is/are closed. Websites that track flights could add verification of cancelled flights. Contact with the Australian Embassy in that country could also be used to verify this type of situation.</p>

<p><strong>Example 5</strong></p>

<p>A Family Tax Benefit (FTB) customer's child travels outside Australia with friends while the FTB customer remains in Australia. After 5 weeks, the child is involved in an accident and is unable to return to Australia for 4 weeks. The customer applies for a portability extension for FTB to enable the child to recover sufficiently to return to Australia. A portability extension is granted under Family Assistance Law and the customer's normal rate of FTB continues until the end of the extension period.</p>

<p><strong>Examples of situations where a discretionary portability extension would not normally be granted</strong></p>

<p><strong>Example1</strong></p>

<p>A Youth Allowance (YA) (job seeker) customer being paid under the New Zealand 10 year residence exemption is granted 4 weeks payment while outside Australia to visit a critically ill parent. The customer has been in receipt of YA under this residence exemption reason for 5 months. The customer telephones after a 6 weeks absence to say that the parent has died and the customer is unable to return for another 1 month. A portability extension is not payable as the customer is only entitled to payment for a period of up to 6 months. The customer has lost qualification at the end of the 6 month period and the period cannot be extended.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>

<p>A customer receives Parenting Payment Partnered (PPP), which is portable for 6 weeks for temporary absences. On 15 January, the customer leaves Australia. After departure and shortly after PPP has stopped, the customer learns that their parent has unexpectedly died and they apply for a portability extension. The portability extension would not be granted as the event occurred after payments stopped. However, a portability extension may be granted should they be able to provide evidence their parent became seriously ill whilst the customer was overseas and before the end of the portability period. In this case, the portability extension may be granted even though the event (the parent's death) occurred after the end of the portability period.</p>

<p><strong>Example 3</strong></p>

<p>An FTB customer went overseas on 3 January to look after their ill mother. The mother is still unwell after 6 weeks absence from Australia and the customer applies for an extension to their portability to continue caring for their mother. A portability extension would not be granted as the event occurred prior to the customer's departure from Australia. If however, the mother's health deteriorated causing them to be hospitalised prior to the customer's payment ceasing to be portable, a portability extension could be considered.</p>

<p><strong>Example 4</strong></p>

<p>A PPS customer's only dependent child has travelled overseas on 10 December to be with relatives while the PPS customer remains in Australia. After 6 weeks, the child becomes ill and is unable to return to Australia, so the customer applies for a portability extension. In this case, a portability extension cannot be granted, because under Social Security Law the customer ceases to be the principal carer of the child after 6 weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Example 5</strong></p>

<p>A Disability Support Pensioner (DSP) and their non-family carer (CP) travelled overseas. The DSP customer had 28 days general portability available. In the 4th week of their trip, the DSP customer had a fall and was hospitalised with a broken leg and concussion. Suitable evidence was provided and the DSP customer was granted a portability extension for 2 months pending review of the medical condition. The CP customer still had 2 weeks general portability remaining but cannot be granted an extension, as they are not a family member of the DSP customer. The care relationship is not enough to allow an extension and is not covered in the legislation.</p>

<p><strong>Example of a situation where portability would be increased before considering a discretionary portability extension</strong></p>

<p>A JobSeeker Payment (JSP) customer was granted 4 weeks payment while outside Australia due to an acute family crisis as the customer's parent was seriously ill. The customer contacted 3 weeks after departure for a portability extension as the parent has just passed away. A portability extension would not be applicable in this situation as the JSP payment would be extended under normal portability rules for a further period required to attend to the funeral up to a maximum of 6 weeks. If the customer was still required to be overseas after the end of their portability period, a portability extension could be considered.</p>
