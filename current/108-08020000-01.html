<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Pension_Supplem">Pension Supplement and its components</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Pension Supplement (PNSUP) was introduced on 20 September 2009. It replaced a number of small add-on payments. Pension Supplement (PNSUP) is based on the payments it replaced. It is the total of the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Pension Supplement Basic (PSBAS)&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
A GST supplement was paid to eligible customers from 1 July 2000 to 19 September 2009. On 20 September 2009 it was replaced by PSBAS</li>
			<li>
This is a taxable component if the primary payment is taxable</li>
			<li>
When a customer is paid PSBAS only or its equivalent, the receiving Pension Supplement Basic (<strong>SUPPL</strong>) component code may be used instead of PSBAS</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Pension Supplement Minimum (PSMIN)&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Replaced the former Utility Allowance (UA) and Telephone Allowance (TAL) payments. TAL was paid at different rates. PSMIN is based on the higher rate</li>
			<li>
This is a non-taxable component</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Pension Supplement Remaining (PSREM)</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Replaced the former Pharmaceutical Allowance (PhA) payment. PSREM is not a defined rate. It is calculated by using the full amount of PNSUP less PSBAS and PSMIN</li>
			<li>
This is a non-taxable component</li>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
			</ul>			</ul>

<p></p>
<div class="twisty">
	
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Pension_Supplem01"></a>
<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Pension_Supplem01">Pension Supplement for transitional customers</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>There are 2 groups of transitional Pension Supplement customers. The names of the components are different and for some customers the rate of payment is also different.</p>

<p><strong>Before 20 September 2009 - eligible 2009 Pension Reform customers</strong></p>

<p>Changes were made to the pension income test. <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-03010070-01.html">Transitional rules</a> were put in place to make sure that no pension customer was worse off because of the new rules. Customers who were entitled to a higher rate before the changes, continued to be assessed under the old rules. An equivalent rate of Pension Supplement is included in the pension rate. The rate of payment as assessed using the old rules is called the transitional pension rate.</p>

<p>The equivalent rate of Pension Supplement is not taxed and has only 2 components&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Transitional Minimum Supplement (TRMIN)&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
can be received fortnightly or quarterly</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Non Taxable Transition component (TRNTX)</li>
			<ul>			<li>
can only be received fortnightly</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>Only detailed rate screens will show the basic pension and the equivalent rate of Pension Supplement separately. In most cases, they will appear together, as one combined amount of transitional pension.</p>

<p>Customers remain on the transitional pension rate until they are better off under the new rules. When that happens, they permanently move to the new rules.</p>

<p><strong>20 March 2020 - former Wife Pension customers only</strong></p>

<p>Wife Pension customers were eligible to receive Pension Supplement. Wife Pension ceased on 19 March 2020. Customers began to receive <a href="../job-seekers/001-19051551-01.html">JobSeeker Payment (JSP)</a> from 20 March 2020. They will be paid Transitional Pension Supplement (TPNSP) while they continue to meet the eligibility rules for Wife Pension, which were in place, on 19 March 2020.</p>

<p>The components of Transitional Pension Supplement (TPNSP) have different names&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Transitional Basic Pension Supplement (TNTAX)</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the equivalent of PSBAS</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Transitional Minimum Pension Supplement (TNMIN)</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the equivalent of PSMIN</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Transitional Remaining Pension Supplement (TNNTX)</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the equivalent of PSREM</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>Some former Wife Pension customers continue to receive the transitional rate of Wife Pension from the 2009 Pension Reform changes. These customers will receive their equivalent amount of Pension Supplement under the TNMIN and TNNTX components.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>Pension Supplement is paid with the customer's fortnightly income support payment. The customer can choose to receive Pension Supplement Minimum (PSMIN) quarterly.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> transitional payments will have a different name.</p>

<p>The payment frequency can change on the customer's request, verbally or in writing. Customers lodging a claim are asked if they want to receive PSMIN fortnightly or quarterly.</p>

<p>Customers who receive Pension Supplement Minimum quarterly will receive their <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-03090000-01.html">Energy Supplement</a> quarterly.</p>

<p>PSMIN is calculated on a daily rate. The amount received each quarter can be different because the&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
number of days in a quarter can be different&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the annual PSMIN is divided by 364, even if it is a leap year</li>
			<li>
the result is multiplied by the number of days in the quarter</li>		</ul>
		<li>
customer changed from fortnightly to quarterly part way through a quarter. If that happened, the customer may have already received some of the payment due for the quarter as fortnightly payments</li>
		</ul>
<p>The year is divided into 4 using quarterly 'test dates'. The dates are the 20 September, 20 December, 20 March and 20 June.</p>

<p>Quarterly payments are generally made with the customer's income support payment on the first payday after the quarterly test date.</p>

<p><strong>Quarterly amount paid before the test date</strong></p>

<p>The quarterly PSMIN will be paid before the quarterly test date if the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
is suspended or cancelled&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
any accrued PSMIN will be automatically paid with the final income support payment</li>		</ul>
