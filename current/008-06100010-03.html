<p>When contact is made, talk to the customer to find out if new information may lead to a reassessment of the original requirement for the customer to have an ESAt.</p>

<p>In some circumstances the customer's payments may be restored without requiring them to attend a new appointment, or if there are exceptional issues with the current request.</p>

<p>Restore payment immediately if any of the following conditions are met and appropriate alternative arrangements have been made&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
customer in hardship is awaiting appointment (APS5 or above only), see <a href="../people-with-disability/008-06100010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Hardship_and_in_Step01">Step 1 in Table 3</a></li>
		<li>
new information provided and an ESAt request is no longer required, contact the relevant Assessment Services team</li>

payments were incorrectly suspended where the customer has mutual obligation requirements, where the '<strong>did not attend</strong>' outcome has been incorrectly recorded by the Assessor, see <a href="../people-with-disability/008-06100010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Hardship_and_in_Step02">Step 2 in Table 3</a></li>

<p>Services Australia must consider the customer's circumstances. For example, it is not reasonable to require a customer to attend an appointment if they are currently hospitalised due to a serious illness.</p>
