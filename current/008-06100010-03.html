<p>In all cases, the Service Officer must check that the ESAt request is still appropriate given current circumstances, and that an ESAt appointment is still required to assess the customer's barriers to employment.

<p>When contact is made, talk to the customer to find out if new information may lead to a reassessment of the original requirement for the customer to have an ESAt.</p>

<p>In some circumstances the customer's payments may be restored without requiring them to attend a new appointment, or if there are exceptional issues with the current request.</p>

<p>Restore payment immediately if any of the following conditions are met and appropriate alternative arrangements have been made&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
customer in hardship is awaiting appointment (APS5 or above only), see <a href="../people-with-disability/008-06100010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Hardship_and_in_Step01">Step 1 in Table 3</a></li>
		<li>
new information provided and an ESAt request is no longer required, contact the relevant Assessment Services team</li>
		<li>
payments were incorrectly suspended where the customer has mutual obligation requirements, where the '<strong>did not attend</strong>' outcome has been incorrectly recorded by the Assessor, see <a href="../people-with-disability/008-06100010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Hardship_and_in_Step02">Step 2 in Table 3</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>Services Australia must consider the customer's circumstances. For example, it is not reasonable to require a customer to attend an appointment if they are currently hospitalised due to a serious illness.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; Manual Follow-up (MFU) action will generally be required where a customer's payment is restored using an alternative manual reason, see <a href="../people-with-disability/008-06100010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Hardship_and_in_Step04">Step 4 in Table 3</a>. In all cases where payment is restored without arranging a new appointment (for example, because an ESAt is no longer required), contact Assessment Services to advise of the decision so that the current request can be cancelled.</p>
