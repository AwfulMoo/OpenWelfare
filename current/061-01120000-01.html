<p>This document outlines information about significant changes to the Australian Working Life Residence (AWLR) laws governing the rate of Centrelink payments paid outside Australia from 1 July 2014. These changes apply to customers paid under either domestic or international agreement portability assessments.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Special 'savings' provisions apply to customers who were either&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Outside Australia immediately before 1 July 2014. This special provision will continue to apply as long as the person remains outside Australia, unless they return to Australia for a period of 26 weeks or more, or</li>
		<li>
Inside Australia temporarily. Customers who normally reside outside of Australia and were in Australia temporarily when the rules changed. This special provision will continue to apply as long as the person leaves Australia on or before 29 December 2014, unless they return to Australia for a period of 26 weeks or more</li>
		</ul>
<p>These customers are able to continue to receive payment under the same conditions that they were subject to on their last departure before 1 July 2014.</p>

<p>A customer who is covered by this 'savings' provision can return to Australia for a visit and then return overseas an unlimited number of times without losing their 'savings' provision as long as they do not remain in Australia for 26 weeks or more in a single visit.</p>

<p>In other words, if a customer covered by this 'savings' provision returns to Australia for 26 weeks or more on or after 1 July 2014, they will lose their 'savings' provision. If they then decide to return overseas, they will be subject to the portability rules that apply at the time.</p>

<p>It is important that customers currently covered by this 'savings' provision contact Centrelink International Services (CIS) if they plan to return to Australia. CIS will ensure the customer is given accurate information about the possible effect on their payment if they decide to return.</p>

<p>This 'savings' provision is also applicable to many customers paid under an international agreement as the portability rate provisions for these customers have also changed.</p>

<p>An additional 'savings' provision also applies for customers receiving a Comparison Rate under an international agreement who were inside Australia on 1 July 2014.These customers are able to continue to receive payment under the same conditions that they were subject to immediately before 1 July 2014.</p>

<p>These customers will cease to receive the benefit of this 'savings' provision if they&#58;</p>

leave Australia, or</li>

	<div class="collapsible_container">

<p>The savings provisions may apply to all customers receiving the following payments&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Age Pension</li>
		<li>
Disability Support Pension (DSP)</li>
		<li>
Parenting Payment Single (PPS)</li>
		<li>
Carer Payment (CP)</li>
		<li>
Bereavement Allowance (BVA)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Wife Pension (WP) and Widow B Pension (WidB) customers who transferred to Age Pension on 20 March 2020 retained their savings provisions. </p>

<p>The savings provisions can only be utilised by customers payable outside Australia indefinitely under either domestic or international agreement assessment except for the New Zealand Agreement. All other payments have limited portability under existing portability legislation.</p>

<p>Under the existing portability rules there were a number of exemptions from being paid a proportional rate of pension. Most of these exemptions were removed with the change in law in September 2000 (for example, an Age Pension customer granted before 2 July 1986) however, customer's protections under the 20 September 2000 provisions will continue to apply.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>Customers who are payable outside Australia indefinitely, are usually paid at a proportional rate after 26 weeks absence from Australia, although some international agreement may apply proportionality at a different point in time. Residence in Australia between 16 years and Age Pension age is used to determine a person's Working Life Residence (WLR). <strong>Note&#58;</strong> customers receiving Age Pension, DSP and CP <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04024000-01.html">travelling to New Zealand are paid under special rules using their working age residence</a>. These special rules remain unchanged from 1 July 2014.</p>

<p>Customers who departed Australia before 1 July 2014, or are 'saved' from the 1 July 2014 AWLR changes can generally continue to receive the maximum means tested rate of pension if they have 300 months (25 years) or more AWLR.</p>

<p>From 1 July 2014, the maximum means tested rate of payment will require a person to have 420 months (35 years) or more AWLR with the following exceptions.</p>

<p>If the customer is paid using the Agreement with Greece the maximum WLR is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
300 months (25 years) for customers who were Australian residents at the commencement of the Agreement, or</li>
		<li>
528 months (44 years) for customers who were not Australian residents at the commencement of the Agreement</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer is paid using the Agreement with the Republic of North Macedonia, the maximum WLR is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
420 months (35 years) for customer who were Australian residents at the commencement of the Agreement, (300 months (25 years) if 'saved' under the 1 July 2014 portability provisions), or</li>

<p>Customers in receipt of CP or WP under an international agreement prior to 1 July 2014 are able to commence using their own AWLR from that date, if favourable to do so. Customers granted or who transfer to a payment under an international agreement after this date will use their own AWLR, unless 'saved' from the 1 July 2014 AWLR changes.</p>
