		</ul>
<p><strong>Income Maintenance Period</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>

		</ul>
<p><strong>You should also tell us if&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
you change your address (if your mail is returned to us because you are not at your address, your payments may be stopped or delayed)</li>
		<li>
you close the account your payments are sent to</li>
		<li>
your or your partner's income goes down (this may mean you will get more Parenting Payment)</li>
		<li>

		</ul>
<p><strong>Dependants</strong></p>

<p>A child under 16 years may be a dependant where she or he is in your care and, if not a full time student, has income (excluding maintenance) of less than or equal to &#123;dependent child income limit&#125; a week.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
A child under 16 is not a dependant where she or he is in receipt of a social security pension or benefit</li>
		<li>
If it is necessary in the future for us to review the dependency of any of your children, we will send one form to the person who is getting Parenting Payment and have both parents sign it. This will be more convenient for you and us</li>		</ul>

<p><strong>When to contact us</strong></p>

<p>If your partner has to give a form to Services Australia on a regular basis, you can tell us about any changes on that form. This means that you and your partner do not have to tell us more than once.</p>
