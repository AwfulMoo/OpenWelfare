<P>Carers who claimed or contacted in relation to a claim for CP (child) before <STRONG>1 October 2009</STRONG>, may have their claim backdated to 1 July 2009, or to the date on which they became qualified for CP (child), whichever is later.

<UL>
<LI>the carer was residentially qualified</LI>

<LI>the carer was providing constant care throughout the period, and</LI>
<LI>the carer would have passed the relevant income and assets tests and the payment was payable to them from the relevant date</LI></UL>
<P>To backdate a payment <STRONG>all</STRONG> relevant dates of effect must equal the date of grant on the (<STRONG>PNA)</STRONG> screen.</P>
<P>For example:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the link start date on the Link Summary (<STRONG>LS</STRONG>) screen</LI>

<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> if this is a change in care, due to a system limitation, the date of effect of the claim for CP cannot be coded as the cancellation date of the CP for the previous care receiver. This means that the carer may miss out on 1 day's payment.</P>
<P>For example, CP is cancelled from 4 February 2015 and paid up to and including 3 February 2015. The system only allows CP for the new care receiver to be granted from 5 February 2015 so the carer is not paid for 4 February 2015.</P>
<P>In these cases, the CP should be cancelled from Date Paid To (DPT) + 1 and the debt waived:</P>
<UL>
<LI>CP should then be granted from DPT for the new care receiver. <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> cancelling CP (child) will also result in the automatic cancellation of CA (auto)</LI>
<LI>to ensure the carer is advised the correct cancellation date, a manual cancellation letter is also required</LI></UL>
