<p>If the student has completed the term of study, the student's circumstances determine the end date to be applied.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> a tertiary or secondary non-schooling student is not considered to have completed a course of study at the end of each year of study in a multiple year course. Completion of a course occurs at the end of the total course period. For example, a 3 year course is completed at the end of the third year.</p>

<p>A secondary student&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
who boards at a boarding school, in an approved ABSTUDY Homestay arrangement, or at a hostel which is a signatory to the ABSTUDY Hostel Agreement) and&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
whose entitlements are paid to the boarding school or Hostel as an ABSTUDY boarding instalment, and</li>
			<li>
who completes a term of study is eligible to the away from home rate until the last date of the term entitlement period</li>		</ul>
		<li>
who boards privately, or whose board entitlements are paid to a Hostel as fortnightly-in-arrears, and who completes a term of study is eligible for the away from home rate up until the last day of the school term</li>
		<li>
who is a non-schooling or tertiary student who completes study is eligible for the away from home rate until the last formal day of the course</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> a student who completes all course work earlier than the formal completion date is still considered to have completed the course and is eligible for the full entitlement period. This often occurs for students in Year 11 or 12 who complete course work earlier than the official study end date, and are released from school early.</p>

<p>The reassessment of a student's last day of eligibility to the away from home rate may create an overpaid amount. The overpaid amount can be a&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
student residual boarding allowance</li>
		<li>
ABSTUDY boarding instalment paid to the board institution</li>
		<li>
term-in-advance boarding allowance paid to the board institution prior to 1 January 2019, see the <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-02070150-05.html">Resources</a> page</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Student residual board allowance</strong></p>

<p>If a debt activity occurs for any residual board allowance paid on behalf of the student, raise a debt against the responsible payee see the Resources page of <a href="../debts/107-09120020-01.html">Raising Fares Allowance (FAA) debts</a>. A <strong>DOC</strong> must be recorded on the student's record of action undertaken.</p>

<p><strong>ABSTUDY boarding instalments</strong></p>

<p>If a debt activity occurs for any portion of an instalment paid to a boarding institution on behalf of the student, a debt should be raised against the responsible organisation payee. The ABSTUDY Payee/Debtor Details (<strong>EYPY</strong>) screen will hold the organisation details and the debt activity will be automatically transferred to the debtor organisation.</p>

<p><strong>Term-in-advance boarding allowance paid to a boarding institution prior to 1 January 2019</strong></p>

<p>If a debt amount occurs from the term-in-advance amount paid to the boarding institution, a debt amount should be raised only for the amount that relates to the period that a boarding institution does not retain the away from home payments. Record a <strong>DOC</strong> on both the student and board organisation record of action undertaken. See the <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-02070150-05.html">Resources</a> page for information about term-in-advance payments.</p>

<p>In this circumstance, whilst the boarding institution, or Hostel, is entitled to retain the way from home entitlements already received via a term-in-advance payment for a period after the student discontinues, the student is deemed to have ceased eligibility to the away from home rate from the date their circumstances changed.</p>

<p>The student is not entitled to any fortnightly residual boarding allowance from the date they are deemed to have ceased eligibility for the away from home rate. Residual boarding allowance components will need to be ceased by coding Rate Component Override (<strong>EPRC</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>Access the <strong>EPRC</strong> screen&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
use the field (<strong>?</strong>) help to key the relevant values&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
start date for the override in the <strong>Start Date</strong> field (for example, student end date + 1)</li>
			<li>
end date in the <strong>End Date</strong> field (if non-standard rate will be for a defined period, for example, end of the term-in-advance entitlement period)</li>
			<li>
override type in the <strong>Component</strong> field</li>
			<li>
the reason in the <strong>Reason</strong> field</li>
			<li>
the amount in the <strong>Amount</strong> field (which will be $0.00)</li>
			<li>
<strong>Source</strong> and <strong>DOR</strong> fields, and press [<strong>Enter</strong>]</li>		</ul>
		<li>
finalise activity on Assessment Results (<strong>AR</strong>) screen, ensuring that the residual boarding amount has ceased from the correct date, and</li>
		<li>
record a <strong>DOC</strong> advising reason for decision</li>
		</ul>
<p>Coding <strong>EPRC</strong> to cease the residual boarding allowance to a customer may result in incorrect adjustments of boarding entitlement and/or transfer of unused School Fees Allowance (SFA) (Group 2) components. These amounts will need to be adjusted via the Daily Rate Component (<strong>RAC</strong>) or One Off Payment (<strong>OOP</strong>) screens to ensure no incorrect arrears or debts are raised, see <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-08170000-01.html">Payment of arrears after reassessment</a>.</p>

<p>The student cannot access alternate ABSTUDY allowances for any period the boarding institution, or Hostel, retains ABSTUDY away from home allowances. The <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-02070150-05.html">Resources</a> page contains an example.</p>

<p>If the student has commenced a new course of study, see <a target="_blank" href="../ongoing-contact/102-07020150-01.html">Changing or correcting course of study and/or educational institution for ABSTUDY students</a>.</p>
