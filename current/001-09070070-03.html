<p>Job seekers who are doing sufficient paid work to fully satisfy their mutual obligation requirements may approach Services Australia about having their activity approved, so they do not have to participate in employment services and do other activities like looking for work.</p>

<p>Alternatively, Service Officers should try to identify job seekers who could possibly have paid work approved and become Centrelink managed.</p>

<p>When a job seeker with&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
part-time mutual obligation requirements (principal carer, partial capacity to work (PCW), or</li>
		<li>
mature age 55+ job seeker PCP/PCW/TRWX/MA55+), and</li>
		<li>
has been declaring sufficient hours and earnings from employment to possibly fully satisfy their requirements,</li>
		<li>
an activity and action item will automatically generate on their record to prompt Service Officers to consider approving the activity</li>
		</ul>
<p>The action item is as follows, 'Customer's recent earnings suggest employment may be approved as meeting mutual obligation requirements. If approving, update Activity and Exemption Summary (<strong>AEX</strong>) screen and determine if a Job Plan update is required. Do <strong>not</strong> update the Job Plan if the customer is a Disability Employment Services (DES) participant.</p>

<p>Job seekers with full-time mutual obligation requirements can also use work to fully satisfy their obligations but the work must be at least 70 hours per fortnight with income equal to or above the national minimum wage. If the employment is less, other activities like job search will be required. They may still qualify for payment depending on the income test applicable for their circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> from 3 November 2018, some principal carers will have their approved part-time work (PTW) activity <strong>automatically updated</strong> if they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
are a principal carer, and</li>
		<li>
are receiving JobSeeker Payment (JSP), Parenting Payment Single (PPS), or Youth Allowance (YA) (Job seeker), and</li>
		<li>
have declared in their last 2 consecutive fortnights that they have worked at least 30 hours each fortnight and earned income equal to or above the national minimum wage</li>		</ul>

<p>Job Plans for job seekers managed by Services Australia are generally negotiated via an outbound phone call interview, done by service centre Service Officers. These outbound contacts are currently managed through the 'Compulsory Participation Interview' appointment type in the Centrelink Appointment System.</p>

<p>If the job seeker is Disability Employment Services (DES) managed, <a href="../job-seekers/001-09070070-03.html#bp03_tbl_Initial_assessm_Step11">go to  Step 11</a>.</p>

<p><img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> Job seekers can view scheduled appointments through their online account, but it will appear as a 'Participation Requirements Appointment'.</p>

<p>If the customer is declaring paid work for the first time&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Smart Centre Service Officers who are suitably skilled may negotiate a Job Plan with the job seeker over the phone. Apply the criteria for paid work to satisfy mutual obligation requirements. <a href="../job-seekers/001-09070070-03.html#bp03_tbl_Initial_assessm_Step03">Go to Step 3</a></li>
		<li>
Otherwise&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Book the first suitable 'Compulsory Participation Interview' available at the job seeker's local service centre. Tell the job seeker the time, date and reason for the appointment. Record a <strong>DOC</strong> confirming advice given, and any other relevant information from the job seeker. If the job seeker cannot accept a call from the service centre (e.g. they have inbound calling restrictions on their phone service), Service Officers should check Office Locator to decide if a walk-in is needed instead of a booked appointment. Procedure ends here</li>		</ul>

Apply the criteria for paid work to satisfy mutual obligation requirements. <a href="../job-seekers/001-09070070-03.html#bp03_tbl_Initial_assessm_Step03">Go to Step 3</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>If a principal carer did not complete their self service reporting because they <strong>did not declare the minimum wage</strong>, <a href="../job-seekers/001-09070070-03.html#bp03_tbl_Initial_assessm_Step09">go to Step 9</a>.</p>

<p>If the job seeker has <strong>ceased</strong> an already approved paid work (PTW) activity, see <a href="../job-seekers/001-09070070-03.html#bp03_tbl_Mutual_obligati_Step05">Step 5 in Table 2</a>.</p>

If a principal carer has had <strong>AEX</strong> updated automatically, a 'Change of Circumstances' work item is allocated to Service Officers for a new Job Plan to be negotiated, to include the new approved part-time work activity. The Job Plan must reflect the new dates on the <strong>AEX</strong> screen. <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-06045030-01.html">Finalising the COC activity</a> must be done by selecting the 'Update Part-time Work activity' COC Interaction from the Interaction History and changing the status from 'For manual action' to 'Completed'.

<strong>No</strong>, the paid work does not meet the requirements. The job seeker may need a referral to an Employment Services Provider if they have not already been connected.

If no complementary activity is chosen, the paid work is not an approved activity. If the job seeker already has a Job Plan, it will stay in place, but if they choose a new activity and the Service Officer must negotiate a new Job Plan. Procedure ends here</li>

<p>For ministers of religion who are either a principal carer of a dependent child or a person assessed as having a partial capacity to work (PCW), who is doing at least 30 hours of paid pastoral work a fortnight for their religious order, the amount of remuneration received does not have to be at the national minimum wage.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> more information about the national minimum wage is on the Fair Work Ombudsman website. Rates quoted in the information section of this site relate to workers 18 years or older. Other rates like junior rates are listed in the fact sheets for relevant years on the relevant website. See the <a href="../job-seekers/001-09070070-05.html">Resources</a> page for a link to the website.</p>

<p>Income provided by a partner to a member of a couple who is receiving a social security payment, does not meet the definition of income under <a href="../job-seekers/001-09070070-04.html">the Social Security Act (1991)</a>. This does not preclude instances where a principal carer does employment and gets income from a business where their partner is involved in that business, as long as the activity meets the necessary criteria.</p>

<p>For principal carers, a combination of paid work and self-employment or paid work and approved study, totalling at least 15 hours per week (30 hours per fortnight), will fully meet mutual obligation requirements. The business income must be equivalent to the national minimum wage for the agreed hours of employment.</p>

<p>For both Centrelink managed and provider managed job seekers, record the paid work as an approved activity.</p>

<p>If the job seeker has not started work yet, consider the correct start date to use when recording the approved activity, as this could affect their ability to use self service reporting. Activities can be recorded on the Activity and Exemption Summary (<strong>AEX</strong>) screen, and in the Job Plan with a start date of up to 2 weeks in the future. Once the activity start date has been reached, the self service reporting system will expect the required hours and earnings to be declared for each fortnight. If the job seeker has only commenced work part way through the first fortnight, they will not normally be declaring sufficient hours or earnings, and they will be transferred to a Service Officer (if using phone self-service), or asked to contact the agency to have the report finalised.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
For jobactive and Community Development Program (CDP) provider managed job seekers, negotiate a Job Plan with the job seeker that reflects the activities approved as fully meeting the job seeker's mutual obligation requirements, the job seeker will now be Centrelink managed</li>
		<li>
Use the 'Paid work' activity in the Job Plan so that activity start and end dates are included. This ensures the approved activity is reviewed at least every 12 months, and aligns with activity coding on the <strong>AEX</strong> screen<br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> The Job Plan will reflect the new dates on the <strong>AEX</strong> screen once accepted by the job seeker. For job seekers who are <strong>not</strong> DES participants, do <strong>not</strong> update AEX prior to negotiating, and, the Job Plan been accepted. The preferred coding is to update the Job Plan first. The <strong>AEX</strong> screen is then updated if needed ('PTW' activities copy across to <strong>AEX</strong>)</li>
		<li>
Use other appropriate activities in the Job Plan where a combination of activities are being approved, e.g. 'Study - part-time or full-time' activity for principal carers doing an approved combination of part-time work and study</li>
		<li>
Record the approved paid work activity on the <strong>AEX</strong> screen using the code of '<strong>PTW</strong>'. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> if doing a combination of suitable paid work and self-employment, use both codes '<strong>PTW</strong>' and '<strong>SEL</strong>'</li>
		<li>
For mature age 55+ customers doing a combination of voluntary and paid work, use code '<strong>VPE</strong>' on the <strong>AEX</strong> screen. See <a href="../job-seekers/001-09070060-01.html">Voluntary work as an approved activity</a> if the customer is attending for the annual review of their voluntary work activities</li>
		<li>
For principal carers doing a combination of part-time work and approved study, use code '<strong>SPW</strong>'</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> part-time work and other approved activities should not be coded on the <strong>AEX</strong> screen for more than 12 months at a time. A new Job Plan is needed every 12 months if the work is continuing. Ensure end date(s) on the <strong>AEX</strong> screen align with the Job Plan activity end date(s).</p>
