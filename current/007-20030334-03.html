<p>The workflow will present an error if the customer selects a date that does not meet this criteria.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> in limited circumstances, customers can be granted Flexible PPL on a date that is more than 42 days in the past. This includes customers that&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
meet the <a href="../families/007-05020030-01.html">PPL extended work test</a> that have nominated a PPL period start date that is in the past. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> Customers cannot receive JobKeeper payment and PPL for the same period. The customer will need to advise their employer if they decide to receive PPL instead of JobKeeper for the period.</li>
		<li>
have attempted to claim Flexible PPL within the required timeframe, however their claim was not finalised in time due to a system issue or other circumstances</li>
		</ul>
<p>For more information about how to identify and finalise Flexible PPL claims for these customers, see <a href="../families/007-20030334-03.html#bp03_tbl_Customers_claim_Step07">Step 7</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Impact on other payments/benefits</strong></p>

<p>When discussing when to claim Flexible PPL days, remind customers of the impact on other benefits that they (or their partner, if they have one) are claiming at the same time. If the customer is claiming Flexible PPL for a date in the past, this may result in a reassessment.</p>

<p>This includes&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Family Tax Benefit Part B, as this cannot be paid on days that the customer or their partner claim PPL</li>
		<li>
Income support payments. PPL is treated as ordinary income for determining eligibility and calculating the rate of income support payments for the customer and their partner for the same period</li>
		</ul>
<p>Reassessments of these payments due to receiving Flexible PPL for a past period may result in an overpayment for the customer or their partner. In some cases, PPL arrears will be offset against PPL or ISP overpayments that occur due to the reassessment.</p>

<p>Encourage customers to consider the impact on other payments they received when claiming Flexible PPL days in the past.</p>

<p><strong>Rate calculations of PPL affecting Income support payments</strong></p>

<p><strong>PPL period and Connected Flexible PPL days</strong></p>

<p>The rate of PPL affecting a customer and/or partner’s rate of Income Support Payment (ISP) is calculated by the average daily amount of payments received for the eligible PPL period and any connected Flexible PPL. The daily rate of PPL used for ISP purposes applies to a full calendar week, Monday to Sunday.</p>

<p>To calculate the daily rate of PPL affecting the rate of ISP&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
count the weekdays included in the PPL period and any connected day’s </li>
		<li>
multiply this by the daily rate of PPL</li>
		<li>
divide this total number of calendar days in the period (weekdays and weekend days)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Calculation Example&#58; ((Daily Rate of the Period) X (number of weekday in the period)) divided by (number of calendar days in the Period) = <strong>Daily rate (for ISP purposes)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Flexible PPL days, not connected</strong></p>

<p>Flexible PPL is calculated differently. The National Minimum Wage (NMW) is applied as the daily rate of PPL affecting the customer and/or their partner’s rate of Income Support Payment (ISP) without any further calculation.</p>

<p>For&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
a block of Flexible PPL days not connected to the PPL period, the NMW rate will be paid for every individual day within the block of Flexible PPL days including weekends.</li>
		<li>
an individual claimed Flexible PPL days, the NMW daily rate applies on any calendar day and includes weekends </li>
		</ul>

<p><strong>PPL period has started</strong></p>

<p>Once the customer’s PPL period starts, the customer cannot increase the number of connected days they have chosen.</p>

<p>However they can claim individual Flexible PPL days on the dates immediately after the end of their PPL period or connected Flexible PPL day. If eligible, the day will be delivered by Services Australia.

<p><strong>PPL period has not started</strong></p>

<p>Customers can increase the number of Flexible PPL days connected to the end of their PPL period or connected period if their PPL has not started. The customer does not need to nominate specific dates for these days. The system will determine them based on the end date of their PPL period. These days can be increased by the customer either via their online services or by a Service Officer using the <strong>PPL Circumstance</strong> guided procedure.</p>

<p>If the customer’ s claim is assessed awaiting proof of birth/adoption (<strong>PPL/ASS-PCB</strong>) and their PPL period start date is based on the child’s expected date of birth or adoption (pre-birth claim), the connected Flexible PPL days will be automatically moved if the PPL period start date changes.</p>

<p><strong>Flexible PPL day is rejected or withdrawn</strong></p>

<p>If a customer changes a Flexible PPL day it will be&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
withdrawn, if it is a day in the future that has not yet been sent to the customer or their employer</li>
		<li>
rejected, if it is a day in the past that has already been sent to the customer or their employer. A full list of rejection reasons is available on the<a href="../families/007-20030334-05.html"> Resources</a> page</li>

<p><strong>Reassessment results in arrears and/or overpayment </strong></p>

<p>If within the activity the results are both PPL arrears and an overpayment of PPL or an overpayment of an income support payment (ISP), the system will automatically offset these amounts. The offset will occur so a payment does not issue and subsequently raise a debt on the same day. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> offsetting for ISP overpayments only applies where the ISP overpayment is a result of the customer getting PPL for the same past period. This is because PPL is treated as ordinary income for calculating the rate of ISP.</p>

<p>If the overpayment amount is greater than the arrears amount, a debt will be identified. The debt shell will auto-allocate to the appropriate debt team for investigation.</p>
