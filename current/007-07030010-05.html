<p><strong>What are special circumstances?</strong></p>

<p>Special circumstances are by their very nature incapable of precise or exhaustive definition. 'Special circumstances' relates to circumstances that are unusual, uncommon or exceptional.</p>

<p>In order for a circumstance to be considered special it needs to be 'different from the usual run of cases'. It is not necessary that the circumstances of the customer be unique, however they 'must be out of the ordinary' and have 'a particular quality of unusualness that permits them to be described as special'.</p>

<p>Whether or not a customer's circumstances would be considered special must be determined on a case by case basis.</p>

<p>For an extension to be considered, the special circumstances must include events which lead to the individual being unable to lodge a Family Tax Benefit (FTB) or Single Income Family Supplement (SIFS) lump sum claim, and where applicable, advising they or their partner (if they have one) are not required to lodge a tax return.</p>

<p>It is not possible to set out a complete list of relevant factors to be taken into account.</p>

<p>Before granting the extension, Services Australia must be satisfied that special circumstances exist.</p>

What is the nature of the event that prevented (or will prevent) the customer and/or their partner from meeting the requirement (for example, fire, flood, accident, ill health, bereavement)?</li>

<p><strong>Who can be granted a special circumstances extension?</strong></p>

<p>The type of extension granted is dependent on the type of claim the customer has lodged (including those who have previously had their claim made not effective/rejected).</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> a claim for the relevant financial year must be lodged before a decision about special circumstances can be made.</p>

<p><strong>Lump sum customers&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Family Tax Benefit (FTB)<br></strong>A customer who has lodged a lump sum FTB claim may access the following special circumstances extensions&#58;</li>

<a class="anchor" name="bp05_tbl_Examples_Spec_4"></a>

<td>

<p><strong>Are there minimum and maximum extension periods?</strong></p>

<p>An extension cannot be granted beyond 30 June of the second income year (that is, extended lodgement year), as there are no legislative provisions to do so.</p>

<p>The extension period granted is considered on a case by case basis. The extension period is determined through a discussion with the customer to ensure a reasonable period of time is allowed for them to meet their requirements.</p>

<p>A retrospective extension can be granted after the end of the second income year however the requirement to which the extension relates must have been met by 30 June of the extended lodgement year. The customer would need to <a href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/109-02000000-01.html">apply for a formal review</a> within 52 weeks after notification of the decision.</p>

<p><strong>Determining the type of special circumstances extension required</strong></p>

<p>Sarah and Robert have 2 children in their care. Due to the nature of their employment, they are unable to provide a reasonable estimate of their income, and choose to claim Family Tax Benefit (FTB) after the end of the financial year when their actual income is available.</p>

<p>Sarah and Robert have 12 months following the end of the entitlement year to lodge a claim for FTB. If Sarah lodges a claim after 30 June of the lodgement year, the claim will be made not effective and Sarah will not be entitled to FTB.</p>

<p>Sarah goes online on 18 July of the extended lodgement year to complete a lump sum claim and cannot access the entitlement year claim. Sarah contacts to query why the claim cannot be accessed.</p>

<p>Sarah is informed about the change to the timeframe for lump sum claim lodgement. Sarah intended to lodge a claim in May after tax returns had been lodged with the Australia Taxation Office (ATO), ensuring the lodgement timeframe would be met. However, Sarah and Roberts' child was diagnosed with leukaemia in mid-May. This resulted in hospitalisation for a 6 week period during which Sarah was staying at the hospital with the child and Robert visited each weekend.</p>

<p><strong>Consideration by Service Officer</strong></p>

<p>A paper lump sum claim for the relevant financial year should be issued to Sarah for completion. Sarah will need to lodge the lump sum claim before the end of the extended lodgement year. A <strong>DOC</strong> should be recorded on Sarah's record with the reason/s why Sarah was unable to lodge a claim by 30 June of the lodgement year. Sarah should be advised a special circumstances assessment and/or decision cannot be undertaken until a claim for the relevant financial year has been lodged. The assessment will be undertaken by processing staff assessing the claim.</p>

<p>Sarah and/or Sarah's partner may also require income lodgement extensions, however, extensions cannot be considered until after the lump sum claim has been lodged. Sarah advises that tax returns for partner Robert were lodged 2 days before the diagnosis. Sarah does not require an extension to confirm either income.</p>

<p>There is no need to record information using the Family Assistance Lodgement Period Extension Management tool because a special circumstances assessment cannot be undertaken until the lump sum claim has been lodged.</p>

<p><strong>Forms for customer</strong></p>

<p>A paper FA054 claim form will be issued separately to Sarah.</p>

<p><strong>Determining an appropriate extension period</strong></p>

<p>Bernadette lodged a lump sum Family Tax Benefit (FTB) claim for the 2018-19 financial year in April 2020. Services Australia advised that Bernadette and partner Howard, would need to lodge tax returns by 30 June 2020 or they would not be entitled to FTB.</p>

<p>Bernadette contacted the agency in May 2020 to advise they were not able to lodge tax returns by 30 June 2020, because their accountant was recently involved in a serious accident shortly after the appointment at the accountants' firm in March. Bernadette has just been advised of this and was told that the accountant will be off work for a further 6 weeks.</p>

<p>Bernadette advised that the accountant has only been able to employ a person to assist the firm in a part time capacity and there will be a delay in having tax returns prepared and submitted.</p>

<p>Bernadette has spoken with the relieving accountant who advised that they should be able to lodge their tax returns by mid July 2020.</p>

<p>The circumstances leading to the lodgement of the tax returns are not in Bernadette's sole control. Bernadette has ensured relevant documentation is available to the accountant and is waiting for this to be prepared and submitted to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).</p>

<p>Bernadette has already lodged a lump sum FTB claim for the relevant financial year. This allows for a special circumstances assessment to be undertaken. In this instance a special circumstances extension for income confirmation could be granted. Although seeking a 2 week extension, it would be reasonable to consider an extension period of 4 to 6 weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Determining a further extension</strong></p>

<p>Bernadette and partner, Howard, have been granted an extension of time to lodge their tax returns for the 2018-19 financial year by Services Australia due to their accountant being involved in a serious car accident delaying the lodgement of the processing of the tax returns. The extension date of 5 August 2020 is recorded.</p>

<p>Income details for Bernadette and Howard are confirmed on 15 August 2020. The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) advises the agency that tax returns were lodged on 15 August 2020. Bernadette's Family Tax Benefit (FTB) lump sum claim is made not effective due to the late lodgement of income.</p>

<p>Bernadette contacts on 30 August 2020 after being told FTB was not payable because of the late lodgement of tax returns. Bernadette advises that there was a further delay in lodging tax returns because the accountant had only recently returned to work in a part time capacity and had an outstanding work load.</p>

<p>In this instance a further special circumstances extension may be considered to coincide with the date the tax return was lodged with the ATO. This would allow the claim to be effective, and entitlement paid.</p>

<p><strong>Determining a special circumstances extension request separate from the ATO</strong></p>

<p>Andrew's partner, Elizabeth has lodged a Family Tax Benefit (FTB) lump sum claim and has been told by Services Australia of not being entitled to FTB if Andrew does not lodge a tax return for the relevant financial year by 30 June of the lodgement year. Elizabeth is not required to lodge a tax return and has advised this previously.</p>

<p>Andrew has recently returned to Australia from an overseas posting. The posting was unexpectedly extended by 3 months. Andrew has spoken with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and has been granted an extension of time to lodge the tax return. The ATO has granted an extension until the end of July, after the end of the lodgement year.</p>

<p>The ATO extension to lodge a tax return will <strong>not automatically be applied</strong> to Elizabeth's FTB claim.</p>

<p>Once Andrew lodges the tax return, the ATO will advise the agency of the lodgement date and if this date is after 30 June (and no special circumstance extension has been recorded), Elizabeth's claim will be made not effective due to the late lodgement of income.</p>

<p>The letter advising Elizabeth of the outcome of the claim will include a text advising to contact the agency if there were special circumstances that prevented confirmation of the income.</p>

<p><strong>Extension request</strong></p>

<p>The agency may grant a special circumstances income confirmation extension retrospectively, however either Elizabeth or Andrew will need to contact the agency to discuss their circumstances for this to be considered.</p>

<p>Yes. A Family Tax Benefit (FTB) instalment customer is only able to access a special circumstances extension <strong>to confirm their or their partner's (if they have one) income</strong>.</p>

<p>Income is confirmed by lodging a tax return with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) or advising Services Australia that they or their partner are not required to lodge.</p>

<p><strong>Reasons that would not generally meet special circumstances criteria - income lodgement</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
a tax agent/accountant has advised they had heavy workloads which prevented lodgement of tax returns by 30 June</li>
		<li>
the customer thought that the tax agent/accountant had lodged the tax returns when this was not the case</li>
		<li>
a tax agent/accountant forgot to lodge the tax returns by 30 June</li>
		<li>
issues with employer who had not taken appropriate deductions from payment during the financial year</li>
		<li>
financial statements were lodged with tax agent prior to 30 June, however these were misplaced and lodged late</li>
		<li>
customer was not aware of the need to lodge a tax return</li>
		<li>
information to complete tax return not available until late in the lodgement year</li>
		<li>
local computer problems delayed transmission of a tax return to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO)</li>
		<li>
the partner is a fly in/fly out worker and is not always home</li>
		<li>
it was cheaper to lodge tax returns for multiple financial years at the same time</li>
		<li>
they incurred capital gains debt and delayed the lodgement of the tax return</li>
		<li>
they were unable to locate payment summaries</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> an individual is ultimately responsible for ensuring their tax return is lodged with the ATO on time and that they do not leave it to the last minute to do so.</p>

<p>Providing financial statements to a tax agent/accountant does not constitute lodging tax returns with the ATO and therefore the customer and/or their partner should make their tax agent aware that their tax return/s must be lodged by 30 June of the lodgement year.</p>

<p>However, if special circumstances caused the tax agent to lodge the returns late, for example, the agent's offices were damaged by fire, destroying all administrative records, an extension to lodge may be warranted. This would be considered on a case by case basis.</p>

<p><strong>Can a special circumstances extension be granted if a customer contacts during an ATO shutdown period that occurs in June?</strong></p>

<p>The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) temporarily ceases transmitting Family Tax Benefit (FTB) transactions to Services Australia during 2 shutdown periods in each financial year. These periods are generally June and December.</p>

<p>The ATO is not closed during these periods, and taxation lodgement facilities, including electronic lodgement services, continue to operate.</p>

<p>A customer is able to lodge a tax return with the ATO during a shutdown period. A lodgement extension should not be granted for this reason.</p>

<p>They may have special circumstances that prevent them from lodging their tax return before 30 June. This may result in an extension being granted.</p>

<p><strong>Can Services Australia grant an income confirmation extension for family assistance purposes if the ATO has not approved an extension to lodge a tax return or vice versa?</strong></p>

<p>Decisions to grant an income confirmation extension due to special circumstances are assessed separately by the agency and the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).</p>

<p>As discussions are based on conversations with a customer on a case by case basis taking into account different factors, it is possible that the decisions made by the ATO and the agency regarding extending the time to lodge a tax return may be different.</p>

<p>For example, the ATO may reject a request to defer the lodgement of a tax return based on a customer's compliance history.</p>

<p>There are no transmissions/liaisons between the ATO and Services Australia regarding extensions to lodge tax returns. A Services Australia Service Officer may grant a special circumstances extension to confirm income based on discussions with a customer.</p>

<p>In the majority of situations evidence will not be required.</p>

<p>However, where an element of doubt exists a Service Officer may request evidence to support the decision. This may be where a customer has a history of requesting special circumstances extensions or where the Service Officer is not satisfied the requirement is met.</p>

<p>If a customer claims to have been affected by a natural disaster and doubt exists, a Service Officer may be able to establish if an emergency payment has been issued by checking the payment summary, benefit status and document history screens on the customer's record.</p>

<p><strong>Can different extension periods be recorded if multiple extensions are granted?</strong></p>

<p>No. If a customer is granted a special circumstances extension for multiple requirements, the extension end date will be the same.</p>

<p>It is likely a customer may be able to meet requirements at different times, however, when considering an extension end date, the requirement that will take the longest period to meet will be used in determining the extension end date for all requirements, provided it is no later than 30 June of the second income year (that is, extended lodgement year).</p>
