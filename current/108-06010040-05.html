<p><strong>Title transferred to child to build units with customer living in 1 unit</strong></p>

<p>A customer wishes to transfer the title of their property, to their child. The property is a home on a large block.</p>

<p>The child intends to build 3 units. One will be for the parent for as long as they live. The other 2 are to be rented out as investment properties. How is this assessed?</p>

<p><strong>Answer&#58;</strong></p>

<p>The customer has a life interest in 1 of the units and has created a granny flat interest.</p>

<p>Section 12A(2) of the Social Security Act 1991 states&#58;</p>

<p>A person has a granny flat interest in the person's principal home if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the residence which is the person's principal home is a private residence, and</li>
		<li>
the person has acquired for valuable consideration or has retained&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
a right to accommodation for life in the residence, or</li>
			<li>
a life interest in the residence</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>The child's investment scheme as it relates to the 2 other units is not an issue for the customer. The child is the legal owner of the property. It does not matter that the customer will be living alone in the unit.</p>

<p><strong>Sold principal home to purchase interest in property and to build granny flat</strong></p>

<p>A customer has sold their principal home. They use the proceeds to buy a one third interest in a property.</p>

<p>They will build an extension to the existing house. This will be their 'granny flat'.</p>

<p>The cost of the granny flat extension is <strong>less than</strong> the Extra Allowable Amount (EAA).</p>

<p>Has the customer established a granny flat right? Is the customer a non-homeowner?</p>

<p><strong>Answer&#58;</strong></p>

<p>The customer has not established a granny flat interest.</p>

<p>The customer's right to live in the property stems from their legal ownership to a one third of the property. The customer is a homeowner.</p>

<p><strong>Selling home, giving proceeds to children, and live in children's homes </strong></p>

<p>A 70 year old customer intends to sell their house and divide the proceeds between their 2 children.</p>

<p>The customer intends to live at both their homes on an alternate basis for the rest of their life. They will live in Brisbane for 7 months and the other 5 summer months in Melbourne.</p>

<p>The children will be paid $140 000 and $100 000 respectively.</p>

<p>How will this affect the customer's pension payment?</p>

<p><strong>Answer&#58;</strong></p>

<p>The customer has created a multiple granny flat interest.</p>

<p>Services Australia must apply the reasonableness test. The reasonableness test amount is $277,208.</p>

<p>The total amount the customer is gifting the children is $240,000. This is, less than the reasonableness test amount.</p>

<p><strong>Sold home and dividing time between children, gave funds to each child</strong></p>

<p>A recently widowed customer aged 79, will sell their house to live with their 2 children.</p>

<p>They will spend time equally with the children and pay them $100 000 each.</p>

<p>How will this impact their age pension payment?</p>

<p><strong>Answer&#58;</strong></p>

<p>The customer has created a multiple granny flat interest.</p>

<p>Services Australia will apply the reasonableness test. The test amount is $178 389.</p>

<p>The total amount gifted is $200 000. This is more than the test amount.</p>

<p>If equal periods will be spent at each granny flat, the policy is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer's principal home is the most expensive granny flat right</li>
		<li>
the deprivation amount is the amount paid for the less expensive granny flat</li>
		</ul>
<p>As the customer has paid the same amount for each granny flat&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
only one home can be treated as the granny flat interest and the principal home, and</li>
		<li>
the amount paid for other is treated as a gift</li>

<p><strong>Granny flat interest customer enters aged care</strong></p>

<p>Does the value of the granny flat interest affect their rate?</p>

<p><strong>Answer&#58;</strong></p>

<p>If the customer's partner still lives in the granny flat interest, the customer remains a homeowner. There is no deprivation and no asset to assess.</p>

<p>If the customer has terminated the granny flat interest, and the value of their original contribution has been returned, no deprivation has occurred.</p>

<p>If the customer has terminated the granny flat interest, and the value of their original contribution has not been returned, deprivation may have occurred. This depends on if&#58;</p>

they vacate 'the granny flat' within 5 years of the date they created the interest, <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
the reason they left would have been known at the time the interest was created</li>

<p><strong>Customer with granny flat interest vacates within 5 years</strong></p>

<p>On 1 July 2017, the customer creates a granny flat interest by gifting their home property in return for a right to accommodation for life.</p>

<p>On 1 July 2018, they vacate the property to move to a unit they have purchased. This was their original intention at the time they created the granny flat interest. The value of their original contribution was not returned when they moved to the unit.</p>

<p>Deprivation applies from 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2022.</p>

<p>Example&#58;</p>

<p>The customer has transferred their home situated on 100 hectares on one title to their son for a granny flat right.</p>

<p>The whole property is worth $1.5 million.</p>

<p>The value of the home and the surrounding 2 hectares is $800 000.</p>

<p>The reasonableness test amount has been calculated at $747 916.</p>

<p>The value of the granny flat interest is therefore $800 000 (because the value of the home and surrounding 2 hectares is greater than the reasonableness test amount).</p>

<p>Deprivation is the difference between&#58;</p>

<p>The value of the whole property $1.5 million</p>

<p>The value of the granny flat interest $800 000</p>

<p>The calculated deprivation amount is $700 000</p>

<p>They are considered homeowners as the value of the granny flat interest is greater than the EAA</p>

<p>The new owner of the property has a remainder interest. If they are also a customer, this is an exempt asset as it was not created by them.</p>
