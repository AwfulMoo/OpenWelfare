<p><strong>Role of the social worker in assessing entitlement</strong></p>

<p>When determining entitlement to Crisis Payment (CrP) the social worker has the responsibility for assessing if a domestic or family violence situation exists. </p>

<p>CrP is paid to re-establish a new home or to help to remain in their home (for example, pay for repairs or changing of locks because of domestic or family violence). It is not paid to people for the sole purpose of leaving a family or domestic violence situation.</p>

<p>If a customer can readily give verification of an incident of domestic or family violence, the social worker can make an assessment on the available evidence without conducting an interview.</p>

<p>Third party verification of the family or domestic violence is to be obtained where possible during the initial interview with the Service Officer. Where the CrP is being assessed as an ACC the customer is to upload third party verification to their record. Where it is not given, the social worker will need to get appropriate verbal verification, or where that is not possible, make a professional assessment.</p></td>

<p><strong>Verification required</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Acceptable third party evidence for customers who have left their home due to family and domestic violence could include, for example, an Apprehended Violence Order (AVO), police report, domestic violence refuge worker, crisis service, doctor's report or a letter from a domestic violence refuge. See link below this table to the Overview of family and domestic violence orders. (This link is not available to the public). If documents are not able to be provided or uploaded to the customer's record, verbal verification can be obtained from relevant third parties by the social worker</li>
		<li>
Acceptable third party evidence to demonstrate the customer's intent to establish a new home could include an appointment with Housing Authority regarding transfer or application for emergency accommodation, bond/rent receipt, lease agreement, letter from refuge/case worker</li>
		<li>
Acceptable third party evidence that the alleged or actual perpetrator of violence actually lived with the victim in the home immediately before being removed could include a lease agreement, police report, Housing Authority documents, a bond or rent receipt</li>
		<li>
Legal evidence of the incident including verification that the actual or alleged perpetrator has been prohibited from the home <strong>must be</strong> an AVO, Protection order, police report or other court issued order. Where a police written or verbal report and/or court order documents cannot be given for verification purposes, the claim must be rejected</li>		</ul></td>

<p><strong>Assessment for eligibility</strong></p>

<p>The social worker has the responsibility for assessing if a domestic or family violence situation exists. They will recommend whether to grant or reject a claim for CrP.</p>

<p>Service Officers are responsible for assessing other eligibility criteria that must be met for CrP - domestic or family violence claims, including severe financial hardship, number of Crisis Payments allowed, claimed in Australia. The system assesses these eligibility criteria where the claim is lodged online or via ACC. The social worker is responsible for considering and included all eligibility criteria within their assessment and the grant or reject <strong>Fast Note</strong>.</p>

<p>The social worker is responsible for considering the other eligibility criteria including severe financial hardship. The social worker must tell the customer to upload a bank statement to their Services Australia record as verification for the assessment. If the customer is unable to do this safely and immediately, the social worker can accept a verbal declaration from the customer regarding their financial circumstances and the system will assess financial hardship nothing information on their record regarding liquid assets.</p></td>

<p>The customer would be entitled to a CrP as an extreme circumstance has occurred and the customer has had to leave the home. CrP may also be payable to a family member who has <strong>allegedly</strong> used family or domestic violence and has been removed from the family home by police, if the customer cannot remain in, or return to the home for legal reasons. Legal evidence of the alleged or actual perpetrator being prohibited from the home must be obtained.

<p><strong>Decision to grant Youth Allowance or ABSTUDY customer under 'unable to live at home/independent' criteria has not been made by social worker, or PIT/PAT details are still<i> </i>to be finalised</strong></p>

<p>CrP can only be granted if, at the time of claim, the customer is eligible for the social security pension, social security benefit or ABSTUDY Living Allowance and it is payable to the person. Therefore, if the Youth Allowance or ABSTUDY determination has not been finalised, determination of CrP must be delayed. If the customer is claiming YA or ABSTUDY before being released from prison or psychiatric confinement, the 21 day rule for accepting claims may help relevant information being requested and timely determination of YA or ABSTUDY (and therefore CrP).</p></td>

could not be contacted (rejection code CNC)</li>
		<li>
has recontacted with new information relevant to the decision</li>

<p>The normal review and appeal process applies. See <a href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/109-03000000-01.html">Initial contact about a decision and the review of decision process</a>.</p>

<p>The Decision Maker (DM) will give an explanation of the decision and consider any new information given by the customer. See <a href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/109-02020010-01.html">SME explanations, ARO referrals and implementing ARO decisions</a>.</p>

<p>If the customer wants to apply for a formal review of the decision an Authorised Review Officer (ARO) will undertake a formal review. See <a href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/109-02000000-01.html">Request for an explanation or application for a formal review (CLK)</a>.</p>
