<p>To be eligible for DED, general <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-03030000-01.html">AIC Scheme eligibility criteria</a> must be met, and&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the student must be studying through an approved distance education provider, or</li>

<p>DED is the applicable allowance where a student undertaking study by distance education methods must periodically attend a residential school or a short 'mini' school as part of their course.</p>

<p><strong>AIC Pensioner Education Supplement</strong> is the appropriate payment if the student receives&#58;</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Homeland Learning Centres (HLC) - (outstation schools) are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Northern Territory (NT) Government recognised annexes of NT Government remote community schools (sometimes known as 'hub' schools or Community Education Centres 'CECs')</li>
		<li>
located in the area around a remote community, and</li>
		<li>
with the support of the remote community school&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
provides primary and secondary education to students of Indigenous families living outside the main community in traditional homelands or an outstation</li>
			<li>
some HLCs may not provide secondary level study or provide the same range of grades for primary and/or secondary level study</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>HLCs are not approved institutions but are administered by remote community schools or 'hub' schools. For the payment of DED HLCs are 'acceptable study locations' in the AIC Scheme Guidelines for payment of DED.</p>

<p>Students are eligible for AIC on the basis their local government schools and remote community schools or 'hub' schools, are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
all classified as limited program schools by the NT Government, and</li>
		<li>
not 'appropriate state schools' under AIC policy</li>
		</ul>
<p>This means students are considered geographically isolated, regardless of the&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
proximity (or distance) of the homeland, or outstation location to the remote community school, or</li>
		<li>
availability of transport to the school</li>
		</ul>
<p>DED is payable if the student attends an HLC and they and their AIC applicant (that is parent, guardian or carer) live on the homeland or outstation location.</p>

<p>DED is <strong>not</strong> payable for a student&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
attending the main remote community (hub/CEC) school or where the student and/or their parent/guardian/carer(s) live in the main remote community</li>
		<li>
living on the homeland or outstation location who travels to the main community to attend the remote community school (for example because the HLC does not provide their level of study or grade), or</li>
		<li>
living in the main community who travels to the homeland or outstation location to attend a HLC</li>
		</ul>
<p>It is not uncommon for a student to be attending an HLC and living in the homeland location with a carer such as a grandparent or other relative, who receives Family Tax Benefit for the student, while the student’s parent(s) live in the main community. In this case, if the carer has principal care of the student, they can be an approved applicant and receive DED for the student.</p>

<p>Where an applicant wants their DED to be paid to the school it should go to an HLC account set up by the administering remote community school, not any other account.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> <strong>Income Management</strong> - AIC applicants whose DED payments for a student attending a NT HLC, are not directed to the school (that is the applicant receives the DED), may be subject to Income Management. If an AIC applicant on a Centrelink or Veterans' Affairs income support payment receives DED for a student attending a HLC and has not directed the payments to the school, they may qualify under one or more of the <a href="../payment-delivery/103-01020000-01.html">Income Management</a> measures because of their individual circumstances.</p>

<p>Where income management is applied, the portion of DED that is income managed is pooled with the income managed portion of their other Centrelink payment(s). This is paid to meet living expenses (known as priority needs) that are determined by the applicant in consultation with a Service Officer. The AIC Smart Centre teams have no role in the administration of Income Management in respect of AIC applicants and AIC payments.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Parttime_dista">Part-time distance education study - eligibility</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Distance Education Allowance (DED) is normally paid for full-time study but in some cases it can be paid on a pro-rata basis where a student is undertaking a combination of face-to-face and distance education. These dual study arrangements for students are usually for either socialisation reasons or under a plan for a gradual return to full-time school attendance.</p>

<p>Pro-rata payment can be made where a student is studying some lessons/subjects/hours/days in face-to-face schooling and&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
is a student with a special need that has been assessed as needing to study from home but is not enrolled at a distance education school on a full-time basis (even taking into account any disability)</li>
		<li>
is undertaking home schooling/education, or undertaking work set by the school to do at home, for less than 4 school days a week</li>
		</ul>
<p>The assumption is the relevant state/territory education authorities (through the distance education school or home education/schooling authority) are aware of the dual study arrangement and either agree with, or have no objection to, the student also attending the school. See the State / Territory Department of Education approval table on the <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-03040020-05.html">Resources</a> Page for details.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Parttime_dista01">Part-time distance education study - evidence requirements</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Even though the applicant may have advised the distance education study, home schooling/education or other approved home-based study (for example work set by school to do at home) is part-time, the student's study load needs to be ascertained along with student's parallel face-to-face school attendance or enrolment. This is to confirm the study is part-time but also to determine the percentage study load so the correct pro-rata rate of DED is paid.</p>

<p>The school enrolment/attendance (for face-to-face study) for some distance education or home schooled students may be at such a low level that it may not affect their eligibility for the normal (full-time) rate of DED. For example, if the local school enrolment/attendance is low enough to mean the student is undertaking the home-based study component for at least 4 days in the school week or the distance education school advises the student's enrolment is (still) full-time, the full-time rate of DED is payable.</p>

<p>Depending on how the home based and face-to-face study loads are identified and measured, the number of school days, hours, subjects or lessons needs to be ascertained from information provided by the applicant (that is from the claim or subsequent contact) and from the relevant school(s) or state or territory home schooling/education authority responsible for the study. The period (start and end dates) of the study combinations is also needed. From this verification, the percentage study loads can be determined.</p>

<p>Where the study arrangements are complex and do not fit into the categories or scenarios in these procedures, advice should be sought from the AIC Level 2 helpdesk. Where the amount of study at home and school varies from week to week, it will be necessary to assess and pay any DED a term in arrears. See the table on the <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-03040020-05.html">Resources</a> page for further information.</p>

<p>The limited program school status of Northern Territory (and South Australia and Western Australia) government remote community schools provides assistance options for other methods of study for students whose homes are in a homeland or outstation location or in a remote Indigenous community.</p>

<p>Students studying at primary or secondary level and enrolled though a school of distance education or school of the air may be eligible for AIC DED. Students studying at primary or secondary level who are boarding away from home may be eligible for AIC Boarding Allowances, although those at secondary level may attract a higher level and greater range of assistance from ABSTUDY or Youth Allowance. ABSTUDY may also assist secondary students (and primary level students if they are aged 13 or over at 1 January of the year of study) attending a remote community school.</p>
