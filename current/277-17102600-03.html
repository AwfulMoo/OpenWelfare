<p>Consider if the customer was affected by one of the following prescribed circumstances&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer was unaware that an assessment had been made</li>
		<li>
the customer had a serious illness or injury (including serious mental illness)</li>
		<li>
the customer was incarcerated</li>
		<li>
the customer resided in a remote location which made it difficult to contact Child Support</li>
		<li>
the customer was prevented from contacting Child Support due to a natural disaster, or</li>
		<li>
the customer was prevented from contacting Child Support due to some other exceptional circumstance which may include&#58;</li>
		<li>
customers with literacy issues, which may include those who find our forms and requirements difficult to understand or complete</li>
		<li>
customers with communication issues, including customers from non-English speaking backgrounds</li>
		<li>
homelessness, in a similar way to a person who resides in a remote location. Both are unusual living situations which reduce a person’s access to communication</li>
		<li>
circumstances, other than those listed above, which made it difficult for the customer to contact Child Support</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> exceptional circumstances are not limited to the above list, however they must be unusual or out of the ordinary compared to those of other child support customers. For example, extreme family breakdown may be considered unusual among the general Australian population. However, it would reasonably be considered commonplace for child support customers so would be unlikely to fit the definition of ‘exceptional,’ unless there was a combination of other factors that made a customer’s particular circumstances more unusual (such as family violence). </p>

<p>If exceptional circumstances are being considered, seek assistance from a Service Support Officer. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-09140000-01.html">Technical Support in Child Support</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Has the customer been affected by a prescribed circumstance?</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>

<p>Determine if the prescribed circumstance prevented the customer from providing their income information to Child Support sooner.</p>

<p>Consider the timing of the prescribed circumstances (they must have occurred at the time the assessment was made), as well as the extent to which they affected the customer. </p>

<p>The customer’s income can only be applied retrospectively if Services Australia is satisfied that a prescribed circumstance prevented the customer from providing their income information at the time the assessment was made. For example&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
If a customer was not able to provide their income information due to being incarcerated, they must have been incarcerated at the time the assessment was actually made, rather than for the period when they should have lodged their tax return or for some other period. If satisfied that a person was incarcerated at the time the assessment was made, it can generally be accepted that the person was prevented from providing their income information (unless there is evidence to suggest otherwise). </li>
		</ul>
<p>In situations where prescribed circumstances affected a customer for an extended period or on an ongoing basis, for example a customer who has poor English language skills, it might be more difficult to assess whether they were prevented from providing their income information at the time the relevant assessment was made. For example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a customer who speaks English as a second language, has been in Australia for only a short period and has a new Child Support case, may find their circumstances make it difficult for them to understand and comply with our requirements, including understanding how to access support (such as using authorised representatives or interpreters) to the extent that they are prevented from providing their income information. It is likely the customer was prevented from providing their income information  </li>
		<li>
a customer who has been in Australia and has had a Child Support case for a longer period, who is employed in an Australian business and is able to manage their other government affairs, and has provided their income information to us in the past. It is unlikely the customer was prevented from providing their income information  </li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Has the prescribed circumstance prevented the customer from providing their income information?</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>, <a href="../separated-parents/277-17102600-03.html#bp03_tbl_Prescribed_circ_Step04">go to Step 4</a></li>
		<li>
<strong>No</strong>, the ATI cannot be applied under Section 11, <a href="../separated-parents/277-17102600-03.html#bp03_tbl_Prescribed_circ_Step05">go to Step 5</a></li>		</ul>

<p><strong>Consider whether the customer provided their income details within a reasonable time</strong> <a title="Read more 4" class="showhead bp03_tbl_Prescribed_circ_Step04" onclick="erefshow(this)" href="javascript:;"><span class="showhead bp03_tbl_Prescribed_circ_Step04" onclick="erefshow(this)" href="javascript:;">+</span> Read more ...</a></p>
<div class="showcont">


<p>Determine if the customer provided their income information within a reasonable period of time once the prescribed circumstances no longer prevent them from doing so.</p>

<p>Generally a customer could be considered to have done something in a reasonable period of time if they have acted as soon as possible where their circumstances permit. If a person’s ability to do something is affected due to circumstances beyond their control (for example, a natural disaster, unexpected actions of another person, etc.) and they then take suitable action relatively quickly after those circumstances no longer affect their ability to take that action, then they would usually be considered to have acted in a reasonable time.</p>

<p>What is reasonable in one instance, may not be in another – it depends on all of the particular circumstances of the case. However, where there are no untoward circumstances affecting a person’s ability to do something, a reasonable period would generally be no more than 28 days. </p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>&#58; For incarcerated customers this would usually be a reasonable period after the person was released from prison. Services Australia may also consider whether the customer has acted within a reasonable period after they became aware that an assessment had been made or gained access to the relevant income records, and was able to provide their income information.  A person who has been incarcerated for several years may need more time if they need to gather information about multiple financial years. Confirm the period of the customer’s incarceration and date of release, then consider how long it took before they provided the information, and whether there was a reasonable basis for any delay.</p>

<p>A customer may have prescribed circumstances that do not always prevent them from providing their income information. For example, they may be affected by a serious mental illness for life, which affects their ability to manage their affairs in a timely way, but they still manage to provide their income information when they are able to. In these situations, consider whether the customer provided their income information as soon as they were reasonably able to do so in the circumstances.</p>

<p>It is not enough for Services Australia to become aware of the customer’s income information from another source; the customer must take action to provide their income information to us. This may occur before or after Services Australia otherwise becomes aware of their income. For example if Services Australia learns of the customer’s income from Centrelink or the ATO while they are hospitalised, and the customer contacts shortly after their recovery to confirm their income (or they confirm their income information during a contact we initiate with them), this is sufficient to satisfy this criteria.</p>

<p>If the customer does not ever contact Services Australia about their income information (for the year(s) in question), they will not meet the criteria for Section 11 to apply and the usual date of effect rules should be used. </p>

<p><strong>For the customer whose income was being considered for prescribed circumstances&#58;</strong></p>

<p>We are writing to you about the adjusted taxable income used in your child support assessment. </p>

<p>You have asked us to consider your circumstances and apply your &#123;Financial Year yyyy-yyyy&#125; adjusted taxable income to your child support assessment from an earlier date.</p>

<p>After careful consideration, we have decided not to change the date the new adjusted taxable income was used in your assessment. This is because we can only change the start date of a new adjusted taxable income if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the income information wasn’t provided when the assessment was made because of prescribed circumstances, and</li>
		<li>
the income information was then provided within a reasonable timeframe.</li>
		</ul>
<p>The best way to ensure the income used in your child support is correct is to lodge your tax return on time every year or provide your income details to us as soon as possible.</p>

<p>This means your adjusted taxable income is still the same and the amount of child support has not changed as a result of this decision.</p>

<p>Update the amended income record in Cuba so that the tax assessment is used in the assessment retrospectively.</p>

<p>The amended tax assessment should be applied to the child support assessment from the date the previous tax assessment has been used. This will be the start of the child support period where the previous tax assessment is the only income used in the Child Support Period (for example, there are no provisional incomes still in use for any of the period). </p>

<p>The amended tax assessment will not replace an earlier provisional income still in use prior to the previous tax assessment. For example, if the previous tax assessment was lodged late and was lower than the provisional income being used, it would only have applied prospectively from the date it was received. The amended tax assessment will be used from the date that the previous tax assessment was received. </p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> a customer may have special circumstances about their amended tax assessment and also have prescribed circumstances that would enable their previous tax assessment to be applied retrospectively under Section 11. If this occurs, the start date for the amended tax assessment should be the start of the Child Support Period and this should be noted in the SSO referral (the Section 11 decision does not need to be processed separately as the previous tax assessment will be wholly replaced by the amended tax assessment). </p>

<p>The Solutions Gateway Officer must email the referring SSO after processing is finalised.</p>

<p>These principles of taking timely action are the same as for prescribed circumstances. See in the <a href="../separated-parents/277-17102600-03.html#bp03_tbl_Prescribed_circ_Step">Prescribed circumstances (Section 11)</a> table for considerations and examples.</p>

<p>If satisfied the customer was prevented from seeking an amended tax assessment promptly because of special circumstances but did so within a reasonable period after those special circumstances ceased to affect them, the amended income should be applied to the child support assessment retrospectively.  </p>

<p>Go to <a href="../separated-parents/277-17102600-03.html#bp03_tbl_Certain_circums_Step04">Step 4 of the Amending a child support assessment retrospectively in certain circumstances</a> table.</p>
