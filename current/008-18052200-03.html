<p>Most causes of spinal cord injury (SCI) are traumatic, e.g, motor vehicle accidents, falls, water sports and crash injuries. Non-traumatic causes are less common and include infections and tumours.</p>

<p>The types of SCI are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Complete injury</strong> – this is the loss of all movement and sensation below the level of the SCI</li>
		<li>
<strong>Incomplete injury</strong> – there may be some sensation or muscle movement below the level of injury</li>
		<li>
<strong>Quadriplegia</strong> – injury is at the level of the cervical (neck) cord segments. Quadriplegia means paralysis or weakness in all four limbs and trunk</li>
		<li>
<strong>Paraplegia</strong> – the level of injury is below the cervical (neck) cord segments. Paraplegia means paralysis or weakness in the legs and sometimes the trunk (depending on the level of injury)</li>
		<li>
Paraplegia or quadriplegia can be complete or incomplete. Not all people in wheelchairs have an SCI and not all people with an SCI use wheelchairs</li>		</ul>

<p>Anxiety disorders may be associated with panic attacks. A panic attack characterised by sudden onset of intense fear accompanied by symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, sweating, dizziness, trembling and feelings of unreality. The intensity of the attack can vary.</p>

<p>A phobia is an excessive or unreasonable fear of certain objects or situations. Agoraphobia is a fear of being somewhere from which it would be difficult to escape or here help might not be readily available.</p>

<p><strong>Obsessive compulsive disorder</strong></p>

<p>An obsessive compulsive disorder involves repeated, intrusive thoughts or compulsive behaviours which are usually known to be irrational. Obsessions may focus on a fear of harming others, acquiring or spreading contamination, doubt about having performed a task. Compulsions can involve rituals of cleaning, repeating, checking, hoarding or avoiding.</p>

<p><strong>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</strong></p>

<p>Post-traumatic stress disorder is a severe reaction to a traumatic event often involving actual or threatened death or serious injury to themselves or others. Post-traumatic stress disorder occurs where a person experiences persistent and intrusive recollections or dreams about the event. They often try to avoid situations which are associated with the trauma.</p>

<p><strong>Bipolar Affective disorder</strong></p>

<p>Bipolar Affective disorder is a mood disorder characterised by a person experiencing both episodes of depression and extreme elation or mania.</p>

<p>During a manic phase, a person is often highly excited, over-active, over-confident, over-talkative and may lose touch with reality. In the depressed phase, a person can become sad, pessimistic about the future, withdrawn, underactive or have guilt feelings.</p>

<p>In either mood, people may experience hallucinations/delusions, sleep disturbance, frequent tearfulness, loss of concentration, a short attention span, confused thinking and mood swings from a general hyperactive state to a flattened mood.</p>

<p><strong>Schizophrenia</strong></p>

<p>Schizophrenia is characterised by social withdrawal, reduced emotional expressiveness and perceptual distortions. A misconception about schizophrenia is that the person has a split personality. The cause of schizophrenia is unknown and it has many varied symptoms, such as&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Delusions</li>
		<li>
Hallucinations – auditory and visual</li>
		<li>
Disordered thinking and attention</li>
		<li>
Bizarre behaviour</li>
		<li>
Emotional withdrawal</li>
		<li>
Loss of motivation</li>
		</ul>
<p>An acute schizophrenic episode is characterised by such things as&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Alterations in the senses e.g hearing voices</li>
		<li>
Changes in emotional responsiveness</li>
		<li>
Changes in behaviour such as neglect of personal health care, hygiene and presentation</li>
		<li>
Having an altered sense of self and others e.g. may have unrealistic ideas about their own importance or unreasonable fears that others are trying to influence or harm them in some way</li>
		<li>
Having impaired concentration and cognitive functioning resulting in an inability to response appropriately</li>		</ul>

<p><strong>Prenatal Causes</strong> - This is where the cause is considered to have occurred prior to birth but the actual cause may not be known. Below are some causes of intellectual impairments at the prenatal stage&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Chromosomal disorders</strong> – Examples of these are Down Syndrome (trisomy 21) occurs by a person having an extra chromosome, and Klinefelter’s Syndrome (XXY Syndrome), where a male has an extra ‘X’ chromosome</li>
		<li>
<strong>Inborn errors of Metabolism</strong> – This is where the body cannot absorb and/or process chemical substances naturally present in the food and necessary for the health of the body and brain. e.g if the thyroid gland is absent or is only partially functioning at birth</li>
		<li>
<strong>Developmental Disorders of Brain Formation</strong> – These abnormalities that occur in the development of a person’s brain prior to birth, e.g. incomplete closure of the neural tube which results in anencephaly and the condition where the size of the person’s head is significantly affected (hydrocephaly or microcephaly)</li>
		<li>
<strong>Environmental Influences</strong> – This can include maternal malnutrition, the effects of drugs or alcohol, and some maternal diseases.</li>
		</ul>

		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Intrauterine Disorders</strong> – These are conditions within the uterus such as toxaemia, complications of labour or multiple births</li>
		<li>
<strong>Neonatal Disorders</strong> – These conditions arise from trauma or damage to the newborn brought about by things such as abnormal bleeding, respiratory problems and infections. </li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Postnatal causes</strong> – Intellectual impairments can also occur after birth, e.g in early childhood due to diseases and/or environmental factors. Below are some postnatal causes of intellectual impairment&#58;</p>

<p>Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a virus which harms the immune system by destroying the white blood cells that fight infection. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) occurs when the immune system has been permanently damaged by HIV and is no longer effective at protecting the body.</p>

<p>HIV and AIDS are not the same. HIV is the virus that leads to AIDS. Not everyone who has HIV will develop AIDS.</p>

<p>In the early 1980’s, when the HIV/AIDS epidemic began, patients rarely lived longer than a few years. But today, there are many effective medicines to fight the infection, and people with HIV have longer, healthier lives.</p>

<p>These medicines help people with HIV, but they are not perfect. They do not cure HIV/AIDS. People with HIV infection still have the virus in their bodies.</p>

<p>An Acquired Brain Impairment (ABI) is an injury to the brain that has occurred sometimes after birth. Other terms that can be used for brain impairments include acquired cerebral insult.</p>

<p>The brain has two cerebral hemispheres – left and right. These are divided into lobes. Each lobe controls different functions.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The <strong>Frontal lobe</strong> is located at the front of the brain and controls&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
planning and problem solving</li>
			<li>
decision making and judgement</li>
			<li>
learning from mistakes and adapting to new situations</li>
			<li>
emotions, impulses</li>
			<li>
expressive language and voluntary movement</li>		</ul>
		<li>
The <strong>Occipital lobe</strong> is located at the back of the brain. It receives visual information and interprets colours, shapes and distances.</li>
		<li>
The <strong>Parietal lobe</strong> is towards the back of the brain and has the following functions&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
monitors body sensation and position</li>
			<li>
controls reading, time recognition and recognition of faces, and</li>
			<li>
judges what objects are</li>		</ul>
		<li>
The <strong>Temporal lobe</strong> is towards the side of the brain and controls&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
memory and learning</li>
			<li>
emotions</li>
			<li>
hearing and language, including the rhythm and pitch of speech</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>An ABI is not the same as an intellectual disability. People with an ABI usually retain their intellectual abilities but have cognitive problems such as difficulty controlling, coordinating and or communicating their thoughts, emotions or actions. Customers with an ABI can experience a significant recovery with appropriate treatment and rehabilitation.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Traumatic Brain Injury</strong> Accidents such as a motor vehicle or sporting accident, gunshot wound, fall, assault or violent shaking</li>
		<li>
<strong>Stroke or Cerebral Vascular Accident (CVA)</strong> – A stroke can cause brain damage when a blood vessel within the brain is ruptured or blocked, interrupting its blood supply. A stroke can occur in many places in the brain, however, it usually affects specific areas of the brain and other areas function normally</li>
		<li>
<strong>Tumours</strong> – The effects of the tumour will depend on its size, type and its location within the brain. There are three main types of brain tumours&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Malignant (primary) tumours – begin in the brain and progressively invade the surrounding area</li>
			<li>
Malignant (secondary) tumours – spread from the cells of malignant tumours in other parts of the body</li>
			<li>
Benign tumours – are usually slow growing and may cause symptoms due to pressure on the brain</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Infections </strong>– The brain has a protective barrier called the blood brain banner. This can be broken by bacteria or viruses, which can result in meningitis or encephalitis</li>
		<li>
<strong>Poisoning – </strong>This is a physical damage to the brain as a result of substance misuse due to alcohol or drug related brain damage and can affect thinking, emotions, behaviour and movement</li>
		<li>
<strong>Lack of oxygen –</strong> This can occur in the case of a drowning or heart attack, where the heart ceases to beat and the oxygen supply is affected. A lack of blood supply can cause brain damage. The longer the brain goes without a blood supply, the more severe the injury will be</li>
		<li>
<strong>Epilepsy –</strong> Damage to the brain may cause scarring and this may affect the brain’s electrical activity, which can cause a fit or seizure</li>		</ul>

<p>Recovery from an ABI will vary from person to person and the outcome is very difficult to predict. Recovery is usually rapid at first, with improvements occurring rapidly as swelling and bruising subsides. The most significant improvements usually occur within the first three to six months. After this, the recovery process slows.</p>

<p>There are generally three stages of recovery from an ABI&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Acute stage – the period of intense treatment where the main priority is the survival and medical treatment of the person</li>
		<li>
Rehabilitation stage – this involves intensive therapy aimed at the natural process of recovery which aims to reduce the long term effects of the disability. It focuses on regaining previous skills and overcoming ongoing problems. This stage may take between six to twelve months</li>
		<li>
Community re-entry stage – this focuses on issues of everyday living and returning to previous activities such as work, study and leisure. This will help the person and their family to adapt to any long term effects of the injury. This stage of recovery may go for a long period of time</li>
		</ul>
<p>Post traumatic amnesia (PTA) is a state of acute confusion characterised by difficulty with perception, thinking, remembering, and concentration. PTA is the time between the injury and the recovery of continuous memory. The length of time of PTA may predict the severity and outcome of the brain injury. A general assessment is, a &#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
PTA of less than 1 hour, is usually related to mild brain damage</li>
		<li>
PTA of 1 to 24 hours, usually indicates moderate brain damage</li>

PTA greater than 24 hours, is commonly associated with severe brain damage</li>		</ul>

When entering the presence of someone who is blind or has low vision, say who you are and let them know when entering or leaving their presence.</li>
		<li>
When providing instructions or directions, do not give visual hand signals in the place of words</li>
		<li>
When speaking, ensure you face the person and speak in a clear, normal voice and state clearly who you are</li>
		<li>
You may need to describe seating to the person, such as whether the chair has arms and a back</li>
		<li>
Do not leave the person sitting or standing on their own without  explaining what is happening</li>
		<li>
Verbalise thoughts and feeling that would usually be sent through non-verbal mannerisms and cues</li>
		<li>
Ask the person if they require assistance or further explanation of a task. Do not assume what the person’s requirements are and remember to offer assistance at the end of the interview, as they may need assistance to leave the office</li>
		<li>
Offer assistance in completing any forms. Many people who are visually impaired can sign their name, however they may need assistance in locating the appropriate place on the form to sign</li>
		<li>
Explanations may have to be repeated to facilitate understanding of tasks. What type of assistance, if any, does the person require? Do not assume they need help and do not assist them without telling them what is about to happen</li>
		<li>
It is vital for the sighted guide to talk to the vision impaired person about the surrounding environment and what movements are intended to get from point A to B. This assists in giving the person an appreciation of the situation and environment around them</li>
		<li>
It is also highly recommended, when guiding the person, that you initially offer the back of your hand, thus indicating the location and position of your body. Most people who have low vision or are blind are taught to grip the arm above the elbow. This enables the person to walk at your side but just slightly behind you. In some instances the person may be more comfortable holding your shoulder instead; if you are uncomfortable with where the person is gripping you, let them know so they are able to select a more appropriate/comfortable location</li>
		<li>
The person will walk half a step behind you. Ask if unsure of the speed</li>
		<li>
When approaching an obstacle such as a narrow doorway or blockage, inform the person of what the difficulty is and provide specific details of how you will get around this</li>		</ul>

<p>These are varying degrees of and different types of hearing loss and it can be complete or partial. The severity and the age of the person at the onset of hearing loss, can affect the person’s ability to hear and speak.</p>

<strong>Tinnitus</strong>- This is where the person hears a sound, a ringing, or a noise when no external noise is present. The noise can be intermittent or constant, mild or severe and may vary from a low roar to a high-pitched sound</li>
		<li>
<strong>Noise induced hearing loss</strong> (Sensorineural hearing loss) This usually develops over a period of years, although it can occur more rapidly following exposure to a loud noise. A noise which is regular and of a continuing frequency or pitch level can result in this kind of hearing loss</li>
		<li>
<strong>Meniere’s disease</strong> – A progressive disease of the inner ear in which the first symptom is usually vertigo (dizziness). Over time tinnitus and hearing loss can develop.</li>
		<li>
<strong>Presbycusis</strong> – a progressive, high frequency hearing loss that is associated with increasing age. It can be complicated not only by a decrease of the nerve cells in the inner ear available for transmission of auditory signals, but also the additional loss of hearing receptors in the brain in which results in poorer speech discrimination than might be expected from the degree of hearing loss</li>
		<li>
<strong>Outer/middle ear infections</strong> – This may be cause by the build-up of wax in the outer ear cancel, which can lead to a reduction in hearing acuity. Medical treatment to remove the wax is usually all that is required. Middle ear infections can lead to permanent damage if not treated. These are common in young children. Chronic ear infection may result in ‘glue ear’, which affects the ability of the tiny bones of the middle ear to transmit sound to the inner ear.</li>

<p>The age of onset of hearing loss has significant implications for a person. A hearing loss is described as either a Prelingual (no exposure to oral language) or Acquired (some exposure to oral language) hearing loss, depending on the age of the person at onset. Prelingual deafness or hearing loss may be present before birth or before language is developed. </p>

<p>Hearing loss can also be acquired postlingually (after language has developed), however, the important difference between prelingual deafness and an acquired hearing loss is that the person has had exposure to the spoken language and, therefore, has had an opportunity to develop an appreciation of the sound and structure of language.</p>

<p>A person may also have a&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Hearing aid</strong> – a device that is used to improve hearing that a person wears in or behind the ear. The type of hearing aid a person has will be dependent on their lifestyle and situation, or</li>
		<li>
<strong>Cochlear implant</strong> – an implanted electronic hearing device. It works by electronically stimulating the nerves inside the inner ear. This is different to a hearing aid.</li>		</ul>

		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Lip reading and speech reading</strong> – Lip reading is a skill of understanding speech by interpreting the shape of the lips and the visual movements of the muscles involved in speech production. Speech reading is the ability to understand the intent of a speaker by watching the movements of the face and body by using information and language used by the situation</li>
		<li>
<strong>Manual communication</strong> – Refers to communication which is achieved by the use of the hands rather than verbal communication</li>
		<li>
<strong>Finger spelling</strong> – This should not be confused with sign language. In finger spelling, signs represent letters of the alphabet. The person writes in the air using their finger, spelling words out letter by letter. In Australia finger spelling is used more extensively by older members of the community</li>
		<li>
<strong>Mime </strong>– This is a way using gestures and bodily movement, without speech or sound, to act out something</li>
		<li>
<strong>Gesture</strong> – This is movement of the body and especially the hands and arms which express an idea, emotion or attitude</li>
		<li>
<strong>Signs</strong> – This is the most commonly series of movements used by people who are deaf</li>
		<li>
<strong>Sign language</strong> – The native sign language of Australia is Auslan. In order to increase the person’s exposure to English, various methods have been devised for sign language. Some people will use just the 26 hand configurations to represent the letters of the alphabet while others use a combination of signs and finger spelling</li>
		<li>
<strong>Internet </strong>– If the person has access to the internet, they may prefer to conduct their business via this option</li>
		<li>
<strong>Assistive Technology </strong>– There is a range of assistive technologies available to assist customers with hearing loss to hear the telephone, television or doorbell</li>
		<li>
<strong>Teletypewriter communication </strong>(TTY) – These messages are sent via phone lines. The person who is deaf or has a hearing loss types their message via a keyboard and these messages are then decoded by a TTY at the other end of the phone line and displayed as a written message. When communicating with someone via the TTY make sure that the language is simple and a message is short. See the <a href="../people-with-disability/008-18052200-05.html">Resources</a> page</li>
		<li>
<strong>National Relay Service (NRS) </strong>–<strong> </strong>If a person wants to contact someone who does not have a TTY, they can do so by using the NRS. This is an Australian wide phone and internet service to allow access to the telecommunications system for people who are deaf, or have a hearing and speech impairment</li>		</ul>

<p>When speaking to a hearing impaired person&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
do not shout or speak loudly to the person unless they request this, as this can be confusing and uncomfortable for a person wearing a hearing aid</li>
		<li>
speak clearly and slowly but do not exaggerate mouth movements</li>
		<li>
use natural gestures and facial expression to enhance the meaning of the discussion and to keep the listener interested</li>
		<li>
look directly at the person. This is so the person is able to lip-read. Do not move around whilst talking to a person who is trying to lip-read</li>
		<li>
use short and straightforward sentences and repeat or rephrase sentences if the person misunderstands. If words need to be used that a person may not understand, wrote them down and explain to the person what it means.</li>
		</ul>
<p>When listening to a person who is deaf or has a hearing loss, observe the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
encourage the speaker to use their preferred method of communication</li>
		<li>
listen carefully to what the speaker says/signs</li>
		<li>
pay attention to the speaker’s facial expressions and gestures to gain extra information about what is being conveyed</li>
		<li>
ask for information to be repeated if it is not understood and always encourage the speaker to continue the conversation even if it is difficult to understand each other</li>
		<li>
always double check information to make sure the message is understood </li>
		</ul>
<p>Writing information for a person who is deaf or has a hearing loss is extremely useful but remember the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the most important information needs to be written first and only introduced one idea at a time</li>
		<li>
write ideas down as they are discussed or as they occur</li>
		<li>
write details about time, place and person at the beginning of a sentence wherever possible and do not use unnecessary words</li>
		<li>
only use words that are common and understood by most people and always break long sentences into short and concise sentences</li>
		<li>
if jargon or a technical term is required, explain the words and make sure that they are understood</li>		</ul>
