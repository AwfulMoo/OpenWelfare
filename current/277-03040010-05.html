<p>Marge and George have 1 child who is in George’s 100% care.  On 1 July 2019, Marge notifies of 2 changes in care for the child that occurred the previous year&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
1 August 2018, Marge started having 2 nights care per fortnight (14%), and</li>
		<li>
1 December 2018, Marge started having 4 nights care per fortnight (28%)</li>
		</ul>
<p>The care percentage for the first event (1 August 2018) is calculated over 12 months from that event date as though the second event had not occurred. That is, 2 nights per fortnight is 14% care (52 nights over 12 months). The care percentage for the second event (1 December 2018) is calculated over 12 months from that event date. That is, 4 nights per fortnight is 28% care (104 nights over 12 months). </p>

<p>As both decisions were notified outside of 28 days, both decreased care percentages apply from the date of event in child support assessments. The increased care percentage for the earlier event, whilst recorded, will not be used in the child support assessment and the increased care percentage that related to the later date of event is used in the assessment from the date of notification. </p>

<p>Two care records, with the Date of Notification as 1 July 2019, should be recorded and&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
Date of event 1 August 2018, George has 86% and Marge has 14% </li>
		<li>
Date of event 1 December 2018, George has 72% and Marge has 28%</li>
		</ul>
<p>The care percentage used in the child support assessment will be&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
Prior to the care change&#58; George has 100% and Marge has 0% </li>
		<li>
Care change on 1 August 2018&#58; George has 86% and Marge has 0%</li>
		<li>

		<li>
Date of notification 1 July 2019&#58; George has 72% and Marge has 28%</li>

<p>If George and/or Marge are, or become, Centrelink customers the care percentages will be used for each party from the actual Date of Event when assessing Centrelink payment eligibility.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
the first care period begins on 12 August 2018, being the first date of event. The care percentage is calculated as 60% for Chris and 40% for Jo. The care period is calculated as though it is going to run for a full 12 months, regardless of the second care change</li>

the second care period begins on 31 August 2018, which is the second date of event. The care percentage is calculated as 75% for Chris and 25% for Jo</li>
		<li>
the child support assessment will be changed from 12 August 2018 to reflect 60% care for Chris and 40% care for Jo and amended again from 31 August 2018 to reflect 75% care for Chris and 25% for Jo.

<p><strong>Calculate care period longer than 12 months example</strong></p>

<p>John and Karen have a parenting plan that provides John with care of their child, Laura, every Saturday night, Fathers' Day, and half of each of the school holiday periods except Christmas. John and Karen alternate care of Laura over Christmas such that Laura stays with John for all of the Christmas school holidays one year and then with Karen all of the Christmas school holidays the next year. Depending on which parent has care of Laura during the Christmas school holidays, both John and Karen’s care percentage would change from one year to the next if 12 month care period was used. In this case, it would be appropriate to consider a care period of 24 months to properly account for the alternating pattern of care for the Christmas school holidays.</p>

<p>Marcia and Eric have one child, Emerson. There is no care arrangement in place for Emerson however, until recently, Marcia had 100% care. Marcia’s circumstances changed such that Marcia is no longer able to care for Emerson full time and so has asked Eric if they could look after Emerson until Marcia is able to resume caring responsibilities. Eric agreed but cannot commit permanently due to travel commitments for work.</p>

<p>Marcia and Eric come to an informal arrangement that Marcia will look after Emerson 1 night per week for the next 2 months, and then will increase care of Emerson by one night per week every 2 months until full time care is resumed.</p>

<p>Eric calls Child Support to advise of the new arrangement. As the parents have agreed on the specific arrangements to increase Marcia’s care in a staggered but foreseeable way over a definable period, it would be appropriate to use a care period of 2 months for each of the periods that Marcia is due to increase the care of Emerson. This ensures the care percentage accurately reflects the care that each parent is providing during each 2 month period.</p>

<p>Li and Mai have one child, Tung. Tung usually lives with Mai 100% of the time. Mai needs to go to hospital for 3 weeks for an operation, and may require a further period of intensive rehabilitation where Mai will not be able to care for Tung. Li will look after Tung during this time. The Registrar makes a one-off block of 100% care decision. When Tung returns to Mai's care, Mai contacts Services Australia and the Registrar makes a new care decision based on the ongoing care of each parent.</p>

<p>It is important that the ‘Block of 100% care’ indicator is selected when recording this change of care. This may be considered to be a temporary absence for Centrelink benefits and payments, see <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-05050020-01.html">Child leaves customer's care/custody</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario</strong></p>

<p>Both parents equally share the care of one child (50% care each). The child then moves into 100% care of a relative, who is not a party to the current assessment. This is a terminating event for the current assessment as both parents cease to be eligible carers as their percentage of care has fallen to 0%. When a terminating event occurs, the assessment must change from the date of event even if notified after 28 days.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>Peter moves from the shared care (50% each) of Susan and Steven (parents) to non-parent carer Nicole’s 100% care on 19 December 2015. Steven advises Child Support of the care change on 29 March 2016. As Nicole was not a party to the assessment and both parents now have a care percentage of 0%, this is a terminating event. The terminating event takes effect from 19 December 2015, being the date of event. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-03140000-01.html">Terminating events (Stage 2) (CS)</a>. If Nicole wishes to claim child support from the parents for Peter, a new application must be made.</p>

<p>As Jenny advised of the care changes more than 28 days after the date of event, Richard’s care percentage reduces to 0% from 10 September 2018 (date of event), Jenny's care percentage increases to 100% from 7 November 2018 (date of notification). </p>

<p>For the period 10 September to 6 November, the assessment for Lee is suspended. Meg is the only child assessed on the case during this period. </p>

<p>Whilst the assessment for Lee is suspended, the cost of child amount only reflects 1 child of Meg's age.</p>

<p>Kevin and Jodie have 1 child, Justin. Justin is in Jodie's 100% care. On 1 August 2018, a care change occurs and Kevin now has 100% care of Justin, however child support is not notified of the change in care until 8 March 2019. </p>

<p>As Jodie's care reduces below 35% from1 August 2018 (date of event) and Kevin's increase percentage of care cannot be used in the assessment until 8 March 2019 (date of notification), a terminating event occurs on 1 August 2018 as neither parent has a care percentage of 35% or more. When the agency was advised of the change in care on 8 March 2019, a new application for child support is required if either parent wants to re-start the case.</p>

<p>When the care change is reported the parents should be asked if they wish to make an application for a new case, to take effect in the event that the care change causes a terminating event. If either parent wishes to do so this should be clearly noted in the care notepad. When the care change is finalised, if either parent has indicated they wished to apply for a new assessment, the restart should be processed by the owning SO from the date we were told they wanted to apply. Do not refer the case to New Customers to be restarted.</p>

<p>If no parent or carer has made a new application for a child support assessment, the case can only restart when a new application is received.</p>

<p>The care should be recorded with the date of notification 8 March 2019 and Date of event 1 August 2018, Kevin has 100% and Jodie has 0%. </p>

<p>The care percentage used in the child support assessment will be&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
Prior to the care change&#58; Jodie has 100% and Kevin has 0% </li>
		<li>
Care change on 1 August 2018&#58; Jodie has 0% and Kevin has 0%</li>
		<li>
If an ‘Application for Assessment’ is lodged by either parent, verbally during care change investigation or at any time after either verbally or online, a restart should be processed using the date the request to apply was made  </li>
		</ul>
<p>The care percentages will be used for each party from the actual Date of Event when assessing Centrelink payment eligibility. If Kevin applies for Family Tax Benefit he will be granted a 13 week grace period to take reasonable maintenance action during which he may be entitled to the full rate of FTB. At the end of 13 weeks FTB will reduce to minimum due to no maintenance action being taken, and this will not increase until a new child support assessment is applied for.</p>
