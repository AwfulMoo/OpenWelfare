		<li>
You can download a copy of the application form at any time and return it by submitting your documents by Post or by uploading direct to your Centrelink online account</li>
		<li>

<p><strong>Progress of Applications</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Processing times will vary for each application. The length of time a particular application takes to process will depend on a range of factors, including the amount of time it takes to gather the needed evidence and properly assess the application. Some applications will be complex and may take time to assess all the details</li>
		<li>
If you would like to provide more details or documents that supports your application you can upload the evidence to your Centrelink online account.'</li>
		</ul>
<p>Complete applications lodged on or after 17 March 2021 must be assessed within 60 days, or the applicant will be automatically exited. If the applications are not complete, or supporting documentation is not provided, the 60 day assessment timeframe will not start until this information is provided.</p></td>

If you do not provide this evidence with your form, we will call you and send a letter to ask you to provide this. You will have 14 days to provide the documents from when we asked you.
