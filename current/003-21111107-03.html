			<li>
NZ DRP claims include secondary claimants (spouse, dependent adult, and/or non-dependent child who lives with them)</li>		</ul>
		<li>
To minimise re-work, when a claim presents in Process Direct, select the <strong>Keyword</strong> icon to see if the claim has the keyword <strong>NOM</strong> applied </li>
		<li>
If the keyword exists, check to make sure the keyword was added correctly and if so, follow this process to assess the claim, then <strong>Handover to CF/CR</strong> if payment is to be made, or rejected via the <strong>!FFAP</strong> screen </li>

<p>Check the New Zealand residence status&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Grandfathered (GRF) is a <strong>protected</strong> Special Category Visa (SCV) holder. <strong>AGDRP</strong> is the appropriate payment, as the customer is an Australian resident</li>

		<li>
Not Entitled (NOT) is a <strong>non-protected</strong> SCV holder. <strong>NZ DRP</strong> is the appropriate payment</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if Real Time Analysis have assessed a claim as ‘not eligible’, <strong>staff must</strong> not do further checks or request evidence from the customer.

Some AGDRP claims are excluded from automation (straight through processing), where they do not meet the strict business rules to enable the system to determine a grant outcome and need a manual assessment to be completed to make sure the accuracy of the outcome. The <strong>most common</strong> exclusion reasons will show on the Keywords page to help staff in processing claims. See <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-21111107-05.html#bp05_L3TT_Automation_excl">Resources</a> for the list of exclusion keywords and reasons</li>

If a claim is excluded from automation, the customer may still be eligible for payment. If an exclusion keyword shows, this may <strong>not</strong> be the only reason the claim was excluded from automation</li>

The claim should be allocated to appropriately trained staff for processing. These will have a keyword attached. For example, <strong>NOM </strong>is for claims with a payment nominee where the <strong>X032AS - No Payment Destination, please update via PA screen</strong> error shows in Process Direct, <strong>FAOCHI</strong> is for claims where a shared care assessment or addition of a new child is needed.

<p>To determine whether additional evidence may be required to support the customer’s address at the time of the disaster, locate the date the customer moved (DOV) and the date the customer notified of the change (Date of Receipt = DOR).</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Open <strong>Customer First</strong> and access the customer’s record. Navigate to the Address History screen by keying <strong>ADH</strong> in the <strong>Next</strong> field then <strong>Enter</strong></li>
		<li>
Note the Activity Management Reference Number(s) (<strong>AMR</strong>) for the address(es) to be reviewed</li>
		<li>
<strong>Clear Customer</strong> from Customer First</li>
		<li>
In <strong>Process Direct</strong> go to the <strong>Event Summary</strong> screen by entering <strong>ES</strong> next to <strong>Super Key </strong>and press [<strong>Enter</strong>]</li>
		<li>
Enter the AMR number(s) in the <strong>Activity ID</strong> field</li>

Take note of the DOV and the DOR for each address to be reviewed</li>
		<li>
Also identify any short periods the customers moved from a non-declared area to a declared area (for example, moved to a declared area for 4 weeks)</li>
		</ul>
<p>If there are concerns a customer may be retrospectively providing false address details so it appears they live in a declared disaster area, see Conduct an address search in <strong><a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-21120238-01.html">E</strong>mergency payments - preventing fraud</a> and <strong><a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-21111107-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Reporting_poten">T</strong>able 7</a>.</p>
