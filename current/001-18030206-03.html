<p>The compliance investigation focuses on all of the relevant facts relating to the work that the job seeker has left and their reasons for leaving. These facts inform the decision on whether the job seeker will incur an unemployment preclusion period or non-compliance cancellation.</p>

<p>The compliance investigation also needs to incorporate the appropriate messages to build a clear understanding of the expectations of job seekers and consequences of non-compliant behaviour. Ensuring the job seeker fully understands their requirements and the consequences of not meeting them gives them the best chance of complying and avoiding further penalties in the future.</p>

<p>Service Officer's must ensure all of the evidence required to make a good decision is identified and appropriately considered by&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
providing a clear explanation of the unemployment failure that is under investigation, the specific matters that need to be considered to reach a decision and the potential outcomes of the decision</li>
		<li>
identifying the facts relevant to the non-compliance event and conducting an investigation focused on the relevant facts</li>
		<li>
giving the job seeker the opportunity to respond to any adverse claim that have been made against them and disclose any further information they would like considered</li>
		<li>
making contact with the employer or other third parties to assist in establishing the facts, where evidence provided by the job seeker contradicts statements made by the employer</li>
		<li>
consulting with a <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-05000000-01.html">specialist officer</a> where required to discuss the impact of job seeker circumstances on suitability of work, misconduct or reasonable excuse assessments.

<p>Voluntary unemployment refers to a situation where a job seeker becomes unemployed as a result of a voluntary act.</p>

<p>When determining whether a job seeker voluntarily left suitable employment without a reasonable excuse, relevant matters that must be considered include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the circumstances that led the job seeker to leave their employment</li>
		<li>
whether the employment was suitable work, and</li>
		<li>
whether there were any factors that made it reasonable for the job seeker to leave employment voluntarily</li>
		</ul>
<p>An unemployment failure has been committed where the job seeker has left suitable employment and their reason for leaving is not considered reasonable.</p>

<p>Dismissal due to misconduct refers to situations where a job seeker has contributed to their unemployment either due to having been dismissed, or been given the option of resigning from suitable work, as a result of inappropriate actions as a worker.</p>

<p>When determining whether a job seeker was dismissed due to misconduct, the relevant matters that must be considered include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
whether the employment was suitable work, and</li>
		<li>
whether an incident of misconduct occurred</li>
		</ul>
<p>The investigation does not consider whether the employee was correctly terminated or if the job seeker had a reasonable excuse for the misconduct. This is because misconduct is a behaviour within the job seeker's control and where misconduct has occurred this is never reasonable.</p>

<p>The reason for termination must be a result of misconduct at work and not because of the employee's general behaviour. The incident must have either occurred in their place of work or be directly related to their work.</p>

<p>An unemployment failure has been committed where the job seeker was dismissed from suitable work due to their inappropriate actions as a worker.</p>

<p>An unemployment failure is only a failure under social security law if the work was suitable for the job seeker based on their individual circumstances at the time that they left the employment. Consideration must be given to the job seeker's individual circumstances such as their skills, experience, qualifications and medical history to check whether the work was suitable or not.</p>

<p>Where the unemployment due to misconduct was reported by a provider, the suitability will have already been considered by the provider. Service Officers may generally assume that work was suitable for the job seeker based on the report from the provider unless further information provided during the investigation requires further investigation to substantiate the providers assessment of suitability of employment. Where the Participation Solutions Team (PST) determines that the work was unsuitable at the time they left the employment, a failure has not been committed and it should be rejected.</p>

<p>Consultation with a <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-05000000-01.html">specialist officer</a> is appropriate where assistance with assessing the impact of identified job seeker circumstances on the suitability of work is required.</p>

<p>Where work was considered suitable and the job seeker has left voluntarily an unemployment failure has been committed. Consideration must then be given to the job seeker's reasons for leaving to determine if a penalty will be applied. Where a reasonable excuse is not established, the penalty will depend on whether the unemployment failure occurred before the claim, or whether the job seeker was receiving a participation payment.</p>

<p>Leaving work voluntarily where the person then chooses to access or increase their reliance on income support is a serious consideration. It is generally not reasonable for a job seeker claiming or receiving income support to leave paid work for factors within their control.</p>

<p>For these reasons, the assessment of whether the voluntary unemployment was reasonable is usually related to whether the work had become unsuitable or it was unreasonable to expect the person to remain in that job due to work related factors.</p>

<p>When determining whether the job seeker left work voluntarily, considerations may include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
any efforts made by the job seeker to retain their employment - for example, did they discuss issues they were experiencing with management before taking the decision to leave and if so what action was taken</li>
		<li>
did they notify anyone of their decision to leave employment (include names, position and contact details)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Factors related to personal reasons that would generally not be considered outside the job seeker's control include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
wishing to relocate to be near children</li>
		<li>
wishing to relocate to a more agreeable climate or location, or</li>
		<li>
wanting to take up a sporting commitment or relocate pending retirement</li>
		</ul>
<p>Such reasons are not generally regarded as being acceptable reasons for leaving work when claiming or in receipt of income support. A person would usually be expected to obtain new employment before relocating and/or to accommodate their external interests.</p>

<p>Similarly, leaving work before the end of a contract because the work or contract was going to be ceasing in the near future is not regarded as reasonable where the job seeker did not have another job to go to.</p>

<p>Where a job seeker has left suitable work voluntarily without a good reason, or was dismissed from suitable work due to misconduct as an employee, an unemployment failure has been committed and a penalty should be applied.</p>

<p>Where voluntary unemployment or unemployment due to misconduct has occurred, an unemployment failure is committed on the date of unemployment. The date of unemployment is generally the date last worked plus one. This date displays in the Participation Compliance workflow as the date of event.</p>

<p>The Service Officer responsible for generating the unemployment failure, or the provider who submits the Unemployment Failure Report, records the date of unemployment based on the evidence already collected.</p>

<p>The Service Officer responsible for the compliance investigation should assume that the date of unemployment is correct unless evidence considered during the compliance investigation establishes that an incorrect date of unemployment has been recorded.</p>

<p>Where the Service Officer has established that an unemployment failure was not committed on the event date that has been recorded, a financial penalty cannot be applied. The Participation Compliance workflow will allow a change to the unemployment failure event date, however, the penalty period will not change. The financial penalty must be rejected and action taken to record an unemployment failure from the correct date.</p>

<p>During conversation with the job seeker in relation to a decision not to apply a financial penalty because of an incorrectly recorded date of event, the Service Officers must ensure they do not undermine the legislative and policy intent of the Targeted Compliance Framework or the relationship the job seeker has with their provider.</p>

<p>In the <strong>Compliance Investigation Workflow</strong>&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
on the <strong>Investigation</strong> page, record&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
<strong>Main excuse for the failure Category</strong>&#58; Information supplied by provider / employer / Services Australia is incorrect</li>
			<li>
<strong>Main excuse for the failure Reason</strong>&#58; Hasn't ceased work still employed by the same company</li>
			<li>
<strong>Is this an acceptable reason that warrants further investigation?</strong> No</li>		</ul>
		<li>
on the <strong>Decision and Penalty</strong> page record&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Have you confirmed the requirement or job is not suitable, it is explicitly precluded by policy or social security law, or they can't be compelled to meet the requirement for another reason? <strong>No</strong></li>
			<li>
Have you identified any significant errors or omissions in the failure submitted? <strong>Yes</strong></li>
			<li>
In the free text explanation, record that the date of event, recorded when the failure was generated, is incorrect, include the correct date of event (the date of unemployment) and the evidence that established this</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>The workflow will auto populate rejection of the unemployment failure with the rejection reason 'Other Rejection reason' and 'Failure Incorrectly Reported – Other Reasons'.</p>

<p><strong>Unemployment failure reported by provider</strong></p>

<p>Where the unemployment failure was reported by the provider, the Service Officer must replace the auto populated text in the '<strong>Further information to be</strong> <a href="../job-seekers/001-10040100-01.html">sent to provider</a>' field with the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
'Incorrect incident date. This must be the first date the job seeker was not working'</li>
		</ul>
<p>Reinforce with the job seeker their personal responsibility to remain in suitable employment and not deliberately contribute to their unemployment. Advise the job seeker that if their provider decides to report an unemployment failure for the date they became unemployed, the job seeker will need to recontact Services Australia and a penalty investigation will be completed.</p>

<p><strong>Unemployment failure generated by Services Australia</strong></p>

<p>Where the unemployment failure was generated by Services Australia, the Service Officer undertaking the compliance penalty investigation must generate compliance action, using the date of unemployment as the event date. The compliance penalty investigation is then undertaken. For further information, see <a href="../job-seekers/001-10060000-01.html">Unemployment due to a voluntary act or misconduct</a>.</p>
