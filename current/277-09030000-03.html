<p>Simple errors are obvious errors which are straightforward and indisputable. Examples of simple errors are based on common scenarios&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
An eligible child's DOB is incorrect. The correct DOB is confirmed with both customers. Correcting the error will have no financial impact.<br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> in international cases it is sometimes necessary to record an inaccurate child DOB, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-08180000-01.html">New Zealand 'In' case management - Registrations between Inland Revenue, New Zealand and Child Support</a>. These children's DOB must not be corrected. If unsure, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-09140000-01.html">Technical Support in Child Support</a>.</li>
		<li>
A child's care change was recorded incorrectly 2 months ago. Both customers have confirmed the care arrangements. Correcting the error will have a financial impact for a period of less than 6 months</li>
		<li>
A relevant dependant was added to a case, but one step was missed and the care arrangements were not recorded. The care arrangements have been confirmed with the parent. Correcting the error will have a financial impact for a period of less than 6 months</li>
		<li>
A recent care change should have caused a role reversal, however the reverse case was not created. Correcting the error will cause a reverse case to be created from the role change date which was less than 3 months ago, and</li>
		<li>
A role change recently occurred. When the reverse case was generated, the child support periods (CSP) were not aligned. Only the CSPs relating to the last relevant year of income (LRYI) need to be aligned</li>		</ul>

<p>Examples of complex errors&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
An incorrect inflation factor was keyed for a child support agreement. This caused incorrect adjustments for the past 3 years</li>
		<li>
A case was ended in error by an error in keying a suspension of liability due to reconciliation. The parties re-separate after 5 months, but because of the error, the case does not resume</li>
		<li>
An error in recording a child's DOB caused their case to end 6 months early. Because the payer had a debt, and continued to pay the same rate, neither customer was aware the case ended. The correct DOB is later confirmed with both customers and corrected to reinstate the case<br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> in international cases it is sometimes necessary to record an inaccurate child DOB, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-08180000-01.html">New Zealand 'In' case management - Registrations between Inland Revenue, New Zealand and Child Support</a>. These children's DOB must not be corrected. If unsure, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-09140000-01.html">Technical Support in Child Support</a>.</li>
		<li>
A child of the relationship was not added to a reverse case. Both the original and reverse case have now ended, and</li>
		<li>
A new ATO taxable income was not automatically applied 2 months ago when it was received. As a mixed assessment was in place it needs to be recalculated and reapplied</li>

<p>Incorrect residency decisions fall into both the simple and complex error categories.</p>

<p>The residency decision must be considered an invalid decision (complex error) if the decision will be effective from the <strong>start date</strong> of liability and the application for assessment was&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
incorrectly accepted because a residency decision was not made, or</li>
		<li>
incorrectly refused because of an erroneous residency decision</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the corrected decision will be effective from a date <strong>after</strong> the start date of liability, the corrected residency decision can fall into either the simple or complex error categories.</p>

<p>Determine if the error is simple or complex by reviewing <a>Correcting a simple Child Support error</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> there may be other circumstances, other than those listed above, when a residency decision should be made invalid. For example, if a residency decision was incorrect due to a denial of procedural fairness this may be considered an invalid decision, go to <a href="../separated-parents/277-09030000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Types_of_errors_5">Item 5</a>.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to make a correcting errors decision when new residency information is received and&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the resulting residency decision will be applied retrospectively to a date after the start date of liability, and</li>
		<li>
the date of effect of the new decision is after the date of effect of the previous decision</li>

<p>A decision is invalid if it was&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
beyond the decision maker's power (ultra vires). A decision made by an officer who did not have the necessary authorisation or delegation, or who otherwise did not have the power to make the decision that they did. For example, a decision that was not possible under the legislation</li>
		<li>
a denial of procedural fairness. For example, a decision to refuse an application without giving the applicant a reasonable opportunity to provide the necessary evidence. This could include where the customer has been given a timeframe to provide evidence but a Service Officer makes a decision before the time expired. Or where evidence is received on time but there is a delay before it is documented in Cuba and in the meantime a decision is made to reject the application</li>
		<li>
based on an error of law or fact. For example, a decision to refuse an application for an assessment even though Child Support had the necessary evidence to presume parentage from a previous application</li>		</ul>

<p>Errors made by delegates when making Change of Assessment and Departure Prohibition Order decisions do not fall into the simple or complex categories and cannot be remedied by using either section 75 or section 42.</p>

<p>If an error is identified do not attempt to correct it, all errors made by delegates must be referred to Program Advice.</p>

<p><strong>Change of Assessment</strong></p>

<p>A section 75 cannot remedy an error with a Change of Assessment (CoA) decision. This is because a CoA determination is a decision of a delegate to depart <strong>from</strong> the assessment. Section 75 can only be used to correct errors <strong>with</strong> the assessment.</p>

<p>Program Support Managers are responsible for evaluating and escalating these types of decisions by email to Child Support Program Advice. Program Advice will consider the facts and where necessary, refer to the delegate for a decision.</p>

<p>If the error is not with the decision but rather how it was applied, it may be appropriate to use section 75 to correct that error.</p>

<p>Where the correction will not have an effect on the outcome of a Notice of Decision (NTD) or a NTD has not been sent to the customers, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-03120000-01.html">Change of assessment in special circumstances (CS)</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Correct inaccurate dates of birth (DOB) in all circumstances to minimise any future impact for the customer and the cases involved. An exception to this is where an inaccurate DOB is necessary to maintain an international case.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> in international cases it is sometimes necessary to record an inaccurate child DOB, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-08180000-01.html">New Zealand 'In' case management - Registrations between Inland Revenue, New Zealand and Child Support</a>. These children's DOB must not be corrected. If unsure, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-09140000-01.html">Technical Support in Child Support.</a></p>

<p>It may be reasonable to correct the DOB error without customer contact and undertake a manual formula modification to address any overpay/debt raised. Consider the assessment impact of correcting a DOB on a case by case basis. For example, if the case has ended. See <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-30010030-01.html">Agreements Cuba Process Help</a>.</p>

<p>It is essential to maintain a unique customer record for the following reasons&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a customer with 2 separate payer customer records will be over-assessed for child support as the multi case allowance will not be reflected in the other case</li>
		<li>
payments made by a parent with multiple payer roles will only be disbursed to one payee as apportionment cannot apply (unless payments are being made on multiple CSRN)</li>
		<li>
customers may not match correctly with Centrelink records causing problems with&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
care decisions</li>
			<li>
child support assessments</li>
			<li>
collection from Centrelink payments</li>
			<li>
transfer of customer details between Centrelink and Child Support systems</li>
			<li>
Family Tax Benefit payments</li>
			<li>
reasonable maintenance action</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Customer Identification Number (CIN)</strong></p>

<p>To enable data exchange between the Child Support system Cuba and Centrelink system, customer records are assigned a CIN. The CIN is not visible within Cuba for most users.</p>

<p>The CIN matching is largely responsible for transfer of customer information through data exchange.</p>

<p>Prior to June 2011 release, CIN matches were often overwritten with new CIN match or the Cuba customer records may not have been successfully matched to the Centrelink system.</p>

<p>To determine which Cuba record is CIN matched to the Centrelink system, lodge an online Technical Support request requesting the CIN match. See <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-30010620-01.html">Technical support Cuba Process Help</a>.</p>

<p>For information about how a customer’s amended taxable income is used in a child support assessment see <a href="../separated-parents/277-07010000-01.html">Income processing for Child Support customers</a>. </p>

<p>Due to a limitation in Cuba, some ATO amended incomes issued prior to 23 May 2018 that should be used in new assessments have not been applied correctly. Manual intervention is required to correct these assessments.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> WA ex-nuptial cases will continue to be based on the rules that applied prior to 23 May 2018, until 15 May 2019.</p>

<p><strong>Defining ‘another child support case’</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
References to 'another case' for a parent only apply to the situation where the other case is with a <strong>different</strong> party, for <strong>different</strong> children. Therefore the parent has multiple (multi) cases</li>
		<li>
When the other case is the reverse of the original one, with the <strong>same</strong> other party, for the <strong>same</strong> children, it is not legally ‘another child support case’</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Multi-cases and amended income errors</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Where the following circumstances exist&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
a parent has an existing child support assessment using an initial ATO income for the LRYI, and</li>
			<li>
an ATO amended income is later recorded for the parent for the same LRYI, and</li>
			<li>
the Issue Date of the ATO amended income is before 23 May 2018 (except where the case is WA ex nuptial case, where it is limited to before 15 May 2019) and</li>
			<li>
a new assessment, for the same LRYI is made on another of the parent's cases after the ATO amended income is recorded</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>The ATO amended income <strong>must be used</strong> in that new assessment for the other case but not used in the assessment in the first case. The exception is when the ATO amended income is covered within the list of specific statutory exceptions for using an amended taxable income in the first case.</p>

<p>Where such a multi-case amended income error is identified, it requires a complex error correction&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Refer to an SSO or Program Support Manager (PSM) to perform a workaround by recording a formula modification</li>
		<li>
See <a href="../separated-parents/277-09030000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Amended_income_Step01">the Multi-case amended income error workaround </a>table</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Reverse case and amended income errors</strong></p>

<p>For amended incomes issued prior to 23 May 2018, both the original case and the reverse case <strong>should continue to use</strong> the initial ATO income for the LRYI for the parent. The <strong>exception</strong> is when the ATO amended income is covered within the list the specific statutory exceptions for using an amended taxable income. Procedure ends here.</p>

<p>Due to Cuba limitations, the Minimum Annual Rate of child support (MAR) is not being calculated correctly for <strong>some</strong>&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
parents who have more than 3 cases and </li>
		<li>
cases where there is a non parent carer (NPC)</li>
		</ul>
<p>For more information see <a href="../separated-parents/277-03100000-01.html">Minimum annual rate to nil - Reducing child support assessments</a></p>

<p><strong>More than 3 cases</strong></p>

<p>If a parent is assessed to pay MAR and they are a parent in more than 3 cases (these include all cases, regardless of the parent's role). The total amount payable is capped at 3 times the MAR and shared between all the cases.</p>

<p>When determining if the parent's MAR liability should be capped, Cuba is failing to include cases where the parent has a role as payee. As a result, some parents are incorrectly assessed to pay the full MAR on each case where they are the payer.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>A customer has 4 Child Support cases, one case as the payer and 3 as the payee. For the case as payer is assessed to pay the MAR (annual rate of $459).</p>

<p>This is incorrect as the annual rate should be calculated as 3 x $459 (MAR)/4 (cases). Therefore, for the case as payee the annual rate should only be $344.</p>

<p><strong>NPC cases</strong></p>

<p>If a parent is assessed to pay MAR in a case with more than one carer (a payee and a NPC, or multiple NPCs), the MAR is paid to the carer with the most care, or shared between the carers if they have equal care.</p>

<p>Cuba is sometimes applying MAR per child, instead of recognising all of the children of the relationship as being part of the same case. Cuba is also not always correctly determining if the total amount payable should be paid to just one of the carers or shared between them.</p>

<p>As a result, some parents are incorrectly assessed to pay the full MAR to each carer in the same case, or to pay MAR despite having at least regular care of at least one child of the case, or to pay incorrect portions of MAR to one or more carers.</p>

<p>The <a href="../separated-parents/277-09030000-05.html">Resources</a> page contains further examples of MAR apportionment errors.</p>

<p>&quot;We would like to discuss the child support assessment between you and (other party's name) but have been unable to speak with you.
