<p><strong>Written approvals</strong></p>

<p>From 1 June 2021, a new General (<strong>S85</strong>) Schedule - Opioid Authority Application Form (<strong>PB294</strong>) for general schedule items is available. Applications received beyond this date with the old application form may be used provided there is enough information to correctly answer the questions. A grace period of 3 months (until end August 2021) will be allowed for prescribers who continue to use the previous version. These applications are to be returned to the prescriber along with a letter and a copy of the new form after this time period.</p>

<p>Prescribers must provide sufficient information, as required to respond to Q&amp;As in Online PBS Authorities (OPA) system to complete an assessment.</p>

<p>If the prescriber has not stated <strong>initial</strong> or <strong>continuing</strong>, staff may approve under <strong>initial</strong> if all other information is available.</p>

<p>Service Officers can accept summarised information on written prescriptions as prescribers have limited space for the PBS criteria.</p>

<p>Two application forms are available to assist prescribers when submitting a written application for an opioid item. The form the prescriber uses will determine which type of item Service Officers need to select.</p>

<p>Where the prescriber submits the application using the General (<strong>S85</strong>) Schedule - Opioid Authority Application Form (<strong>PB294</strong>); Services Officers must select an item from the general PBS Schedule.</p>

<p>Where the prescriber submits the application using the Palliative Care Schedule – Opioid Authority Application Form (PB306); Service Officers must select an item from the Palliative Care Schedule.</p>

<p>If the prescriber does not provide sufficient information to satisfy the criteria according to the form that was submitted, Service Officers must reject the application and return it to the prescriber with the relevant letter and with compliments slip.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; What changes have been made to the palliative care schedule from 1 June 2021?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; some opioids have been added to the palliative care schedule for both short and long-term use. They are still available on the general schedule for palliative patients, however eligibility requirements are simplified for palliative care patients via the palliative care schedule.   </p></td>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Is there a limit on the maximum quantity of palliative care opioids that Services Australia can approve for an authority prescription?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; If the restrictions do not limit the maximum quantity, a quantity of up to 1 month treatment can be approved, with sufficient repeats for up to 3 months treatment (via self-serve OPA, or written, either by post or HPOS form upload only) if required. The previous 240 limit does not apply.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Can the prescriber apply for an authority prescription for up to 3 months' supply on OPA (self-serve) or Form Upload?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; A prescriber can apply via either channel for up to 3 months' supply. Some requests may reject on OPA due to quantity and/or repeat (multiplier) limitations. If a prescriber contact Services Australia to query a rejection and the request meets all other requirements, amend the authority request to override the rejection in OPA with an authority comment “Q/R within guidelines&quot;.</p></td>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Can the prescriber apply for an authority on the existing form (PB294) for opioid authorities for items on the palliative care schedule?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; No. </p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> ‘palliative care’ is still part of the restriction for some general schedule opioid items, and therefore it is still part of the existing form. SOs should not reject applications simply because this option has been ticked, as it is may still a valid application. If the prescriber has provided all relevant information to process this application, SOs should approve this under a general schedule item.</p></td>

<p><strong>Question&#58;  Can service officers approve a palliative care opioid when the prescriber submits the other form</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Service officers must approve items based on which form the prescriber submits. The onus is on the prescriber to make the decision about which criteria their patient meets, and to use the corresponding application form.</p></td>

<p><strong>Question&#58; What changes have been made to opioid restrictions from 1 October 2020?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Services Australia no longer requires the details of the&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
medical practitioner who undertook the annual pain management review, and</li>
		<li>
date of the review. </li>
		</ul>
<p>The Department of Health amended restrictions to include treatment phases. These treatment phases include&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
Initial PBS treatment after 1 June 2020 where patient has been treated with opioids for <strong>less than</strong> 12 months </li>
		<li>
Initial PBS treatment after 1 June 2020 where patient has been treated with opioids for <strong>more than</strong> 12 months </li>
		<li>
Continuing PBS treatment after 1 June 2020 </li>
		</ul>
<p>If the patient has received authority approval for the same form and drug between 1 June and 30 September 2020, Service Officers need to request authority approval under continuing treatment and confirm patient’s eligibility.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Palliative care nurse practitioners can now conduct the annual pain management review for palliative care patients. This is to reduce disruptions to the prescribing of required opioid medications.</p>

<p>The requirements for an annual pain management review have been removed for palliative care patients whose clinical condition is such that a review is not possible.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; When was information about the latest opioid changes provided to prescribers?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; The Department of Health and Services Australia provided information to the College of General Practitioners and the Australian Medical Association (AMA), as well as other peak bodies in May regarding the initial changes. Further information was provided in September for the most recent changes. In addition to this, the information is online at pbs.gov.au under ‘News’.</p>

This may include non-PBS treatment, PBS treatment with listed amounts and PBS treatment supplied under an authority for increased quantities and repeats.
