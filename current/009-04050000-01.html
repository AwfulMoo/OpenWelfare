<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>A carer who has lodged a claim for CP and does not meet basic eligibility qualification and payability for CP may have the claim rejected. Sometime the claim lodged is an inappropriate or incorrect claim. In all these circumstances, the claim is rejected.</P>

<LI>claims and is rejected for a residence related reason based on information provided on their claim. In some cases visa, citizenship and movement information, which is provided directly from the Department of Home Affairs datalink, may cause the claim to be rejected. Where the datalink with Department of Home Affairs has provided the information this will take precedence over any conflicting information provided by the carer</LI></UL>
<P>When manually rejecting a claim, ensure that an advice is sent to the carer giving reasons for the rejection, and detailing the <A href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/109-03000000-01.html">steps in the review and appeals process.</A></P>
<P>For a list of rejection codes, see <A href="../carers/009-04150060-01.html">Cancellation, suspension and rejection codes for Carer Payment (CP)</A>.</P>

<P>Qualification for bereavement assistance depends on whether the carer receives CP and/or CA. Before granting a claim for CP and/or CA, ensure the carer is eligible during the bereavement period and that arrears are not paid for more than 14 weeks from the date of death.</P>
<P>If the carer receives:</P>
<UL>
<LI>CA, bereavement assistance may be payable:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>if the <A href="../carers/009-03090050-01.html">care receiver was a child</A></LI>
<LI>under certain circumstances if the <A href="../carers/009-03090060-01.html">care receiver was an adult</A></LI></UL>

<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>In these situations, the death action on the care receiver's record should not be actioned until the CP and/or CA claim is finalised. It may be necessary to suspend the deceased care receiver's payment and inhibit the advices, until the CP and/or CA claim is ready to be finalised. If the date of death is not recent, it is important to calculate the correct arrears owing and to zero out any arrears of CA past the date of death to avoid overpayment.</P>
<P>If <STRONG>granting</STRONG> or r<STRONG>ejecting</STRONG> a CP and/or CA claim for the carer of a deceased care receiver, a manual Q888 <STRONG>must</STRONG> be issued.</P>
<P>The grant or rejection letter must be addressed to:</P>

<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Once the CP and/or CA claim is granted (or rejected) and arrears have been adjusted, the Service Officer can then code the death action on the care receiver's record.</P>
<P>If the care receiver is a <STRONG>child</STRONG>, the death action should cancel the CA and the system will assess the carer's eligibility for a lump sum bereavement payment of CP and CA. It will also assess entitlement for CP for the bereavement period.</P>
<P>If the care receiver is an <STRONG>adult</STRONG> and the carer is in receipt of:</P>
<UL>
<LI>CA only, the system will automatically cancel CA. The carer will not be eligible for a bereavement payment</LI>
<LI>both CP and CA, the system will automatically cancel CA and assess the carer's entitlement to CP during the bereavement period and eligibility for a lump sum bereavement payment for that care receiver</LI>
<LI>both CA and an income support payment (other than CP) that does not qualify them for a bereavement payment, the system will cancel CA at the end of the bereavement rate continuation period and assess the carer's eligibility for a lump sum CA bereavement payment</LI>
<LI>both CA and an income support payment that qualifies for a bereavement payment, the system will automatically cancel CA</LI></UL>
<P>The death action should generate an appropriate bereavement letter ensuring the carer is sent a grant letter and a bereavement letter.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
