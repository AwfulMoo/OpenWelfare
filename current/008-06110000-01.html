<p>A customer is assessed as having a <strong>Temporary Reduced Work Capacity </strong>(TRWC) if they have been assessed by an Assessor as being temporarily unable to work for at least 30 hours per week because of a medical condition.</p>

<p>A <strong>Partial Capacity to Work </strong>(PCW) is decided based on permanent verified medical conditions. The customer is assessed as having a PCW if both 'baseline work capacity' and 'with intervention' work capacity are assessed to be less than 30 hours per week. Assessors select a bandwidth(s) for ‘baseline’ and ‘with intervention’ work capacity from the following bandwidths&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
0-7 hour per week</li>
		<li>
8-14 hours per week</li>
		<li>
15-22 hours per week</li>
		<li>
23-29 hours per week</li>
		<li>
30+ hours per week</li>
		</ul>
<p>Customers with a PCW or a TRWC of 0-7 or 8-14 hours per week of 12 weeks or more in duration, will be required to attend compulsory quarterly participation interviews with Services Australia to fully meet their requirements, unless they are&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
over 35 and in receipt of DSP, or</li>
		<li>
undertaking paid work or self-employment within their bandwidth</li>
		</ul>
<p>Customers who fail to attend a compulsory quarterly interview appointment may have their payment suspended.</p>

<p>Customers with an assessed TRWC of 0-7 or 8-14 hours per week of less than 12 weeks in duration will not have a quarterly interview requirement. Instead, these customers will fully meet their requirements by lodging their Reporting Statement and attending appointments with Services Australia if requested.</p>

<p>Customers with a PCW or TRWC of either 0-7 or 8-14 hours per week are still required to meet mutual obligation requirements, with the following exceptions&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
while these customers are always encouraged to participate with Employment Services Providers, they cannot be penalised if they choose not to do so</li>
		<li>
customers with a TRWC of 0-7 hours per week. Customers cannot be referred to Disability Employment Services (DES) but can be referred to jobactive, and</li>
		<li>
to fully meet their requirements through paid work instead of attending quarterly interviews, the hours of work must be within their bandwidth (for example, at least 8 hours per week, if they have a PCW of 8-14 hours per week)</li>
		</ul>
<p>A customer who lodges a medical certificate (seeking exemption from mutual obligation requirements) may be referred for an Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) to assess their PCW or TRWC where there is not already a current and valid assessment of the customer's work capacity. The referral for an ESAt should not delay the decision about the temporary incapacity exemption. In all cases, the decision about whether to grant an exemption is based on available evidence, including the medical certificate completed by the customer's treating doctor.</p>

<p>A customer is assessed as having a <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03040010-01.html">Continuing Inability To Work (CITW)</a> if their medical condition(s) prevents them from being able to work for more than 15 hours or more per week, and when&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
educational,</li>
		<li>
pre-vocational,</li>
		<li>
vocational, or</li>
		<li>
work related training is unlikely to enable the customer to do any work for 15 or more hours per week, within 2 years, independently of a program of support. <br>A CITW <strong>must</strong> be met in addition to meeting other eligibility criteria for DSP. </li>
		</ul>
<p>For the purposes of work capacity, 'work' is considered to be any work. It is not limited by the work the customer usually performs nor, work available in the customer's area. It is expected that a person will be capable of reliably performing work on a sustainable basis, that is, for a reasonable period of time without requiring excessive sick leave or work absences. In this context, a reasonable period of time generally means 26 weeks and work means work in open, unsupported employment. Sick leave or absences of 1 month or more (in total) taken in any given 26 week period are considered excessive.</p>
