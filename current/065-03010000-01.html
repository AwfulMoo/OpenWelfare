<p>This document outlines how a customer or correspondence nominee can claim or re-claim Age Pension. This can be done online, with help from a Service Officer using Assisted Customer Claim (ACC) or via a paper claim. Eligible customers may also claim the Pension Bonus Payment when claiming Age Pension. Where specific criteria are met, partnered customers may be eligible to lodge a combined claim for themselves and their partner when claiming Age Pension online.</p>

<p>Claims for Age Pension (including Age Pension Blind) and Pension Bonus Payment (PBP) can be made by completing paper claim forms. If a customer or their correspondence nominee have completed paper claim forms (<a class="extwebsitelink" href="https&#58;//www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/sa002">SA002</a> and <a class="extwebsitelink" href="https&#58;//www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/sa369">SA369</a>) or been issued pre-populated claim forms via <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-03010000-01.html">FCSO</a>, <strong>all </strong>forms must be fully completed and lodged to be assessed for Age Pension. Check forms and supporting documentation provided by the customer (and their partner if applicable).</p>

<p>Paper claim forms include partner details. If the partner is also claiming Age Pension at the same time as the customer, they can both claim on the one form. However, if they wish to provide their details individually for privacy reasons, they can complete and lodge separate forms.</p>

<p>Maximising a customer's entitlement to PBP may depend on various factors. The date a customer finishes work may not be the same as the date their bonus period ends.
