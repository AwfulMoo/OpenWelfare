<P>Centrelink can assist customers to verify their or their partner's citizenship.</P>
<P>It is not necessary for a customer and/or their partner to be Australian citizens for the customer to be residentially qualified for a Centrelink administered payment. A customer may also be the holder of a permanent visa or a protected SCV holder. A customer may also be residentially qualified for Special Benefit, family assistance and concession cards if they have a certain temporary visas that qualify customers for some payments. A customer may also qualify for Parental leave payments, family assistance and concession cards (excluding Ex Carer Allowance Health Care Card (EHC)) if they are a non-protected SCV holder.</P>
<P>If the customer doesn't have any verification, Centrelink can assist a customer to verify both the citizenship and/or permanent visa status for themselves and/or their partner.</P>
<P>A request for verification of citizenship should be sent to CIS.</P>
<P>If the customer states they or their partner (as appropriate) are an Australian citizen, coding the country of citizenship as 'AU' will generally create an edit in the new claim or benefit transfer activity unless an identity confirmation exemption has been recorded or a suitable confirmation document is recorded on the <STRONG>POIH</STRONG> or <STRONG>Identity Summary</STRONG> screens or the datalink has verified Australian citizenship. If the edits occurs after procedures have been followed to this point, contact CIS.</P>
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> if any of the following applies, it is generally <STRONG>not</STRONG> necessary to record and verify a person's Australian citizenship before granting their claim:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the person is a permanent visa or protected SCV holder or</LI>
<LI>the person qualifies for the payment or card as a non-protected SCV holder or has a certain temporary visas that qualify customers for some payments and</LI>
<LI>if the person is claiming a <A href="../migrants-refugees-and-visitors/005-02020000-01.html">NARWP affected payment</A>, it has already been served or the customer is exempt from the Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Period (NARWP) without reliance on their Australian citizenship</LI></UL>
