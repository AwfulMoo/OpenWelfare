<p>If a customer does not agree with a decision, they may <a target="_blank" href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/109-02000000-01.html">apply for a formal review</a>. This may be without requesting an explanation, or after a SME explanation. A formal review will be undertaken by an Authorised Review Officer (ARO).</p>

<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Date of effect - social security law</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>There are 2 factors relevant to the date of effect&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
how quickly a customer applied for a formal review of the original decision, and</li>
		<li>
whether or not the notice of the original decision was given to the person</li>
		</ul>
<p>The interaction of these 2 factors has significant consequences for deciding the date of effect of the favourable determination.</p>

<p>If notice of the original decision was&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
given to the person and the person applied for a formal review</li>
			<ul>			<li>
<strong>within 13 weeks</strong> after being given the notice, the date of effect of the favourable determination is the date of effect of the original decision</li>
			<li>
<strong>more than 13 weeks</strong> after being given the notice, the date of effect of the favourable determination is the date the person applied for the formal review</li>		</ul>
		<li>
was <strong>not</strong> given to the person, the date of effect of the favourable determination is the date of effect of the original decision. This is regardless of when the person applied for the formal review</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>For the grant</strong> <strong>of a social security payment</strong>, the determination of the date of effect is subject to the start day rules.</p>

<p>Information on the <a href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/109-06030000-01.html">Review of Assessment (ROA) screen</a> will feed into this assessment process. Specifically the Notification Handler (NOHL), which helps in determining the correct date of effect for a change in entitlement.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Section 109 sets out the date of effect to be used when a favourable determination results from a formal review. That is, the date of effect for a rate increase or resumption of payment determination.</p>

<p>Section 110 states what date of effect should be used when a customer advises a change of circumstances.</p>

<p>If either section 109 or section 110 could apply to a case, the provision that gives the most beneficial outcome to the customer should be applied. See the <a href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/109-06010000-05.html">Resources</a> page for an example.</p>

<p>Generally, the date of effect of a favourable determination is the date that would give full effect to the decision if the application for a formal review was made within the time limit. See below for the time limits for applying for a review.</p>

<p><strong>Payment of Family Tax Benefit (FTB) by instalment decision</strong></p>

<p>If an application for a formal review of the FTB decision is made more than 52 weeks after notice of the original decision was given to the person, or a further period if Centrelink is satisfied there are special circumstances that prevented the person from making an application for review on time, the date of effect of a favourable determination is the <strong>later</strong> of&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the date that would give full effect to the decision, or</li>
		<li>
1 July of the income year before the income year in which the application for the formal review was made</li>
		</ul>
<p>This date of effect limitation does not apply where the request for review is the result of&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the person meeting reconciliation conditions and requesting a review of their annual entitlement , i.e. asking for reconciliation to occur, or</li>
		<li>
an assessment or review of taxable income by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). This is provided the application for review is made within 13 weeks from when the person received notification of the ATO decision and the reconciliation conditions were originally met for the relevant income year</li>
		<li>
a review of child support entitlement, provided the person makes the application for review within 13 weeks of receiving notification of the revised child support assessment</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p><strong>Child Care Subsidy (CCS) and Additional Child Care Subsidy (ACCS)</strong></p>

<p>The date of effect of CCS and ACCS decisions cannot be earlier than the first day of the income year immediately before the income year in which the application for review was made.</p>

<p>This date of effect limitation does not apply where the&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
decision is a result of the person meeting reconciliation conditions, to the extent the review relates to the persons Adjusted Taxable Income, and requesting a review of their annual entitlement, i.e. asking for reconciliation to occur, or</li>
		<li>
review is conducted because of a review of taxable income by the ATO. This is provided the application for review is made within 13 weeks from when the person received notification of the ATO decision and the reconciliation conditions were originally met for the relevant income year</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p><strong>Care decision</strong></p>

<p>If a customer applies for a formal review of a care decision, the review decision may affect the Child Support assessment of the customer and all other affected parties.</p>

<p>The date of effect of the review decision for child support purposes is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the date of the original care decision, if the application for a formal review was made within 28 days of the customer being notified of the original decision</li>
		<li>
the date the customer applied for a formal review, if the application was made more than 28 days after the customer was notified of the original decision</li>

<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Time limits under family assistance law</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">

<p>If a decision is made to reject a claim for Baby Bonus (BBY) due to income, and the customer's financial situation changes, they may provide a revised income estimate and either apply for a formal review of the decision, or lodge another claim for BBY within 52 weeks of the rejection decision. BBY is only available for a child born or entrusted to care as part of an adoption process from 1 July 2007 and before 1 March 2014.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>Under social security law, the time taken to deliver the notice must be taken into account when deciding whether a person has applied for a formal review within 13 weeks of being given the notice.</p>

<p>Under family assistance law, the time taken to deliver the notice must be taken into account when deciding whether a person has applied for a formal review within 52 weeks of being given the notice.</p>

<p>If the notice is posted to the person, it is deemed to have been given at the time it would be delivered in the ordinary course of the post, unless it is proved it would have arrived at another time. The <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-14000000-01.html">delivery timetables</a> provide details of times from generation to posting of Centrelink letters and Australia Post published delivery standards. These times must be added to the date a notice was issued to decide when the notice was given to the person.</p>

<p>The customer is taken to have been given notice of a decision if it was&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
delivered to the person personally</li>
		<li>
left at the person's last known place of residence or business, or</li>
		<li>
sent by prepaid post to the person's last known postal address</li>
		</ul>
<p>The notice is deemed to have been given to the person even if it is known that the person did not receive it. For example, if a notice sent to the person by prepaid post is returned to Centrelink marked 'left address'.</p>

<p><a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-14000000-01.html">Delivery timetables for Centrelink forms and letters</a> depend on the actual time from letter creation to mailing, and Australia Post delivery standards.</p>

<p>Customers who receive their letters via myGov are considered to have received the letter on the date it becomes available for viewing. This is 2 working days after the letter has been generated. The date the letter was generated is shown on the customer's Letter History Summary (<strong>HS</strong>) screen. See the <a href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/109-06010000-04.html">References</a> page for a link to the relevant section of the Electronic Transactions Act.</p>
