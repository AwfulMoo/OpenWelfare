<p>Criteria for UTLAH eligibility include that the young person is&#58;</p>

not receiving continuous financial or other support, directly or indirectly, from their parent(s) or guardian(s)</li>
		<li>
not receiving payments in the nature of income support (other than a social security benefit) on a continuous basis from a commonwealth, state or territory government, and</li>
		<li>
unable to live at the home of either or both parents because&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
of extreme family breakdown or other similar exceptional circumstances</li>

living at home would cause a serious risk to the customer's physical or mental well-being due to family and domestic violence, child abuse, sexual abuse, neglect or other similar unreasonable circumstances, or</li>
			<li>
their parents are not able to provide a suitable home for the customer due to a lack of stable accommodation</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>A customer aged under 18 years must be referred to a Services Australia social worker. They will make the decision about UTLAH eligibility.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; a new UTLAH assessment is not required if there is no change to the young person's circumstances, and they were receiving a payment with UTLAH independence status, in the 52 weeks before a new payment claim.</p>

<p>When conducting an UTLAH assessment the Services Australia social worker will&#58;</p>

conduct a file assessment</li>

interview the customer</li>

		<div class="block">

<p>A guardian is <strong>not</strong> considered a parent for the purposes of determining if it is unreasonable to live at home with a young person's parent(s).</p>

<p>For a UTLAH assessment, establishing <strong>if</strong> a person is a guardian, or suitable adult with substantial care of a young person, is only relevant&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
for determining if the customer is receiving continuous financial<strong> </strong>or other support from a parent<strong>, </strong>or another person who is acting as their guardian on a longâ€‘term basis, or</li>
		<li>
if the young person is under 16 years, claiming Special Benefit and the social worker is considering if they are a 'dependent child' of a suitable adult, who they are substantially in the care of. In such cases FTB may be the most suitable option, see <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-08030080-03.html">Assisting a customer aged under 16</a> </li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p>Social workers should consider <strong>all </strong>of the factors listed below&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>The duration of care</strong> - if the relationship between the young person and adult is long-standing</li>
		<li>
<strong>The kind of care</strong> - if the young person is given constant care and attention, emotional and material support, as would be expected of a child's parents. If the young person is nurtured and treated as a member of the family, including attention given to welfare and education</li>
		<li>
<strong>The degree of independence</strong> - if the young person has a high degree of independence and ability to manage their own affairs</li>
		<li>
<strong>The nature of the relationship</strong> - if the relationship between the young person and adult is close and intimate, like that between a parent and child. A parent-child like relationship is often, but not necessarily, linked with duration of care</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a young person living with a relative does not necessarily make the relative a guardian for continuous support, or suitable adult for Special Benefit purposes. This is even if the young person refers to them as their guardian </li>
		<li>
a person, who is not a parent, receiving Family Tax Benefit (FTB) for the young person is a cause for exploration, but does not necessarily indicate that the carer is a suitable adult who has substantial care of the young person</li>

<p>In all cases, if a parent of a customer aged under 18 is not to be contacted because of issues of risk, or the young person has refused consent to contact, consultation with the Social Work Manager (EL2) <strong>must</strong> occur.

<p>Some UTLAH assessments may identify a need for follow-up support of the young person. The purpose of follow-up intervention is to make sure that young people experiencing vulnerability have early access to supports and services. The aim is to provide early, focused intervention with strategies that are tailored to the young person's individual development and life situation. </p>

<p>Follow-up support is usually provided by a social worker though short-term <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-17072600-01.html">social casework</a>. However, if the young person declines a referral for social casework, staff should consider a future UTLAH wellbeing review.</p>

<p>All customers under 16 years are deemed to need follow up. This is unless significant appropriate supports are already in place.</p>

<p>Social workers should also consider follow up for customers experiencing other vulnerable circumstances. These include (but are not limited to) young people with minimal existing supports and&#58;</p>

<p>If a young person has applied for an income support payment under UTLAH provisions, a full assessment will occur, including&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer's current living situation, to make sure the young person is not at risk</li>
		<li>
contact with parents/guardians as appropriate, and </li>
		<li>
<a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-12030030-01.html">referral to the relevant State or Territory Welfare Authority</a>, as appropriate</li>
		</ul>
<p>When a young person under 16 has applied for Special Benefit (SpB), the social worker will also help decide&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the adequacy of any support being provided by way of state care, if the young person indicates the support they are receiving is insufficient </li>
		<li>
whether the young person is a dependent child of another adult who is providing ongoing care, who can apply for Family Tax Benefit (FTB) </li>
		</ul>
<p>Refer to <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-08030080-01.html">Assisting a customer under 16</a>. The social worker  must make sure the reasons for their recommendations are outlined in the UTLAH report. </p>

<p>Given the vulnerability of young people in this age group, regular consultations should occur between social workers and their EL1 Social Work Support Manager or EL2 Social Work Manager throughout the assessment.</p>

<p>A determination of whether a customer meets the eligibility criteria to be granted UTLAH independent status is an appealable decision.</p>

<p>If a young person notifies the agency they are independent due to it being unreasonable to live at home, a UTLAH eligibility decision should always be made, including if the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
does not attend their social work UTLAH interview and the social worker cannot contact them. In these cases, the social worker will reject UTLAH due to insufficient information to determine if it is unreasonable for the young person to live at home</li>
		<li>
declines to continue participating in a UTLAH assessment. Since assessment of UTLAH independence status eligibility is not a claim, there is no claim to withdraw. The social worker should still make a UTLAH determination using any information already provided. <strong>Note</strong>&#58; do not contact parents or third party if this has not yet occurred and the young person withdraws their consent </li>
		<li>
seems likely to be ineligible once the assessment has begun. The social worker should complete the UTLAH assessment, even if it becomes clear, after one or more interviews, that a young person will not meet eligibility criteria</li>
