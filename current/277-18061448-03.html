<p>Debt Enforcement is to review the debt to ensure it is accurate. Consider&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the basis of the assessment</li>
		<li>
the incomes used in the assessment for all relevant parties</li>
		<li>
the use of estimates of income. If an estimate reconciliation is required refer to the Specialised Assessments Team for action, see the <a target="_blank" href="../utils/CustomerReferralGuidelines/Customer-Referral-Guidelines.html?estimate-review-reconciliation-specialised-estimates.html">Customer referral guidelines for Child Support staff, Estimates</a>.</li>
		<li>
the use of all Amended Taxable incomes since 1 July 2008 to ensure they are in line with the revised amended taxable income policy. If not, an error correction submission needs to be completed and forwarded to a Service Support Officer (SSO) for review</li>
		</ul>
<p>Ensure all relevant collection options have been investigated and appropriate administrative enforcement actions taken.</p>

<p>The Debt Enforcement PSM will make an initial decision on whether the case may be suitable for debt enforcement action. As the payee and the Child Support Registrar cannot take court action for the same debt, at this point there may need to be discussion with the payee about their intentions.</p>

<p>If the payee has already filed their application with the court, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-18061448-03.html#bp03_tbl_Court_applicati_Step03">Step 3 in the Court application and outcome</a> table.</p>

		<li>
establish their reason/s for taking court action (e.g. inaction/delay, new information, 'hope' that action will prompt payer to pay) and if the payee has not sought legal advice suggest that this is an option they should consider</li>
		<li>
ask what orders/enforcement action they will be seeking from the court. Advise that where possible the agency will implement any court orders which impact on the assessment but will not enforce orders obtained by the payee if the payer fails to comply</li>
		<li>
advise that while they are taking enforcement action, the agency is not prevented from continuing or commencing administrative collection action. Therefore, it is essential that open communication occurs to ensure that collection action undertaken by either party is not jeopardised</li>
		<li>
advise that as child support debts frequently change, they should contact the agency prior to any court date or settlement to confirm the current amount of the child support debt. It is also important that they also notify us of any changes to care, income and naps throughout this process</li>
		<li>
advise that both the assessment and the debt may change in the future as a result of updated information or review of the assessment, that is by a change of assessment or objection, and any changes to the assessment will be confirmed to them in writing</li>
		<li>
advise of any relevant action taken, or about to be taken, to collect or correct the debt. This will allow the payee to make an informed decision on whether to continue their court action. Do not discuss the advantages and disadvantages of their court action or discuss if they should continue</li>

to any other payee/case</li>
		<li>
for late payment penalties, consolidated revenue, costs or fines</li>
		</ul>
<p>The payee may require a number of Certificates of Debt to be issued if there are multiple court dates because the debt will continue to accrue over the course of the court proceedings. There may also be changes to the debt amounts as a result to changes to the assessment.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> only SO5 debt enforcement officers can issue the certificate of debt notice as this requires the manual generation of these certificates with the affixing of a facsimile of the Child Support Registrar’s signature.</p>

<p>The payee can file a court application for enforcement of the debt. The agency is not a party to the enforcement proceedings brought by the payee, the parties are the payee and payer of the relevant case. There is no time limit for the payee (after giving the agency at least 14 days' notice) to file an enforcement summons application to the court.</p>

<p>If court documents are received which list the Child Support Registrar as a party to the proceedings, please escalate the case to the Debt Enforcement PSM for their review and recommendation to the delegate as to whether to remove the Registrar as a party.</p>

<p>When the application is made to the court, and a copy of the application received by the agency, the payer should be locked a Service Officer.</p>

<p>Once a sealed copy of the court application is received, send an email to the Debt Enforcement PSM with a recommendation for or against the agency intervening in the proceedings. The Debt Enforcement PSM will liaise with Litigation and Information Release Branch (LIR) via email.</p>

<p>In addition, the Assistant Director, Program Advice will also be copied to the email in order to seek comments from the Child Support Program Branch. The Service Manager should be copied into all communication.</p>

<p>Generally, the agency will only consider intervening if the payer owes child support on more than 1 case and there is an indication that there is a viable collection opportunity. This will ensure that the court considers the payer's total debt and that any resulting court order on this debt assists with child support collection on all of the payer's cases.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when the agency intervenes in a payee enforcement proceeding, the agency becomes liable for our costs and may be subject to costs orders.</p>

<p>Once approval to intervene has been received, the LIR will instruct an external legal service provider and the case will be allocated to a Senior debt Enforcement Officer (SDEO) in the relevant debt enforcement team. The SDEO will email the PSM requesting the Recovery of Debt by Customers Register be updated. From this point on, the case will be managed in line with the <a href="../separated-parents/277-04220030-01.html">Taking a Child Support customer to court</a> procedure.</p>

<p>If a decision is made not to intervene or take over enforcement proceedings, the case will remain locked to a Senior Debt Enforcement Officer for ongoing management.</p>

<p>Contact both customers by phone to discuss the case and any actions the agency have or will take in relation to the payee's legal action. Also advise both customers of the current child support debt and ongoing liability and let them know that they will need to contact us prior to any court dates or settlements to confirm if the debt has changed.</p>

<p>The customers need to be advised that where possible, the agency will provide any documentation they require for the court action, at their request. For example, assessment letters, notes or transaction statements. However, the agency is still bound by privacy and secrecy provisions and even in response to a subpoena, the agency may not be able to provide all documentation they request. Refer customers to the <a target="_blank" href="http&#58;//guides.dss.gov.au/child-support-guide/6/4/1">Child Support Guide 6.4.1&#58; Subpoenas and notices to produce documents</a> for further information and see <a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-04030000-01.html">Handling subpoenas and Commonwealth Information Location Orders served on the agency </a>.</p>

<p>Advise the customers that the agency will not attend the hearing unless the agency wishes to intervene in the proceeding or the court requires the agency 's attendance. Also advise that where possible the agency will implement any court orders which impact on the assessment but will not enforce orders obtained by the payee if the payer fails to comply.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> until the payer is served with the copy of the payee's court application, the agency cannot discuss or advise the payer of the proposed payee enforcement action. Therefore, the Service Officer should contact the payee in the first instance to confirm if service has been effected on the payer.</p>

<p>Document all contact in Payer Collection window, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-01030000-01.html">Documenting Child Support information</a>.</p>

<p>The court has broad powers to make orders for payment and enforcement of a child support debt. The type of order made will be influenced by a customer's individual circumstances. The court also has the power to make an order for costs against the Registrar but only if the agency are a party to the proceedings.</p>

<p>The payee will need to take the appropriate action(s) to implement any enforcement provisions of the court order. If the payer defaults on the terms of the orders then the payee will need to commence enforcement proceedings through the court.</p>

<p>Any payments ordered by the court, in relation to a child support debt, must be made directly to the agency.</p>

<p>Where a payer pays child support to us in accordance with the order, the agency must disperse to the payee(s) named in the order. The general apportionment process does not apply.</p>

<p>To ensure that these funds are not apportioned, if a payer owes debt to more than 1 payee, place a hold on the account when a copy of the sealed court orders are received and then manually disburse the funds once received.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the manual allocation of funds subject to Payee Enforcement orders where there are multiple cases, must be approved by the PSM.</p>

<p>The Service Officer must consult with their team leader before taking any administrative enforcement action where the debt is subject to court orders.</p>

<p><strong>Where the payee obtains an order that covers both collect and non-collect periods, the agency will only credit payments made for the collect period.</strong></p>
