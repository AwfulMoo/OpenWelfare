<p>If a customer enquires about their Family Tax Benefit (FTB)/Child Care Benefit (CCB) reconciliation or lump sum claim and the activity has been stopped for manual intervention, Service Officers should <strong>not</strong> contact Technical Peer Support (TPS).</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> some activities with the manual intervention reason <strong>'Customer may be impacted by Natural Disaster/Emergency' </strong>(<strong>#EMGDIS</strong>) may be completed by Service Officers <strong>without referring to the MIV team</strong>.

<p>Before sending a request to the MIV team, check the record for a MIV Progress <strong>DOC</strong>. A MIV Progress <strong>DOC</strong> indicates the MIV team are currently working on the customer’s reconciliation outcome. Advise the customer that their reconciliation will be finalised in due course. Direct them to check their online account for updates.</p>

<div class="showcont">


<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; the School Enrolment and Attendance Measure (SEAM) ceased from 1 January 2018.</p>

<p>From the December 2010 major systems release, there have been limited cases of continued SEAM suspension periods over 13 weeks (payments automatically cancelled after 13 consecutive weeks and were subject to review and manual determinations after 13 cumulative weeks of suspension). There were also limited reconciliation periods prior to the December 2010 release that included SEAM suspension periods exceeding 13 continuous weeks. In these limited cases, the following process applied&#58;</p>

<p>For reconciliation purposes, where a customer's income support payment had a SEAM suspension of 13 or more continuous weeks, the customer’s Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A and/or Child Care Benefit (CCB) were subject to the income test for the entire suspension period. This included the initial 13 week suspension if the entire period fell within the same financial year.</p>

<p>For suspension prior to the December 2010 release, the customer's record will have been suspended with one of the following codes&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
'<strong>ATF</strong>' (Attendance not satisfactory)</li>
		<li>
'<strong>ENF</strong>' (Enrolment details not provided)</li>
		</ul>
<p>For suspension post the December 2010 release and up to 31 December 2017, the customer's record will have been suspended with one of the following codes&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
'<strong>ATN</strong>' (Attendance not satisfactory)</li>
		<li>
'<strong>ENN</strong>' (Enrolment details not provided)</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the suspension spans 2 financial years, only the suspension period in the second financial year is to be income tested. The income test will not apply to FTB Part A and/or CCB for the suspension period in the first financial year, regardless of the length of the suspension. If the income support payment was suspended for less than 13 continuous weeks, the customer’s FTB Part A and/or CCB is free of the income test for the suspension period.</p>

<p>If a customer's payment was '<strong>SUS/ATF</strong>' or '<strong>SUS/ENF</strong>' anytime during the financial year and is suspended as at 30 June, manual intervention is required if the payment was not being automatically assessed. The MIV team will override the suspension period which has been assessed as 'off income support'.</p>

<p>Manual intervention is required to ensure that the above rules are applied correctly at reconciliation. Where required, the FAO ISP Override (<strong>FISPO</strong>) screen may be coded to correct the assessment.</p>

<p>From the 2012-13 financial year, where FTB is reconciled under late lodger provisions, supplements (including Single Income Family Supplement (SIFS)) are not payable (excluded from the assessment) and top ups are inhibited, that is, not paid to the customer nor are they available for debt offsetting.</p>

<p>Where a tax return for the 2012-13 or later financial year is lodged after the end of the <strong>allowable period</strong> and reconciliation for the relevant year has previously completed based upon an estimate of income, manual intervention may be required for some customers to determine if they are entitled to FTB supplements, SIFS or top ups calculated.</p>

<p>MIV staff will be able to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
accept the provisional re-reconciliation result</li>
		<li>
adjust the result to include or exclude supplements (using the Supplement Override function)</li>
		<li>
adjust the result using the FAO Reconciliation Manual Adjustment (<strong>FRMA</strong>) screen</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> from the 2016-17 financial year onwards, FTB Part A supplement is not payable to families with an adjusted taxable income (ATI) of more than the Part A supplement income limit for the relevant income year. A supplement override to include the Part A supplement should <strong>not</strong> be coded for 2016-17 and later financial years where the families ATI exceeds the income limit.</p>

<p>From the June 2014 major system release if a late lodger assessment is made for the customer or their partner, for the 2011-12 and later financial years, manual intervention is required if the customer had MCA deductions in the relevant year.</p>

<p>Manual intervention is necessary as reconciliation calculations cannot distinguish between MCA deductions and More Choice for Families (MCFF) deductions when determining if a late lodger is eligible for a top-up.</p>

<p>If the customer chose to receive less than their legislative rate of FTB during the year they will only be entitled to the lesser of the entitlement based on their estimate and entitlement based on their actual adjusted taxable income (AATI). This is not a top-up.</p>

<p>MCA deductions cannot be paid as a top-up and will need to be inhibited.</p>

<p>Part A and Part B supplements, and SIFS will not be included in the customer’s annual FTB rate.</p>

<p>MIV staff will be required to manually check the result to ensure MCA deductions are adjusted and not paid to the customer as a top-up.</p>
