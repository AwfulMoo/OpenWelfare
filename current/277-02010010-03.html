<div class="showcont">


<p>Agreements must be accompanied by an application for acceptance of the child support agreement from 1 of the parties to the agreement. Applications for acceptance can be made in writing or verbally. </p>

<p>Section 1 of the <a target="_blank" class="extwebsitelink" href="https&#58;//www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/customer/forms/cs1666">Child Support Agreement</a> form constitutes an application for acceptance. If there is no written application for acceptance, contact the customer to  apply verbally by phone. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-01010000-01.html">Contact with Child Support customers</a>.</p>

<p>Child Support customers can only apply for acceptance of their child support agreement. After the supplied documents have been fully examined and considered, Child Support will decide if the agreement satisfies the requirements for acceptance as a binding or limited agreement.</p>

<p>A customer may withdraw their application for acceptance of their child support agreement at any time prior to Child Support making a decision on the application.   </p>

<p><strong>Application withdrawn or refused and customer re-applies for acceptance of the same child support agreement </strong></p>

<p>If an application for acceptance of a child support agreement is withdrawn or refused, a customer (either the original applicant or the other party) may re-apply to have the same child support agreement accepted at a later date and Child Support can use the agreement that is already on the system record. The customer does not need to re-submit the same agreement with their application, but can do so.  </p>

<p>This may arise when the original application was refused and the subsequent application for acceptance can now be accepted. Examples of this are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a pre-condition in the child support agreement had not been met, but this pre-condition is now met, or</li>
		<li>
the annual rate payable under a limited agreement was not equal to or greater than the annual rate payable under the assessment, but it now meets that test </li>
		</ul>
<p>If the application for acceptance relates to a child support agreement that is already on the system record, contact both customers to confirm that the agreement has been identified correctly and that there is a common understanding of the terms of the agreement. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-02010020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Interpret_the_c_Step02">Table 1 Step 2 in Interpreting and making a decision on a Child Support agreement</a>.</p>

<p>The agreement <strong>must</strong> be refused in relation to a child if it provides that a person will receive child support - in the form of either periodic or non-periodic payments - when customers are not an eligible carer of that child.</p>

<p>If the agreement includes more than 1 child, the agreement may be accepted for any other child/ren not affected by these provisions. However, consider the agreement in its entirety to determine if the provisions allowing a non-eligible carer to receive child support are severable to the agreement provisions for the other children. If not severable, the agreement should be refused for all the children. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-02010020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Interpret_the_c_Step04">Table 1, Steps 4 &amp; 5 of Interpreting and making a decision of a Child Support agreement</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Dual role agreements</strong></p>

<p>Where both parents are liable parents and receiving parents according to the terms of the agreement, the agreement may be treated as if it contains 2 separate agreements. In such cases, where there are provisions that contravene section 85, it may be possible to refuse 1 agreement but accept the other.</p>

<p>The child support agreement must include 1 or more of the following provisions&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a periodic amount (regular amounts payable on a regular basis) payable by 1 party to the other. These may be paid directly to the other parent or non-parent carer, to their bank account, or to a third party acting as the agent of the payee, such as a solicitor or trustee </li>
		<li>
a variation to the periodic amount already payable by 1 party to the other</li>
		<li>
a variation to the components of the child support formula</li>
		<li>
a non-periodic payment provision where payments are to reduce the annual rate of child support payable by the parent under the child support assessment </li>
		<li>
that a parent is to provide child support in a form other than by a non-periodic payment provision or lump sum payment provision.<br>If the agreement does not specify that non-periodic payments will reduce the child support liability by an amount or percentage, they are deemed to be child support in a form other than by a non-periodic payment or lump sum payment and are in addition to the child support payable. The <a href="../separated-parents/277-02010010-04.html">References</a> page contains a link to the Child Support Guide 2.7.1&#58; What is a child support agreement?</li>
		<li>
a parent is to provide child support in the form of a lump sum payment to be credited against the parent’s child support liability. An agreement where child support is paid in the form of a lump sum that is to be credited against the liability <strong>must </strong>be a binding agreement.<br>Not all agreements that refer to payments of lump sums will be ‘lump sum payment provisions’. Agreements will only come within the specific definition of a lump sum payment provision if they provide for the lump sum to be credited against the liability payable under the assessment (as opposed to reducing (or not reducing) the annual rate payable in the assessment).<br>If there are not ‘lump sum payment provisions’, they could be either a (lump sum) non-periodic payment provision that is to reduce the annual rate (if that reduction is specified), or if no reduction to the annual rate is specified, the (lump sum) non periodic payment will be taken to be in addition to the child support payable</li>

to end the liability of a party to pay or provide child support from a date specified, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-02010040-01.html">Ending a Child Support agreement</a>. The specified day must be a future date </li>		</ul>

<p>Binding child support agreements allow parents to make binding financial agreements about child support. Binding child support agreements operate in a similar manner to binding financial agreements that separating parents might make in relation to property, superannuation and spousal maintenance.</p>

<p>A binding child support agreement cannot be varied (section 80CA). To change a binding child support agreement, the agreement must be terminated and replaced with a new binding child support agreement.</p>

<p>A binding agreement must include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a written statement confirming that each customer has received independent legal advice on the effect of the agreement and the advantages and disadvantages of making the agreement before it was signed. This statement must be part of the agreement, but it can be present in either the Recitals portion of the agreement, or the operative provisions of the agreement, and</li>
		<li>
a <a class="extwebsitelink" href="https&#58;//www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/organisations/business/forms/cs4137">Legal Certificate</a> from each customer’s independent legal practitioner who provided advice on the terms of the agreement</li>
		</ul>
<p>If all the required documents have not been received, contact the customer and negotiate a reasonable timeframe for them to be sent in. Contact the other parties to the agreement to advise of the delay.</p>

<p><strong>Legal practitioner </strong></p>

<p>A legal practitioner for the purposes of s80C(2)(c) of the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 must&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
be a lawyer who has been admitted by the Supreme Court of a State or Territory of Australia or a federal court</li>
		<li>
hold a current practising certificate</li>
		</ul>
<p>Child Support will not accept a binding agreement that has been certified by an overseas lawyer who does not meet these criteria.</p>

<p>Child Support will generally not question whether the legal advice was independent except in the following circumstances&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
one party, as a qualified legal practitioner, has provided legal advice to the other party to the agreement</li>
		<li>
one party, as a qualified legal practitioner, has provided legal advice to themselves, and </li>
		<li>
the same legal practitioner has provided legal advice to both parties </li>
		</ul>
<p>In such cases, Child Support will not consider the legal advice to be independent and the child support agreement will not be accepted as a binding agreement. </p>

<p>If an agreement is received which does not meet the legal advice requirements, contact the customers to explain the requirements for a legal practitioner for a binding child support agreement. </p>

<p>The parent who asked for the agreement to be accepted may wish to withdraw the application for acceptance and re-apply once independent legal advice has been obtained and a new agreement has been signed. The independent legal advice cannot just be provided after the old agreement was already signed - it must be provided before an agreement is signed. </p>

<p>Document the conversation on the Additional Registration Information window notepad. </p>

<p>Documents that cannot be accepted as a binding agreement may satisfy the criteria for acceptance as a limited agreement. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-02010010-03.html#bp03_L2GT_Requirements_of">Step 1 in the Requirements of limited child support agreements</a> table. Contact customers as a decision <a href="../separated-parents/277-02010010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Requirements_of01_Step01">must</a> be made to either proceed with a limited agreement or withdraw their application for acceptance of the agreement.</p>

<p>A binding agreement <strong>without</strong> a lump sum payment provision can be for any amount, and there does not need to be an existing administrative assessment. Go to step 2</p>

<p>If an agreement contains lump sum payment provisions, there must be an existing administrative assessment, and the amount of the lump sum must equal or exceed the current annual rate of the administrative assessment. An agreement with lump sum payment provisions cannot be an initiating agreement. Go to step 3.</p>

<p>Customers may apply for acceptance of a binding agreement without an existing child support assessment in place. If the agreement is accepted there will be no underlying assessment and therefore no child support will be payable when the agreement ends or if it is suspended due to a care change. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-18061455-01.html">Suspending or Ending a Child Support agreement due to care</a> and <a href="../separated-parents/277-02010040-01.html">Ending a child support agreement</a>.</p>

<p>In these initiating agreement cases, contact the customer who applied for acceptance of the agreement to advise that there will be no underlying administrative assessment of child support once their agreement ends or if it is suspended due to a care change. Give the customer the option of withdrawing their application to accept the agreement and resubmit it after the customer have applied for an administrative assessment and that assessment is in force.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> in this option, the customer must take specific actions to prevent the agreement being an initiating agreement. The customer cannot add on an application for an administrative assessment. They must withdraw their application to accept the agreement, and make an application for an administrative assessment and must wait until the administrative assessment is made and in force, before re-submitting an application to accept the agreement.</p>

<p>If the customer declines that option and wants to continue their application to accept the agreement, continue assessing the agreement. Tell the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
if the agreement is accepted it will be an initiating agreement, and </li>
		<li>
there will be no underlying assessment of child support once their agreement ends or if it is suspended due to a care change </li>
		</ul>
<p>Advise the customer this means if their agreement ends, a new application for an administrative assessment will be required to have a formula administrative assessment. If their agreement is suspended due to a care change, any party to the agreement may elect to end the assessment then apply for a formula based assessment in order for child support to be payable. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-18061455-01.html">Suspending or Ending a Child Support agreement due to care</a>.</p>

<p>If there is no existing administrative assessment, the Registrar must also be satisfied that the parties to the agreement are parents or eligible non-parent carers before a binding agreement can be accepted. The <a href="../separated-parents/277-02010010-04.html">References</a> page contains a link to the Child Support Guide 2.1.3 Parentage and 2.1.1 Applications for Assessment, Eligible carer.</p>

<p>In some circumstances, the agreement document itself may satisfy the presumption of parentage requirements under Section 29(2)(d) of the Child Support (Assessment) Act.

<p>As well as meeting the requirements of a binding agreement, lump sum binding agreements must also meet the following conditions&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
there must be an administrative assessment in place prior to the application for acceptance of the agreement being made </li>
		<li>
it must state the lump sum payment is to be credited against the amount payable under the liable parent’s <strong>liability</strong> under the administrative assessment </li>
		<li>
the amount of the lump sum payment is specified in the agreement </li>
		<li>
the amount of the lump sum must equal or exceed the current annual rate of the administrative assessment </li>
		<li>
the lump sum payment provisions may also state that the lump sum payment is to be credited by a nominated percentage. If not, it must be credited at 100% of the amount payable until the amount is exhausted</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>T</strong>he lump sum payment is credited against the payer's liability under CSRC Act section 69A (rather than reducing the annual rate of child support payable under the administrative assessment). As at 1 July each year, the remaining lump sum credit is indexed in accordance with changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

<p>If a binding agreement includes initialled changes, contact the parties and confirm whether the initialled changes were made before, or after receiving their independent legal advice. </p>

<p>If the initialled changes were <strong>made before receiving their legal advice</strong>, those changes should have been discussed with their <a href="../separated-parents/277-02010010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Requirements_of_1">legal practitioner</a>, and should be covered by the Legal Certificate completed by that practitioner.</p>

<p>If the initialled changes were made <strong>after receiving their legal advice and after</strong> <strong>the Legal Certificate was completed</strong>, they can only alter a binding agreement by seeking legal advice about the changes. Customers <strong>must</strong> consult their respective legal practitioners and obtain a new legal advice statement and <a class="extwebsitelink" href="https&#58;//www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/business/forms/cs4137">Legal Certificate</a> from their respective legal practitioner that addresses the changes before they initial any changes.</p>
