Information about exemptions for Child Support staff

Customers can apply for a full or partial exemption from taking
reasonable maintenance action if pursuing child support places them
and/or their family at risk of family and domestic violence.

Exemptions are granted by social workers and/or Indigenous Services
Officers (ISO) and can be granted before the customer applies for child
support or if an active child support case exists.

Circumstances where an exemption may be appropriate include:

-   a history of violence occurring between parties of a child support
    case
-   a paying parent has threatened the receiving parent and/or their
    immediate family (or another party to the child support case) with
    family and domestic violence if maintenance action for child support
    is pursued, or
-   if a customer fears that taking action for child support will result
    in another party to the child support case reacting with harm or
    violence towards them or their family

Note: customers who have been granted a full exemption and want to end
their case must make an election to end the child support case.

If a partial exemption is granted for family and domestic violence
reasons:

-   the customer is assessed (for FTB purposes) on the amount they are
    actually receiving instead of the amount assessed by Child Support
-   the customer is considered to be taking maintenance action
-   the case is placed into private collection, and
-   both customers continue to receive assessment notices
