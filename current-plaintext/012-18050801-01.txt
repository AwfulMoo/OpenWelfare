Section 19AB of the Health Insurance Act 1973

Section 19AB of the Health Insurance Act 1973 (the Act) imposes
restrictions on medical practitioners who did not obtain their primary
medical qualifications in Australia.

A medical practitioner subject to the restrictions of Section 19AB must
satisfy this section of the Act in addition to other legislation
applicable to the medical practitioner prior to accessing a Medicare
benefit.

Services Australia holds a number of 19AB class exemptions which can be
applied depending on the medical practitioner and location eligibility.

A medical practitioner may satisfy Section 19AB of the Act by the
application of a class exemption where the criteria of the class
exemption is met. Where a class exemption cannot be granted, an
application for a Section 19AB(3) exemption is made to the Department of
Health and Aged Care.
