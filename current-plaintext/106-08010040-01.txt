FPS status and reviews

The FPS process applies to customers who are in receipt of a designated
Australian payment and is used to issue claim forms and notices to
customers. FPS uses status codes to indicate the stages in the claim
process and also sets specific reviews to track the progress of a claim
from start to finish.

International Services (CIS) is responsible for processing all FPS
reviews.

The Process page contains a list of the various FPS Manual Follow-ups
(MFU) and action required.

The Resources page contains information on each FPS status and the
reviews that are set and links to the International Services homepage
and the International Program homepage.
