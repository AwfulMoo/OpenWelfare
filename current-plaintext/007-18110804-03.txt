Child never attended care – attendance status ‘Cancelled’

Child never attended care - attendance status ‘Processed’

Child did attend care – attendance status ‘Cancelled’

Child never attended care – attendance status ‘Cancelled’

Where a service has cancelled attendance data for a child, the
Department of Education views this as an admission from the service that
care was never provided. In this circumstance, any debts generated post
reconciliation by Services Australia against the customer’s account must
be recovered from the service (except for amounts paid directly to the
customer, for example tops up of Child Care Benefit (CCB)/ Child Care
Rebate (CCR), CCR Direct to Customer (DTC).

Scenario 1: Child never attended care – attendance status ‘Cancelled’

Table 1: This table provides the process when a customer has a debt
raised for CCB/CCR due to cancelled attendance and the child never
attended care.

Child never attended care - attendance status ‘Processed’

Families can become aware of a service using their CRN details to claim
benefits if a debt is raised for care that was never provided. Debts are
generally raised in this circumstance when a customer’s eligibility is
backdated to ‘ineligible’. Under these circumstances, the customer
should never have incurred a debt as care was not provided. As data has
been submitted, debts could be generated if the customer:

-   no longer has primary care of the child
-   has over estimated their income
-   has over estimated their level of activity

In these circumstances, as CCB and/or CCR has been paid to the service,
reconciliation attempts to recover the overpayment from the customer.

Scenario 2: Child never attended care - attendance status ‘Processed’

Table 2: This table provides the process when a customer contacts and
advises they have received a reconciliation debt but the child/ren never
attended the centre.

Child did attend care – attendance status ‘Cancelled’

Where a service has cancelled attendance data for a child and the
customer claims that care did in fact occur, any debts generated post
reconciliation by Services Australia against the customer’s account must
be recovered from the service. In these instances, the Department of
Education will contact the service and request for them to resubmit the
attendance data.

Scenario 3: Child did attend care – attendance status ‘Cancelled’

Table 3: This table provides the process when contacts and advises that
they have received a reconciliation debt due to cancelled attendance but
the child/children did attend the centre.
