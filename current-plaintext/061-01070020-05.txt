| 1                                 | PES customer leaves Australia to  |
|                                   | live in another country + Read    |
|                                   | more                              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Julie has been studying at        |
|                                   | University for the past 2 years   |
|                                   | and receiving PES. Julie has      |
|                                   | advised she is leaving Australia  |
|                                   | on December 4 to return to live   |
|                                   | in the USA. While payment would   |
|                                   | generally cease on departure due  |
|                                   | to the portability rules, Julie   |
|                                   | has advised that studies will     |
|                                   | cease on 20 November. Therefore   |
|                                   | PES will cease from 20 November   |
|                                   | rather than the date of           |
|                                   | departure.                        |

|                                   | Lou is attending University and   |
|                                   | receiving PES. Lou is required to |
|                                   | study part of the course in       |
|                                   | Germany from July to December.    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | At the end of this study Lou is   |
|                                   | planning on using the opportunity |
|                                   | to tour Europe prior to returning |
|                                   | to study in Australia from        |
|                                   | February the following year.      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Lou's PES is payable for the full |
|                                   | period of study. In addition, it  |
|                                   | can be paid for 6 weeks from the  |
|                                   | end of study in Germany. As long  |
|                                   | as Lou returns to Australia prior |
|                                   | to the end of the 6 weeks and     |
|                                   | remains enrolled to continue      |
|                                   | study the following year, the PES |
|                                   | will be payable for the full      |
|                                   | absence.                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If Lou was to have 2 weeks        |
|                                   | holiday in August during her      |
|                                   | study period in Germany and       |
|                                   | returned to Australia, the        |
|                                   | original portability decision     |
|                                   | would continue when she left      |
|                                   | Australia again to return to      |
|                                   | Germany. That is, payment would   |
|                                   | continue until the end of the     |
|                                   | course in December.               |

|                                   | receiving Parenting Payment (PP)  |
|                                   | and PES. Jonathan travelled to    |
|                                   | New Zealand to visit family from  |
|                                   | 10 January to 21 March for a      |
|                                   | total of 10 weeks.                |

|                                   | for 6 weeks and will suspend if   |
|                                   | Jonathan remains overseas. If     |
|                                   | Jonathan returns to Australia and |
|                                   | there is a gap in entitlement to  |
|                                   | the Parenting Payment, Jonathan   |
|                                   | will need to lodge a new claim    |
|                                   | for PES.                          |

|                                   | Peter is studying and receiving   |
|                                   | Carer Payment (CP) and PES. Peter |
|                                   | travelled to New Zealand to visit |
|                                   | family from 18 January to 22      |
|                                   | March for a total of 9 weeks.     |
|                                   | Peter's payment was stopped after |
|                                   | the 6 week maximum portability    |
|                                   | period for CP was exceeded. Peter |
|                                   | reclaimed PES when he returned to |
|                                   | Australia and it was granted.     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | In April, Peter decided to go     |
|                                   | back to New Zealand to visit      |
|                                   | family for Easter.                |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | As Peter had not been in          |
|                                   | Australia for 6 weeks since the   |
|                                   | return in March, Peter is not     |
|                                   | entitled to a new period of       |
|                                   | portability. This applies even    |
|                                   | though Peter had to re-claim PES. |
|                                   | Therefore, PES is not payable for |
|                                   | any part of the absence in April. |
