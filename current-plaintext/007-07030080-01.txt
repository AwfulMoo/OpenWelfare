This document outlines what to do when proof of a child's birth is
scanned to a customer's record.

Proof of a child's birth

Customers may provide proof of birth for a child:

for a family assistance or Paid Parental Leave scheme claim

to enrol them in:

-   Medicare
-   Medicare Safety Net
-   My Health Record, and
-   Australian Immunisation Register (AIR)

Proof of a child's birth can include:

Newborn Child Declaration (FA081) from the hospital or midwife for a
child born on or after 1 April 2015

Other acceptable proof of birth for a child to support a:

-   claim for payment or
-   Medicare Enrolment Application

[] A scanned image of just the Doctor/Midwife - Proof of Birth
declaration on the back page of the FA081 must be:

-   part of the 'Add Newborn' service (via Express Plus Centrelink app
    or online workflow), or
-   a claim for payment with the child's details and birth registration
    declaration. When lodged with the online claim or 'Add Newborn'
    workflow this is acceptable proof of birth

[] Customers may use Upload documents online to upload proof of birth.
If the customer has not also used the 'Add Newborn' service or has a
claim the FA081 must be:

-   complete,
-   signed, and
-   uploaded in full

Customers who are not using the online channels and are lodging the
FA081 must lodge a complete and signed FA081.

Despite what the customer states on the form, Centrelink and Medicare
can use this proof of birth. The Resources page contains examples.

Process when proof of birth received

If the customer (or their partner):

has not yet claimed payments, advise them of their potential entitlement
and how to make a claim

already has lodged a pre-birth claim that has been assessed pending
proof of birth, their claim can be finalised if they:

-   have provided proof of birth and completed the 'Add Newborn' service
    online, or
-   completed the FA081 in full (the 'Add Newborn' service is not
    available for Dad and Partner Pay (DAP) claims)

A letter from an agency confirming proof of birth for a foster care
child is not proof of birth. It can be proof of a change in care.

Validation of serial numbers

The Newborn Child Declaration (FA081) and Claim for Bereavement Payment
(FA008) include a unique serial number. This helps Services Australia to
detect potential fraud.

The customer records the serial number online. A data load error occurs
if the serial number is:

-   duplicate
-   invalid, or
-   outside issued number range

Check or record the serial number on the Change Child (CCH) screen.

Cross check the serial numbers between the CCH screen and the form. If
the number on the CCH screen is:

-   incorrect, enter the correct number. If this number does not return
    an error message, continue processing
-   correct but the error remains on the CCH screen, Service Officers
    cannot process the claim. Refer the Customer Reference Number (CRN)
    to the Families and Child Care - Business Process Branch. Mark it
    'URGENT'
