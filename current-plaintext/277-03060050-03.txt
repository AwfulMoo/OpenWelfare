Disputed care

If customers are advising of a potential disputed care situation or a
disagreement about care, transfer the customer to the Integrated Care
Team, see Customer referral guidelines for Child Support staff. An
Integrated Care Service Officer will manage customers who disagree about
their care or who are advising of disputed care. See the Background page
in Integrated Care for information about roles and responsibilities.

Table 1: this table contains details for determining if care is
disagreed or disputed.
