Onasemnogene abeparvovec (Zolgensma®) pharmacy payment arrangements

The total DPMQ for Zolgensma is $2,527,773.87. Pharmacies will be paid 2
separate payments:

-   $97,773.87 towards the price of Zolgensma via the regular claiming
    and payment arrangements via PBS Online, and
-   a separate bulk adjustment completed by the agency to pay the
    remaining balance of $2,430,000.00 outside of PBS Online. This is
    expected within 5 working days

This means there will be a discrepancy in the amount the Agency pays
through PBS Online and the listed price. The $97,773.87 payment will
show on the PBS Payment advice and a separate PBS adjustment notice with
the amount of $2,430,000.00 will be posted to impacted pharmacies via
Australia Post.

Pharmacies do not need to manually claim the remainder of this amount.
The agency will monitor claims for Zolgensma to make sure payments are
made in a timely manner. These arrangements should be in place until 1
October 2023.
