This document outlines the definition and assessment of a customer whose
partner is in prison. While the partner is in prison, their cost of
living will increase. Although they still consider themselves married or
a member of a couple, treat them as partnered (partner in prison) until
their partner is released.

Payments for a couple separated due to partner in prison

A customer whose partner is in prison maybe eligible to receive the
following extra assistance:

-   A higher rate of payment. Certain allowance and pension customers
    may receive the equivalent of the single rate of payment
-   Single rate of Pharmaceutical Allowance (PhA), where applicable
-   Single rate of Pension Supplement, where applicable
-   Single rate of Rent Assistance (RA)

Note: although a customer whose partner is in prison may be paid a
higher rate of payment, equivalent to the single rate of payment, the
assessment will still take into account the combined income and assets
as if they were a regular member of a couple.

After entering the appropriate ‘partner in gaol’ relationship qualifier
code on the Marital Status (MS) screen, the records of the customer and
their partner will continue to be linked and correctly display as a
‘member of a couple’ (i.e. married, registered or de facto).

Customer’s partner in an Immigration Detention Centre

A person detained in an Immigration Detention Centre is not the same as
a person in gaol. If the customer's partner is being detained in an
Immigration Detention Centre, the:

-   customer is not eligible for the 'Partner in Gaol' rate
-   Marital Status (MS) screen must not have the GAP/GAC relationship
    qualifier code recorded on the customer's and partner's record

It may however, be appropriate to consider whether there is a 'special
reason' to not treat the customer as a member of a couple under Section
24 of the Social Security Act 1991 due to the cancellation of a
partner's visa. See Treatment of a partnered person as single under
Section 24 new determinations.

Austudy, Youth Allowance (YS) and ABSTUDY customers

There are no provisions within the relevant legislation or policy to pay
an Austudy, YA or ABSTUDY customer a special rate of payment when their
partner is in prison. If the customer still considers themselves to be a
member of a couple, they will continue to receive the partnered rate.

Carer Payment (CP) and Carer Allowance (CA) customers

If the customer is the carer of the imprisoned partner, the customer's
qualification for payment may continue and the temporary cessation of
care provisions applied. See:

-   Temporary Cessation of Care (respite) provisions for Carer Payment
    (CP) and Carer Allowance (CA)
-   Care receiver is absent from the caring situation, and
-   Coding a one-off absence for Carer Allowance (CA)/Carer Payment (CP)
    when the care receiver is absent

Rent Assistance

The Rent Assistance (RA) thresholds and maximum rate payable will depend
on a customer's circumstances. Customers who are partnered and who have
to live apart due to their partner being in prison (temporarily
separated) may be paid

-   RA the single rate, or
-   RA at the single with child/ren rate when paid with Family Tax
    Benefit (FTB)

Concession Card

The customer's Concession Card entitlement remains the same, except for
the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card (CSHC). See Commonwealth Senior
Health Card for more information.
