+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Customer not subject to former    |
|                                   | resident provisions               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Generally, a customer who:        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   has been overseas long term   |
|                                   |     whilst in receipt of DSP      |
|                                   | -   then returns to Australia and |
|                                   |     transfers to Age Pension      |
|                                   |     while in Australia            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | will not normally be subject to   |
|                                   | the former resident provisions    |
|                                   | even if they leave Australia      |
|                                   | within 2 years of the return to   |
|                                   | Australia. This is because these  |
|                                   | customers have not normally       |
|                                   | returned to Australia as a        |
|                                   | permanent resident and so do not  |
|                                   | satisfy the former resident rules |
|                                   | (which only apply if the customer |
|                                   | resumes residence prior to the    |
|                                   | transfer).                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the customer did return for    |
|                                   | residence consider the            |
|                                   | portability conditions attached   |
|                                   | to the previous payment paid      |
|                                   | during the earlier absence:       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   If that payment was portable  |
|                                   |     indefinitely and the customer |
|                                   |     remained continuously         |
|                                   |     qualified for payment until   |
|                                   |     the transfer to Age Pension   |
|                                   |     then the customer is not      |
|                                   |     subject to the former         |
|                                   |     resident provisions. This is  |
|                                   |     because the customer has not  |
|                                   |     gained an advantage by        |
|                                   |     returning to Australia (their |
|                                   |     payment was already portable  |
|                                   |     indefinitely) and it is       |
|                                   |     accepted that the customer    |
|                                   |     has not returned to reside in |
|                                   |     Australia purely to gain an   |
|                                   |     indefinitely portable payment |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 2                                 | Customer subject to former        |
|                                   | resident provisions               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the previous payment was not   |
|                                   | portable indefinitely when the    |
|                                   | customer returned for residence   |
|                                   | (or if they lost qualification    |
|                                   | whilst in Australia and were      |
|                                   | subsequently re-granted) then the |
|                                   | customer is subject to the former |
|                                   | resident provisions. This is      |
|                                   | because by transferring to Age    |
|                                   | Pension the customer has gained   |
|                                   | access to what would otherwise be |
|                                   | an indefinitely portable payment. |

Examples

Customers subject to or not subject to former resident provisions

Table 3: This table contains examples relating to information where
customers are subject to or not subject to former resident provisions.

| 1                                 | A DSP customer was granted        |
|                                   | indefinite portability under SSA  |
|                                   | 1218AAA (severe impairment) and   |
|                                   | left Australia to live in another |
|                                   | country. Some years later the     |
|                                   | customer decided to return to     |
|                                   | Australia as a resident, and      |
|                                   | shortly afterwards qualified for  |
|                                   | and was transferred to Age        |
|                                   | Pension.                          |

|                                   | If that customer decides to leave |
|                                   | Australia within 2 years of the   |
|                                   | recent return they will not be    |
|                                   | subject to the former resident    |
|                                   | provisions. This is because their |
|                                   | DSP was indefinitely portable at  |
|                                   | the date of return, and           |
|                                   | qualification has been maintained |
|                                   | through to the transfer to Age    |
|                                   | Pension. The customer has not     |
|                                   | gained access to an indefinitely  |
|                                   | portable payment because they     |
|                                   | already had that access.          |

|                                   | period under s1218AA(3). The      |
|                                   | customer decided to return to     |
|                                   | Australia as a resident whilst    |
|                                   | still in pay, and shortly         |
|                                   | afterwards qualified for and was  |
|                                   | transferred to Age Pension.       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If that customer decides to leave |
|                                   | Australia within 2 years of the   |
|                                   | recent return they will be        |
|                                   | subject to the former resident    |
|                                   | provisions. This is because their |
|                                   | DSP was not indefinitely portable |
|                                   | at the date of return, even       |
|                                   | though qualification has been     |
|                                   | maintained through to the         |
|                                   | transfer to Age Pension. The      |
|                                   | former resident provisions act to |
|                                   | prevent the customer regaining    |
|                                   | the access to an indefinitely     |
|                                   | portable payment that they lost.  |

| 3                                 | A DSP customer was granted        |
|                                   | indefinite portability under      |
|                                   | pre-2004 legislation and that     |
|                                   | indefinite portability is 'saved' |
|                                   | whilst they live in another       |
|                                   | country. Some years later the     |
|                                   | customer decided to return to     |
|                                   | Australia as a resident, and      |
|                                   | shortly afterwards qualified for  |
|                                   | and was transferred to Age        |
|                                   | Pension. The customer lost their  |
|                                   | '1 July 2004 savings provision'   |
|                                   | and thereby any future access to  |
|                                   | indefinite portability of DSP on  |
|                                   | their date of return.             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If that customer decides to leave |
|                                   | Australia within 2 years of the   |
|                                   | recent return they will not be    |
|                                   | subject to the former resident    |
|                                   | provisions. This is because their |
|                                   | DSP was indefinitely portable at  |
|                                   | the date of return for residence, |
|                                   | and qualification has been        |
|                                   | maintained through to the         |
|                                   | transfer to Age Pension. The      |
|                                   | customer has not gained access to |
|                                   | an indefinitely portable payment  |
|                                   | because they already had that     |
|                                   | access.                           |

|                                   | BVA was subject to former         |

|                                   | This meant that if a person was   |

|                                   | (prior to the payments closing 20 |
