This document outlines information about Income Management reviews for
the Child Protection and Supporting People at Risk measures.

Customer reviews

Customers are to have a review of their Income Management:

-   when a Work Item has been raised that indicates a customer’s Income
    Management should be reviewed due to a change in circumstances
-   at the customer’s request

Referring authority reviews

Reviews of Income Management are also held between Services Australia
and Income Management referring authorities:

-   a State or Territory Child Protection Authority
-   an approved referring authority for Supporting People at Risk Income
    Management

For customers income managed under the Child Protection and Supporting
People at Risk measures of Income Management, an Income Management
Contact Officer will conduct a review of a customer’s Income Management
with the referring authority:

-   35 days prior to the end of the Income Management period
-   prior to the customer's notice being revoked (pre-exit review)
-   when requested by the referring authority. This request may be
    prompted by a Change in Circumstances notification which is
    automatically received by the referring authority via the Unified
    Government Gateway (UGG) for Child Protection and Supporting People
    at Risk
