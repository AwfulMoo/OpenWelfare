This document outlines how to view Programme Assurance reports for Third
Party Organisations (TPO) after the review, or re-review of
non-compliance has been completed.

Programme Assurance Review report

A reviewer completes a Programme Assurance Review report whenever they
conduct a Programme Assurance review or re-review for a TPO.

Reports include the questions asked of the TPO and any notes made, as
well as any breaches and documents uploaded as part of the original
review. Reports also include results of a Post Approval Discussion
(PAD), Rent Deduction Scheme (RDS) Review or General activities (GND)
and Education/Support and Training reviews (EST).

Once Programme Assurance Review reports are finalised, they cannot be
amended.

If an error is made, the review can be deleted. Send a request to the
Deduction and Confirmation Branch DAC Programme Assurance and Reporting
team.
