|                                   | Discuss with the carer the        |
|                                   | reasons for the request. Note:    |
|                                   | most requests from carers would   |
|                                   | be considered reasonable, and     |
|                                   | therefore normally accepted.      |

|                                   | within 21 days a reminder letter  |
|                                   | is sent with no forms enclosed.   |

|                                   | a maximum of 28 days.             |

|                                   | It is possible to defer both the  |
|                                   | reminder letter (the              |
|                                   | 'reminder/request contact stage') |
|                                   | and the cancellation stage.       |
|                                   | However, it is only possible to   |
|                                   | defer both for 28 days in total - |
|                                   | for example, if the reminder      |
|                                   | stage is deferred by 15 days, the |
|                                   | cancellation stage is only able   |
|                                   | to be deferred by 13 days.        |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | If the request is not reasonable  |
|                                   | or acceptable, advise the carer   |
|                                   | and record the details in a DOC   |
|                                   | including reasons why extension   |
|                                   | has not been approved.            |

|                                   | Note: most requests from carers   |
|                                   | would be considered reasonable,   |
|                                   | and therefore normally accepted.  |
