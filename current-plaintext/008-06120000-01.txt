This document provides an overview of the responsibilities of the
Assessment Services Branch in completing an Employment Service
Assessment (ESAt).

ESAt types and purpose

An ESAt assesses the impact of barriers and medical conditions on a
customer's ability to comply with mutual obligations and participate in
work or Employment Services Provider programs of support. At the ESAt
interview, Assessors collect information from the customer to make an
appropriate onward referral to Employment Service Provider and to
determine the level of participation required for customers with mutual
obligations.

There are 2 types of ESAt:

-   non-medical ESAt determines the correct Employment Service Provider
    when the customer has no medical conditions
-   medical ESAt determines work capacity and the correct Employment
    Service Provider when a customer has medical conditions

An ESAt is used to:

-   decide the participation required for customers with mutual
    obligation requirements in accordance with the Social Security Act
    1991
-   decide current work capacity of customers receiving Disability
    Support Pension (DSP) who are under 35 years of age or wish to be
    linked to an Employment Services Provider
-   inform the agency's decisions on payments and allowances, such as
    Mobility Allowance, or Youth Disability Supplement
-   determine eligibility for Disability Employment Services (DES) and
    Workforce Australia services
-   assisting Employment Services Providers to provide services to
    individual job seekers

Information contained in a ESAt report

Medical Conditions

This includes details of whether the condition is temporary or
permanent.

Work capacity in bandwidth hours

Work capacity in bandwidth hours determines what current and potential
work hours the customer is able to perform. It decides how the
functional impacts of a customer's medical condition(s) affect their
ability to work. Service Officers use the work capacity information in
the ESAt report to determine if the customer has:

-   any Temporary Reduced Work Capacity (TRWC),
-   Partial Capacity to Work (PCW), or
-   Continuing Inability to Work (CITW)

Support Requirements

Identifies the type and duration of support the customer requires to
work as a result of their medical condition(s).

Vocational and non-vocational barriers and corresponding interventions

Barriers to employment can be any factor affecting a customer's ability
to:

-   find employment
-   retain or maintain employment
-   undertake certain types of work
-   undertake certain hours of work (medical barriers only)
-   undertake job search activities, or
-   undertake other activities that may improve their ability to work

Interventions that assist customers to overcome their barriers to
workforce participation are identified. It is reasonable to expect that
customers referred for an assessment have at least 1 barrier to
employment. Customers looking for work with no (or very limited)
barriers to employment are either:

-   referred by Services Australia to an Employment Services Provider
    for immediate assistance, or
-   approach a Workforce Australia Provider independently and may not
    require an ESAt

Risk of non-compliance ratings and suggested Vulnerability Indicator
categories

Where the referral reason is participation failure, Assessors must
record the specific information in the Risk of Non-Compliance section.

Onward referral

Employment Services Assessment may recommend referrals to:

-   Workforce Australia Online
-   Workforce Australia Services
-   Workforce Australia Transition to Work
-   Disability Employment Services (DES)
-   customers assessed as 'Unable to benefit' (where upgraded to a Job
    Capacity Assessment (JCA)

ESSWeb

ESSWeb 1.0 and ESSWeb 2.0 are web-based applications which provide
access for Department of Education, Skills and Employment programs
administered through Services Australia and Department of Education,
Skills and Employment -funded Employment Services Providers. ESSWeb 1.0
and ESSWeb 2.0 are used to create and update service requirements for:

-   Job Plans
-   Job Capacity Assessments (JCA)
-   Employment Services Assessments (ESAt)
-   Disability Support Services (DES)
-   Workforce Australia/Community Development Program (CDP)
-   Information sharing to and from Services Australia for payment
    determinations

The Resources page contains information that outlines work capacity,
referral outcomes, Employment Services Provider referrals and the risk
of non-compliance as well as contact details for Assessment Services.
