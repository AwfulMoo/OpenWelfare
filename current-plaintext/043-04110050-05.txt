|                                   | John is single, 35 years old and  |
|                                   | works at the local meat works.    |
|                                   | Four years ago, John's sibling    |
|                                   | Sally received severe brain       |
|                                   | injuries as a result of a motor   |
|                                   | vehicle accident. Sally received  |
|                                   | a large compensation settlement   |
|                                   | which was placed in a trust.      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | John's widowed parent Alice, aged |
|                                   | 70, looks after Sally. Because    |
|                                   | Sally is unable to manage their   |
|                                   | own financial affairs, Alice has  |
|                                   | official control over the money   |
|                                   | in the trust. Alice               |
|                                   | conscientiously administers the   |
|                                   | fund for Sally's exclusive        |
|                                   | benefit.                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Alice is concerned about losing   |
|                                   | the pension, as it is the only    |
|                                   | source of income. Alice visits    |
|                                   | the local Centrelink office and   |
|                                   | sees a Financial Information      |
|                                   | Service (FIS) Officer. Alice is   |
|                                   | relieved to learn that the income |
|                                   | and assets from the trust will    |
|                                   | not affect the pension as the     |
|                                   | trust funds originated for, and   |
|                                   | are used for, Sally's benefit.    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Alice is not getting any younger  |
|                                   | and is also concerned that one    |
|                                   | day control of the trust will be  |
|                                   | handed over to John. John's job   |
|                                   | is a bit shaky and in the past    |
|                                   | has spent periods of time on      |
|                                   | income support payments. Alice is |
|                                   | relieved to find out that if John |
|                                   | has to take over the management   |
|                                   | of the trust John would still be  |
|                                   | able to get government help, if   |
|                                   | required, provided the trust      |
|                                   | funds continue to be used for     |
|                                   | Sally's exclusive benefit.        |
