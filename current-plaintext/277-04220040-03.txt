|                                   | payment obligations imposed by    |

|                                   | of the following:                 |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   |     the Respondent                |
|                                   | -   any other payments collected  |
|                                   |     by administrative means       |
|                                   | -   any variations to the         |
|                                   |     liability resulting from the  |
|                                   |     lodgement of tax returns or   |
|                                   |     other case events, and        |
|                                   | -   any intercepted tax refund    |

|                                   | If the Debt Enforcement SO5 is    |
|                                   | unsure of how to allocate         |
|                                   | payments, contact the Respondent  |
|                                   | to confirm the intention of the   |
|                                   | payment.                          |

|                                   | Each payment or variation to the  |
|                                   | liability must be attributed to   |
|                                   | either the payments required      |
|                                   | pursuant to the orders or to the  |
|                                   | ongoing liability. This will      |
|                                   | allow the Debt Enforcement SO5 to |
|                                   | determine whether the Respondent: |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   has complied with the orders, |
|                                   |     or                            |
|                                   | -   has defaulted on the orders   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | and                               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   has satisfied the ongoing     |
|                                   |     liability since the date of   |
|                                   |     the orders, or                |
|                                   | -   failed to satisfy the ongoing |
|                                   |     liability since the date of   |
|                                   |     the orders                    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | In some instances, the Respondent |
|                                   | may have defaulted on the orders  |
|                                   | and also failed to pay the        |
|                                   | ongoing liability.                |

|                                   | Note: a Respondent’s failure to   |
|                                   | pay the monthly ongoing liability |
|                                   | results in the creation of a new  |
|                                   | debt. The new debt does not form  |
|                                   | part of the enforcement           |
|                                   | proceeding and as such cannot be  |
|                                   | generally enforced pursuant to    |
|                                   | the final orders.                 |

|                                   | Although the agency is aware the  |
|                                   | ongoing liability cannot form the |
|                                   | subject of orders made in an      |
|                                   | enforcement proceedings, as it is |
|                                   | not a debt at the date of the     |
|                                   | orders, the notation that the     |
|                                   | Respondent is required to pay the |

|                                   | an effort to draw the             |
|                                   | Respondent's attention to the     |
|                                   | fact they should continue to meet |
|                                   | their ongoing liability to avoid  |
|                                   | further proceedings being brought |
|                                   | against them.                     |

|                                   | obligations pursuant to the       |

|                                   | way. For example, by taking steps |

|                                   | debt in a lump sum.               |

|                                   | orders, the Debt Enforcement SO5  |
|                                   | must consider any available       |
|                                   | default provisions which may      |
