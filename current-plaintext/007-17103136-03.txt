|                                   | ACC will create a Social Online   |

|                                   |     review of a decision about    |

|                                   |     is taken not to have been     |
|                                   |     made. The customer can ask    |
|                                   |     for a review of the decision  |
|                                   |     which made the claim not      |
|                                   |     effective. If the claim is    |
|                                   |     still found to be not         |

|                                   |     need to be lodged. A new      |
|                                   |     claim is made not effective   |
|                                   |     if requested documents were   |
