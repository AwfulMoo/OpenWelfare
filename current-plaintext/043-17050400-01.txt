Initiate payment procedure - batching

Once a claim is accepted, it goes through a payment initiation process
called batching. This occurs daily.

Interest may be payable on claims paid outside of 30 days from receipt.
Only interest of $100 or more is payable.

Return payment from batch

Payments can be recalled when in the 'Pending Payment' stage, when:

-   the Adjusted Lodgement Date (ALD) needs correcting/adjusting
-   the claim needs correcting
-   incorrect bank details are recorded, or
-   there are system issue

Rejected direct credit procedure

An error in account details may cause a financial institution to reject
the payment. For example an incorrect BSB, account number or name.
