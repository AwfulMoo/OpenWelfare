|                                   | as 0 in the provider data for     |
|                                   | defined income streams. Ignore    |
|                                   | this relevant number. This is     |
|                                   | because the provider does not     |
|                                   | report the relevant number for    |
|                                   | defined benefit income streams.   |

|                                   | The system will calculate the     |
|                                   | appropriate relevant number when  |
|                                   | a defined benefit product is      |
|                                   | coded on the system.              |

|                                   | instances. If the number differs  |
|                                   | from what is recorded within the  |
|                                   | income stream product, ignore the |
|                                   | warning and rely on the coding.   |

|                                   | previously was also $0 and the    |

|                                   | further investigation is needed   |
|                                   | to decide the correct tax free    |
|                                   | component amount and tax free     |

|                                   | benefit began to receive the      |
|                                   | income, rather than the start     |
|                                   | date of the original product.     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If this occurs, the start date in |
|                                   | the provider data should not be   |
|                                   | used and the start date of the    |
|                                   | original product should be        |
|                                   | retained.                         |

|                                   | will need to be coded before the  |
|                                   | latest Date of Event (DOV). The   |
|                                   | system will not allow a product   |
