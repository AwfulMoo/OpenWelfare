This document explains how to assess and process the ABSTUDY Change of
Circumstances/Enquiries Sheet (SY053).

When to use this form

Service Officers may issue the ABSTUDY Change of Circumstances/Enquires
Sheet (SY053) when a customer wants to advise Services Australia of a
change of circumstance.

Customers may advise a change in circumstance:

-   verbally (for example, over the phone) and
-   using self service portals

Issue a SY053 if the customer:

-   knows in advance of a change but are not sure of the exact details.
    For example, a change of address
-   prefers to notify of changes in writing rather than verbally or via
    self service

Service Officers can issue the form to third parties such as partners,
parents, or others if they need to supply details about the student's
circumstances.

Students can advise of a change in their study details, by [] using
Manage study details online or via the study details section of the
Express Plus Centrelink mobile app if they are registered for online
accounts and are authenticated.

Processing

ABSTUDY Smart Centre Processing Teams process ABSTUDY claims. See
Processing arrangements for ABSTUDY claims and enquiries for more
information.
