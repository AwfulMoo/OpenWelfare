| 2                                 | What if the YA customer is over   |
|                                   | 18 and the parent or partner does |
|                                   | not have permission to enquire?   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the situation is such that     |
|                                   | implied authority cannot be used, |
|                                   | Services Australia can still      |
|                                   | receive information from the      |
|                                   | parent/partner. However, as with  |
|                                   | other third parties that do not   |
|                                   | have permission to enquire, when  |
|                                   | the agency accepts personal       |
|                                   | information from this source,     |
|                                   | staff should be careful not to    |
|                                   | disclose information about the    |
|                                   | customer to the third party.      |
