This document outlines how to determine whether payments of periodic
compensation are to be treated as direct deduction or ordinary income
for a compensation recipient.

On this Page:

Direct deduction

Treat periodic compensation as a direct deduction for the recipient if
on the accident or incident date:

-   the compensation recipient is not qualified for and receiving a
    compensation affected payment (CAP)
-   the compensation recipients payment is suspended or paid at a nil
    rate on the incident date

To calculate the excess to affect their partner's rate of payment:

-   Assess the periodic compensation as a dollar for dollar rate
    reduction
-   Treat the excess compensation payment as the partner's ordinary
    income

Ordinary income

Treat periodic compensation as ordinary income if the compensation
recipient was in receipt of and qualified for a CAP on the incident
date.

If the compensation recipient does not claim a CAP apply the beneficial
approach when calculating their partner's rate.

If the partner is in receipt of a saved compensation affected payment
(SCAP) the compensation is treated beneficially.

If the compensation recipient claims and cannot be paid due to direct
deductions, any excess compensation is ignored when assessing a
partner's SCAP.

Consider the customers eligibility for a Low Income Health Care Card
(LIC) or Commonwealth Senior Health Card (CSHC), if a customer and/or
their partner cannot be paid a CAP because of:

-   direct deduction or
-   partner excess periodic compensation

Coding or changing system defaults

Only staff in the Compensation Recovery Team (CRT) can set up arrears
and new ongoing periodic payment details. Once completed, all other
staff can update periodic compensation payments on an existing record.
Staff outside the CRT will need to request CMS02 access through
mySupport to update compensation periodic payments.
