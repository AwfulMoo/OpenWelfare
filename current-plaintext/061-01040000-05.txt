| Item                              | Example                           |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | DSP portability                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Shara receives DSP and is not     |
|                                   | considered to be severely         |
|                                   | disabled. Shara has been living   |
|                                   | overseas in Fiji for the past 10  |
|                                   | years and has been portable for   |
|                                   | the full time as since being      |
|                                   | granted DSP prior to 12 November  |
|                                   | 1991.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | As Shara was overseas on 1 July   |
|                                   | 2004 the payment will continue to |
|                                   | be payable indefinitely under the |
|                                   | 1 July 2004 savings provision. If |
|                                   | Shara returns to Australia for    |
|                                   | residence after 1 July 2004, the  |
|                                   | saved status will be lost. If     |
|                                   | Shara then returns to Fiji to     |
|                                   | live, DSP will cease from         |
|                                   | departure from Australia. If      |
|                                   | Shara goes overseas temporarily,  |
|                                   | DSP will only be paid for a       |
|                                   | maximum portability period of     |
|                                   | four weeks in a 12 month period.  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If Shara returns to Australia for |
|                                   | a temporary visit to see the      |
|                                   | children, the payment will be     |
|                                   | portable indefinitely on return   |
|                                   | to Fiji. However, Shara is not    |
|                                   | entitled to any add-ons or        |
|                                   | concession cards during the       |
|                                   | visit.                            |
