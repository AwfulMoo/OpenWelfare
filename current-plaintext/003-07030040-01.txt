This document outlines how to assess Crisis Payment (CrP) claims for
customers soon to be released from prison or psychiatric confinement.

Timeframe for claim

Under this category, a claim for CrP may be made up to 21 days before
the customer's expected release date. A claim will be granted where the
person:

-   has been charged with committing an offence
-   spent 14 or more days in prison or psychiatric confinement as a
    result of being charged
-   is expected to be released within 21 days, and
-   is expected to be qualified for both the primary payment and the CrP
    on their anticipated release date

Only Prison Liaison Officers can undertake pre-release claims and
assessments.

One claim per circumstance

Only 1 CrP can be made for the same circumstances.

For example if a customer is paid CrP under the Social Security Act
1991, then becomes an ABSTUDY customer, they cannot claim another CrP
under ABSTUDY policy for the same circumstances.

Method of payment

The preferred method of payment is New Payments Platform (NPP), Real
Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) or direct credit.

Other assistance and services

If a claimant is not eligible for CrP, offer any other assistance or
specialist service that may be available to them.

The Resources page contains links to contact details, prison servicing
information and contacts, rejection codes and reasons, error and warning
messages, forms, information for staff on prison release, intranet links
and external websites.
