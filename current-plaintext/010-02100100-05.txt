|                                   | (excluded). Both missed part of   |

|                                   | and then travelled by air from    |
|                                   | Darwin to Kununurra. The students |
|                                   | failed to present for their       |

|                                   | parents from Kununurra and driven |
|                                   | home. This resulted in both       |
