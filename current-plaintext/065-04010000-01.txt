This document outlines how a customer can be assessed for Age Pension
(Blind).

Assessment of Age Pension (Blind)

Transfer provisions apply to customers currently receiving most social
security payments when they are eligible to transfer to Age Pension and
have meet the social security definition of permanent blindness. See
Qualification for Age Pension (Blind). Customers are subject to
comparable foreign payment requirements if they were born overseas or
lived overseas.

This procedure also applies to customers currently receiving Age Pension
who wish to have their rate assessed under Age Pension (Blind)
provisions. The date of effect in such instances is the date the
customer requests this assessment, provided they are qualified on that
date and they submit verification of blindness within a reasonable time.

Customers entitled to Age Pension (Blind) do not need to disclose their
income and assets unless:

-   they are claiming Rent Assistance (RA), or
-   their partner is receiving or applying for an income and assets to
    correctly assess their rate of payment

In these cases customers need to complete an Income and Assets form
(SA369).

Note: a claim is not needed if the customer is currently receiving Age
Pension.

Verification of blindness

Verification is required to determine if the customer can be assessed as
permanently blind, except for customers already in receipt of Disability
Support Pension (Blind).

The customer must provide a report from their treating ophthalmologist.

A Request for Ophthalmologist or Optometrist Report (SA013) is
preferred. However, any report which provides the information requested
by the SA013 is acceptable.

An optometrist can complete the report but it must be clearly stated it
is supported by a report from an ophthalmologist and details about the
ophthalmologist are provided. The local blind society may also be able
to help with information provided by an ophthalmologist that measures
the customer’s visual acuity under the Snellen Scale.

Not currently receiving an income support payment

Customers who do not have a Centrelink record and/or do not currently
receive an income support payment need to claim Age Pension to be
assessed for Age Pension (Blind). See Qualification for Age Pension
(Blind).

Letters

Customers in receipt of Age Pension (Blind) can choose to receive their
Centrelink letters in an alternative format.
