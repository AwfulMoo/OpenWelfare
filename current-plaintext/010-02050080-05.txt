|                                   | John was paid $633.50 Incidentals |
|                                   | Allowance for a full year course  |
|                                   | at TAFE. John decided to enrol in |

|                                   | whilst still studying the full    |
|                                   | year course. As the courses are   |
|                                   | being undertaken simultaneously,  |
|                                   | John is entitled to another       |

|                                   | This is because Axel completed    |

|                                   | commenced a new course.           |

|                                   | course. Axel dropped out of       |
|                                   | studies early in February and     |
|                                   | enrols in a 3 year degree. Axel   |

|                                   | the new course. This is because   |
|                                   | Axel did not complete the         |
|                                   | previous course, and had already  |
|                                   | got Incidentals Allowance for the |
|                                   | non-completed course. The system  |
|                                   | calculates the balance owed to    |
