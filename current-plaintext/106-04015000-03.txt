|                                   | In Germany, federal legislation   |
|                                   | needs the compulsory payment of   |
|                                   | social security contributions     |
|                                   | usually through deductions from   |
|                                   | paid employment. The pension      |
|                                   | insurance covers most workers and |
|                                   | the self-employed.                |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | against disability and death and  |
|                                   | provides for income in the form   |
|                                   | of a pension once the person      |
|                                   | reaches retirement age.           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Separate legislation also         |
|                                   | provides insurance for            |
|                                   | unemployment, work-related        |
|                                   | accidents and health and          |
|                                   | long-term care requirements. A    |
|                                   | social assistance scheme provides |
|                                   | support for those with low        |
|                                   | income.                           |

|                                   | The legislation is the            |
|                                   | responsibility of the German      |
|                                   | federal government but            |
|                                   | administration and payment of     |
|                                   | pensions is the responsibility of |
|                                   | the centralised German funds.     |

Coding details - Survivor Pensions - Hinterbliebenenrenten (SUR)

Table 6: This table contains how to code details of Survivor Pensions
(SUR).

Note:

SUR pensions may be paid at a higher rate for up to 2 years from grant,
then may drop to a lower rate or cease altogether. A manual review must
be set for 2 years after grant to review the rate

Orphan pensions are coded as SUR if paid direct to the person who is
entitled, or if paid to the parent of a child who is entitled but is not
a dependent child
