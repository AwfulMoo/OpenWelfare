Online Messaging for customers

Where a customer has not provided correct Medicare details for their
child or a customer is receiving FTB for a child that is not up to date
with immunisation requirements, (Immunisation status of 'N') the
following messaging will appear in their online services:

-   Customers where incorrect Medicare information is provided for their
    child:

'You need to provide (child's name) correct Medicare number, child
reference number (IRN) and date of birth. We cannot check (child's name)
immunisation status with the Australian Immunisation Register.'

-   Customers receiving FTB for a child with an established link with
    the AIR and the child is not up to date with immunisation
    requirements (Immunisation status of 'N'):

'Your payments will be affected as your child does not meet immunisation
requirements. Please contact your vaccination provider or general
practitioner to update your child's immunisation record.'

AIR Mismatch codes

Families Override Staff Note:

When viewing the Medicare portal if individual registration source is
listed as ACIR SIN Claim this generally indicates the child received
vaccinations but is not yet enrolled in Medicare. For more information
see Merge or match individual records and SIN records in Australian
Immunisation Register (AIR).

Where a child is not linked and no mismatch code is present, the GP
Warning and Suggested Action will display 'Send a link request to AIR by
entering the child's Medicare number using the MEI screen'.

procedure warning text and suggested Centrelink Service Officer action
according to the presenting reason code. Once the reason code has been
