monotherapy or dual therapy application, where available:

-   RHC composite assessment, and
-   ECHO composite assessment, and
-   6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT)

Monotherapy, dual therapy and triple therapy options

Monotherapy – refers to treatment with a single PAH agent.

Dual Therapy – refers to treatment with a combination of PAH agents. For
the purposes of PBS subsidy, dual therapy requires a phosphodiesterase-5
inhibitor (PDE-5i) administered in combination with either an endothelin
receptor antagonist (ERA), or a prostanoid.

-   Approved PDE-5i’s include sildenafil citrate and tadalafil
-   Approved ERA’s include ambrisentan, bosentan monohydrate and
    macitentan
-   Approved prostanoids include epoprostenol sodium and iloprost
    trometamol

Note: dual therapy with a PDE-5i and a prostanoid is only available for
patients who:

-   Currently have WHO Functional Class IV PAH, or
-   Have received prior PBS subsidised PAH treatment with any PAH agent,
    as either monotherapy or dual therapy treatment

Triple Therapy – refers to treatment with a combination of PAH agents.
For the purposes of PBS subsidy, triple therapy requires either:

-   the combined use of selexipag, an ERA and a PDE-5i
-   the combined use of selexipag and either an ERA or a PDE-5i, in
    cases where a patient cannot receive all 3 agents for clinical
    reasons

Approved ERAs and PDE-5is for triple therapy are the same as the
approved dual therapy agents, prostanoids are not currently PBS
subsidised for triple therapy treatment. A patient must have previously
received PBS subsided treatment as either monotherapy or dual therapy
treatment in order to be eligible for triple therapy.
