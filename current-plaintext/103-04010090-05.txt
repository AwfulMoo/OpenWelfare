This page contains scenarios of the Residential Costs Option (RCO).
These examples show how the RCO may or may not be advantageous to the
student. It also contains examples to assist when determining whether
RCO is payable to someone who has already received a Relocation
Scholarship for the same period.

Rent assistance

Rent Assistance is only calculated for the time a student is paying
residential costs. Therefore, when considering whether the RCO is more
beneficial this needs to be taken into account when calculating the
entitlements. Generally a student will only pay residential costs for
the period of study and not during the vacation periods. Therefore,
whilst a student can be paid the away from home rate during the vacation
period, they do not continue to receive rent assistance during that
period.

Assessing student accommodation for RCO - Choice 1

Bowie is 18 years old and approved to live away from home. Bowie is in
first year of university study. Bowieâ€™s base rate of ABSTUDY Living
Allowance is $462.50 per fortnight. Bowie is also eligible to receive
Rent Assistance for the periods when living in a residential facility.
Currently the residential costs are $350 per week.

For Bowie to assess whether the RCO is the most suitable option, the
following must be considered:

Choice 1 - No Residential Costs Option

Bowie can access Living Allowance and Rent Assistance (for the time
Bowie pays 'rent' to the residential facility - Bowie is 'on-campus' for
36 weeks or 18 fortnights).

Table 1: This table describes the calculations of Living allowance and
Rent assistance - No Residential Costs option. Note: rates are current
as at 20 March 2020.

These amounts may not be current. They are examples only. For current
payments, see Rates and thresholds.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

Assessing student accommodation for RCO - Choice 2

During the period when Bowie is living 'on-campus' the RCO of $41.60 per
fortnight would be received - (36 weeks for two semesters) For the other
16 weeks Bowie would receive Living Allowance but would not be able to
access Rent Assistance)

Table 2: This table describes an example of calculations Residential
Costs Option.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| Payment or Allowance  | Rate                  | Yearly Total          |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| 36 weeks 'on campus'  | $41.60 x 18           | $748.80               |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| 16 weeks 'off campus' | $462.50 x 8           | $3,700.00             |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| Residential Fees      | $350.00 x 36          | $12,600.00            |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| Total                 |                       | $17,048.80            |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

In the first year of study it is more beneficial if Bowie does not claim
the RCO.

However, in the second and subsequent years of study, the RCO may be
more beneficial depending on whether Bowie qualifies for the regional
rate of Relocation Scholarship. Note: the rate of an Indigenous CAS does
not decrease after the first year and is usually more beneficial than
the RS.

Using the above figures (note: these will change with CPI and other
increases) if Bowie is qualified for the regional rate of Relocation
Scholarship in the second year of study, the total for No RCO would be
$19,135.00. If Bowie is not qualified for the regional rate of
Relocation Scholarship, the total for No RCO would be $17,048.80. Let's
assume Bowie does not qualify for the regional rate of Relocation
Scholarship. As both of the No RCO totals are less than what Bowie would
receive under the RCO option, it would be more beneficial if Bowie
accepted the RCO in the second and subsequent years of study.
