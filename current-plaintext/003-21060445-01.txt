This document explains eligibility, payment rates and claiming options
for the COVID-19 Disaster Payment.

Do not follow this procedure for any other Victoria event. See COVID-19
Disaster Payment – Victoria (16 July 2021 onwards)

The claiming period for this event has ended. Staff will only assess
online claims for this event that were lodged before the claiming period
ended or phone claims where special circumstances apply.

For staff not trained in processing claims, complete a warm (announced)
transfer to ‘COVID-19 Disaster Payment’ in Services Australia Workspace.

Victoria claims that do not meet the eligibility requirements can be
rejected, except when the customer has a pending Income Support Payment
claim. Claims where a customer has tried to lodge a New South
Wales/other state or territory claim under a Victoria online claim can
also be rejected.

If a customer calls about the status of their claim or automatic
payment, see Status of claim - customer calls to enquire for what to
tell the customer.

Eligibility

For online claims for this payment, do not contact customers to confirm
online claim details unless advised to do so by the Level 2 Helpdesk.

The following eligibility is different for all other COVID-19 Disaster
Payment events. Do not follow this for any other COVID-19 Disaster
Payment event.

To get a payment, a customer must meet all of the following for at least
1 day in the relevant 7 day period:

an Australian resident (through legal permanent residence and residing
in Australia) or a holder of a visa class permitted to work in Australia
(to check these see Resources for visa subclasses), and in Australia at

live or work in a relevant area subject to a state public health order
for a lockdown

live or work in a relevant area that is a deemed a COVID-19 hotspot by
the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer

$10,000 in a joint bank account, their accessible income is $5,000

would have worked on or after the eighth day of a state public health
order for ‘lockdown’. This means they would have worked for any period
from Friday 4 June to Thursday 10 June 2021 (the relevant 7 day period)

state public health order for a ‘lockdown’

for the same relevant 7 day period, not be receiving any of the
following:

-   an income support payment
-   state pandemic payment - the Victorian Coronavirus (COVID-19) Test

    Program Round Two’

have insufficient appropriate paid leave entitlements including any
special pandemic leave, or will use them up during the same relevant 7
day period

Self-employed customers can have the same work and home address.

Customers involved in a trust or company

Customers who only derive their income from a trust or company
(distributions/dividends) are not eligible:

-   a customer must be working and due to the lockdown be unable to work
    and therefore unable to earn an income
-   distributions/dividends will not count as employment as the lockdown
    is not affecting their income

Loans made to a private trust or private company must not be considered
liquid assets:

-   if customers are involved in private trusts or private companies,
    the liquid assets of the entity must not be considered when
    assessing their eligibility for this payment
-   do not refer these claims to a Complex Assessment Officer (CAO)

Company directors

A customer who is a company director, even when they draw a wage from
the business, cannot receive the COVID-19 Disaster Payment if the
business has received a state small business payment.

The customer may be eligible to receive the COVID-19 Disaster Payment
if:

-   the business has not received a state small business payment,
-   the customer draws a wage from the business, and
-   all other eligibility criteria is met.

Phone claims - customer on a nil rate of an Income Support Payment:

-   contact Technical Peer Support for these customers
-   Technical Peer Supportmust escalate the claim to the Level 2
    Helpdesk using the payment query template. Do not follow the
    Escalation of claims table as these claims cannot be selected for
    follow-up

For help assessing eligibility:

-   see the scenarios
-   contact Technical Peer Support

Insufficient appropriate leave entitlements

This applies to a customer if:

-   they have no appropriate leave entitlements under a relevant
    industrial instrument or by agreement with their employer including
    any special pandemic leave
-   they do not have enough days of appropriate leave to cover the
    relevant 7 day period, or
-   their employer is unable to pay appropriate leave entitlements
    because of financial hardship

Appropriate leave includes:

paid sick leave or carers leave:

-   when they are sick or injured, or
-   when they need to care for an immediate family or household member
    who is sick or injured, or for an emergency

paid special pandemic leave

state pandemic payments - the Victorian Coronavirus (COVID-19) Test
Isolation Payment

Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment

state small business payment - the ‘Business Costs Assistance Program
Round Two’

Appropriate leave does not include:

-   annual leave
-   unpaid leave
-   another leave type they are not entitled to access at this time,
    such as paid sick and carer’s leave or compassionate leave when they
    have been stood down without pay by their employer under the Fair
    Work Act

Customers do not need to take:

accrued leave entitlements such as:

-   annual leave
-   long service leave
-   unpaid leave

leave they are not entitled to access if they have been stood down
without pay by their employer under the Fair Work Act. For example:

-   paid sick leave
-   carer’s leave
-   compassionate leave

However, if a customer is receiving any of the above leave types,
including pandemic related leave entitlements, during the entire
relevant period, they:

-   have not lost income, and
-   are not eligible to receive COVID-19 Disaster Payment

For unpaid leave, while the customer may have lost income, they would
not meet the ‘would have worked’ criteria. That is, if a person is on
unpaid leave, they would not have worked even if the restricted movement
(lockdown) did not occur.

If ‘appropriate leave entitlements’ do not cover the entire ‘relevant
period’ from 4-10 June 2021 inclusive, the customer meets this
eligibility requirement.

For example, if a customer has ‘appropriate leave entitlements’ that
cover 3 days of the ‘relevant period’, they meet this eligibility
requirement. Note: the customer must meet all eligibility requirements
for at least 1 day in the remaining 4 day period.

A customer will not meet this eligibility requirement if their
‘appropriate leave entitlements’ they have received or will receive
cover the full ‘relevant period’ from 4 June to 10 June 2021 inclusive.

Payment amount

If the customer is eligible, the payment amount is:

-   $325 if they would have worked for less than 20 hours in the
    relevant 7 day period
-   $500 if they would have worked for 20 hours or more in the relevant
    7 day period

The payment cannot be paid pro rata. The customer must be paid the full
amount of $325 or $500, depending on if they would have worked less than
or more than 20 hours in the relevant 7 day period.

Timeframes for claiming

The claiming period:

-   started on 8 June 2021
-   ends on 2 July 2021

Note: if a customer claims for relevant period 1 or onwards:

-   they will automatically receive a payment for all future relevant
    periods, unless they advise of a change of circumstances
-   the length of the relevant period does not impact the rate of the
    automatic payment
-   they do not need to lodge a new claim

Customers lodging a claim for the last relevant period (not an automatic
payment) should complete the claim answering the question set based on
the length of the relevant period.
