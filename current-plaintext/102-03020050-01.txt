This document outlines how to monitor scheduled Inter-environment Change
of Address (ICoA) activities.

ICOA facility

The ICoA facility is a suite of programs and screens used to transfer
customer data between environments. ICoA allows a user to start and
schedule an inter-environment transfer and to monitor the status of the
transfer. After a transfer has completed the customer record will be
located in the new environment. For this reason, there is a need to
monitor transfers to ensure all required action on edits is taken so
that the record is transferred to allow ongoing payments for the
customer.

Situations which prevent a scheduled transfer from occurring are listed
on edit screens. Once the edits are fixed by the user or cease to exist
(some edits cannot be actioned by the user as they finalise
automatically), then the customer record is transferred.
