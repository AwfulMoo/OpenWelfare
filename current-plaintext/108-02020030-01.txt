This document outlines circumstances when the Parental Income Test (PIT)
will not apply to an ABSTUDY or Youth Allowance (YA) customer or
Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) applicant. These circumstances
relate to whether or not the parent(s)/guardian(s) are receiving
particular government payments or have been automatically issued a
Health Care Card (HCC).

ABSTUDY and AIC allowances

Not all ABSTUDY allowances are affected by the PIT. The following
allowances are affected by PIT:

-   ABSTUDY Living Allowance
-   Rent Assistance
-   Remote Area Allowance
-   Pharmaceutical Allowance
-   means test component of the School Fees Allowance Group 2
-   AIC Additional Boarding Allowance (ABA)

Exemptions from the PIT

The PIT will not apply to a dependent YA or ABSTUDY customer during the
period where at least one of their parent(s)/guardian(s):

-   receives a certain social security benefit or pension or a payment
    paid by the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA), listed in Module
    L of Section 1067G of the Social Security Act 1991 (for example,
    Service Pension, Income Support Supplement (ISS), Veteran Payment)
-   receives ABSTUDY Living Allowance
-   receives Farm Household Allowance (FHA)

The parent(s)/guardians(s) are not taken to be receiving an income
support payment, and an exemption from the PIT will not apply if they:

-   are serving an Income Maintenance Period that reduces their rate to
    nil
-   are in an employment income nil rate period, or
-   have an AGE/CZR PLS status (indicating receipt of Home Equity Access
    Scheme (HEAS) payments only)

Note: an additional exemption applies to dependent AIC and ABSTUDY
customers or claimants if a parent holds a current Health Care Card or
has a Health Care Card because they receive the maximum rate of Family
Tax Benefit Part A.

PIT exemption effective periods

Subject to notification provisions affecting ABSTUDY and AIC, the
exemption from the PIT applies from the date the parent commences to
receive the payment or hold a current HCC until the payment or HCC
ceases.

PIT exemption notifiable event

A parent/guardian commencing or ceasing to receive a Commonwealth
payment is a notifiable event. Where a parent/guardian contact to advise
a change in circumstances that reassess their eligibility to a
Commonwealth payment, the date they notify is deemed as the Date of
Event. If that change has a negative impact on the YA, ABSTUDY or AIC
customer which results in a debt, see Raising Parental income debts for
information on how these are managed. If the customer or parent advise
there is another sibling also receiving YA or ABSTUDY or attracting AIC
ABA, the sibling's record should also be reassessed if necessary.
