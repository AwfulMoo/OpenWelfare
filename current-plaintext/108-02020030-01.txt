This document outlines circumstances when the Parental Income Test (PIT)
will not apply to an ABSTUDY or Youth Allowance (YA) customer or
Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) applicant. These circumstances
relate to whether or not the parent(s)/guardian(s) are receiving
particular government payments or have been automatically issued a
Health Care Card (HCC).

ABSTUDY and AIC allowances

Not all ABSTUDY allowances are affected by the PIT. The following
allowances are affected by PIT:

-   ABSTUDY Living Allowance
-   Rent Assistance
-   Remote Area Allowance
-   Pharmaceutical Allowance
-   means test component of the School Fees Allowance Group 2
-   AIC Additional Boarding Allowance (ABA)

PIT exemptions for YA

The PIT does not apply to a YA customer if one of their
parent(s)/guardian(s) are in receipt of:

-   a certain social security benefit or pension or DVA payment
-   Farm Household Allowance (FHA)
-   ABSTUDY Living Allowance

However, the exemption from the PIT does not apply:

-   if the parent/guardian is taken to be receiving their income support
    payment entirely as a Home Equity Access Scheme loan, or
-   during an employment income nil rate period

PIT exemptions for ABSTUDY and AIC

The PIT does not apply to a dependent ABSTUDY or AIC student if one or
both of their parent(s)/guardian(s) are:

-   in receipt of a certain social security benefit or pension or DVA
    payment
-   in receipt of Farm Household Allowance (FHA)
-   the holder of a current Health Care Card (HCC), including a HCC
    issued on the basis of receipt of maximum rate Family Tax Benefit
    Part A
-   in receipt of ABSTUDY Living Allowance

However, the exemption from the PIT does not apply:

-   for a period after the expiry date on the HCC
-   where a parent holds a HCC because they receive a social security
    Mobility Allowance or Carer Allowance (in respect of a child with a
    disability)
-   if the applicant or the applicant's partner holds only a Pensioner
    Concession Card (PCC) or a Commonwealth Seniors Health Card (CSHC)
-   if the parent/guardian is taken to be receiving their income support
    payment entirely as a Home Equity Access Scheme loan, or
-   during an employment income nil rate period

PIT exemption effective periods

Subject to notification provisions affecting ABSTUDY and AIC, the
exemption from the PIT applies from the date the parent commences to
receive the payment or hold a current HCC until the payment or HCC
ceases.

PIT exemption notifiable event

A parent/guardian commencing or ceasing to receive a Commonwealth
payment is a notifiable event. Where a parent/guardian contact to advise
a change in circumstances that reassess their eligibility to a
Commonwealth payment, the date they notify is deemed as the Date of
Event. If that change has a negative impact on the YA, ABSTUDY or AIC
customer which results in a debt, see Raising Parental income debts for
information on how these are managed. If the customer or parent advise
there is another sibling also receiving YA or ABSTUDY or attracting AIC
ABA, the sibling's record should also be reassessed if necessary.
