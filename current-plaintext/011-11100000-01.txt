AODR document batching

All AODR source documents in service centres are batched daily where
electronic archiving is not appropriate. They are separated from other
program documents so they can be accessed at a later date. They are
stored offsite.

AODR transactions must not be held in excess of 1 week.

The Resources page contains a link to the Processed Australian Organ
Donor Register Transactions form and contact details.
