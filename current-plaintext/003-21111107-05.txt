Valid (eligible) and invalid (ineligible) impact reasons

For online claims or ACC lodged:

-   on or after 11 March 2022, customers can select from the below
    impact reasons
-   on or before 10 March 2022, staff can refer to the below impact
    reasons when reviewing any free text information provided in a
    customer’s claim

Table 1: Impact reasons and if they meet the adversely affected
criteria. That is, if they are a valid (eligible) or invalid
(ineligible) impact reason.

If there is no valid impact reason, and any free text information does
not meet a valid impact reason, the customer:

-   does not meet the adversely affected eligibility criteria and
-   is not eligible for payment. That is, their claim is to be rejected
    if formal approval has been provided to reject claims

Staff must always consider free text information to determine if
customer contact is needed. See Item 17 below.

Hierarchy of ineligible (rejection) reasons

Table 2: Ineligible reasons available when rejecting a claim.

If more than one reason applies, staff must

-   select the reason that best suits the customer’s circumstances from
    the hierarchy, and
-   clearly document all rejection reasons in the Claim Finalisation
    Note

For example if a customer

-   is ‘Not residentially qualified’ and ‘PPR not impacted’ select ‘Not
    residentially qualified’ and document both reasons in the Claim
    Finalisation Note
-   ‘Does not meet age requirement,’ ‘Not in a qualifying area,’ and
    ‘Assets below required threshold’ select ‘Does not meet age
    requirement’ and document the three reasons in the Claim
    Finalisation Note

Automation exclusion keywords and reasons

Table 6: while there are a large number of reasons a claim is excluded
from automation (straight through processing), these are the most common
reasons an AGDRP claim will be allocated for manual processing. Although
excluded from automation, the customer may still be eligible for payment
once the customer’s circumstances have been manually assessed. These
reasons should not be the only focus when assessing eligibility for
payment, but service as help only.

Not all exclusion keywords are listed

Service Officers must follow all Process steps to review the claim
fully, including any exclusion reason to determine if a customer is
eligible or ineligible for the payment.

Help from Technical Peer Support

If staff need help to finalise a claim, they must not call Technical
Peer Support (unless the customer is on the phone).

Before seeking help from Technical Peer Support using a Technical
Support Request staff must:

-   thoroughly research Operational Blueprint and other available
    resources
-   try to resolve the issue at a local level, for example, using local
    MS Teams chats

If:

-   an issue cannot be resolved and further technical assistance is
    needed, staff will lodge a Technical Support Request
-   staff have not received an outcome for their support request by the
    end of their shift, the related activity is to be placed on hold
    using the reason ‘hold to user’

Note: where a customer is on the phone, staff can call Technical Peer
Support.
