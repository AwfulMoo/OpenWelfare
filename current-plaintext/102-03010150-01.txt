Some older Australians may be at risk of abuse. For information on how
to identify abuse of older Australians and the referral options
available, go to Abuse of older Australians. If the customer is with
another person or on speaker phone, continue the current business
conversation as usual.

This document outlines changing the address of a customer when they have
moved permanently from an aged care home and the advice has been
received from the customer, their partner or their nominee.

Notification that customer has moved out of aged care home

Note: this procedure does not cover when a customer moves into an aged
care home.

There are 2 main ways Services Australia (the agency) is notified that a
customer has moved out of an aged care home for permanent care:

-   The customer, their partner or a nominee may notify the move if the
    resident is currently in receipt of payment from the agency
-   Notification to the agency can occur when the aged care home sends
    advice that the resident has been discharged

Customers are obliged to notify the agency of a change of address within
14 days.

Notification received from customer, their partner or nominee

When the information is received directly from the customer, their
partner or their nominee, the following needs to be provided to ensure
correct assessment:

-   name and address of the customer's new home
-   details of any rent, or board and lodgings payable at the address
-   the date of the change
-   the address the customer wants their mail sent to

Customer is a homeowner

If the customer is a homeowner and in receipt of an income support
payment through the agency, Service Officers will need to check if the
customer:

-   has now moved back to the principal home
-   if they have not moved back into their home, what the customer has
    done or expects to do with their principal home

Customers who have recently vacated aged care

The aged care means test assessment status will remain current and
customer records may continue to display homeownership until an
automatic discharge advice is received from the provider.
