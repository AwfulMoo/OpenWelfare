|                                   | payment would only be made if the |
|                                   | reason for ceasing care was       |

|                                   | It should be clear in these       |
|                                   | situations that a return to care  |
|                                   | at the required level can be      |
|                                   | expected after a definite period  |
|                                   | and that the carer will resume    |
