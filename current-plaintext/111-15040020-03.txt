|                                   | to proceed it is important to     |

|                                   | questions that may help in        |
|                                   | identifying the issues include:   |

|                                   | To make a correct decision it is  |
|                                   | important to understand which     |
|                                   | rules apply to the situation.     |
|                                   | These rules, and advice on how to |
|                                   | apply them, are usually found in  |
|                                   | the relevant legislation          |

|                                   | Decisions must be based on        |
|                                   | relevant facts and evidence. The  |
|                                   | decision making process can be    |
|                                   | made more difficult if there is   |

|                                   | evidence obtained. The following  |
|                                   | points may help with this stage   |
|                                   | of the decision making process:   |

|                                   | When reviewing evidence, some     |
|                                   | important questions to ask        |
|                                   | include:                          |

|                                   | -   Is the evidence from a        |
|                                   |     firsthand source or a third   |
|                                   |     party?                        |
|                                   | -   Does the person providing     |

|                                   |     interest in the issue or is   |

|                                   | -   Does this piece of evidence   |
|                                   |     support or conflict with      |
|                                   |     other evidence?               |
