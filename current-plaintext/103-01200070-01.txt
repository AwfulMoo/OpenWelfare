This document outlines details of the Disbursement interview process
when a customer exits Income Management under the Supporting People at
Risk (SPaR) measure. (This procedure does not cover the action required
after the death of a customer).

Disbursement interview

Customers can request to attend a Disbursement interview to discuss how
they will manage ongoing expenses and how residual funds will be paid
out when Income Management ends.

If a customer does not attend a Disbursement interview or no
disbursement instructions are recorded, Auto Disbursement rules apply.

Reasons Income Management ends

Income Management under this measure will end in the following
circumstances:

-   the customer or their partner is no longer receiving a category H or
    a category I welfare payment
-   the customer has an excluded payment nominee for Income Management
    purposes
-   the customer no longer meets the legislative requirements
-   the period of Income Management specified in the Notice to Commence
    Income Management or the Cashless Debit Card ends
-   the relevant approved referring authority has lodged a Revocation of
    Income Management or Cashless Debit Card, or
-   the Cashless Debit Card commences in their location

Note: if a customer moves into a Cashless Debit Card area, Income
Management will continue until it reaches its natural end date (that is
the Notice expires or it is revoked by the approved referring
authority).

Discussions at a Disbursement interview

The following will be discussed with customers who request to attend a
Disbursement interview:

-   If appropriate, how residual income managed funds will be disbursed,
    including confirmation of payment destination details
-   Using Centrepay or the Rent Deduction Scheme to meet ongoing
    expenses
-   Eligibility for another measure of Income Management, including
    Voluntary Income Management (if appropriate)
-   Continued use of their BasicsCard for up to 60 days after Income
    Management ends
-   Option to appoint a payment nominee
-   Where to find more information to help with managing their finances.

Preparing for a Disbursement interview

To prepare for a Disbursement interview:

-   check whether the customer requires an interpreter, and book
    interpreter if required
-   investigate the record to determine whether the customer is likely
    to become eligible for Income Management in the near future,
    including eligibility for Voluntary Income Management
-   check the customer's available Income Management funds
-   check whether the customer has an active BasicsCard and the current
    balance
-   check the record for any vulnerability indicators as customer may
    benefit from a referral to a social worker, and
-   have the relevant communication products on hand (for example,
    Centrepay information, Nominee forms)
