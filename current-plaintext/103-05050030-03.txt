Assessing application for SEA due to unreceived income

Table 3

Note: since 7 December 2020, customers report the gross employment
income they are paid in an entitlement period as shown on their payslip.
Due to this change it is unlikely that SEA would be granted due to
unreceived income but as this criteria is still in the legislation it
must be included in Operational Blueprint and any training material.
