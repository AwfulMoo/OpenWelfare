This document outlines information on Approval to claim and share PPL
days for a customer claiming PPL for a child born or entering care on or
after 1 July 2023.

Approval to claim and share PPL days

For Parental Leave Pay (PPL) claims for children born or adopted on or
after 1 July 2023, approval to claim and share PPL days will be required
from the Approval Giver for an Approval Seeker to make an effective
claim for PPL.

The Approval Giver is the:

-   birth mother
-   first adoptive parent or
-   PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances

The Approval Seeker is anyone other than the birth mother, first
adoptive parent or PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances who wishes
to claim PPL or access PPL days for a child.

In cases of adoption:

-   the first adoptive parent to claim will become the Approval Giver
-   the subsequent adoptive parent will then become the Approval Seeker

In these cases, the Approval Giver only needs to provide Approval to
share days. Approval to claim is not required.

Note: the first adoptive parent will remain the Approval Giver for
approval to claim and share PPL days for all other claimants.

Where a PPL claimant is in exceptional circumstances, they must provide
approval to claim for their partner to claim PPL.

Giving approval

Where an Approval Giver claims PPL they will be able to submit their
claim, provided any supporting documentation requested in the claim is
provided.

Approval Givers should be strongly encouraged to use the available
Online Services to complete Approval activities, unless they are
ineligible.

Where an Approval Seeker claims PPL, then an Approval task will be
created on the Approval Giver's record.

Where an Approval task is triggered by the Approval Seeker’s PPL claim
and:

-   the Approval Giver does not have a CRN, or
-   the Approval Giver could not be uniquely matched

The system will the trigger a Temporary Access Code (TAC) to enable the
Approval Giver to either:

-   create a Customer Record Number (CRN) and link to a Centrelink
    online account, or
-   authenticate themselves via their Centrelink online account

The Approval Giver can then access and action the Approval task for the
Approval Seeker.

Until the Approval task is completed, then the Approval Seeker will be
unable to submit their claim.

Temporary Access Code (TAC)

A Temporary Access Code (TAC) will be triggered when:

-   an Approval Seeker does not have a CRN, or
-   a match cannot be completed based on the information provided by the
    Approval Seeker about the Approval Giver

At the end of the Approval Seeker’s PPL claim, if the TAC is required,
the Approval Seeker is provided with a:

-   TAC to give to the Approval Giver. This is an 11 alphanumeric unique
    identifier code, and
-   Claim ID

The TAC will allow the Approval Giver unauthenticated entry to confirm
their personal information and CRN.

The Approval Giver will be presented with several questions to confirm
their details. This could include confirming their existing CRN or
creating a CRN and online account.

The TAC remains valid until either:

-   the task is completed by the Approval Giver, or
-   the Approval Seeker’s online claim expires

Once the Approval Giver confirm their details, the process is complete,
and the TAC will expire. The Approval Giver can then use Centrelink
Online account as an authenticated customer.

If match is successful, the Approval Giver can now login their MyGov
account to complete the Approval task. It will display in their
Centrelink Online Service.

If the match is unsuccessful (all valid person information matches are
not confirmed), a Failed Online Change in Circumstance activity
(ZPPL_ZCOC) will be created in Process Direct. A Service Officer will
need to manually action and may need to contact the Approval Giver to
verify the information provided in the TAC service.

Rejecting approval to claim PPL

Approval Givers can reject an Approval Seekers request for approval to
claim.

If approval to claim is rejected:

-   the Approval Seekers PPL claim will be made Not Effective (NEF) due
    to Approval not provided (ANP)
-   If the Approval Seekers claim is made NEF, then the Approval Seeker
    could lodge another claim for the PPL child

Removing approval to claim PPL

An Approval Giver can only remove approval to claim in cases where no
PPL days have been paid e.g. The Approval Seekers claim status is
Assessed (ASS).

If approval to claim is removed:

-   if the Approval Seekers PPL claim is assessed and no days have been
    paid, the PPL claim will reject (REJ) Approval Withdrawn for claim
    (AWC)
-   the Approval Seeker will not be able to make another effective claim
    for the PPL child, until the Approval Giver updates the approval in
    their online services via the Parental Leave Pay Circumstances
    Dashboard
-   if the Approval Seeker PPL claim has been paid at least one PPL day,
    their claim will be cancelled. Any PPL payments already received by
    the Approval Seeker for the PPL child will not be raised as an
    overpayment
-   any future unpaid PPL days will be returned to the Approval Givers
    balance to manage and claim

Managing shared PPL days

The maximum entitlement for a child in most cases is 100 days.

Birth mothers or first adoptive parents no longer need to claim PPL
first, or at all.

For a father, partner or another person to receive PPL the birth mother
or first adoptive parent (Approval Giver) must give their approval to
claim PPL and approval to share PPL days with the other person.
