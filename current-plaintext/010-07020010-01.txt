This document explains the action should be taken when a student does
not meet the participation related requirements of their payment and how
to determine if, after signing a Student Activity Agreement, a
participation failure has been committed by a student.

Circumstances when a participation failure applies

Normally, where an Austudy or Youth Allowance (YA) customer has failed
to attend an appointment about their Activity Test requirements, the
customer may be subject to a participation failure if they do not have a
reasonable excuse.

ABSTUDY, Australian Apprentices and trainees

This procedure does not apply to:

-   ABSTUDY customers who are assessed under a specific breach framework
-   Australian Apprentices receiving YA or Austudy because they are
    exempt from the student Activity Test at all times
-   trainees who are doing a course which does not qualify them for
    payment as a full-time student or an Australian Apprentice. This
    last group are regarded as job seekers and are required to comply
    with activities negotiated in a Job/Participation Plan

Examples of when a student may incur a participation failure

-   failure to comply with the terms of a previously negotiated Student
    Activity Agreement in relation to secondary school attendance
-   failure to attend a participation related service profiling
    appointment
-   failure to attend an appointment booked to enable an Student
    Activity Agreement to be negotiated

Examples of when a student will not incur a participation failure

-   not enrolled in and/or undertaking full-time (or qualifying) study
-   not enrolling in and/or undertaking the course of study following an
    intention to do so
-   not commencing the course of study by the Friday of the second week
    of classes
-   for continuing students, not enrolling in the course when the next
    enrolments are accepted
-   for a YA student, refusal to sign a Student Activity Agreement
-   failure to attend a non-participation related appointment.
    Suspension is the appropriate option in this case
-   leaving employment voluntarily or through misconduct and claiming a
    payment as a student
-   Generally, where a student fails to satisfy the Activity Test when
    they no longer study full time, this will result in the loss of
    qualification and a resultant debt, rather than the application of a
    participation failure

Penalties related to earnings

If a student:

-   refuses or fails to correctly declare earnings from employment
-   recklessly or knowingly gives false or misleading information about
    earnings

A debt will be raised for any overpayment and a 10% recovery fee may be
applied. A participation failure or loss of qualification for payment is
not applicable in these circumstances

Unfavourable decisions

When an unfavourable decision is to be made, a Decision Maker (DM) must
provide the customer with an explanation of the decision and an
opportunity to provide further information or evidence relevant to the
decision. The DM must also advise the customer of their review and
appeal rights. This includes unfavourable decisions made by Service
Officers within Smart Centre Call.

If a DM is not speaking with the customer at the time of making an
unfavourable decision, they are required to make 2 genuine attempts to
contact the customer before finalising the decision.

For more details, see Initial contact about a decision and the review of
decision process.
