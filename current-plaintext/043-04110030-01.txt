This document outlines information on the concessions available for
controllers of a trust who could not access trust capital and/or income
as at 7:30 pm on 9 May 2000. The trust deeds of some existing trusts
contain an irrevocable clause that prevents access to capital.

Trust deeds access prevented

Where, as at 7:30 pm on 9 May 2000, the trust deed irrevocably prevents
access to:

-   assets only, the assets will not be assessed but the income will be
    assessed under the post 1 January 2002 rules (attribution of income)
-   income only, the income will not be assessed but the assets will be
    assessed under post 1 January 2002 rules (attribution of assets)
-   both assets and income, the assets are not assessed but the actual
    income distributions received will be assessed (pre 1 January 2002
    rules)

Note: access is not irrevocable where a controller or associate has the
power to change the trust deed to allow access.

If access is prevented for a specific time, for example, until a person
reaches a certain age, the concession will only apply until those access
conditions are met.

All cases must be fully verified, that is, the trust deed and a
statement obtained and examined, before the concession can be applied.

Information for Complex Assessment Officer (CAO)

If access to trust income and/or assets is irrevocably prevented by the
trust deed as at 7:30 pm on 9 May 2000, this should be reflected in the
details coded on the Trust/Company Attribution (TRA) screen.

For example, if a 100% controller has access to income but not assets as
at 9 May 2000, the income attribution percentage should be set to 100%
and the asset attribution percentage to zero.

Details of non access should be placed on a DOC on the organisation
record.

If access is prevented for a specific time, for example, until a person
reaches a certain age, a review should be set.
