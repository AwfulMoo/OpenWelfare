This document outlines how to deal with debts when the customer has a
nominee.

Treatment of debts where a nominee is correctly appointed

Customers with a nominee must advise of any circumstance changes within
their notification period.

If a nominee fails to advise a change in circumstances, which results in
an incorrect payment:

-   this error is taken to have been made by the customer, and
-   any debts must be raised against the customer

See Finalised 'no debt' (FND) or 'zeroing' debts that are not legally
recoverable.

Treatment of debts where a nominee is incorrectly appointed

Raise the debt on the nominee as a third party debt where there is
evidence:

-   to support an incorrectly appointed nominee and
-   they received the benefit of the funds

See Calculating Centrelink entitlements and gathering information when
investigating debts.

Penalties applicable to nominees

Social Security Law and Family Assistance Law set out obligations for
both correspondence and payment nominees. Nominees must act in the
customer's best interests.

Nominee arrangements are subject to review. The agency's power to
investigate has limits. The Australian Federal Police (AFP) may need to
investigate.

Raise a third party debt when a court has determined that the nominee
has:

-   stolen
-   fraudulently used, or
-   misappropriated the customer's money

Refer these types of investigations to the AFP by the Intelligence and
Investigations Branch.

The Resources page contains further information regarding penalties.
