This document outlines information about the Profiling Bulk Update
Facility (PQBUF) screen used by Service Profiling Coordinators. It
allows for the bulk selection and automatic commencement of Service
Components by Area or Service Centre.

Screen overview

The PQBUF screen can commence Service Components on up to 999 customer
records, without the need to manually update each individual customer
record.

Service Components are selected in order from oldest to most recent and
will update the Service Action from 'NST' to 'STA'. This Service Action
may include booking appointments, issuing forms or conducting file
reviews.
