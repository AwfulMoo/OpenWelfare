This document explains Away from Base assistance. It helps students
participate in an approved course where that course requires students to
travel away from their home or study location for a short period of
time.

Eligibility

For student eligibility to Away from Base, see Assessing student
eligibility to attend an approved ABSTUDY Away from Base activity.

Away from Base activities include:

-   testing and assessment programmes for entry into tertiary courses,
    or in certain circumstances, an enabling course
-   residential schools
-   field trips for tertiary courses
-   placements or practical components of tertiary courses

Other than for a testing and assessment programme, an Away from Base
activity will only be approved if it is:

-   an essential academic component of a course, and
-   necessary for a student to do this component to meet the minimum
    requirements for successful completion of the course

Some restrictions apply to eligibility for assistance to travel
interstate.

Away from Base assistance is only available for activities in Australia.

Away from Base assistance is not available for activities that:

-   are part of an Australian Apprenticeship or,
-   receive funding from the National Indigenous Australians Agency
    (NIAA) under the Indigenous Advancement Strategy (IAS) Away from
    Base program unless the activity is a Testing and Assessment
    programme in order to gain entry to that course. See the Resources
    page for the list of NIAA funded courses

Note: students participating in a course funded by the NIAA's Away from
Base Program can claim ABSTUDY non means-tested Living Allowance.

Claiming

Education providers conducting an Away from Base activity must lodge an
ABSTUDY Submission for away from base activity funding form (SY034). The
submission must include all details of the activity.

Students who arrange their own activity do not need to lodge an SY034.
However, they must provide a letter from the education provider
confirming:

-   the date, period and location of the activity
-   that the activity is a necessary component of the course
-   that the student's attendance is compulsory
-   the details of any assistance provided by any third party for the
    student to attend the activity, and
-   where the student is claiming Away from Base assistance under the
    Lawful Custody Award, that they have permission from the
    correctional provider to attend the activity

Away from Base claims must be lodged by the Away from Base submission
closing date.

Submissions lodged by education providers will not be accepted more than
13 weeks before the calendar year in which the first course is due to
start.
