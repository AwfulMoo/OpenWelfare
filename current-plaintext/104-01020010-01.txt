This document contains guidelines for accepting information from a
parent of a Youth Allowance (YA) customer. Services Australia can accept
information from any source about a customer's circumstances without
confirming or disclosing that the person the information relates to is a
customer of the agency.

Provider's credentials

Before action is taken on the information provided, staff must be
confident of the enquirer's competence to provide accurate information.

For example, a parent may phone to advise that their child has stopped
attending school and has commenced full time work. They may also provide
details for their son/daughter's income.

If any doubt exists about the validity of the advice or the 'bona fides'
of the caller, the customer should be contacted by telephone or in
writing before the change is actioned.

The Resources page contains links to the certificate for disclosure in
the public interest, release of information to other Commonwealth
Departments and Agencies, and the Privacy intranet page.
