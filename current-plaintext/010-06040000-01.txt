This document outlines the varying rates of Youth Allowance (YA) that
are available and the reasons for granting them.

Circumstances that affect the rate of YA

There are a number of different rates of YA available, depending on the
customer's situation, including:

-   age
-   dependence on or independence from parent(s)
-   whether they live in the parental home
-   whether they are partnered or single
-   whether they have dependent children
-   whether they are in state care (supported or unsupported)
-   whether they are a long term income support student

Full-time students and Australian Apprentices receiving YA and 21 years
of age and under may be entitled to Youth Disability Supplement (YDS).
The customer must have been assessed by an Employment Services
Assessment (ESAt) as having a partial capacity to work (PCW) of less
than 30 hours per week.

Note: the basic rates of YA may also be affected by income, assets and
the Parental Means Test.

The Resources page contains links to the latest rates for YA.
