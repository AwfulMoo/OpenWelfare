This document outlines how job seekers managed under the Targeted
Compliance Framework are held to account for complying with compulsory
requirements.

Key principles

The Targeted Compliance Framework is the job seeker compliance system
that ensures job seekers serviced by Workforce Australia, Disability
Employment Services (DES) and ParentsNext providers, comply with their
compulsory mutual obligation requirements in return for receiving a
participation payment.

The Targeted Compliance Framework ensures the small percentage of job
seekers who repeatedly and deliberately fail to meet their compulsory
requirements or who refuse suitable work, are appropriately held to
account. At the same time, it provides early support for vulnerable job
seekers to help ensure their requirements are appropriate, and a lighter
touch for the majority of job seekers who are genuine in their efforts
to find work.

Personal responsibility

The Targeted Compliance Framework has a strong emphasis on personal
responsibility for meeting compulsory requirements and engagement with
providers.

Personal responsibility is about helping to develop or reinforce
work-like behaviours by giving job seekers ownership and personal
accountability for:

-   ensuring their provider is aware of their circumstances, this
    ensures requirements in the current Job Plan/Participation Plan are
    appropriate and achievable
-   recording Personal Events in the Job Seeker Account calendar to
    ensure their provider is aware of these when requirements are
    scheduled
-   maintaining contact with their provider and engaging to their full
    capacity in compulsory appointments and activities
-   recording their own attendance at requirements where they are
    capable of doing so
-   accepting all offers of suitable work (Note: ParentsNext
    participants are not required to look for work), and
-   contacting their provider prior to a requirement or appointment's
    scheduled start time if unable to attend

Leaving or refusing suitable work

Unemployment and work refusal failures reinforce the expectation that
participation payments are only available to those who are genuine in
their efforts to move into paid work.

An unemployment failure is committed when a person leaves suitable work
voluntarily (without a valid reason) or is dismissed from suitable work
due to misconduct. When an unemployment failure is applied:

-   Customers claiming a participation payment will be subject to an
    unemployment preclusion period, affecting the participation payment
    start day by 4 weeks (6 weeks where they received relocation
    assistance to move to take up the work)
-   Where a job seeker who is already receiving a participation payment
    commits an unemployment failure, their participation payment is
    cancelled and they cannot receive a participation payment is
    cancelled and they cannot receive a participation payment 4 weeks (6
    weeks where they received relocation assistance to move to take up
    the work). If a job seekerâ€™s payment is cancelled for this reason,
    they will need to re-claim a participation payment to receive future
    participation payments

A work refusal failure has been committed where the job seeker refused,
failed to accept or did not commence work that they are capable of doing
without a valid reason:

-   Job seekers who refuse, fail to accept or commence suitable work
    have their payment suspended until they re-engage with their
    provider to discuss their reason for non-compliance
-   To reinforce the seriousness of these failures, participation
    payments are cancelled with a 4 week post cancellation non-payment
    period. Job seekers will need to re-claim a participation payment
    before they can receive a participation payment again

Note: ParentsNext participants are not subject to unemployment failures
or work refusal failures as there is no compulsory requirement for them
to look for work.

Managing compliance with compulsory requirements

The TCF consists of 3 zones for job seekers and ParentsNext
participants, these zones are called the:

-   green zone
-   warning zone
-   penalty zone

All job seekers start their return to work journey in the green zone.
Providers are responsible for monitoring compliance with compulsory
requirements. A mutual obligation failure occurs when a job seeker fails
to comply with a compulsory requirement in their Job Plan or
Participation Plan. When a mutual obligation failure occurs the provider
records the non-compliance event in the Employment Services System
(ESSweb). This may result in suspension of the job seekers payment.

Job seekers who are meeting their requirements - the green zone

As long as the job seeker is meeting their compulsory requirements, job
seekers will remain in this zone for the duration of their time on a
participation payment.

Job seekers in this zone are expected to let their provider know of
their circumstances to help ensure requirements in their
Job/Participation Plan are appropriate and achievable. The job seeker
must maintain contact with their provider, engage to their full capacity
and record their own attendance at requirements, including appointments
and activities. Those who are unable to record or manage their own
attendance should discuss this with their provider, or, if they are in
Workforce Australia Online, with the Department of Education, Skills and
Employment Digital Services Contact Centre (DSCC). If a job seeker who
usually records their own attendance is unable to do so on occasion (for
example, due to an internet outage), they must contact their provider or
the DSCC before close of business that day to avoid a potential
suspension or demerit.

First mutual obligation failure in 6 months - entering the warning zone

When a mutual obligation failure is identified, the job seeker receives
a notice telling them:

-   they may have missed a mutual obligation requirement, and
-   they must contact their provider within 2 business days to avoid
    having their payment suspended

If the job seeker does not contact their provider, their payment will be
suspended after 2 business days. Their payment will remain suspended
until they contact their provider and meet any reengagement requirements
the provider sets.

Once the job seeker contacts, the provider will want to know the reasons
why the job seeker failed to comply with the requirement. If the
provider decides the job seeker did not have a valid reason for missing
their requirement the provider will apply a demerit. The first demerit
will move the job seeker from the green zone into the warning zone.

Generally, where a mutual obligation failure has occurred and the job
seeker did not have a valid reason one demerit point is accrued.
However, mutual obligation failures for non-attendance or misconduct at
a job interview or for failing to act on a job offer are more serious
and will fast-track the job seeker to the next assessment point. The TCF
assessments points are the Capability Interview (conducted by the
provider) and the Capability Assessment (conducted by Participation
Solutions Team (PST) skilled Service Officers at Services Australia.

Each demerit contributes to the job seeker's demerit point count for 6
months. Job seekers return to the green zone automatically when all
demerits expire.

Repeated non-compliance in the warning zone - Capability Interviews and Capability Assessments

Mutual obligation failures, participation suspensions and demerits
provide a warning and make it simple and easy for job seekers to
understand the consequences of non-compliance and the link between
participation and payment.

When a job seeker in the warning zone has a mutual obligation failure,
they will receive a notice telling them:

-   they may have missed a mutual obligation requirement, and
-   they must contact their provider within 2 business days to avoid
    having their payment suspended

If the job seeker does not contact their provider, their payment will be
suspended after 2 business days. Payment will remain suspended until the
job seeker contacts their provider and meets any reengagement
requirements the provider sets.

Provider contact following each mutual obligation failure provides the
opportunity for job seekers to discuss their reasons for a mutual
obligation failure and a chance to identify any circumstances impacting
the job seeker's ability to comply with the requirements in their
Job/Participation Plan.

Repeated non-compliance may trigger the next assessment point - a
Capability Interview or a Capability Assessment. Failures relating to
job interviews or job referrals also fast track the job seeker to the
next assessment point.

A Capability Interview is conducted by a provider when a job seeker
accrues 3 demerits within a 6 month period or has been fast tracked to
this assessment point, unless one has already been completed within the
previous 8 weeks

-   The Capability Interview ensures the provider understands the impact
    of the job seeker's circumstances on their capacity, requirements
    are appropriate and job seekers understand the consequences of
    further non-compliance
-   Where the Capability Interview finds a job seeker is not capable of
    meeting their current compulsory requirements demerits are reset to
    zero, the job seeker returns to the green zone and the provider is
    responsible for re-negotiating the Job/Participation Plan

A Capability Assessment is an assessment conducted by appropriately
skilled Services Australia staff when a job seeker in the warning zone
accrues 5 demerits in a 6 month period or has been fast tracked to this
assessment point

-   The Capability Assessment acts as a further check to ensure that all
    circumstances impacting compliance have been identified, their
    capacity has been appropriately assessed and their compulsory
    requirements are appropriate to their circumstances
-   Where the Capability Assessment finds the Job/Participation Plan is
    appropriate they enter the financial penalty zone
-   Where the Capability Assessment finds a job seeker is not capable of
    meeting their current Job/Participation Plan requirements demerits
    are reset to zero. The job seeker returns to the green zone and the
    provider is responsible for re-negotiating the Job/Participation
    Plan

Persistent non-compliance and the penalty zone

Job seekers transition to the penalty zone where:

-   their provider considers requirements are appropriate to their
    circumstances (following a Capability Interview), and
-   a Capability Assessment conducted by Services Australia confirms the
    job seeker is capable of meeting their current Job/Participation
    Plan requirements

In this zone, job seekers who:

-   demonstrate full compliance for 3 months will return to the green
    zone (demerits reset to zero), and
-   those who continue to be non-compliant will face financial penalties
    or payment cancellation

If the job seeker commits a mutual obligation failure while in the
penalty zone, payment suspension occurs immediately, encouraging job
seekers to re-engage with their provider and their requirements. In
addition, a Non-Compliance Report (NCR) triggers a potential financial
penalty. Job seekers who had a valid reason for failing to comply are
encouraged to contact their provider before they are due to report.

If the provider does not believe the job seeker had a valid reason for
their non-compliance, a Provider Report is submitted and will become an
active failure in the Services Australia system on the job seekerâ€™s
reporting date.

Job seekers who do not wish to speak with a PST-skilled Service Officer
about their reasons for not complying can accept the financial penalty
for some failures as part of their reporting. Where a job seeker would
like to present their reasons for non-compliance or the failure cannot
be accepted as part of reporting, a compliance investigation must be
conducted by a PST-skilled Service Officer. Where the job seeker is
unable to establish reasonable excuse and the failure is applied, the
job seeker will incur a financial penalty.

Escalating financial penalties and payment cancellation, based on the
job seeker's penalty count, send a strong message that repeatedly
failing to meet requirements is not acceptable:

-   a first financial penalty results in a loss of 50% of the
    fortnight's payment
-   a second financial penalty results in a loss of 100% of the
    fortnight's payment
-   a third financial penalty results in payment cancellation and a 4
    week post cancellation non-payment period. Job seekers will need to
    reclaim before they can receive a participation payment again

Non-Compliance cancellation and post cancellation non-payment period

A non-compliance cancellation occurs when a job seeker:

-   fails to accept or commence suitable work (work refusal failure)
-   voluntarily leaves suitable work without reasonable excuse
    (unemployment failure)
-   is dismissed from suitable employment due to misconduct as a worker
    (unemployment failure)
-   has a third financial penalty applied for a persistent mutual
    obligation failure

Where payment is cancelled, the job seeker enters a post cancellation
non-payment period:

-   A post cancellation non-payment period is 4 weeks, or 6 weeks for an
    unemployment failure where the job seeker received Relocation
    Assistance for the job in the previous 6 months. During this period
    a participation payment is not payable. There are no waiver
    provisions for job seekers in financial hardship during this period,
    however the job seeker will maintain concession card and benefit
    rate Family Tax Benefit (FTB) eligibility
-   At the end of, or during, the post cancellation non-payment period,
    job seekers may reclaim a participation payment. They will be
    subject to RapidConnect and, if returning to payment at the end of
    the preclusion period, they return to the TCF zone they were in
    prior to the non-compliance cancellation

Services Australia responsibilities

Services Australia is expected to work with providers to ensure job
seekers understand what they need to do to receive a participation
payment, and the impact non-compliance will have on their payment.

All staff have a responsibility to communicate the following messages to
job seekers if they contact about a missed requirement or a
participation suspension:

-   take personal responsibility to meet your requirements
-   talk with your provider about any circumstances that may be
    affecting your ability to meet your requirements
-   record personal events in your Workforce Australia calendar so your
    provider is aware
-   if there is good reason why you are unable to meet a requirement
    (such as attending an appointment or job interview, or participating
    in another activity) talk to your provider before the requirement
-   be aware of what will happen if you do not comply, and
-   if you miss a requirement, contact your provider as quickly as
    possible, within 2 business days to avoid payment suspension

Participation Solution Team (PST) skilled Service Officers with the
WNPPD security resource or Service Officers who process job seeker
claims and have a UNPP security resource are responsible for:

-   determining whether to apply failures where persistent mutual
    obligation failures are incurred without reasonable excuse (WNPPD
    only)
-   determining whether a work refusal (WNPPD only) or unemployment
    failure has been committed
-   cancelling payments following a third persistent mutual obligation
    failure, work refusal failure or unemployment failure
-   determining payment start dates following a non-compliance
    preclusion periods or unemployment preclusion periods
-   actioning review and appeals outcomes for decisions made under
    Social Security Legislation

Appropriately skilled PST-skilled Service Officers with a WNPPD security
resource also conduct Capability Assessments.

Consultation with a PST Service Support Officer (SSO), PST-skilled
social worker or other specialist officer may be appropriate when
assessing the impact of a job seekerâ€™s circumstances on their capacity
to comply. See Accessing a PST-skilled social worker for information on
when consultation with a PST-skilled social worker may be appropriate.
