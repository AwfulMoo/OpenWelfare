This document outlines how job seekers managed under the Targeted
Compliance Framework are held to account for complying with compulsory
requirements.

Key principles

The Targeted Compliance Framework is the job seeker compliance system
that ensures job seekers serviced by jobactive, Disability Employment
Services (DES) and ParentsNext providers, comply with their compulsory
mutual obligation requirements in return for receiving a participation
payment.

The Targeted Compliance Framework ensures the small percentage of job
seekers who repeatedly and deliberately fail to meet their compulsory
requirements or who refuse suitable work are appropriately held to
account. At the same time, it provides early support for vulnerable job
seekers to help ensure their requirements are appropriate, and a lighter
touch for the majority of job seekers who are genuine in their efforts
to find work.

Personal responsibility

The Targeted Compliance Framework has a strong emphasis on personal
responsibility for meeting compulsory requirements and engagement with
providers.

Personal responsibility is about helping to develop or reinforce
work-like behaviours by giving job seekers ownership and personal
accountability for:

-   ensuring their provider is aware of their circumstances, this
    ensures requirements in the current Job Plan/Participation Plan are
    appropriate and achievable
-   recording Personal Events in the Job Seeker Account calendar to
    ensure their provider is aware of these when requirements are
    scheduled
-   maintaining contact with their provider and engaging to their full
    capacity in compulsory appointments and activities
-   recording their own attendance at requirements
-   accepting all offers of suitable work (Note: ParentsNext
    participants are not required to look for work), and
-   contacting prior to a requirement or appointment's scheduled start
    time if unable to attend

Leaving or refusing suitable work

Unemployment and work refusal failures reinforce the expectation that
participation payments are only available to those who are genuine in
their efforts to move into paid work.

An unemployment failure is committed when a person leaves suitable work
voluntarily (without a valid reason) or is dismissed from suitable work
due to misconduct:

-   Customers will be subject to an unemployment preclusion period,
    affecting the participation payment start day by 4 weeks (6 weeks
    where they received relocation assistance to move to take up the
    work)
-   Participation payments are cancelled where a job seeker commits an
    unemployment failure. Job seekers have a 4 week wait and will need
    to re-claim a participation payment to receive future participation
    payments (6 weeks where they received relocation assistance to move
    to take up the work)

A work refusal failure has been committed where the job seeker refused,
failed to accept or commence work that they are capable of doing without
a valid reason:

-   Job seekers who refuse, fail to accept or commence suitable work
    have their payment suspended until they re-engage with their
    provider to discuss their reason for non-compliance
-   To reinforce the seriousness of these failures, participation
    payments are cancelled with a 4 week post cancellation non-payment
    period. Job seekers will need to re-claim a participation payment
    before they can receive a participation payment again

Note: ParentsNext participants are not subject to unemployment failures
or work refusal failures as there is no compulsory requirement for them
to look for work in their Participation Plan.

Managing compliance with compulsory requirements

The TCF consists of 3 zones for job seekers and ParentsNext
participants, these zones are called the:

-   green zone
-   warning zone
-   penalty zone

All job seekers start their return to work journey in the green zone.
Providers are responsible for monitoring compliance with compulsory
requirements. A mutual obligation failure occurs when a job seeker fails
to comply with a compulsory requirement. When a mutual obligation
failure occurs the provider records the non-compliance event in the
Employment Services System (ESSweb). This may result in suspension of
the job seekers payment.

Job seekers who are meeting their requirement - the green zone

As long as the job seeker is meeting their compulsory requirements, job
seekers will remain in this zone for the duration of their time on a
participation payment.

Job seekers in this zone negotiate compulsory requirements with their
Employment Services Provider or their ParentsNext provider. They are
expected to let their provider know of their circumstances (for example,
when negotiating their Job/Participation Plan) to help ensure
requirements are appropriate and achievable. The job seeker must
maintain contact with their provider, engage to their full capacity and
record their own attendance at requirements, including activities.

First mutual obligation failure in 6 months - entering the warning zone

When a mutual obligation failure is identified the job seeker receives a notice telling them:

-   

    It seems they have missed a mutual obligation requirement, and

-   

    they must contact their provider to avoid having their payment suspended

If the job seeker does not contact their provider, their payment will be suspended after 2 business days. Their payment will remain suspended until they contact their provider and meet any reengagement requirements the provider sets.

Once the job seeker contacts, the provider will want to know the reasons
why the job seeker failed to comply with the requirement. If the
provider decides the job seeker did not have a valid reason for missing
their requirement the provider will apply a demerit. The first demerit
will move the job seeker from the green zone into the warning zone.

Generally, where a mutual obligation failure has occurred and the job
seeker did not have a valid reason one demerit point is accrued.
However, mutual obligation failures for non-attendance or misconduct at
a job interview or for failing to act on a job offer are more serious
and will fast-track the job seeker to the next assessment point.

Each demerit contributes to the job seeker's demerit point count for 6
months. Job seekers return to the green zone automatically when all
demerits expire.

Repeated non-compliance in the warning zone - Capability Interviews and Capability Assessments

Mutual obligation failures, participation suspensions and demerits
provide a warning and make it simple and easy for job seekers to
understand the consequences of non-compliance and the link between
participation and payment.

When a job seeker in this zone has a mutual obligation failure, they
will receive a notice telling them:

-   It seems they have missed a mutual obligation requirement, and
-   they must contact their provider to avoid having their payment
    suspended

If the job seeker does not contact their provider, their payment will be
suspended after 2 business days. Payment will remain suspended until the
job seeker contacts their provider and meets any reengagement
requirements the provider sets.

Provider contact following each mutual obligation failure provides the
opportunity for job seekers to discuss their reasons for a mutual
obligation failure and a chance to identify any circumstances impacting
the job seeker's ability to comply.

Repeated non-compliance may trigger the next assessment point - a
Capability Interview or a Capability Assessment. Failures relating to
job interviews or job referrals also fast track the job seeker to the
next assessment point.

A Capability Interview is conducted by a provider when a job seeker
accrues 3 demerit points within a 6 month period or has been fast
tracked to this assessment point, unless one has already been completed
within the previous 8 weeks

-   The Capability Interview ensures the impact of the job seeker's
    circumstances on their capacity is understood, requirements are
    appropriate and job seekers understand the consequences of further
    non-compliance which is a referral to Services Australia for a
    Capability Assessment
-   Where the Capability Interview finds a job seeker is not capable of
    meeting their current compulsory requirements demerits are reset to
    zero, the job seeker returns to the green zone and the provider is
    responsible for re-negotiating the Job/Participation Plan

A Capability Assessment is an assessment conducted by appropriately
skilled Services Australia staff when a job seeker in the warning zone
accrues 5 demerit points in a 6 month period or has been fast tracked to
this assessment point

-   The Capability Assessment acts as a further check to ensure that all
    circumstances impacting compliance have been identified and that the
    job seeker is in the right stream, their capacity has been
    appropriately assessed and their compulsory requirements are
    appropriate to their circumstances
-   Where the Capability Assessment finds the Job/Participation Plan is
    appropriate they enter the financial penalty zone
-   Where the Capability Assessment finds a job seeker is not capable of
    meeting their current Job/Participation Plan requirements demerits
    are reset to zero. The job seeker returns to the green zone and the
    provider is responsible for re-negotiating the Job/Participation
    Plan

Persistent non-compliance and the penalty zone

Job seekers transition to the penalty zone where:

-   their provider considers requirements are appropriate to their
    circumstances (following a Capability Interview), and
-   a Capability Assessment conducted by Services Australia confirms the
    job seeker has capability to meet current Job/Participation Plan
    requirements

In this zone, job seekers who:

-   demonstrate full compliance for 3 months will return to the green
    zone, and
-   those who continue to be non-compliant will face financial penalties
    or payment cancellation

If the job seeker commits a mutual obligation failure while in the
penalty zone, payment suspension occurs immediately, encouraging job
seekers to re-engage with their provider and their requirements. In
addition, a Non-Compliance Report (NCR) triggers a potential financial
penalty. Job seekers who had a valid reason for failing to comply are
encouraged to contact their provider before they are due to report.

If the provider does not believe the job seeker had a valid reason for
their non-compliance, a Provider Report is submitted and will become an
active failure on the job seeker's reporting date in the Services
Australia system.

Job seekers who do not wish to speak to a PST-skilled Service Officer
about their reasons for not complying can accept the financial penalty
for some failures as part of their reporting. Where a job seeker would
like to present their reasons for non-compliance or the failure cannot
be accepted as part of reporting, a compliance investigation will be
conducted by a PST-skilled Service Officer. A financial penalty is
applied where the job seeker is unable to establish reasonable excuse.

Escalating financial penalties and payment cancellation, based on the
job seeker's penalty count, send a strong message that consistently
failing to meet requirements is not acceptable:

-   first financial penalty results is a loss of 50% of the fortnight's
    payment
-   second financial penalty results is a loss of 100% of the
    fortnight's payment
-   third financial penalty results in payment cancellation and a 4 week
    post cancellation non-payment period. Job seekers will need to
    reclaim before they can receive a participation payment again

Non-Compliance cancellation and post cancellation non-payment period

A non-compliance cancellation occurs when a job seeker:

-   fails to accept or commence suitable work (work refusal failure)
-   voluntarily leaves suitable work without reasonable excuse
    (unemployment failure)
-   is dismissed due to misconduct as a worker from suitable employment
    (unemployment failure)
-   has a third financial penalty applied for a persistent mutual
    obligation failure

Where payment is cancelled, the job seeker enters a post cancellation
non-payment period:

-   A post cancellation non-payment period is 4 weeks, or 6 weeks where
    an unemployment failure related to a relocation job has been
    committed. During this period a participation payment is not
    payable. There are no waiver provisions for job seekers in financial
    hardship during this period, however the job seeker will maintain
    concession card and benefit rate Family Tax Benefit (FTB)
    eligibility
-   At the end of, or during, the post cancellation non-payment period,
    job seekers may reclaim a participation payment. They will be
    subject to RapidConnect and, if returning to payment at the end of
    the preclusion period, they return to the zone they were in prior to
    the non-compliance cancellation

Services Australia responsibilities

Services Australia is expected to work together with providers to ensure
job seekers understand what they need to do to receive a participation
payment, and the impact non-compliance will have on their payment.

All staff have responsibility to communicate the following messages to
job seekers if they contact about a missed requirement or a
participation suspension:

-   take personal responsibility to meet your requirements
-   talk with your provider about any circumstances that may be
    affecting your ability to meet your requirements
-   Record personal events in your jobactive Calendar so your provider
    is aware
-   if there is good reason why you are unable to meet a requirement
    (such as attending an appointment or job interview, or participating
    in another activity) talk to your provider before the requirement
-   be aware of what will happen if you do not comply, and
-   if you miss a requirement, contact your provider as quickly as
    possible, within 2 business days to avoid payment suspension

Participation Solution Team (PST) skilled Service Officers with WNPPD
security resource or Service Officers who process job seeker claims and
have a UNPP security resource:

-   apply financial penalties where persistent mutual obligation
    failures are incurred without reasonable excuse (WNPPD only)
-   determine whether a work refusal (WNPPD only) or unemployment
    failure has been committed
-   cancel payments following a third persistent mutual obligation
    failure, work refusal failure or unemployment failure
-   determine payment start dates following a non-compliance preclusions
    periods or unemployment preclusions period
-   action review and appeals process for decisions made under Social
    Security Legislation

Appropriately skilled PST-skilled Service Officers with a WNPPD security
resource also conduct Capability Assessments.

Consultation with a PST Service Support Officer (SSO), PST-skilled
social worker or other specialist officer may be appropriate when
assessing the impact of job seeker circumstances on their capacity to
comply. See Accessing a PST-skilled social worker for information on
when consultation with a PST-skilled social worker may be appropriate.
