Service Profiling

Service Profiling is a method of selectively targeting Centrelink
services and Service Officer assistance to our customers. It is a way of
identifying which customers need a more focused/targeted level of
service to assist them in meeting program outcomes (for example, correct
declaration income and assets).

A Service Component is the business process which has a specific goal or
purpose. This is achieved through the completion of a number of Service
Actions. These Service Actions collectively describe the steps, tasks,
or actions involved in delivering the Service Component. For example,
the Income and Asset Service Component requires a Service Update on the
customer's income and asset details. This is done by mail contact using
an Income and Assets Update (SA220) form being sent to the customer.

Each Service Component has a unique identification (ID) number. The ID
number can be used to search the Service Component Search (PQCS) and
Service Component National Search (PQNS) screen.
