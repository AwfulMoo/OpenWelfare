Transfer of excess SFA (Group 2)

Where a secondary school student's total annual entitlement of combined
Living Allowance, Rent Assistance and Remote Area Allowance is
insufficient to meet the board charge of the school or hostel, any
excess SFA (Group 2), up to the maximum available, is transferred across
to top-up the shortfall.

Terminology and formula used

Table 1: This table describes the terminology and formula used by the
system from the coding on the School Fees and Boarding Details (EYSB)
screen to calculate a top-up from the SFA (Group 2) for payment to cover
the shortfall in boarding expenses.

-   TSFA minus SFC = available excess of SFA (Group 2)
-   BC minus TBE = shortfall in boarding entitlements
-   Top-up = the lower of the available excess SFA (Group 2) and the
    shortfall in boarding entitlements.

Scenarios

Excess SFA (Group 2) and available top-up calculations

Table 2: This table describes scenarios where an excess SFA (Group 2) is
calculated for the shortfall in boarding entitlements.

These amounts may not be current. They are examples only. For current
