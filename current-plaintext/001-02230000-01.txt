This document outlines employment assistance available for job seekers
with an illness, injury or disability. This includes Services
Australia's role in assessing and referring these job seekers to the
most appropriate services.

Types of employment assistance

There are 2 main types of employment assistance available to job seekers
with disability:

-   Workforce Australia
-   Disability Employment Services (DES)

Employment assistance tailored to job seeker needs

The type of employment assistance offered to a job seeker depends on the
level of assistance the job seeker needs to increase their capacity to
obtain and retain work. This is usually assessed in either a Job
Capacity Assessment (JCA) or an Employment Services Assessment (ESAt).

Designated remote area

Job seekers who live in a Department of Employment and Workplace
Relations designated remote area are referred to a Community Development
Program (CDP) provider. The CDP provider will provide similar services
to both Workforce Australia and DES.

Marketing employment assistance to the job seeker

Job seekers are encouraged to increase their economic and social
participation through individually tailored assistance to increase their
work capacity. Many people with a disability are keen to work, study and
participate in whatever way they can, but face significant obstacles.
Service Officers should recognise an individual's capacity for
participation and provide support and assistance for people to achieve
their potential.

The following points should be discussed with the job seeker:

-   advantages of work - income, involvement in community, self-esteem -
    suggest they watch VoDs highlighting the positive impact work and
    participation has had for some recipients of Disability Support
    Pension (DSP)
-   current circumstances, changes to condition and how it affects them.
    Investigate whether work, part-time or full-time, is of interest to
    them
-   participation in employment assistance does not affect eligibility
    for DSP or other payments
-   participation in job seeking and referral to an Employment Services
    Provider is voluntary for customers who are not in receipt of a
    payment with mutual obligation requirements or subject to DSP
    participation requirements however there are limits on the length of
    engagement and eligibility for Disability Employment Services (DES)
-   if in receipt of a payment with mutual obligation requirements or
    subject to DSP participation requirements, DES or a similar activity
    might satisfy, or contribute towards satisfying, their mutual
    obligation requirements or participation requirements
-   other payments and services that may assist in participation, for
    example, Family Day Care Services/vacation care programs,
    possibility of Mobility Allowance (MOB), State taxi transport
    subsidy
-   if engaged with DES or a Workforce Australia Employment Services
    Provider, they may be referred to Self-Employment Assistance or
    other structured programs of employment assistance

Offering employment assistance at new claim stage

-   Disability Support Pension (DSP) - Many customers may be reluctant
    to consider employment assistance before a decision is made about
    DSP eligibility. However, unless a customer is to be granted DSP
    (manifest), they are required to attend a JCA to assess the
    functional impact of their impairment and their work capacity. The
    JCA will recommend appropriate employment assistance options. A DSP
    (manifest) customer may volunteer to attend an ESAt to assess their
    employment assistance options if they wish
-   From 1 July 2014, DSP customers under 35 years of age who have a
    work capacity of 8 or more hours per week may have compulsory
    participation requirements if they meet the DSP participation
    requirements criteria. In addition to the requirement to attend DSP
    Participation Interviews and sign a DSP Participation Plan,
    customers must include at least 1 compulsory activity in their
    Participation Plan
-   Payments with mutual obligation requirements - Customers with a
    temporary incapacity are required to provide a medical certificate
    indicating that they are not fit for work. If the customer is
    assessed through an Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) as able to
    work at least 8 hours per week but less than 30 hours per week,
    their mutual obligation requirements will be modified. Customers
    with a work capacity of 8-14 hours are able to volunteer to
    participate in DES if DES is recommended in their ESAt. Customers
    with an assessed work capacity of 30+ will not be eligible for a DES
    referral
