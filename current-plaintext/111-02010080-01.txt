This document outlines the process of accessing archived audio
recordings of the interactions between customers and the Report
Employment Income (REI) Interactive Voice Response (IVR) Self-Service
channel using the Archiving and Culling Engine (ACE) application.

Audio recordings

All audio recordings of the interactions between customers and the REI
Self Service IVR are archived to ACE daily. Audio voice recording was
introduced in September 2003, and archiving of these interactions began
in October 2007. All audio voice recordings prior to this date
previously stored on hard disk have been manually loaded to ACE.

Voice recordings of all customer calls to the REI Self Service IVR are
archived under the Customer Reference Number (CRN), even though
customers who have a Customer Access Number (CAN) must use their CAN and
a Personal Identification Number (PIN) to access the service.

Every customer who authenticates and enters the REI application on an
IVR with the voice recording equipment installed has their call recorded
to the local hard drive of the voice recording equipment. This recording
commences after the authentication stage of the call so that each
customer's CRN and PIN are not stored as part of the recording. This
process is to ensure that the customer's PIN remains secret. These
recordings are uploaded to ACE each week night and are accessible to
authorised users the next working day.

The Resources page contains information on known IVR data issues and a
link to the Archiving and Culling Engine (ACE).
