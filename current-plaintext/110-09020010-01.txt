This document outlines the steps involved in accessing the Accelerated
Claimant Matching (ACM) system, how to navigate around the system and
what to do if there are any problems encountered (such as system
faults).

ACM system

The ACM system has been established to check the authenticity of new
claims and change of circumstance notifications by comparing information
provided by customers when they advise of a change of circumstances,
against data already held by Centrelink.

Where inconsistencies are identified, customers are selected for review.
This is part of a strategy of preventing incorrect payments from
starting and encouraging voluntary compliance from customers.
