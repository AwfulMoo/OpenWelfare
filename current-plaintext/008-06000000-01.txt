This document outlines information about the roles and responsibilities
of the Assessment Services and Smart Centres Coordination Branch.

Assessment Services

Assessment Services and Smart Centres Coordination Branch provides
effective and accurate assessments for use by other staff and/or
Employment Service Providers to ensure appropriate customer outcomes for
income support and/or employment services assistance.

The Australian Government funds a range of organisations to deliver the
services and interventions required to assist job seekers gain
employment. The role of Assessment Services and Smart Centres
Coordination Branch is to refer the job seeker to the correct service
that will deliver the required interventions.

There are 4 types of assessments an Assessor may conduct:

-   Job Capacity Assessment (JCA)
-   Employment Services Assessment (ESAt),
-   Medical Assessment Recommendation
-   Specialist Assessment

Employment Services Assessment (ESAt)

An ESAT is to:

-   ensure job seekers are referred to the most appropriate employment
    service assistance
-   consider barriers to finding and keeping a job due to disability,
    injury, illness, or other disadvantage
-   identify interventions to assist in overcoming those barriers
-   consider capacity to work

ESAts may also be used by Services Australia to make decisions on income
support payment qualification such as Mobility Allowance and mutual
obligation participation requirements.

Job seekers may be referred for an ESAt by Services Australia or an
employment services provider.

This referral is based on an assessment of the impact of medical
conditions and/or other identified barriers on the job seeker's capacity
to participate in work or employment services.

There are 2 types of ESAt:

-   non-medical ESAt is an assessment of job seeker circumstances that
    determines the most appropriate service where no medical condition
    is identified
-   medical ESAt is an assessment of job seeker circumstances to
    determine work capacity and the most appropriate service where a
    medical condition/s is identified

Job Capacity Assessment (JCA)

A JCA is a comprehensive assessment of an individual's level of
functional impairment and work capacity and is usually conducted to
determine Disability Support Pension (DSP) eligibility.

The assessment identifies:

-   level of functional impairment resulting from any permanent fully
    diagnosed, treated and stabilised medical conditions
-   work capacity
-   barriers to finding and maintaining employment and any
    interventions/assistance that may be required to help improve their
    current work capacity
-   Continuing Inability to Work (CITW)
-   active participation in a Program of Support (POS) when applicable

Medical Assessment Recommendation

The Medical Assessment Team (MAT) assess the medical evidence lodged for
a DSP claim to determine if:

-   manifest medical eligibility criteria is met
-   the customer is manifestly medically ineligible
-   insufficient medical evidence prevents assessment of medical
    condition/s and functional impacts
-   there are doubts about the medical evidence authenticity.
    Note: MAT or HPAU must investigate further by contacting treating
    health professionals (THPs) listed in the evidence to confirm the
    diagnosis and prognosis
-   a current and valid assessment can be used for the claim
    determination, or
-   a Job Capacity Assessment (JCA) referral is required to determine
    medical eligibility

A DSP Medical Assessment Recommendation report may be completed by an
Assessor and uploaded to the customer's record (UNSSPOC/SA479) to
clearly document:

-   the recommendation
-   evidence taken into account, and
-   if applicable, supporting evidence from the customer, their THP/s
    and/or HPAU
-   a work item is allocated to a DSP Officer to assess non-medical
    eligibility

Specialist Assessment

Specialist Assessments can be arranged to assist with completion of a
JCA report or, in some cases, an ESAt report, particularly where medical
evidence supplied to the Assessor indicates the individual may be
eligible for Disability Support Pension (DSP) and in which case the ESAt
would change to a JCA.

Specialist Assessments may also be requested by an external Government
Contracted Doctor (GCD).

Flexible service delivery

As Employment Services Assessments (ESAt) and Job Capacity Assessments
(JCA) are demand driven, referral volumes vary across locations.
Assessment Services has adopted a national flexible service delivery
model. This flexible servicing identifies the most appropriate mode of
assessment, utilising telephone by default, file assessments and
face-to-face assessments where other modes are inappropriate. It
provides equitable access to appointments for customers regardless of
where they live.

This model enables services to be delivered by appropriately skilled
service delivery employees, in any location and at any time, based on
pre-determined priorities, routing and business rules.

The flexible service delivery model assists with:

-   meeting demand and appointment coverage nationally
-   increasing session availability for customers
-   the achievement of Key Performance Measures (KPM)

Assessment Services Health Professionals

Assessors employed by Assessment Services are Health and Allied Health
Professionals with the relevant experience and skills to conduct high
quality assessments and reports.

Contributing Assessors

An Assessor's qualifications generally align with the Impairment Table/s
relevant to a customer’s primary medical condition. In situations where
they do not align, a secondary Contributing Assessor holding a
professional qualification that aligns with the relevant Impairment
Table/s reviews the medical evidence and assessment recommendations.

In some cases where the primary assessor needs specialised assistance
during a JCA, a Contributing Assessor will provide discipline specific
input to the assessment, as well as reviewing the conclusions drawn
about certain aspects of the assessment.

The team provides administrative support for Assessment Services
including:

-   booking customer appointments
-   diary management - session availability and rescheduling
-   pre-assessment reminder
-   interpreter bookings

-   various other duties

Health Professional Advisory Unit (HPAU)
