This document outlines how to process income compliance class action
settlements.

Contacting customers

A tailored servicing approach is required for incarcerated customers who
are part of the income compliance class action and eligible for a
settlement payment.

As these customers cannot contact Services Australia, they are unable to
provide the information needed to register for the class action
settlement or access their dispute options.

Where correction facilities allow, Prison Liaison Officers (PLO) will
make direct contact with these customers to:

-   obtain the information needed to process their settlement payment
-   explain the dispute options

Registration

Some incarcerated customers will need assistance to register for the
class action settlement. Auto registration will occur for those who have
received an income compliance refund.

The Resources page contains links to the Correctional facilities
intranet page, debt categories, Services Australia and Gordon Legal
websites, FAQs to help staff answer enquiries, DOC templates.
