This is a Family and Domestic Violence Interaction Point. If the
customer is with another person, on speaker phone, or already identified
with family and domestic violence concerns, continue with the current
business conversation. Otherwise, go to the Family and domestic violence
procedure to conduct the risk identification and referral process.

This document outlines information on changing the BasicsCard daily
spend limit and maximum card balance limits on a customer's existing
BasicsCard. It also outlines how a customer can opt-in or opt-out of the
Residual Payment method.

Customer consent

A customer/payment nominee can request to vary their BasicsCard
allocation method, daily spend limit and/or maximum card balance to suit
their spending needs.

Prior to any changes being processed, a customer must provide consent.
Under no circumstances should a customer be forced into a change.

Limits for the BasicsCard

Daily Spend Limit: A customer can request to set this limit between $20
and $1500. If the BasicsCard daily spend limit is reached for a 24 hour
period (midnight to midnight), the customer will be required to wait
until midnight before the daily spend limit resets and additional
purchases using their BasicsCard can be made.

Maximum Card Balance: A customer can request to set this limit between
$100 and $3000.

A customer may request to lower the daily spend or maximum card balance
limits of their BasicsCard, however, if that customer is deemed as
'vulnerable', appropriate referrals should be made.

While there is no longer a requirement for a Service Officer to make
contact with a Service Officer from the customer's local office or a
senior officer involved in the initial decrease of the limits, Service
Officer should ensure a full assessment of the customer's circumstances
is undertaken and any appropriate referrals made.

Allocation Method

From 13 June 2016 there will be changes to the way customers receive
funds to their BasicsCard. All customers will be transitioned onto one
of two models – the Residual Payment method or the Partial Payment
method.

Customers are able to change their BasicsCard allocation method by
contacting the agency.

[] Customers can also allocate funds to their BasicsCard through online
services or by contacting Services Australia. See Coding Income
Management Expenses for more information on allocating funds to the
BasicsCard.

Customer vulnerability

Many income managed customers are vulnerable and require specialist
assistance such as an Interpreter, Indigenous Service Officer or Social
Worker. To determine if a customer would be assessed as 'vulnerable' and
require further assistance, check the following:

-   Display on Access (DOA) DOC
-   evidence of recent social work contact
-   evidence of recent injury or medical treatment
-   customer is very young or very old
-   customer has language difficulties
-   lots of other people are interested in the customer's finances
-   large amounts of unallocated funds
-   evidence of lack of understanding about Income Management
-   evidence of a lack of financial literacy or consumer issues/rights,
    particularly when the customer is making a large one-off purchase

These indicators will assist Service Officers to determine when a
referral for specialist assistance such as an interpreter, Indigenous
Service Officer or social worker is required.
