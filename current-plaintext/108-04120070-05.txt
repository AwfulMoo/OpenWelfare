|                                   | below the applicable FTB limit.   |
|                                   | This is because FTB is assessed   |
|                                   | on 'taxable income' not 'ordinary |
|                                   | income' and may include           |
|                                   | non-allowable deductions such as  |
|                                   | income equalisation and land      |
|                                   | conservation expenses.            |
