This document outlines the role of an SSO in TPS/Floorwalkers (FLW) in
Smart Centres.

SSO role

SSOs are responsible for coordinating the completion of escalations
generated by Service Officers, TPS and FLW staff from their Smart Centre
or other Smart Centres within their footprint. Staff other than SSOs,
including high performing TPS/FLW staff, or staff in the SSO development
pool, can be used in processing these escalations.

It is expected that escalations will be dealt with in a timely manner.
Any referrals must be followed up on a regular basis to ensure
completion as soon as possible. Escalation DOCs must be on customer
records and updated regularly with the latest information.

All SSOs with the required skill are to help daily with escalations
submitted under the Direct Referral to SSO process.

intranet page and the level 2 helpdesk referral forms.
