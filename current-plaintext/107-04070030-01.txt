This document outlines information on raising and recovering debts for

On this Page:

Situations that may cause an overpayment

Service Officers are to raise DAP debts for the full or partial amount
of DAP paid:

to a customer by mistake as a result of an administrative error

to a customer for a period when they were not eligible

for a period of time in which the customer was deceased

as a result of a breach of the Paid Parental Leave Act 2010, which
includes:

-   fraud
-   a false statement, or
-   a misrepresentation

Recovery of DAP debts

Services Australia can recover DAP debts via:

-   cash repayments
-   withholding repayments from current Centrelink payments
-   garnishees
-   referral to a collection agent
-   legal proceedings (civil recovery)

Service Australia may request refunds from third parties where:

-   a payment is made to the wrong person, or
-   the person is deceased

Other debts are not recoverable from DAP payments.

Payment Summary

If a Payment Summary has generated on the system that includes a
recovered DAP amount.

Issue an amended payment summary if there is a change to the taxable
amount. A manual adjustment may be required in some cases.

The amended Payment Summary is also available to customers through a
range of self service options. See Centrelink Payment Summaries for
