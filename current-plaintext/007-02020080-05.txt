Scenarios

Past periods and manual procedures

This table describes scenarios of blended families. Currently the FAO
system is not able to process a Family Tax Benefit (FTB) claim from a
customer in the situations described below if the other party has
already received the full entitlement. The manual procedure described in
this procedure must be used.

|                                   | In normal circumstances, blended  |
|                                   | family assessments cannot be      |
|                                   | retrospectively applied. However, |
|                                   | when a couple separates, section  |
|                                   | 29 of the Family Assistance Act   |
|                                   | (1999) can also be applied to     |
|                                   | blended family couples.           |
|                                   | Therefore, this can apply if the  |
|                                   | couple has not been assessed      |
|                                   | correctly as a blended family     |
|                                   | when they became partnered.       |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Robert and Sarah became a couple, |
|                                   | both having 2 children each from  |
|                                   | a previous relationship. When     |
|                                   | they advised of their             |
|                                   | relationship, a blended family    |
|                                   | situation was not set up. While   |
|                                   | they were a couple, Sarah claimed |
|                                   | FTB for the 2 children only.      |
|                                   | Robert has always claimed FTB as  |
|                                   | a lump sum.                       |

|                                   | After the couple separates,       |
|                                   | Robert lodges a lump sum claim    |
|                                   | for Robert's 2 children , however |
|                                   | this is rejected reason PEC       |

|                                   | claim covers a period when Robert |
|                                   | was partnered. Under blended      |
|                                   | family rules, they both needed to |
|                                   | claim via the same method.        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Sarah and Robert would be         |
|                                   | entitled to share the FTB for all |
|                                   | 4 children during the partnered   |
|                                   | period.                           |

|                                   | In this case, Robert would be     |

|                                   | legislative entitlement. Sarah    |
|                                   | cannot incur an overpayment due   |

|                                   | John and Amy were partnered       |
|                                   | during the 2015-2016 financial    |
|                                   | year. Amy received FTB by         |
|                                   | instalments for this period. The  |
|                                   | couple separate on 27 July 2016.  |
|                                   | John lodges a lump sum claim for  |
|                                   | the 2015-2016 financial year on 5 |
|                                   | August 2016.                      |

|                                   | John's claim should be rejected.  |

|                                   | John is not entitled to FTB as    |
|                                   | Amy has already been paid for     |
|                                   | this period. John has received    |
|                                   | the benefit of this payment when  |
|                                   | they were a couple.               |

|                                   | Note: if Amy receives a top-up as |
|                                   | a result of reconciliation after  |
|                                   | the date of separation, policy    |
|                                   | allows Amy to retain this         |
|                                   | payment.                          |

|                                   | Each claimant's share of FTB will |
|                                   | depend on the care arrangements   |
|                                   | while the couple were partnered.  |
|                                   | The claimants may agree on the    |
|                                   | percentage of care they had for   |
|                                   | each FTB child, providing the     |
|                                   | percentages add to 100%. In       |
|                                   | situations where the claimants do |
|                                   | not agree on the percentage of    |
|                                   | care, an assessment of their      |
|                                   | actual care arrangements for the  |
|                                   | past period will be made (the     |
|                                   | methodology for calculating the   |
|                                   | percentage is the same as any     |
|                                   | other shared care case).          |
