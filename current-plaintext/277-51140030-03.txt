|                                   | If they want Child Support to     |
|                                   | collect any arrears, they can ask |
|                                   | for the full amount to be         |
|                                   | collected or indicate a lesser    |
|                                   | amount. Note: if an individual    |
|                                   | opts to change from Child Support |
|                                   | collect to private collect, they  |
|                                   | can elect to collect any arrears  |
|                                   | of child support owing to them.   |
|                                   | This has the effect of            |
|                                   | discharging Child Support from    |
|                                   | the responsibility for collecting |
|                                   | the arrears. Instead the          |
|                                   | individual is responsible for     |
|                                   | collecting the arrears, this      |
|                                   | needs to be recorded as child     |
|                                   | support income. The discharged    |
|                                   | arrears amount is not included in |
|                                   | the entitlement data from Child   |
|                                   | Support therefore the discharged  |
|                                   | amount will need to be added to   |
|                                   | the Child Support assessed amount |
|                                   | and manually coded as the total   |
|                                   | actual amount. Refer to Recording |

|                                   | further details. The customer may |
|                                   | ask Child Support to continue to  |
