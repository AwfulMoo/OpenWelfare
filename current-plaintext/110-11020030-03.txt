|                                   | considered admissible as          |
|                                   | evidence.                         |

|                                   | suffice. This is the preferred    |
|                                   | approach. However, it may be      |
|                                   | necessary to produce some         |
|                                   | documents or records via a        |
|                                   | certificate.                      |

|                                   | in relation to certain evidence   |
|                                   | that allows it to be received in  |
|                                   | courts as prima facie evidence.   |
|                                   | Certificates need to be drafted   |
|                                   | based on certain conditions       |
|                                   | relating to the provision of law. |
|                                   | For example, a certificate        |
|                                   | pursuant to s155A Evidence Act    |
|                                   | (Cth) can be used to admit a      |
