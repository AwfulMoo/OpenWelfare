+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Medicare Compensation Recovery    | A Commonwealth program            |
|                                   | administered by Services          |
|                                   | Australia, to recover Medicare    |
|                                   | benefits, nursing home benefits,  |
|                                   | residential care subsidies and    |
|                                   | home care subsidies paid on       |
|                                   | behalf of a person in relation to |
|                                   | an injury/illness where more than |
|                                   | $5,000 has been awarded in        |
|                                   | compensation or where a           |
|                                   | reimbursement arrangement has     |
|                                   | been entered into more than 6     |
|                                   | months after a compensation claim |
|                                   | has been lodged.                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This is to prevent double-dipping |
|                                   | in compensation cases. That is,   |
|                                   | so the Commonwealth is reimbursed |
|                                   | for subsidies and benefits paid   |
|                                   | for medical services which were   |
|                                   | provided to a person (bulk-billed |
|                                   | or subsidised) by the government  |
|                                   | who has been compensated for      |
|                                   | those services.                   |
