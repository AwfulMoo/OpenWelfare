|                                   | review B and review A is also     |
|                                   | linked to review C, then review B |
|                                   | is not linked to review C, this   |
|                                   | must be done manually. Links,     |
|                                   | however work both ways, so review |
|                                   | B is obviously linked to review A |
|                                   | even though the linking was       |
|                                   | initiated from review A.          |
