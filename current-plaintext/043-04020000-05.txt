| 1                                 | Creating a trust                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Trusts may be established by law  |
|                                   | or by individuals. They may also  |
|                                   | be declared to exist by a court   |
|                                   | although no documentation         |
|                                   | establishing a trust exists.      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A settlor or creator may provide  |
|                                   | the initial contribution to start |
|                                   | the trust or a trust may be       |
|                                   | established on the death of a     |
|                                   | person to hold the residue of     |
|                                   | their estate. A trust may also be |
|                                   | formed to hold monies awarded by  |
|                                   | a court (for example, transport   |
|                                   | accident compensation).           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Private trusts created by the     |
|                                   | express and intentional           |
|                                   | declaration of the individual,    |
|                                   | usually in the form of a deed or  |
|                                   | will, are referred to as express  |
|                                   | trusts. Most of the private       |
|                                   | trusts that the Complex           |
|                                   | Assessment Officer (CAO) will be  |
|                                   | assessing are of this type.       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | However, there are occasions      |
|                                   | where a customer claims that a    |
|                                   | trust exists even though there is |
|                                   | no trust deed or will. In these   |
|                                   | cases, Services Australia may     |
|                                   | need to seek legal advice in      |
|                                   | order to determine whether a      |
|                                   | trust exists or not. These types  |
|                                   | of trusts may be referred to as   |
|                                   | constructive, resulting, secret,  |
|                                   | implied or presumptive trusts.    |

|                                   | A trust that is not trading may   |
|                                   | be referred to as 'dormant'. This |
|                                   | does not mean the trust has       |
|                                   | ceased to exist or been wound up. |
|                                   | It may however, indicate that no  |
|                                   | tax returns have been lodged with |
|                                   | the Australian Tax Office (ATO)   |
|                                   | for a number of years. A trust    |
|                                   | that is dormant may still hold    |
|                                   | assets.                           |

|                                   | If a customer states they are     |
|                                   | involved in a private trust that  |
|                                   | is dormant, the documents         |
|                                   | required to assess a private      |
|                                   | trust will need to be obtained    |
|                                   | before an assessment can be made  |
|                                   | by the CAO of the customer's      |
|                                   | income and assets in respect of   |
|                                   | their involvement in that trust.  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the dormant trust has no       |
|                                   | income and no assets or           |
|                                   | liabilities then under common law |
|                                   | it is deemed to be vested.        |

|                                   | necessarily mean that the trust   |
|                                   | has been wound up. The trust may  |
|                                   | continue to operate with a        |
|                                   | natural person taking on the role |
|                                   | of trustee in place of the        |
|                                   | corporate trustee.                |

|                                   | perpetuity period is the period   |
|                                   | the trust is intended to operate  |
|                                   | before being wound up. The        |
|                                   | vesting date is the date the      |
|                                   | trust funds are intended to be    |
|                                   | vested, that is transferred, to   |

|                                   | A trust may be wound up before    |
|                                   | the intended vesting date. For    |
|                                   | example, a trust may become       |
|                                   | insolvent and enter an agreement  |
|                                   | whereby it pays out creditors a   |
|                                   | certain amount of cents per       |
|                                   | dollar owing.                     |

|                                   | A solvent trust may also wind up  |
|                                   | before the vesting date in        |
|                                   | accordance with the rules of the  |
|                                   | trust deed. For example, the      |
|                                   | trustee may distribute all the    |
|                                   | capital of the trust. For         |
|                                   | example, all living beneficiaries |
|                                   | of a will may agree that a        |
|                                   | deceased estate be wound up.      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Once the trust is thus wound up   |
|                                   | or vested, the trustee company    |
|                                   | may be de-registered or           |
|                                   | liquidated Since a trust derives  |
|                                   | its legal status from its         |
|                                   | trustee, if the trustee is a      |
|                                   | company, then it may also need to |

|                                   | (providing the company does not   |

|                                   | Creditors of a trust may be of    |

|                                   | unsecured. Secured creditors hold |

|                                   | for, as guarantee of payment of,  |
|                                   | a debt owing by the trust.        |

|                                   | A secured creditor may call in    |
|                                   | the security held and sell or     |
|                                   | realise the asset to recover the  |
|                                   | monies owed to them. If there is  |

|                                   | owed to the secured creditor and  |
|                                   | the value of the security, the    |
|                                   | balance owing to the creditor is  |
|                                   | treated in a similar manner to    |

|                                   | creditors. If the amount realised |
|                                   | on the sale of the security is    |
|                                   | more than the amount owed to the  |
|                                   | secured creditor, the balance     |
|                                   | reverts to the trust.             |
