Timeframes and fees

The time taken for the individual financial institution to credit a
customer's account may vary depending on if:

-   they are large financial institution using an automated process or a
    smaller financial institution using a manual process
-   the account is overdrawn

Customers must be told the payment will be delivered by close of
business on the day the payment was processed (next day for some Credit
Unions and Building Societies).

Staff are to make sure customers understand that fees or charges may be
applied by the financial institution, depending on the terms and
conditions of their account and if a manual process is used.

The amount of the fees or charges are decided by the financial
institution.

Specific RTGS time frames and fees information is not available to
Services Australia.

Issue Future Payment (IFP) screen codes

Table 1: Note: staff need to assess the language used by the customer
and determine the correct code to use. For example, the customer may say
they have a crisis. However, the correct code would be an urgent payment
using the code extraordinary circumstances (ECI). Incorrect use of a
code may affect ongoing customer entitlement to immediate payments.
