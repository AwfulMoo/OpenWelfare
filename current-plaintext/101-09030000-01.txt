This document outlines information on how Services Australia conducts
reviews on Third Party Organisations (TPO) to ensure they are meeting
the terms of its contract/agreement with the agency.

TPO in this file is defined as businesses/merchants/participants.

TPO contracts

The agency enters into contracts/agreements with Third Party
Organisations (TPO) to deliver various services to customers. Reviews
are carried out to ensure that TPOs are complying with its
contract/agreement with the agency.

The Deduction and Confirmation Branch manages the following programs
where services are provided for customers in partnership with a TPO.

-   BasicsCard (BCD)
-   Centrelink Confirmation e-Services (CCeS)
-   Electronic Verification of Rent (EVoR)
-   Income Management Schedule 4 (IM4)
-   Income Management Schedule 5 (IM5)
-   Rent Deduction Scheme (RDS)
-   Centrepay

The BasicsCard is an agreement between the agency and the TPO, whereby
the TPO agrees to abide by the BasicsCard Merchant Terms, BasicsCard
Merchant Application and any Special Conditions referred to in the
Approval Letter.

The TPOs participating in the other programs also enter into an
agreement with the agency (Income Management currently under a contract
arrangement). This is comprised of the agency's Business Terms and
Conditions, pertaining to each program, the Business Application, the
Approval Letter and any Special/Additional Conditions required in
addition to the Terms and Conditions. CCeS, Centrepay and EVoR
agreements are comprised of Policy and Terms, a Procedural Guide and can
have a variation to the Terms or additional conditions. RDS is also an
agreement between the agency and State Housing Authorities. Each state
has its own agreement for the provision of a direct deduction facility -
RDS and a Service Level Standards agreement.

These documents are the conditions that each TPO must abide by to be
eligible to participate in the program.

TPOs may have multiple contracts/agreements with the agency, and when a
review is conducted the agency reviews all of the programs the TPO has
with the agency).

Conducting a review

The agency's right to conduct a review is contained in the Policy and
Terms.

The Resources page contains links to the relevant documents for each
program.

Reviews undertaken

The agency conducts reviews to:

-   ensure the TPO is complying with its obligations in the
    contract/agreement and continues to meet the approval and
    eligibility criteria
-   protect customers from any TPO actions in breach of the
    contract/agreement that may disadvantage them
-   protect customer privacy
-   follow up complaints and feedback about TPOs from customers, welfare
    agencies, other government departments and regulatory bodies
-   help TPOs to better manage a relationship with the agency and our
    customers and help them fulfil the obligations of the contract
    and/or agreement

Selecting TPOs to review

Reviews are selected either randomly or can be specifically selected and
added manually. The Deduction and Confirmation Branch may set annual
targets and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the number of reviews
that need to be completed. There are certain criteria for selecting
random reviews based on the following:

-   Random sampling
-   TPOs not reviewed within the last 12 months
-   TPOs previously deemed non-compliant
-   Annual turnover percentage of excluded goods and services
    (BasicsCard)
-   Income Management (IM) TPOs risk factors by Service Reason
-   CCeS/Centrepay TPOs by business category risk/Service Reason

Manual reviews can be selected on the basis of:

-   customer complaints received including those recorded in the
    Integrated Customer Feedback Database (ICFD)
-   complaints made by external organisations
-   public denunciations and 'tip-offs'
-   evidence of excessive fallback transactions (BCD)
-   analysis of transaction data (BCD)
-   analysis of Customer Record Access Monitor (CRAM) Reports (CCeS)
-   analysis of Deduction Authorities and Itemised Deduction Statements
    (Centrepay)
-   geographic location
-   triggered data events

Overview of the review process

Conduct a background check first

-   Check the Australian Business Number (ABN/ACN) is current, check the
    entity type
-   Check if the TPO has had a general activity (GND) and if any
    licences are required and current. Refer to Actioning a review for
    Third Party Organisations for more information regarding licence
    checks

Contact TPO to arrange a review

-   Send the letter notifying the TPO of the date and time the review
    has been scheduled
-   Include a request of the relevant information needed to complete the
    review (Baseline check reviews may not require any contact with the
    TPO, for example some National Merchants such as Coles or
    Woolworths. In this case a letter of notification is not required)

Conduct the review (desk based)

-   Date of the review should be the same date the workflow is run

Enter the results in the Customer First (CF) Organisation Review
workflow

If the review outcome is 'Compliant' advise TPO of the satisfactory
outcome

If the review outcome is 'Non-Compliant' send a remedy notice,
requesting the TPO to remedy its breach of the Contract/Agreement

Follow up the remedy notice by conducting a re-review to check TPO
compliance

If the TPO does not reply to the remedy notice or is found to be
non-compliant in the re-review

-   A show cause (potential of revocation) letter or, for Centrepay, an
    intent to suspend letter is to be sent
-   Thereafter a full or partial suspension may be imposed or withdrawal
    of approval of the contract may occur
-   If a National Merchant is being reviewed from the Coles/Woolworths
    group or Australia Post and a breach is identified, a referral
    should be sent to Deduction and Confirmation Branch - Business,
    Online and Assurance Team

Terminations - withdrawal of approval in some instances, only occurs
after consultation with the Branch, the Corporate and Commercial Legal
Branch, and Department of Social Services (DSS) (if BasicsCard)

The questions asked in the review by the reviewer are based on the terms
and policy of the Contract/Agreement.

Possible outcomes

The possible results from a review are, the TPO is:

-   Compliant (Assurance met)
-   Non-Compliant (Assurance not met)
-   Terminated (withdrawal action complete)
-   Voluntary Withdrawal (exclude - withdrawal trigger)

If the review result is Non-Compliant, the reviewer has the option to
select the outcome of:

-   Business Integrity escalation
-   Remedy notice
-   Show Cause
-   Warning

If a TPO is found to be Non-Compliant, they are required to remedy the
breach and submit to the agency in writing how they will address each
breach and how they will prevent non-compliance in the future.

If a TPO is unable to comply with the Terms and Policy or does not
remedy an identified breach, the agency may terminate the agreement.
