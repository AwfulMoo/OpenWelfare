From 17 March 2021, Income Management (IM) customers based in the
Northern Territory (NT) can permanently transition to the Cashless Debit
Card (CDC) program. Customers on an income support payment who are
living in the NT and are not currently on IM, will be able to volunteer
for the Cashless Debit Card (CDC) from this date.
For more information on this process or to initiate an IM to CDC
transition, see Income Management (IM) to Cashless Debit Card (CDC)
Transition in the Northern Territory, which also contains staff
resources and links to the transition overview Intranet page for
additional information.

This document outlines Income Management under the Vulnerable Welfare
Payment Recipients (VWPR) measure.

VWPR Income Management

To be eligible for VWPR Income Management, customers must be in receipt
of a category H welfare payment and:

-   reside within a VWPR Income Management area
-   not be income managed under a measure that is higher in the
    hierarchy of Income Management measures
-   not have an excluded payment nominee for Income Management purposes,
    and
-   have been assessed as a Vulnerable Welfare Payment Recipient by a
    social worker, or
-   under 25 years and automatically identified for Income Management
    due to their circumstances

Social worker assessed VWPR Income Management

Services Australia social workers can assess customers as a Vulnerable
Welfare Payment Recipient and place them on Income Management.

When determining whether Income Management is suitable for a customer
who has one of the following vulnerability indicators:

-   financial hardship
-   financial exploitation
-   failure to undertake reasonable self-care
-   homelessness or risk of homelessness

Social workers will consider:

-   whether the customer is meeting their and their family's priority
    needs, and
-   whether Income Management is an appropriate support tool for the
    customer to meet their responsibilities, build and maintain
    self-care and manage their finances

Before referring a customer for an Income Management social work
assessment Service Officers must ensure the customer resides in an
Income Management location, or is currently subject to Income
Management. For information on when social work referrals can be made
for both income managed and non-income managed customers, see the
Resources tab in Social work service referral

VWPR Youth Income Management

Customers will automatically be identified for VWPR Youth Income
Management if they are:

-   under 16 years of age and in receipt of a Special Benefit (SpB-USY)
-   aged 16 years or over and in receipt of the Unreasonable to Leave at
    Home (UTLAH) rate of Youth Allowance (YA), Disability Support
    Pension (DSP) or ABSTUDY Living Allowance or
-   under 25 years and received a Crisis Payment (CrP) within the last
    13 weeks due to release from prison or psychiatric confinement

Customers will not be identified for Income Management if they are
full-time students or Australian apprentices, or currently on Voluntary
Income Management (VIM).

Duration of VWPR Income Management

-   Social worker assessed VWPR: A Vulnerable notice is generally for a
    period of 12 months, however a social can end the notice prior to
    this date. After 12 months, a social worker will make a new
    determination and may extend the notice provided the customer still
    meets the criteria.
-   VWPR Youth - UTLAH and SpB-SUY customers: Income Management is for a
    one-off period of 12 months. When a customer has completed 12
    months, they will be automatically exited from VWPR Youth Income
    Management. Customers cannot be identified for Income Management
    under these categories for a second time, however they may become
    eligible if they receive a Crisis Payment upon release from prison
    or psychiatric confinement.
-   VWPR Youth - CrP customers: Income Management will be for a period
    of 12 months. Eligibility for VWPR Youth Income Management under
    this category can apply again after the initial 12 month period.

Note: VWPR Youth customers' Income Management will end if they are
granted an exclusion or they no longer have the applicable trigger
reason and request to exit Income Management.

Percentage of payments income managed

Under VWPR Income Management:

-   50% of a customer's regular fortnightly category I welfare payment
    (which includes category H welfare payment) are income managed, and
-   100% of lump sum payments are income managed

There are specific payments not income managed.

Exclusions from VWPR Youth Income Management

Customers will automatically be granted an exclusion from VWPR Youth
Income Management if they have received less than 25% of their maximum
basics rate of payment for at least 4 out of the last 6 fortnights.
Non-payment periods or reduced rates of payment due to non-compliance
are not included when determining eligibility. However, customers may
request to be assessed for this exclusion if they believe they meet this
criteria. The Income Management and Assessment Team (IMEAT) are
responsible for determining these exclusions.

A Services Australia social worker is responsible for assessing all
other requests for an exclusion from VWPR Youth Income Management.

For more information about exclusions and referrals for an assessment,
see Exclusions for automatically triggered Vulnerable Welfare Payment
Recipients (VWPR) Youth Income Management for Service Officers.

Note: customers who have been assessed as a Vulnerable Welfare Payment
Recipient by a social worker cannot apply for an exclusion. However,
these customers can request a reconsideration of their circumstances.
For more information see Reviewing, reconsidering and ending Vulnerable
Welfare Payment Recipient (VWPR) Notices assessed by social workers.
