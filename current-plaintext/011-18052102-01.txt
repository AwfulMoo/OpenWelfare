This document outlines how payments for the Disaster Health Care
Assistance Scheme (DHCAS) are processed.

Payment run process details

The Disaster Health Care Assistance Scheme (DHCAS) system does not have
an automated payment process. In order for a payment to be made to
either the claimant or their provider/supplier, a payment run
spreadsheet has to be created and completed manually. This spreadsheet
is used to record the details of the payments that are due to be made in
that payment run. Once completed, quality checked and approved, the
payment run spreadsheet is emailed to the department’s Finance section
cc’ing in Program Management.

The Resources page contains a link to contact details for DHCAS.
