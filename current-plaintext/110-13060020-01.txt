This document outlines how and when to record contact details and place
a Customer Compliance intervention on hold.

IRS contact screen coding

IRS contact screen coding is required for all inbound and outbound phone
or mail contact with customers, nominees and third parties. It is also
used to code escalations to the Compliance Assurance and Debt Operations
Division helpdesks and for Workload Management.

Contact is initiated by coding the Review Contact Summary (IRCS) screen.
Details of each contact are then coded on the Review Contact Details
(IRCD) screen. These screens display all contacts over the life of the
intervention.

Contacts with a future expected date of response must be put on hold
(HLD). This removes them from current workloads until the expected
response date.

Coding the IRCS/IRCD screen does not negate the requirement to record
information in the intervention DOC.
