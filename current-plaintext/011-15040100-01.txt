This document outlines information about a notice of judgment or
settlement for Medicare Compensation Recovery.

Notice of judgment or settlement

A notice of judgment or settlement advises Services Australia (the
agency):

-   that the compensation payer has reached judgment, or
-   settlement regarding a claim for an amount greater than $5,000
    (including all costs for settlements, and excluding costs for
    judgments)

The notice may be given:

-   on the Notice of judgment or settlement form (MO022), or
-   in writing

See: Notifiable and not notifiable claims for Medicare Compensation
Recovery.

Valid notice to be received within 28 days

Under section 23 of the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act
1995, a valid notice of judgment or settlement must be:

-   given by the compensation payer (or their solicitor/agent), and
-   received by the agency in writing, within 28 days after the date the
    amount of compensation was fixed

Appealed cases: A notice of judgment should only be given after:

-   All applicable time limits for lodging an appeal have expired, and
-   The appeal and all subsequent appeals have been finally disposed of

Failure to give notice within 28 days

Under section 29(3) of the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act
1995, if a valid notice of judgment or settlement is not received by the
agency within 28 days of the amount of compensation was fixed, the
compensation payer is liable to repay any debts identified in the notice
of charge.

Centrelink clearance

If there is an amount payable to Centrelink under Part 3.14 of the
Social Security Act 1991 (SS Act), an advance payment can still be made
to the agency without committing an offence under the SS Act.
Alternatively, the compensation payer may choose to wait for a notice of
charge.

Regardless of amounts payable to Centrelink, section 29(3) is still a
requirement to provide the valid notice of judgment or settlement to the
agency within 28 days.

If section 29(3) applies, see Step 3 in Table 2 for assessing and
processing an s29(3) case for advance payments.

Contents of a valid notice

The compensation payer is encouraged to use the agency 'Notice of
judgment or settlement' form (MO022). Alternatively, the notice may be
given to the agency in any other form or letter provided all required
information is supplied. See Mandatory checks for Medicare Compensation
Recovery for form versions to accept.

The Resources page contains a link to the 'Notice of judgment or
settlement' form.

The notice of judgment or settlement must include the below information:

-   Injured person's name, address and date of birth
-   Date of injury
-   Nature of the injury
-   Names of all the parties to the judgment or settlement (including
    address of compensation payer when registering the case)
-   Date (if any) by which the amount of compensation is required to be
    paid
-   Amount of compensation to be paid
-   Whether the compensation payer intends to make an advance payment
-   If the injured person has been notified by the compensation payer
    that it intends to make an advance payment
-   If the amount of compensation represents (in whole or part) a
    redemption of the entitlements to compensation by periodic payments
-   If the amount of compensation was fixed on the basis that liability
    for the injury was apportioned between the injured person and the
    compensation payer due to contributory negligence
-   The percentage (if any) by which the amount of compensation has been
    reduced as a result of the apportionment of liability. The provision
    will have been satisfied if the notice includes the percentage of
    apportionment attributed to the injured person
-   Full name of the person signing on behalf of the compensation payer,
    the compensation payer or compensation payer's solicitor
-   Valid signature of the compensation payer or compensation payer’s
    solicitor (cannot be transferred from supporting documents)

The date the amount of compensation was fixed (date of judgment or
settlement) is not a legislative requirement but is required for the
notice to be considered valid. Where the date of judgment or settlement
is missing from the notice, it can be obtained by telephone from the
compensation payer or their solicitor. All other information must be
supplied in writing for the notice to be considered valid.

The document will be considered valid and complete when some of the
information listed above has not been provided on the notice or form but
can be obtained from supporting documentation such as:

-   Consent judgment
-   Deed of release/discharge
-   Terms of settlement
-   Complying agreement for workers compensation
-   Court order or judgment

Note: the agency will accept hand written amendments to documents as
long as they are initialled and signed by all relevant parties.

Where the notice or supporting documents are missing some required
information but include the injured person’s details (name, address and
date of birth), the date of injury, the nature of injury and the
compensation payer’s name and address, the case must be registered in
the Compensation Case Management System (CCMS).

It is preferable for all mandatory information to be included in the
notice of judgment or settlement, or the supporting documents listed
above. Missing information that can be provided in an email or letter
from the compensation payer or their solicitor responding to our request
for it includes:

-   Date (if any) by which the amount of compensation is required to be
    paid
-   Amount of compensation to be paid
-   Whether the compensation payer intends to make an advance payment
-   If the injured person has been notified by the compensation payer
    that it intends to make an advance payment
-   If the amount of compensation represents (in whole or part) a
    redemption of the entitlements to compensation by periodic payments
-   If the amount of compensation was fixed on the basis that liability
    for the injury was apportioned between the injured person and the
    compensation payer due to contributory negligence
-   The percentage (if any) by which the amount of compensation has been
    reduced as a result of the apportionment of liability. The provision
    will have been satisfied if the notice includes the percentage of
    apportionment attributed to the injured person

See:

-   Legal and requests for information for Medicare Compensation
    Recovery, and
-   Mandatory checks for Medicare Compensation Recovery

Amount to be recovered

The agency is required to recover the:

-   Total amount of Medicare benefits, nursing home benefits,
    residential care subsidies and home care subsidies (Care Costs) paid
    in relation to the compensable injury or illness. The agency only
    recovers those benefits and subsidies paid between the date of
    injury or illness and the date the amount of compensation was fixed
-   Past expenses fixed by a judgment that specifies an amount for
    medical care; nursing home care, residential care or home care
    already incurred
-   An amount up to, but not exceeding the total amount of compensation
    fixed under a judgment or settlement, less any amounts payable under
    Part 3.14 of the Social Security Act 1991

The References page provides links to legislation.

See: Care costs for Medicare Compensation Recovery

Notice of past benefits becomes the notice of charge

If a notice of past benefits was issued in the last 6 months, the notice
of past benefits becomes the notice of charge at the time of judgment or
settlement, and the compensation payer cannot make an advance payment.

The agency will accept payment of a recently expired notice of past
benefits provided the notice of past benefits:

-   has only expired within 28 days from the date the amount of
    compensation was fixed under judgment or settlement, and
-   would otherwise have been valid (for example, relates to the date
    and nature of injury/illness for which the compensation was paid)

This must be processed outside CCMS. The Process page contains
information, see Step 7 in Table 1.

No valid charge on the date of judgment or settlement

If on the date of judgment or settlement there was no valid notice of
charge, the agency has a maximum of 3 months to issue a notice of charge
to:

-   The injured person, if the compensation payer has made an advance
    payment to the agency, or
-   The compensation payer

Where an advance payment has been made, the 3 month time limit to issue
a notice begins from the latest date of receipt of either:

-   A complete and valid notice of judgment or settlement from the
    compensation payer, or
-   The advance payment

If:

-   an extension was granted to return a statement by claimant and
-   the new due date to return the statement is after the section 33D(1)
    date

the new 33D date is 28 days after the new statement return date.

See Notice of past benefits and notice of charge for Medicare
Compensation Recovery.

Issue a Medicare history statement and declaration where:

-   an advance payment has been made, and
-   the compensation payer has no intention of paying a notice of charge
    that expired within 28 days of date of judgment or settlement
-   the section 33D date has not passed

Do not issue a Medicare history statement and declaration if the agency
has failed to issue a notice of charge by the due date under:

-   section 33D: pay the whole of the advance payment to the injured
    person under section 33K, discharging their liability to pay any
    amounts owing, or
-   section 24(4): issue z2438 Notice of charge- reconciled to the
    compensation payer, discharging their liability to pay any amounts
    owing

No interest payable on section 33D/K cases

Under the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995 section 33D,
from 1 July 2020 where a case failed to meet the date for issue of the
notice of past benefits –advance payment, the agency ceased:

-   paying interest on the advance payment it held, and
-   advising the claimant of interest payable

If a customer enquires about interest payable on a section 33D/K case,
tell them that interest will only be payable if they can provide in
writing the law that requires the agency to pay interest. S33M of the
Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995 does not require the
agency to pay interest.

Total costs not known when notice given to the agency

-   The Medicare Compensation Recovery Notice of judgment or settlement
    form (MO022) asks the compensation payer to tell the agency of the
    total amount of compensation including all legal costs
-   If the only missing information is the costs are not yet known, no
    further follow up or letter is required. Proceed with processing

See: Mandatory checks for Medicare Compensation Recovery

For both judgments and settlements with costs unknown, where the total
amount compensated is less than or equal to $5,000, determine the case
is not notifiable

If the case is:

-   registered, process in CCMS
-   not registered, issue z2654 Compensation claim not notifiable, and
    return any payment made

See: Notifiable and not notifiable claims for Medicare Compensation
Recovery

If the total amount compensated is over $5,000 proceed with processing.
That is, issue a Medicare history statement if required

If costs are:

-   available when processing the notice of judgment or settlement,
    enter the total amount awarded including costs
-   not available, enter the total amount awarded as advised (excluding
    costs)

The Process page contains information for processing cases where total
costs are unknown, see Table 1

The Resources page contains links to forms, letters and email templates.
