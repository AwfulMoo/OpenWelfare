This document explains details about a notice of judgment or settlement
for Medicare Compensation Recovery, and factors influencing the Medicare
recovery amount.

Notice of judgment or settlement

A notice of judgment or settlement advises Services Australia (the
agency) that a decision has been reached about a compensation claim for
an amount greater than $5,000 (including legal expenses).

Under section 23 of the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act
1995 (HOSC Act) a compensation payer or their representative must advise
the agency within 28 days after the date of the compensation was fixed
on:

-   the Notice of judgment or settlement form (MO022), or
-   in writing

The agency is required to recover the eligible Medicare benefits and
costs, once a judgment or settlement has been reached about the
compensable injury or illness.

See:

-   Resources for a link to the MO022 form
-   Notifiable and not notifiable claims

Failure to give notice within 28 days

Under section 29(3) of the HOSC Act 1995, if a valid notice of judgment
or settlement is not received by the agency within 28 days from the date
the compensation amount was set, the compensation payer is liable to
repay any debts identified in the notice of charge. If a compensation
payer has not complied with legislated notice requirements letter
(Z2809) will be issued to the compensation payer. Any payment made will
be treated as a voluntary payment and will be applied to the notice of
charge.

See References for a link to legislation.

Appealed settlement decisions

Where a claimant does not agree with the outcome of a compensation
settlement decision, they may seek a review of the claim via the
Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) by lodging an appeal.

Where a claimant lodges an appeal, a notice of judgment should only be
given after:

-   all applicable time limits for lodging an appeal have expired, and
-   the appeal and all subsequent appeals have been finalised

Centrelink clearance

While the insurer or compensation payer may need to wait for a
Centrelink clearance under the Social Security Act 1991 (SS Act) before
releasing a compensation payment to the person, it is still a
requirement under section 23(2) to give a valid notice of judgment or
settlement to the agency within 28 days.

See References for a link to legislation.

Contents of a valid notice

A valid notice of judgment includes information about the claim provided
in:

the agency’s MO022 form, or

official supporting documents such as:

-   Consent judgment
-   Deed of release/discharge
-   Terms of settlement
-   Complying agreement for workers compensation
-   Court order or judgment

See:

-   Process correspondence for details of a valid notice of judgment or
    settlement. Note: the MO022 form includes additional fields. For
    example, Question 2 ‘date the notifiable person advised the injured
    person in writing that they may be liable for any debts’ is not a
    mandatory field in MCRS
-   Resources for a link to the MO022 form

Amount to be recovered

The agency is required to recover:

The total amount of Medicare benefits, nursing home benefits,
residential care subsidies and home care subsidies (care costs) paid in
the course of treatment of, or as a result of the compensable injury or
illness

-   The agency only recovers those benefits and subsidies paid between
    the date of injury or illness and the date the amount of
    compensation was fixed
-   If the amount of compensation awarded has been reduced as a result
    of contributory negligence, the amount of recovery is reduced by the
    percentage of contributory negligence

Past expenses fixed by a judgment that specifies an amount for medical
care, nursing home care, residential care or home care already incurred,
subject to the specific terms of the judgment and the amount established
through the Notice to claimant process. See below

An amount up to, but not exceeding the total amount of compensation
fixed under a judgment or settlement, less any amounts payable under
Part 3.14 of the Social Security Act 1991, if this amount is less than
the calculated recovery amount

-   For Medicare Compensation Recovery the amount payable under Part
    3.14 of the Social Security Act 1991 if referred to as the amount
    payable to Centrelink

See References for a link to legislation.

Apportionment of liability for Medicare Compensation Recovery

Apportionment of liability as a result of contributory negligence is a
formal agreement or finding that reduces the amount of compensation that
would otherwise be payable. Where apportionment of liability applies,
the total amount payable to the agency is reduced by the proportion of
liability for the injury or illness attributed to the injured person as
indicated in the judgment or settlement documents if:

-   the judgment or settlement fixes the amount of compensation on the
    basis that liability for the injury has been apportioned between the
    injured person and compensation payer, and
-   as a result, the amount of compensation is less than it would have
    been if liability had not been apportioned

Evidence of liability

The agency must only be satisfied that settlement has been fixed on the
basis that the original amount of compensation has been reduced as a
result of an apportionment of liability.

The MO022 form or settlement documents must include the percentage of
apportionment attributed to the injured person.

Acceptable documentation to support an apportionment if the MO022 is not
provided are:

-   judgment or court order
-   consent order
-   terms of settlement
-   deed of release or discharge

Reducing the amount owed

-   When the amount of compensation is reduced because an apportionment
    of liability has been applied for contributory negligence, the
    amount owed to the agency is reduced by the proportion of liability
    attributed to the injured person
-   For example, if the amount owing is $1,000 but 20% liability has
    been apportioned to the injured person in the claim, the recoverable
    amount is reduced by 20% to $800
-   When the notice of charge is issued, the reduced amount owed to the
    agency is automatically calculated in MCRS. The notice of charge
    will show the reduction
-   A notice of charge may be amended if a request is made within the 2
    year reviewable period and supporting apportionment of liability
    settlement documents are provided

See Notice of past benefits and notice of charge for information about a
notice of charge.

Judgment fixes the amount of past expenses

Where the 'amount of past medical expenses' and/or the 'amount of past
care costs' is fixed by a court at the time of judgment, this fixed
amount:

-   becomes the maximum amount payable if the amount derived from the
    Notice to claimant process is greater
-   is disregarded if the amount derived from the Notice to claimant
    process is less
-   becomes the amount payable if the terms of judgement specify the
    amount as the Medicare recovery amount

See Notice of past benefits and notice of charge for details about a
notice of charge.

Total amount of compensation and amount payable to Centrelink

The agency cannot recover more than the total fixed compensation amount
and an amount payable to Centrelink further reduces the amount
recoverable.

Medicare Compensation Recovery has no role in recovering the amount
payable to Centrelink.

See Notice of past benefits and notice of charge for details about a
notice of charge.

Notice of past benefits becomes the notice of charge

When a judgment or settlement has been reached, a notice of past
benefits that was issued in the last 6 months becomes the notice of
charge. Only where the recoverable amount under the HOSC Act differs
from that on the NOPB is a further notice of charge issued.

See:

-   Notice of past benefits and notice of charge for information about a
    notice of charge
-   Payments, refunds and debts for information about advance payments
-   Statement by claimant and care costs

Advance payments

About advance payments

A compensation payer may choose to make an advance payment under section
33B of the HOSC Act if no valid notice of charge exists on the date of
judgment or settlement.

After the agency has received an advance payment, the compensation payer
can then release the remainder of the settlement sum to the injured
person or claimant before the amount owed to the agency has been
determined. Once an advance payment has been made, the compensation
payer is not entitled to receive any further information about the case,
including:

-   details of any debts owed by the injured person, or
-   any amounts deducted from the advance payment

A payment from a compensation payer is only accepted as an advance
payment if advice of intent to make an advance payment is accepted and
other criteria are met.

Advance payments - notification of payment intent

If the compensation payer intends to make an advance payment, they must
notify the injured person in writing under section 33A of the HOSC Act
before the date the judgment or settlement is fixed.

The notice must state the:

compensation payer intends to make the advance payment

amount of the advance payment

circumstances in which the:

-   agency can retain some or all of the advance payment, and
-   injured person will be required to make an additional payment to the
    agency in respect of eligible benefits

Confirmation of this notification is provided on the MO022 form.

Advance payments - notification of intent to Medicare

The notifiable persons’ notification to Medicare of intent to pay an
advance payment is accepted if any of the following apply:

-   either the Yes box is ticked or the amount of 10% is entered in the
    AP field at Q36 on the NOJS
-   there is an attached deed of release or other official document that
    specifies the AP intent and amount
-   an amount of money equal to 10% is paid to Medicare

Intent to pay an advance payment is not accepted, regardless of any
money paid, if No is ticked at Q36 on the MO022 form.

If advance payment intent is not accepted any payment received will be
considered as a voluntary payment (ad-hoc in MCRS) and will be applied
to the notice of charge. As there is no written advice that this payment
was intended as an advance payment there will be no non-compliance
letter issued.

Advance payments - criteria

A compensation payer can make the advance payment in respect of the
compensation payable, if:

-   a notice of past benefits has not been issued in respect of the
    claim in the 6 months preceding the day on which the judgment or
    settlement is fixed
-   a notice of judgment or settlement under section 23 of the HOSC Act
    has been given to the agency indicating the compensation payer
    intends to make an advance payment
-   a notice under section 33A of the HOSC Act has been given to the
    injured person
-   the total amount of compensation fixed under the judgment or
    settlement (including legal costs) is fixed at more than $5,000
-   the payment made is equal to 10% of the total amount of compensation
    payable, and
-   the advance payment is made within 28 days after the date of
    judgment/settlement

Any payment that does not meet the criteria for advance payments is
considered a failure to comply and will be:

-   treated as a voluntary payment (ad-hoc payment in MCRS), and
-   applied to the notice of charge

An Advance payment criteria not satisfied (Z2810) notice is issued to
the notifiable person advising:

-   they are liable for any outstanding charge, and
-   not to pay any of the compensation amount until the charge has been
    paid

A copy of this notice is sent to the claimant.

No valid charge on the date of judgment or settlement

Where there is no valid notice of charge on the date of judgment or
settlement, the agency has a maximum of 3 months to issue a notice to:

-   the injured person, if the compensation payer has made an advance
    payment to the agency, or
-   the compensation payer

Where an advance payment has been made, the 3 month time limit may be
extended under certain circumstances.

A notice to claimant is not issued if the agency has failed to issue a
notice of charge by the due date.

See:

-   Notice of past benefits and notice of charge for information about a
    notice of charge, including situations where the 3 month time limit
    may be extended
-   Payments, refunds and debts for information about advance payments

No interest payable on section 33D/K cases

The agency does not pay interest where there has been a delay in
processing an advance payment (Section 33D of the Health and Other
Services Compensation Act 1995).

Where a customer enquires about interest payable on a section 33D/K
claim, the response should be that interest will only be payable if they
can provide in writing the law that requires the agency to pay interest.
S33M of the HOSC Act 1995 does not require the agency to pay interest.

Total amount payable/refundable exceeds threshold

If the total amount payable/refundable exceeds the threshold (currently
$50,000), the NOC needs to be reviewed by a second Service Officer.

See Quality checking – Medicare Compensation Recovery for details about
the review process.

The Process page contains information about actioning corrections.

Re-processing Notice of Judgment or Settlement for amendments

Some claims must be reopened:

-   for corrective action, or
-   to process an amended statement by the claimant

Once a claim is re-opened, reprocess using the ‘Reprocess the SBC and
issue a new NOC’ function from the Review NOJS screen.

See:

-   Extensions, not substantially correct, decisions and reviews for
    details about amendments
-   Escalations and case notes for details about referring a case to the
    appropriate delegate for approval before actioning the amendment
