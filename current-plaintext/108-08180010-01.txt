This document outlines information regarding steps to follow to code a
manual rate of payment for recipients who are receiving payments which
are not paid in the Newstart or ABSTUDY systems. It may be necessary in
certain circumstances to code a manual rate of payment for a recipient.

Ceasing or amending a manual rate of payment

Information is also provided to assist with ceasing or amending a manual
rate of payment for a recipient.

Payments covered by this procedure are payments made in the PEN, PGA and
FAO systems.

When a manual rate is coded, care must be taken to adjust the rate as
required after any reassessments.

The system may also be unable to generate automatic letters so these
must be finalised manually.
