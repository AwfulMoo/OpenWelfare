This document outlines and links to procedures for processing claims for
payments and concession cards. When a customer submits an online claim
or a Service Officer completes an Assisted Customer Claim (ACC), the
data uploads into a Social Application (claim workflow). This is used to
view, record and confirm information to assess the customer's
entitlement.

Assisted Customer Claim (ACC)

ACC has the same design as the online claim. It is used by Service
Officers to collect claim information from a customer over the phone or
face-to-face, or to enter information provided on a paper claim form.

Service Officers can use ACC to submit a claim that the customer has
started but has not submitted.

'Channel Hopping' within ACC allows:

-   the customer to start a claim online and have a Service Officer
    complete it
-   a Service officer to help a customer start a claim for them to
    complete online

Claims submitted using ACC are processed the same as online claims.

ACC supports online claims in SAP technology.
