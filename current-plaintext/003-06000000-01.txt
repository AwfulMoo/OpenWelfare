This document outlines topics to assist in assessing the package of
products and services best suited to helping customers in crisis or
needing special help.

Government intent

From time to time customers who attend Services Australia offices may be
facing situations that put them 'in crisis or in need of special help'.
In some cases, customers in such circumstances may be eligible for one
of the exceptional payments Services Australia is able to make.
Alternatively, they may be able to be referred to a specialist officer
within the organisation, or to an external agency, to provide the
specific assistance required to help the customer through their
difficulties.

At the initial contact, it is the responsibility of the Service Officer
to:

-   determine whether the customer is 'in crisis or needing special
    help'
-   identify and offer a package of services to meet the customer's
    needs

Methods of initial contact

A customer may make an initial contact in writing, face-to-face or by
phone.

Information provided in initial contact

Those seeking assistance will be advised of eligibility criteria,
processes for new claims, and how the start day of a payment is
determined.
