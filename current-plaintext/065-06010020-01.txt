This document outlines what to do when a customer's CSHC is cancelled
due to leaving Australia for a temporary period greater than their
maximum portability period.

On this Page:

Departure from Australia since 1 January 2015

Customers who leave Australia temporarily keep entitlement to a CSHC for
the maximum portability period of 19 weeks from departure, after which
time their CSHC will automatically cancel.

Note: customers who left Australia temporarily before 1 January 2015,
retained entitlement to a CSHC for the maximum portability period of 6
weeks from departure after which their CSHC cancelled.

Re-claiming upon return to Australia

Customers can complete a verbal re-claim on their return if they meet
all of the following criteria:

-   their CSHC has been cancelled due to a temporary overseas absence
    exceeding their maximum portability period, and
-   they have returned to Australia and have contacted within 13 weeks
    of their CSHC being cancelled, and
-   they have previously provided income details from their Tax Notice
    of Assessment from either of the previous 2 financial years or they
    are 'not required to lodge' an income tax return, and
-   any account-based income streams owned by the customer (and partner)
    are coded on the Pension/Annuities Summary (SUPS) screen

Customers who do not meet the above criteria or who have returned to
Australia and contact less than 26 weeks since their CSHC cancellation
date, will need to complete a CSHC re-claim process. They can do this by
using:

-   [] an online claim
-   Assisted Customer Claim (ACC)
-   Customised Claim for Commonwealth Seniors Health Card (SA443)
    (issued by a Service Officer), or
-   Re-claim for a Commonwealth Seniors Health Card claim (SA296A)
    (downloaded directly by the customer)

Where customers have been cancelled for more than 26 weeks they will
need to complete a new application for CSHC.

Note: the verbal claim for a CSHC is a re-claim and not a restoration of
CSHC entitlement.

Portability rules

Entitlement to a CSHC when a customer goes overseas is covered by the
portability rules for concession cards including information on
permanent absences and when the customer returns before the end of the
portability period.

Entitlement to Energy supplement when a customer goes overseas is
covered by the rules for Energy supplement overseas absences.

The CSHC income threshold amount is found in the Rates Chart.

Changes in a customer's circumstances

A change in a customer's circumstances may include, but is not limited
to their:

-   relationship status,
-   income,
-   address or,
-   telephone number

If the reclaim includes changes see Changes in a customer's
circumstances and effect on concession card entitlement.
