| 1                                 | The caller discusses self-harm    |
|                                   | and/or suicide at any point       |

|                                   | It is important to convey a sense |
|                                   | of calm and control, without      |
|                                   | appearing to be commanding or     |
|                                   | authoritarian. For this reason,   |
|                                   | you should not tell people to do  |
|                                   | things such as ‘calm down’ as     |
|                                   | this can be viewed as dismissive  |
|                                   | of their situation and feelings,  |
|                                   | as well as authoritarian.         |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | self-harm are to be taken         |
|                                   | seriously and are often           |
|                                   | confronting.                      |

|                                   | -   Remain calm and listen        |
|                                   |     carefully to what the caller  |
|                                   |     is saying and do not dismiss  |
|                                   |     any information that they are |

|                                   | -   Ask the caller if they are    |

|                                   |     their life or harming         |
|                                   |     themselves or others. If the  |
