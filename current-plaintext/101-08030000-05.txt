Tax Help Centres

Information about Tax Help Centres is only accessible from 1 July to 31
October each year. Not all service centres providing Centrelink services
will have a Tax Help Centre located nearby. If this is the case, provide
the customer with the 'Contacting the Tax Office' flyer to contact the
ATO for assistance.

For the most current information about Tax Help Centres, please refer to
the ATO website. Provide the customer only with the telephone number of
the nearest Tax Help Centre for the customer to make an appointment. Tax
Help Centre addresses are not to be issued to customers.

Service centres providing Medicare services are not required to provide
assistance with referrals to Tax Help Centres.
