This document outlines information about debts which result from a
customer receiving payment in excess of their entitlement because of an
order of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT). The AAT is a body
which provides independent review of administrative decisions made by
both the Australian Commonwealth government and some non-government
bodies.

Appealing a decision

A customer has the right to appeal a decision made by Services Australia
to cancel or reduce payments. The AAT can order the agency to continue
making payments pending the outcome of the appeal. This is known as a
'stay order'.

When the final decision of the AAT is the customer was entitled to less
than they received, the difference is a recoverable debt. These debts:

-   are rare, and
-   only apply when it is the customer referred the matter to the AAT

The Resources page contains a link to the Administrative Appeals
Tribunal (AAT) website.
