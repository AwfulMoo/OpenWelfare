This document provides an overview of the Health Professional Advisory
Unit (HPAU), and outlines the process of referral to the HPAU.

The Health Professional Advisory Unit (HPAU)

The HPAU is a team of health professionals (including medical
practitioners) employed to provide and/or facilitate medical advice and
opinion where this information is not available from any other source.

Role of the HPAU

The HPAU:

-   strengthens decision making by providing expert advice to key
    stakeholders, including Assessors, Review Officers, Legal Officers,
    Random Sample Officers, Specialists and Disability Branch staff
    involved in Disability Support Pension (DSP) claims, reviews, appeal
    assessments and determinations
-   provides advice to International Services staff including for
    foreign pension assessment, portability extension requests due to a
    medical condition and entitlement to indefinite portability of DSP
    under the 'no future work capacity' portability provisions
-   provides advice relating to ministerial complaints, media related
    cases and high profile matters
-   provides medical advice on Carer claims, Australian Victim of
    Terrorism Overseas Payment (AVTOP), People Support Branch cases and
    other matters

The HPAU may be contacted by telephone, web form or email. For contact
details, see Health Professional Advisory Unit (HPAU).

Services provided by HPAU

Services provided by HPAU include:

-   clarification of information from treating doctors and other medical
    professionals
-   clarification of ambiguous, unclear or conflicting medical
    information
-   expert opinion of the diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and functional
    impact of medical conditions
-   interpretation of the Impairment Tables
-   expert advice informing relevant policy
-   educational presentations and training material
-   internal and external stakeholder engagement

The HPAU will look at all available medical information to take a
comprehensive view of the referral. The HPAU are able to offer an
opinion on all aspects of the customer's medical condition including:

-   an analysis of what treatment options are available based on the
    co-morbidities
-   the prognosis for the customer
-   expected outcomes of both the disease and prescribed treatment in
    relation to the customer's functional capacity including work

A health professional in the HPAU will utilise their broad based medical
background and experience to provide feedback to a referring officer.

Services not provided by the HPAU

The HPAU does not:

provide information or advice to referring officers about income support
or program eligibility, for example, DSP entitlements or Disability
Employment Services eligibility

perform medical examinations

replace the utilisation of existing helpdesks within Services Australia,
the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, or other external
organisations

replace the existing requirement for customers to provide medical
evidence when claiming DSP

replace existing processes, such as:

-   existing Job Capacity Assessment (JCA) procedures and processes,
    including those for accessing treating health professionals
-   existing JCA and contributing assessor expertise
-   the utilisation of existing Senior Service Officer or JCA staff
-   existing review and appeal processes (for example, Authorised Review
    Officers (ARO) contacting JCAs for a second JCA report where it is
    clear new evidence suggests a new JCA is warranted)

Referrals to HPAU

Referrals can be made by:

Assessment Services Branch (ASB). Referrals by Assessors will be
reviewed by the relevant Assistant Director and Director. Assessors are
not to refer directly to HPAU until clearance has been obtained from an
Assistant Director/Director if a referral is necessary. ASB will assess
the need for an early HPAU referral where, for example:

-   there are serious malignancies and possible manifest eligibility or
    other conditions that severely limit life expectancy, for example
    motor neurone disease
-   nursing home level care is suspected, for example severe multiple
    sclerosis, dementing conditions, severe cerebrovascular disease and
    other less common neurological conditions
-   media related cases or high profile customer Ministerial complaints

Appeals Branch, for example a Review Officer

the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT)

Legal Services Division

(DSP):

-   Emergency Services Team for AVTOP
-   Disability Branch staff
-   People Support Branch
-   Participation Solutions Team (PST) staff
-   Random Sample Officers reviewing DSP payments

International Services

The Quality Team will assess whether HPAU referrals are required for
claims referred to Assessment Services where:

-   there are serious malignancies and possible manifest eligibility or
    other conditions that severely limit life expectancy, for example
    motor neurone disease
-   nursing home level care is suspected, for example severe multiple
    sclerosis, dementing conditions, severe cerebrovascular disease and
    other less common neurological conditions
-   media related cases or high profile customer Ministerial complaints

Referral process

The HPAU Health Professional will:

-   examine the information, generally in consultation with the
    referring officer
-   determine if additional information is still required and can be
    obtained by the referrer
-   assess if there is a necessity to consult an external health
    professional to obtain relevant information or clarify the questions
    or concerns raised by the referrer
-   upload the HPAU opinion report to the customer record
