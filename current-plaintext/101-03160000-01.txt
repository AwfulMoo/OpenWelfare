This document explains the process and requirements for undertaking
appointments for the ParentsNext program.

ParentsNext overview

ParentsNext is a pre-employment program for Parenting Payment (PP)
(single and partnered) customers with children under 6 years of age,
which may include grandparents or foster parents receiving PP. The
program focuses on offering individual support and referrals to services
that can help customers to plan and prepare for work or connect to the
workforce when their youngest child turns 6.

ParentsNext participants do not need to look for or take up work. The
aim is to encourage customers to think about their future work and study
related goals and to support them in achieving these goals by connecting
them with appropriate services in their local community. The program
offers individualised support that can include help to access secure
housing, financial advice, parenting courses, childcare, transport,
further study, training or volunteering.

Customers selected for ParentsNext need to attend an initial appointment
with Services Australia. They will be referred to a ParentsNext provider
if they are eligible.

Compulsory participants must:

-   attend an appointment with their ParentsNext provider at least every
    3 months
-   develop and sign a Participation Plan and
-   participate in compulsory activities

Customers selected as a compulsory ParentsNext participant will be
placed on 2 weekly (fortnightly) reporting initially, but may
subsequently change to 12 weekly reporting if they are granted a long
term exemption. See ParentsNext exits and exemptions.

There are three selection reasons for ParentsNext and eligibility is
automatically determined by the system based on the information on the
customer's record at the time of the eligibility assessment. A
customer's reason for selection into ParentsNext will show on the
ParentsNext Summary page within Customer First.

For further information, see ParentsNext eligibility and servicing.

ParentsNext appointments with Services Australia

Parenting Payment customers who are assessed as eligible for ParentsNext
need to attend an appointment with Services Australia. If the customer
has a phone contact number recorded, the appointment will be undertaken
by phone. If there is no contact phone number on the customer's record,
the appointment is undertaken at the customer's local service centre.

If the system identifies a customer is eligible for ParentsNext, a 10
minute appointment will be automatically booked where profiles are
available. If the system is unable to automatically book the
appointment, a Manual Follow-up (MFU) activity will be created to alert
a Service Officer that a ParentsNext appointment must be manually
booked.

Desktop messaging

To improve attendance at Services Australia ParentsNext phone
appointments, Service Officers can use Desktop Messaging to issue a
pre-call SMS notification (to customers signed up to Electronic
Messaging via SMS). The message will remind the customer:

-   of their ParentsNext phone appointment
-   the call will come from a blocked number, and
-   they need to answer this call

Note: messages will only be released between 9am and 5pm. Messages sent
before 9am will only issue to the customer after 9am the same day.
Messages sent after 5pm will only issue after 9am the following day.

ParentsNext appointment notifications

All customers selected for ParentsNext will be notified of the
requirement to attend an appointment with Services Australia. The letter
has a Department of Employment and Workplace Relations brochure that
explains the ParentsNext program to the customer and how it may benefit
them. If the customer has subscribed to receive Centrelink letters
online, they will receive a link to the brochure in their online
account.

The letter advises customers there are some circumstances where they may
not need to participate in ParentsNext and if relevant encourages the
customer to provide evidence before their Services Australia
appointment.

The Resources page has a link to the brochure.

Rescheduling ParentsNext appointments with Services Australia

[] When appropriate, tell customers they can reschedule any appointment
type via their online account. Appointments can only be rescheduled up
to the scheduled date and time of the original appointment. After that,
a new appointment must be booked.

See the full list of appointments and parameters for rescheduling and
ParentsNext eligibility and servicing.

Impact of retrospective updates on eligibility

ParentsNext eligibility is based on information on the customer's record
at the time of the eligibility assessment. For example, the age of the
youngest PP child, whether the customer is currently studying or whether
the customer has completed Year 12 or an equivalent qualification or
higher. Incorrect or out of date information may affect this assessment.
The customer may be selected as eligible, but if the information was up
to date they would not have been selected, or they would have been
selected for a different reason.

In these cases, update the customer's record with the correct
information to trigger an eligibility reassessment.

See ParentsNext exits and exemptions.

ParentsNext providers

ParentsNext providers will:

-   conduct an initial appointment with the customer to develop and
    complete a Participation Plan
-   inform the customer about locally available services and undertake a
    referral if appropriate
-   conduct appointments with the customer at least every 3 months
-   refer the customer to other service providers as outlined in their
    Participation Plan
-   book and conduct re-engagement appointments with customers who have
    failed to comply with their participation requirements
-   assess customers' eligibility for an exemption from participation,
    and
-   notify the agency of non-compliance via the Targeted Compliance
    Framework

ParentsNext provider appointments must be booked within 1 to 5 business
days after the customer's next Entitlement Period End Date (EPED).

For example, if conducting a ParentsNext appointment on 9 May and the
customer's payment schedule is as follows:

-   4 May to 17 May
-   18 May to 31 May
-   1 June to 14 June

The Service Officer must attempt to book the appointment within 1 to 5
business days from 17 May. If this cannot happen, the Service Officer
should look at the next EPED. This would be within 1 to 5 business days
of 31 May. Appointments must not be booked any later than 1 to 5
business days of the second EPED.

If an interpreter is needed for the provider appointment this should be
detailed in the notes field and the appointment must be booked no
earlier than 7 days in the future.

If referral options are limited, continue to refer customers to an
available provider if they raise concerns about:

-   their provider's location
-   attending an appointment in person

Tell them to contact their provider to discuss alternate servicing
arrangements.

ParentsNext Participation Plans

As ParentsNext participants are provider managed, ParentsNext
Participation Plans are developed and updated by ParentsNext providers
only. Service Officers are only able to view ParentsNext Participation
Plans. They cannot negotiate or update them. If a customer wishes to
update their Participation Plan, refer them to their ParentsNext
provider.

Activities for ParentsNext participants depend on their individual goals
and circumstances. The activities are intended to support customers to
prepare for work in the future, or increase their capacity for work.
Activities may include:

-   locally available parenting services
-   referrals to non-vocational support services such as health care or
    counselling services
-   work or study
-   referral to employment services, for example, Workforce Australia

Customers will be given tailored support to develop and sign a
Participation Plan with their provider. The Participation Plan will have
at least one compulsory activity.

Service Officers must not guarantee or create any expectation, of what a
customer's activities/help may be.

The Resources page has a document outlining appropriate activities that
may be included in a ParentsNext Participation Plan.

Disability Employment Services (DES)

Customers will not be selected for ParentsNext while they are
voluntarily participating in DES. If a customer has been referred to a
DES provider but not yet started, they will still be selected for
ParentsNext if the eligibility criteria is met.

A ParentsNext participant will only be automatically exited where
recorded as commenced.

Information on the status of a DES referral is detailed on the
Participation Summary screen in Process Direct.

ParentsNext exemptions

ParentsNext exemptions recorded by either the agency or the ParentsNext
provider will exempt the customer from the requirement to participate in
ParentsNext (for the duration of the exemption).

The granting of an exemption does not change a customer's ParentsNext
eligibility status or their reason for selection.

See ParentsNext exits and exemptions.

Healthy Start for School Check

Customers must meet Healthy Start for School (HSFS) requirements if
during a financial year:

-   they received FTB Part A for a child who has turned 4, and
-   they (or their partner) received an income support payment
    (including nil rate periods) for at least one day

To meet HSFS requirements:

-   the child must have an acceptable health check, and
-   the customer must notify the agency that this has taken place

If HSFS requirements are not met before the child's fifth birthday, an
FTB Part A rate reduction is applied to the maximum rate of FTB Part A
that can be paid for that child. See Healthy Start for School (HSFS)
requirements from 1 July 2018.

activities and links to external websites, Department of Employment and
Workplace Relations and Find a Provider.
