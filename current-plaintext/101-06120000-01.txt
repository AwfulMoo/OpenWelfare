Services Australia no longer provides the NSW Half Fare transport
concession card for job seekers.

This card has been replaced with a Concession Entitlement Card which is
administered by Transport for NSW.

NSW job seekers will need to go to the Transport for NSW website to
apply for a Concession Entitlement Card.

The Resources page contains a link to the Transport for NSW website.
