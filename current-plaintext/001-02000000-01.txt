This document outlines the relationship between Services Australia (the
agency) and Employment Service Providers in the provision of employment
assistance.

Government intent

The agency connects job seekers to employment services available through
Workforce Australia Online for Individuals and Employment Services
Providers and makes referrals to programs funded by various government
departments, including State and local Governments. The agency also
offers job search facilities in each service centre.

Services Australia is the gateway to employment services, including:

-   Workforce Australia - including Workforce Australia Online for
    Individuals and Workforce Australia Employment Services Providers
-   Disability Employment Services (DES)
-   Workforce Australia - Transition to Work (TtW)
-   ParentsNext appointments and processing
-   Community Development Program (CDP)

The agency provides information to assist job seekers selecting the
services appropriate to them.

Referral to Workforce Australia Online for Individuals employment service

Most job seekers are automatically referred to Workforce Australia
Online for Individuals during their Participation Interview, with
selection and referral being undertaken by the Department of Employment
and Workplace Relations. Selected job seekers are automatically referred
to online servicing and do not require a referral to a provider.
Instead, participants manage their obligations through Workforce
Australia Online services (the online service website).

Referral of job seekers to Workforce Australia Employment Services Providers

Referral of job seekers to an Employment Services Provider is subject to
the availability of those services in their particular location. Job
seekers are referred to a provider for the full range of services for
which they are eligible. Providers offer a variety of services and
mutual obligation requirements matched to the job seeker's skills and
any identified barriers to employment.

The role of Services Australia in Workforce Australia Online

The role of Services Australia is to explain to the job seeker that
they:

have been selected for Workforce Australia Online for Individuals

must register with the Workforce Australia website via myGov

must agree to a Job Plan via Workforce Australia

will not be required to attend face to face appointments with a
provider, and

can contact the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations to
discuss:

-   their participation
-   issues accessing the website
-   agreeing to the Job Plan, or
-   exiting from Workforce Australia Online

Using the Workforce Australia Online service, job seekers will:

-   agree to a Job Plan
-   develop or upload a resume, a career profile and other relevant
    information, and
-   report mutual obligation requirements or points based activities

If a job seeker needs to be transferred to a Workforce Australia
provider, the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations will
refer the job seeker.

Complementary employment and training programs

The agency and/or Employment Services Providers can also refer eligible
job seekers to a number of complementary employment and training
programs. Complementary programs include:

-   Skills for Education and Employment (SEE)
-   PaTH Internship Programme
-   Workforce Australia - Transition to Work (TtW)
-   state and territory training and employment programs

Australia, and contact details for the Department of Employment and
Workplace Relations National Customer Service Line.
