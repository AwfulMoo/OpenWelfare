This document outlines the relationship between Services Australia and
Employment Service Providers in the provision of employment assistance.

Government intent

The agency connects job seekers to employment services available through
Online Employment Services and Employment Services Providers and makes
referrals to programs funded by various government departments,
including State and local Governments. The agency also offers Jobsearch
Facilities in each service centre.

Services Australia is the gateway to employment services, including:

-   jobactive - including Online Employment Services and jobactive
    providers
-   Disability Employment Services (DES)
-   Intensive Support - Transition to Work (TtW)
-   ParentsNext appointments and processing
-   Community Development Program (CDP)

The agency provides information to assist job seekers selecting the
services appropriate to them.

Referral to online jobactive employment service

Most job seekers are automatically referred to Online Employment
Services during their Participation Interview, with selection and
referral being undertaken by the Department of Education, Skills and
Employment. Selected job seekers are automatically referred to online
servicing and do not require a referral to a jobactive provider.
Instead, online participants manage their obligations through jobactive
(the online employment service website).

Referral of job seekers to Employment Services Providers

Referral of job seekers to an Employment Services Provider is subject to
the availability of those services in their particular location. Job
seekers are referred to a provider for the full range of services for
which they are eligible. Providers offer a variety of services and
activities matched to the job seeker's skills and any identified
barriers to employment.

New Employment Services Model Pilot

From 1 July 2019, all Stream A job seekers in 2 designated pilot areas
are selected by the Department of Education, Skills and Employment to
participate in the New Employment Services Model Pilot (ESM). The pilot
builds on the existing Online Employment Services (OES). The ESM pilot
will continue until the New Employment Services Model is implemented in
July 2022.

The role of Services Australia in online jobactive servicing

The role of Services Australia is to explain to the job seeker that
they:

have been selected for the OES or ESM

must register with the jobactive website via myGov

must agree to a Job Plan via jobactive

will not be required to attend face to face appointments with a
jobactive provider, and

can contact the Department of Education, Skills and Employment to
discuss:

-   their participation
-   issues accessing the jobactive website
-   agreeing to the Job Plan, or
-   exiting from the OES/pilot

Using the Online Employment Service, job seekers will:

-   agree to a Job Plan
-   develop or upload a resume, a career profile and other relevant
    information, and
-   report mutual obligation requirement activities, mainly job search
    or points based activities

If a job seeker needs to be transferred to a jobactive provider, the
Department of Education, Skills and Employment will refer the job
seeker.

From 8 December 2019, all Stream A volunteer job seekers will be:

-   referred to online employment services instead of jobactive
    providers
-   able to access online services for up to 12 months

Note: prior to 8 December 2019, volunteer job seekers could only access
jobactive services for a maximum of 6 months.

See the Resources page for current trials and pilots for online
employment services, and a link to the jobactive website.

Complementary employment and training programs

The agency and/or Employment Services Providers can also refer eligible
job seekers to a number of complementary employment and training
programs. Complementary programs include:

-   Skills for Education and Employment (SEE)
-   PaTH Internship Programme
-   Intensive Support - Transition to Work (TtW)
-   state and territory training and employment programs

The Resources page contains a link to the Services Australia website for
information about looking for work, links to websites about jobactive,
the New Employment Services Model and contact details for the Department
of Education, Skills and Employment National Customer Service Line. It
also contains a table explaining current trials and pilots for online
employment services.
