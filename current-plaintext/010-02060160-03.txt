|                                   | When looking at the ABSTUDY away  |
|                                   | from home rate, it is considered  |
|                                   | unreasonable to break continuity  |
|                                   | of study:                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   at any time during a school   |
|                                   |     or academic year, or          |
|                                   | -   if the State/Territory        |
|                                   |     authorities regard continuity |
|                                   |     of schooling between years 9  |
|                                   |     and 12 to be at least highly  |
|                                   |     desirable                     |

|                                   | Note: a student who qualifies     |
|                                   | under continuity of study         |
|                                   | provisions due to a change in     |
|                                   | circumstances during an academic  |
|                                   | year:                             |

|                                   | -   will continue to qualify in   |
|                                   |     subsequent years, and         |
|                                   | -   requires no further           |
|                                   |     reassessment as long as they  |

|                                   | that are lower than year 9, are   |
|                                   | not considered for approval of    |

|                                   | If a student's independent school |
|                                   | scholarship ceases, so does their |
|                                   | prior eligibility for the away    |
|                                   | from home rate. They cannot       |
|                                   | continue to receive the away from |
|                                   | home rate under the continuity of |
|                                   | study provisions.                 |

|                                   | Example: A student has qualified  |
|                                   | for the away from home rate       |
|                                   | because they were receiving an    |
|                                   | eligible independent school       |
|                                   | scholarship, but the SES score    |
|                                   | for the school then reduced to    |
|                                   | less than 100 for the following   |
|                                   | year. They can remain eligible    |
|                                   | under the continuity of study     |
|                                   | provisions if they still hold the |
|                                   | scholarship they were awarded.    |

|                                   | concessions apply to year 12      |
|                                   | students who were receiving       |
|                                   | Living Allowance at the away from |
|                                   | home rate until the end of the    |
|                                   | previous year. The intention of   |
|                                   | these concessions is to ensure    |
|                                   | these students are not adversely  |
|                                   | affected by a change in parental  |
|                                   | income.                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | They may continue to receive      |
|                                   | Living Allowance at the away from |
|                                   | home rate until the end of the    |
|                                   | year or until they discontinue    |
|                                   | study in that year, if they:      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   are undertaking year 11 or 12 |
|                                   | -   were receiving Living         |
|                                   |     Allowance at the away from    |
|                                   |     home rate until the end of    |
|                                   |     the previous year             |
|                                   | -   continue attending at the     |
|                                   |     same school, and              |
|                                   | -   would become ineligible for   |
|                                   |     Living Allowance due to the   |
|                                   |     application of the Parental   |
|                                   |     Income Test                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Example: John received full       |
|                                   | entitlement based on a Parental   |
|                                   | Income Test (PIT) exemption while |
|                                   | one of his parents were in        |
|                                   | receipt of an income support      |
|                                   | payment. In March of John's year  |
|                                   | 12 studies, the parent obtained   |
|                                   | work. Therefore, John no longer   |
|                                   | qualified for a PIT Exemption.    |
|                                   | Due to base tax year income, John |
|                                   | would lose all ABSTUDY income     |
|                                   | tested entitlements. Under        |
|                                   | special continuity provisions,    |
|                                   | John will continue to qualify for |
|                                   | Living Allowance until the end of |
|                                   | year 12.                          |

|                                   | eligible where:                   |

|                                   |     institution                   |
|                                   | -   it would be unreasonable to   |
|                                   |     break continuity of study,    |
|                                   |     and                           |

|                                   |     be eligible for the away from |
|                                   |     home rate                     |

|                                   | Example: Mary's father Denis is a |
|                                   | soldier. The Army has told Denis  |
|                                   | that in 4 months the unit is      |
|                                   | going to move bases. Mary would   |
|                                   | not be able to move with the      |
|                                   | family and continue attendance at |
|                                   | the current school. The           |
|                                   | State/Territory education         |
|                                   | authority confirms that it is     |
|                                   | highly desirable not to break     |
|                                   | study at this stage of Mary's     |
|                                   | schooling.                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Due to Mary's impending need      |
|                                   | (within 12 months) to live away   |
|                                   | from the permanent home when      |
|                                   | Denis moves, Mary will be         |
|                                   | eligible for the away from home   |
|                                   | rate of ABSTUDY. That rate of     |
|                                   | payment would commence as soon as |
|                                   | Mary moves out of her parental    |
|                                   | home (even if that is before      |
|                                   | Mary's family moves).             |

|                                   | home rate based on time and       |

|                                   | Port Hedland in July. The         |
|                                   | permanent home is now within      |

|                                   | Como Secondary College. Janelle   |
|                                   | remains eligible for away from    |
|                                   | home rate, Living Allowance and   |

|                                   | of the year. This is because it   |
|                                   | is unreasonable to break          |
