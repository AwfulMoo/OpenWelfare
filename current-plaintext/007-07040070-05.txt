|                                   | refuge with child Amelia. Muriel  |
|                                   | has recently fled from the        |
|                                   | ex-partner who was receiving FTB  |
|                                   | for Amelia.                       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Muriel lodges a claim for FTB for |
|                                   | Amelia, supported by a letter     |
|                                   | from the women's refuge that      |
|                                   | Muriel is caring for Amelia at    |
|                                   | that point in time. Muriel is     |
|                                   | concerned that contacting the     |
|                                   | ex-partner to confirm the change  |
|                                   | of care may place them at risk of |
|                                   | harm.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The Service Officer needs to be   |
|                                   | satisfied there has been a change |
|                                   | in care and that Amelia is now in |
|                                   | Muriel's care. The Service        |
|                                   | Officer may need to seek other    |
|                                   | forms of verification that the    |
|                                   | change of care has occurred. This |
|                                   | may require social worker         |
|                                   | involvement or Muriel may be      |
|                                   | requested to provide additional   |
|                                   | evidence. The letter from the     |
|                                   | women's refuge can be used as     |
|                                   | part of the evidence to support   |
|                                   | the change of care.               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Ultimately the Service Officer    |
|                                   | needs to be satisfied that a      |
|                                   | change of care has occurred based |
|                                   | on available evidence, without    |
|                                   | confirming with the ex-partner.   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Change of care - supported by an  | On 20 December 2013, Byron        |
| interim court order               | requested FTB due to now caring   |
|                                   | for 2 children. Byron's           |
|                                   | ex-partner Phoebe was contacted   |
|                                   | to confirm the details. Phoebe    |
|                                   | contested that the children were  |
|                                   | now in Byron's full-time care and |
|                                   | claimed that they were only on an |
|                                   | access visit.                     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Byron was able to produce an      |
|                                   | interim court order dated 18      |
|                                   | December 2013 which stated the    |
|                                   | children were to reside with      |
|                                   | Byron from 18 December 2013 until |
|                                   | further orders were issued.       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Phoebe stated the matter was due  |
|                                   | to go back to court in January    |
|                                   | 2014 and intends to fight to get  |
|                                   | the children back and explains    |
|                                   | this absence is only temporary.   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | However, as the change of care is |
|                                   | fully supported by the interim    |
|                                   | order dated 18 December 2013,     |
|                                   | Byron can be paid from the date   |
|                                   | of the order (18 December 2013)   |
|                                   | and Phoebe's payments for the     |
|                                   | children must be cancelled from   |
|                                   | this date.                        |

| No change of care - temporary     | Moira is a single parent who has  |
| visit during school holidays      | the full care of 2 children. The  |
|                                   | children go to stay with their    |
|                                   | grandparents during the Christmas |
|                                   | school holidays for 6 weeks and   |
|                                   | the grandparents lodge a claim    |
|                                   | for FTB.                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Moira contested the change        |
|                                   | stating the children were only    |
|                                   | away temporarily and shows        |
|                                   | financial assistance was provided |
|                                   | to the grandparents to care for   |
|                                   | the children during their visit.  |
|                                   | Moira also provided the children  |
|                                   | with pocket money, clothes and    |
|                                   | toiletries, etc. Moira regularly  |
|                                   | phones the children during their  |
|                                   | holiday and is consulted          |
|                                   | regarding the children's medical  |
|                                   | needs and activities.             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | On the basis of the information   |
|                                   | provided, it is decided that the  |
|                                   | children remain in Moira's care   |
|                                   | during their holiday, and the     |

|                                   | rejected.                         |

|                                   | is received from Rosemary on 10   |
|                                   | August for child Yon. Rosemary    |
|                                   | claims care for Yon and states    |
|                                   | the child has now left the care   |
|                                   | of Margaret.                      |

|                                   | Margaret, who is currently        |
|                                   | receiving FTB for Yon. Margaret   |
|                                   | disagrees that Yon has already    |
|                                   | left and confirms Yon is only     |
|                                   | leaving Margaret's care on the    |
|                                   | following Saturday, 15 August.    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Child Support then calls Rosemary |
|                                   | who agrees with Margaret's        |
|                                   | statement explaining that a       |
|                                   | mistake was made when writing the |
|                                   | dates. Rosemary accidentally      |
|                                   | wrote the date claimed as the     |
|                                   | date of the change in care.       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | On Margaret's record, Yon is      |
|                                   | recorded as left care from 15     |
|                                   | August. This cancels Margaret's   |
|                                   | FTB for Yon. Rosemary's claim is  |
|                                   | then processed and Yon is         |
|                                   | recorded in Rosemary's care from  |

P24845 problem and workaround

The P24845 system issue may impact in the following scenarios:

-   Where a step parent is claiming FTB that has been transferred to
    them from a biological parent, who is also a mutual Child Support
    Customer, and the other biological parent also becomes entitled to
    receive FTB for any level of care
-   Where the biological parent transfers their FTB to a step parent and
    they later separate. Care details for the child will not be
    transferred correctly to Child Support if a past period care refresh
    is requested
-   The care may transfer to the step parent's child support record
    (with incorrect child relationship details) causing inaccurate child
    support assessments and impacting multiple parties

As a result, where FTB is transferred out to partner ('TOP' is keyed on
the Child Override/Claim (CHOC) screen - from parent to step parent) and
the customer is a Centrelink and Child Support mutual customer, these
records are to be referred for investigation. See the Process page of
Notification and assessment of shared care arrangements for Family Tax
Benefit (FTB) for further information on workaround and text for Display
on Access (DOA) DOCs.
