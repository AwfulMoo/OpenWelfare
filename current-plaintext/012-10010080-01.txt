This document outlines the Confirmation Statement process.

Annual Confirmation Statement

At the start of May each year, practices are sent an Annual Confirmation
Statement (ACS). This will not be sent to practices approved for the PIP
in the preceding 6 months.

An ACS will show all information on the practice profile.

A practice must confirm their practice details. This includes their
eligibility for the:

-   PIP, and
-   individual incentives

The below individual incentives do not show on the ACS and therefore
practices do not need to confirm their eligibility for the:

-   General Practitioner Aged Care Access Incentive (ACAI)
-   Rural Loading payment
-   Teaching Incentive
-   PIP COVID-19 Vaccine General Practice Incentive

A practice can receive and confirm their ACS via:

Health Professional Online Services (HPOS)

-   if the practice’s online subscriptions is set to ‘access online’
-   most changes made through HPOS are effective immediately. They can
    be made up to and on 31 July

mail

-   if the practice’s online subscriptions is set to ‘receive printed
    copy via mail’
-   must be submitted at least 7 days before the relevant point-in-time
    date

On receipt of the ACS, the practice must:

-   check that all the details on the ACS are correct
-   submit the ACS via HPOS or sign the declaration page and return by
    fax / email

Only the declaration page needs to be submitted. If there are changes to
practice details, the practice must also submit the relevant page.

The practice payments will be automatically put on hold if a practice
does not confirm their ACS by the 31 July. Once the ACS has been
confirmed, the practice payments will be released in a fortnightly
payment run. See Payments for PIP and WIP – Practice Stream

Changes to the practice details

A practice can make changes to the details on the Annual Confirmation
Statement (ACS).

The Resources page has a list of acceptable changes.

The Resources page contains a list of acceptable changes on the ACS,
scenarios if the ACS is not processed by 31 July, exceptional
circumstances and links to the letters, contacts and guidelines.
