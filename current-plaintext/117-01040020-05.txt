Preliminary Notice

A preliminary notice is a legal notice sent by Services Australia to a
compensation payer. It tells them:

-   to notify when liability is accepted, and
-   stops them from paying the compensation until they repay Services
    Australia

A preliminary notice continues to have effect until the compensation
payer's full liability is disclosed. The compensation payer must tell
the Secretary of any further compensation payments despite refunds
already received.
