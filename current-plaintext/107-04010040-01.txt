This document outlines how to take the correct action on a new debt
activity. This can include raising the debt, finalising no debt, or a
waiver. This process is used for debt raising under Social Security Act
1991, Student Assistance Act 1973 and A New Tax System (Family
Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999, section 70, Debts due to the
Commonwealth (excluding Child Care Subsidy (CCS) and Additional Child
Care Subsidy (ACCS).

Access requirements to action debt activities

Debt staff have the required system access to perform debt related
functions, such as running the Debt Script.

Non-debt staff required to perform a debt related action need the
appropriate security access. See the Resources page of General Debt
Raising Information.

Debt action

DMIS registers an undetermined debt (debt activity) through:

-   a reassessment from the host system, or
-   a link between DMIS and another system such as the Integrated Review
    System (IRS)

Investigate the undetermined debt to check:

-   if the customer received payments in excess of their entitlement,
    and
-   there is a legally recoverable debt

Use the Debt Action script to record the details and outcome of the
debt.

A separate procedure applies for debts managed in Process Direct.

Manually add a debt record to DMIS if the system did not create one.

Clean screen policy

Action all debts on a customer record at the same time. This clean
screen policy must be adhered to where possible. See the Resources page
for further information.

System generated duplicate payment debts

The system generates a duplicate payment debt when a customer contacts
advising they have not received their payment and requests a replacement
payment. The payment is reissued to the customer, however the original
payment is not returned. A duplicate payment debt is generated for the
reissued payment. See the Resources page for an example.

Carer Supplement debts

Qualification for a Carer Supplement is dependent on a customer being
entitled to Carer Allowance or Carer Payment on 1 July. Carer Supplement
is a standalone payment rather than a component of Carer Allowance or
Carer Payment. Raise Carer Supplement debts as a separate debt under the
relevant legislation.

The References page contains links to Accountable Authority Instructions
(AAI).

The Resources page contains a list of debt reason codes, examples of
correct debt amalgamation and suggested responses to scenarios under the
clean screen policy. It also contains examples of how legally payable
arrears to be used to offset debts are calculated as well as a duplicate
payment.
