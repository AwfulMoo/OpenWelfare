This document explains the Automatic Uplift process for income estimates
for family assistance, which are automatically recalculated if the
customer has not given an estimate for the new financial year.

Default estimate

The process relates to the Automatic Uplift of income estimate for
Family Tax Benefit (FTB) and Child Care Subsidy (CCS). If the customer
has not given an estimate for the new financial year, Services Australia
will apply a default estimate. This measure is designed to reduce the
risk of debt for families.

The estimate for the new financial year (the default estimate) is
calculated by applying an indexation factor to the customer's most
recent estimate or actual income for the previous financial year. The
indexation factor is aligned with changes to the Australian Average
Weekly Earnings and may not result in an increase to the existing
estimate.

First stage Automatic Uplift (Uplift 1)

Before the start of the new financial year, income tested families will
get a letter as part of the New Financial Year Assessment (NFYA) review
process. Customers will be given the choice of either:

-   providing their own income estimate for the coming financial year,
    or
-   accepting the default estimate that has been automatically
    calculated for them

If a customer does not give a reasonable estimate for the new financial
year, the default estimate will automatically be used to calculate their
rate of FTB and/or CCS.

Second stage Automatic Uplift (Uplift 2)

Second stage Automatic Uplift will occur where:

-   the customers current FTB/CCS rate is calculated based on the
    default estimate (Uplift 1), and
-   the customer and/or their current partner lodges a tax return for a
    previous financial year, and
-   the new indexed actual income figure (calculated on the previous
    financial year actual income) is higher than the default estimate
    used to calculate Uplift 1

The second stage Automatic Uplift can occur more than once if:

-   actual income for the customer and their partner is received from
    the ATO at different times, or
-   amended actual income is received from the ATO and the new indexed
    actual income figure (based on amended actual income) is higher than
    the indexed actual income currently being used to calculate the
    customers FTB rate

Some customers not included in the first stage Automatic Uplift may be
subject to the second stage Automatic Uplift. For example, if an
estimate is not recorded for themselves or their partner.

Actual Australian Taxation Office (ATO) Income

The ATO confirms certain components of Adjusted Taxable income (ATI),
including:

-   taxable income
-   reportable fringe benefits
-   exempt reportable fringe benefits
-   reportable superannuation contributions
-   net investment losses
-   tax exempt foreign income

When these actual income component details are received from the
Australian Taxation Office (ATO) for the customer or their current
partner, the system will compare:

-   the relevant income components currently being used to work out
    ongoing FTB/CCS, and
-   the person's actual income as advised by the ATO, adjusted by the
    indexation factor

If the indexed actual income amount is greater than the current
estimate, the second stage Automatic Uplift process will start.

When actual income is received for one member of a couple, the system
will set a review for 14 days before calculating a new default estimate,
to await the receipt of the partner's actual income. If actual income
for the other member of the couple:

-   is received within 14 days, the new default estimate will apply to
    both members of the couple
-   is not received within 14 days, the new default estimate will apply
    for one member of the couple, and the existing default estimate for
    their partner

Default Uplift Estimates may result in FTB cancelling income (FTB/CAN-INC)

If a default estimate (Uplift 1 or Uplift 2) results in the customer
exceeding the relevant FTB income threshold FTB will cancel due to
income (CAN-INC).

If FTB is cancelled and the customer is providing a revised estimate
below the income threshold, FTB may be restored from the date the
revised estimate is given. A lump sum claim will be needed after the end
of the financial year to assess the CAN-INC non-payment period.

The Resources page has historical indexation factors and examples of how
the default estimate is calculated for each stage of the Automatic
Uplift process for FTB and CCS during the 2020-21 financial year,
commencing 1 July 2020.
