    domestic violence
-   New claim for Crisis Payment Other Extreme Circumstances
-   New claim for Crisis Payment after customer released from prison or
    psychiatric confinement
-   New claim for Crisis Payment prior to the release of a customer in
    prison or psychiatric confinement
-   New claim for Crisis Payment for humanitarian entrants newly arrived

Note: after assessment the reason for the decision is to be recorded in
a details DOC on the customer's record. Ensure that advice is issued to
the customer confirming whether the payment was granted or rejected.

Because CrP claims are usually of an urgent nature, the best payment
method is to pay CrP via the New Payments Platform (NPP). If NPP is

next preferred payment option.
