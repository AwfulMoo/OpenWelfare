Do not follow this procedure for self-isolation, quarantine or caring
periods that start on or before 17 January 2022. See Processing Pandemic
Leave Disaster Payment Claims in Customer First.

If allocated an online claim or Assisted Customer Claim, do not process
it in Customer First. If staff are allocated one and not trained in
processing in Process Direct, they should speak with their team leader
or Service Support Officer (SSO) for help reallocating the work item.

Customers can claim online again from 8am Wednesday 20 July 2022. If a
customer calls, tell them to visit
https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/pandemic-leave-disaster-payment for
how to claim online. If a customer does not have access to online
services, they can claim over the phone using Assisted Customer Claim
(ACC) from 9am on the same date.

There are different claiming periods depending on the self-isolation,
quarantine or caring period claimed. See the Resources page.

If a customer has lodged a claim online or using ACC that has not yet
been finalised, they cannot lodge another one. If a customer calls to
ask why they cannot lodge more than one claim, tell them:
‘You can lodge your next claim once you have received confirmation from
Services Australia on the claim outcome of your previous claim.’

Reminder: more than one Flexible Support Payment (including Pandemic
Leave Disaster Payment) cannot be paid on the same day. See Processing
Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment claims in Process Direct.

Rejecting claims

Do not follow this procedure for self-isolation, quarantine or caring
periods that start on or before 17 January 2022. See Processing Pandemic
Leave Disaster Payment Claims in Customer First.

Table 2: Process to follow if a customer’s claim is to be rejected. For
help with any steps, contact Technical Peer Support.

If a customer contacts the agency after a claim has been rejected to
provide more information or to advise they disagree with a decision
made, they can request an explanation of the decision. A formal review
cannot be undertaken. Do not try to process a new claim to change the
decision.

    period they are claiming the Pandemic leave Disaster Payment, and
-   has not reported employment or self-employment income in their last
