|                                   | backdated to 20 January which is  |
|                                   | the first day Jack became Mark's  |

|                                   | former partner. Elizabeth now has |
|                                   | two PP children in care, but has  |
|                                   | not previously claimed PP due to  |
|                                   | casual work and the income was    |
|                                   | above the income limit. Elizabeth |
|                                   | ceased work on 15 July to care    |
|                                   | for Mary and would be eligible    |
|                                   | for PP from the date Mary came    |
|                                   | into care. As Elizabeth claimed   |
|                                   | PP within 4 weeks of the date     |
|                                   | Mary came into Elizabeth's care,  |
|                                   | PP can be granted from 1 July.    |

|                                   | 2020, and is sufficient to        |
|                                   | preclude PPS from being payable   |
|                                   | at the date of claim.             |

|                                   | December 2020. The attribution of |
|                                   | the paid employment income would  |
|                                   | preclude PPS from being payable   |
|                                   | from the claim date to this first |
|                                   | EPED. The attribution of the      |

|                                   | beyond the first EPED, and as the |
|                                   | customer will not receive any     |
|                                   | further payments of employment    |

|                                   | PPS will be payable from 19       |

|                                   | first period that the paid        |
|                                   | employment income does not        |
|                                   | preclude PPS from being payable.  |

|                                   | Based on the information the      |
|                                   | customer has provided we can      |
|                                   | determine that the customer's     |
|                                   | start date will be 19 December    |
|                                   | 2020, the date after their income |
|                                   | no longer precludes payment.      |
