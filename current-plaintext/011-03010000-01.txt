This document outlines the procedures that Service Officers use in
managing Individual Healthcare Identifiers (IHI) in the HI Service.

Background

An IHI is a unique number used to identify an individual for health care
purposes.

Individuals:

-   enrolled in Medicare or who hold a Department of Veterans' Affairs
    (DVA) card have an IHI
-   not eligible for Medicare or DVA can apply for an IHI

See the Resources page for frequently asked questions about IHIs.

IHI and COVID-19

An IHI is not needed to get a COVID-19 vaccination.

People who are not eligible for Medicare or DVA can find out more
information on how to get a COVID-19 vaccine by:

-   going to the Department of Health and Aged Care website, or
-   calling the National coronavirus and COVID-19 vaccine helpline

See the Resources page for links to the website and helpline.

A person not eligible for Medicare or DVA can apply for an IHI to access
digital proof of their vaccination history, including an International
COVID-19 Vaccination Certificate. They may apply for an IHI:

-   online through the IHI Service in myGov, or
-   if unable to apply online, the Request an Individual Healthcare
    Identifier form (MS003) form can be used, see the Resources page for
    a link to the form

For below for information about handling enquiries for:

-   Coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines
-   International COVID-19 Vaccination Certificates

Release of an IHI

Service Officers:

-   can release an IHI to an individual who owns it after the completion
    of a security check
-   that do not have access to CDMS can warm transfer a request from an
    individual to the Tier 2 – HI Service team
-   should warm transfer all requests from providers or organisation to
    the Tier 2 – HI Service team. Note: Service Officers trained in HI
    (Tier 2 and 3) are the only ones who can release IHIs to healthcare
    providers and organisations

See Healthcare Identifiers (HI) Service for contact details.

The Resources page contains contact details for Tier 2 – HI Service
team, links to the National coronavirus and COVID-19 vaccine helpline,
the Department of Health and Aged Care website for COVID-19 vaccine
information, FAQs about IHIs and the MS003 form.
