This document outlines information on creating a Carer Payment (CP) link
for paper claims during the claim process where the care receiver is not
the partner of the carer.

CP link

If a CP record does not have a valid CP link, it must be created. The
link assists in the administration of CP, allowing Service Officers to
identify both the carer and the care receiver when changes to
circumstances are advised. As a variation in circumstances to either
party can impact on both payments, it is important for Service Officers
to be able to easily identify, access and check both records when
actioning changes.

E525PN: Must link the carer to the care receiver error message indicates
that the carer or partner receives or has received CP and there is no
current CP link.

If CP is current or is being granted or restored, this edit is generally
resolved by creating a CP link from the earliest payment start date, or
deleting the end date of an ended CP link if the person is still caring
for the same care receiver.

The Resources page contains a link to the online incident reporting
form.
