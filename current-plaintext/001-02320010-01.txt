This document outlines when and how Service Officers record details that
override recommendations after an ESAt is accepted.

Reason for override

Overrides to medical conditions or work capacity recommendations
generally reflect decisions to vary the Assessor's recommendations. For
example, as a result of a review of decision.

Changes passed to ESS system

When an override is recorded in the Services Australia system, the new
values for work capacity are passed back to the Department of Education,
Skills and Employment's Employment Services System (ESS) and displayed
as an annotation to the relevant ESAt report.

Note: that the new or amended values are not reflected in all parts of
the ESS. For example, Disability Employment Services (DES) and Workforce
Australia will usually determine mutual obligation requirements and
employment benchmark hours (for DES) in accordance with the original
recommendations in the ESAt report even though these have subsequently
been varied on the Services Australia customer record.

Considerations when overriding information

Consider:

-   impacts on the customer's eligibility for participation in a program
    such as DES, their mutual obligation requirements, Participation
    Requirement and hours for Partial Capacity to Work
-   whether additional action is required to ensure the customer is
    referred to the most appropriate employment assistance, and that
    work capacity and benchmark hours information is correct in the
    Department of Education, Skills and Employment's Employment Services
    System (ESS). This is essential for job seekers receiving an income
    support payment with mutual obligation requirements such as
    JobSeeker Payment (JSP), or any job seeker who is or may be referred
    to an employment service such as DES
-   the work capacities for all permanent conditions are consistent with
    the Fully Diagnosed, Treated and Stabilised (FDTS) work capacities,
    for example bandwidths for all permanent conditions should not be
    higher than FDTS work capacity
-   only override work capacity for all permanent conditions or
    temporary reduced work capacity where this is necessary, for example
    to ensure all permanent conditions are consistent with FDTS work
    capacity

The Resources page contains examples to help Service Officers understand
the effects of overriding the customer's work capacity.
