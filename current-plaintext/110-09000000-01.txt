This document outlines data matching undertaken by Services Australia.
Data matching involves bringing together data from different sources and
comparing it.

Government intent

Services Australia is responsible for ensuring public money is paid
correctly through the various programs it administers. The agency's
risk-based compliance approach uses data from a variety of internal and
external sources and combines it where appropriate to allow a holistic
intervention with the customer at risk of incorrect payment.

Types of Data matching

Centrelink undertakes data matching which involves the use Centrelink
customer records and matching internal data, or externally with data
from other agencies or third parties. This is undertaken in accordance
with the voluntary Guidelines on Data Matching in Australian Government
Administration issued by the Office of the Australian Information
Commissioner.

Background to data matching

Up until the 1980s, government agencies relied on local knowledge and
public assistance to identify incorrect payments to recipients of
government assistance. Government agencies began using computer-based
data matching in the early 1980s to detect incorrect payments. In the
1990-91 Budget, the government announced new measures to detect
incorrect payments in the income support system. They included:

-   the requirement for most people claiming government assistance to
    provide tax file numbers (TFNs) as a prerequisite for payment, and
-   increased computerised matching of data held by various Commonwealth
    agencies

Purpose of data matching

The main objectives of data matching is to:

-   detect customers who may be receiving incorrect payments
-   verify the accuracy of customers' incomes declared to agencies which
    make income support payments
-   encourage voluntary compliance - this includes deterring people from
    attempting to claim payments to which they are not entitled, the
    voluntary surrender of payments to which people may not be entitled
    and the voluntary disclosure of changes in circumstances which
    affect rates of payment
-   identify debts to the Commonwealth which may be recovered from a
    payment from another agency
-   improve the integrity of agency records
-   detect instances of tax evasion

Impact on customer

As a result of conducting data matching interventions, a decision can be
made for the customer whether:

-   to stop payments to those people who are no longer qualified
-   to reduce or increase payments to the correct rate
-   to raise a debt for any past payments that were received when not
    entitled
-   to provide assistance to people who may be entitled to another type
    of allowance/pension/payment
