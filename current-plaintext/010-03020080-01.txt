This document outlines how the Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC)
Organisation details (SY067) is assessed by AIC Smart Centre staff.

Required forms

This form is used by a non-government organisation together with the
Claim for Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) (SY040) to apply for
AIC for a student. It is used to provide details of the organisation and
why the student is in their care.

If the form is lodged at a Service Centre it should be checked to ensure
it is complete and then forwarded to the relevant AIC Smart Centre.

Claim requirements

Claims for AIC can only be accepted from an organisation that does not
receive a foster care or similar allowance for the student.

The organisation must have full responsibility for the upkeep of the
student and:

-   the student has been placed in their care by a state/territory
    authority or court, or
-   the student's parents are not involved in decisions about the care
    of the student, do not provide any financial support for the student
    and are either unable to be contacted to complete the form or are
    unwilling to do so

Geographical isolation rule

For an organisation to receive AIC for a student boarding there during
the school term, a geographical isolation rule must be met in terms of
the student's access to an appropriate state school from their parents'
home.
