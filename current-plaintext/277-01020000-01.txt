Risks to a customer's privacy have been identified. See Separating
Safely - protecting personal details to make sure the customer's
personal details are safe before progressing.

This document outlines the processes for confirming identity.

Purpose of identity checks

An identity check:

-   aligns with Services Australia's identity confirmation obligations
-   is conducted when customers asks about personal or assessment
    information/changes
-   may prevent someone, without authority, accessing or changing
    details belonging to someone else
-   is not meant to prevent or make it difficult for the customer to get
    help

Voice biometrics authentication:

-   is used by Services Australia on inbound calls to help with an
    identity check
-   uses a mutual customer’s voiceprint
-   removes the need to ask a customer for their legal name and date of
    birth
-   is available for an customer with a registered voiceprint
-   is not available for authorised representatives calling on behalf of
    a customer
-   remains on call transfers from Centrelink and internally

Completing an identity check

When doing an identity check with a customer/authorised representative:

-   always ask them to answer the questions
-   do not prompt them with personal details such as addresses, phone or
    other details available on the record

An identity check is:

not required when:

-   discussing general child support information
-   a call is voice biometrics authenticated and there is no password on
    the Child Support customer record

required when a customer wishes to discuss or change personal
information or customer/case record, and:

-   a call is not voice biometrics authenticated
-   a call is voice biometrics authenticated with a password
-   a Service Officer makes an outbound call

To find the correct Child Support record, a Service Officer can ask a
customer/representative to give their:

-   Child Support Reference Number (CSRN), or
-   Centrelink Reference Number (CRN)

Tax file numbers (TFN) are not part of an identity check.

Service Officers may ask for a TFN for income and data matching
purposes.

Do not update an incorrect CRN or TFN.

Escalate the issue to an Aligned Service Support Officer. See Technical
support in Child Support.

Giving personal details to a customer or representative

If a customer/representative asks for their personal information, and an
identity check is complete:

see Disclosing information under child support law for what details
staff can give

discuss self-service options:

-   Child Support online account
-   Express Plus Child Support mobile app, and

do not mention Freedom of Information (FOI)

Administrative release

If the details that the customer/representative wants are not available
under Disclosing information under child support law, see Administrative
release.

If the details are not available under Administrative release the
Service Officer must:

-   call the Service Support Officer (SSO) phone queue
-   select 'CS Technical' queue from the corporate directory on Services
    Australia Workspace

The SSO will confirm if the personal information requested is:

unavailable under the:

-   Disclosing information under child support law, and
-   Administrative release, and

an FOI request is appropriate, see Step 7 in the Disclosing personal
information via administrative release or Freedom of Information (FOI)
table.
