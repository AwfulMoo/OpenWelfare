This document outlines how to escalate a Medicare enrolment enquiry. It
also details how to escalate a Child Dental Benefits Schedule (CDBS)
enquiry.

An outline

A Service Officer must try to resolve a customer enquiry at first point
of contact by using all resources available.

If Services Officers are unable to help the customer, see Health Service
Delivery (HSD) Eligibility Team for assistance.

The team provides help with:

-   processing work received in PaNDA
-   complex Medicare enrolment processing issues and enquiries
-   complex phone enquiries from F2F Service Officers
-   CDBS enquiries

If HSDD staff are not able to resolve the query escalate to Medicare
Eligibility and Enrolments (MEE) Programme Support Officer (PSO).

The PSO will give a:

-   verbal answer to verbal enquiries or
-   request Service Officers to escalate the enquiry through PaNDA,
    include any investigations, notes and documents

Service Officers and HSDD Service Officers are not to escalate any
enquiries to the Medicare Public Eligibility helpdesk directly. Only an
Eligibility PSO has the delegation do this.

Document verification

Identification documents need to be verified in the Document
Verification System (DVS) prior to processing enrolment applications.
The Process page contains details on how Face to Face (F2F) Service
Officers verify information.

Role of Medicare Public Eligibility Helpdesk

The helpdesk Tier 3 is in place to help with exceptional or out of the
ordinary enrolment requests and enquiries. This can include giving an
accurate interpretation of eligibility policies to help work out a
customer's eligibility.

The advice helpdesk gives takes into account all of the relevant
legislative and policy requirements and is used to assess the customer’s
individual circumstances. A final decision is then made that matches the
policy intent.

In most cases the helpdesk or policy teams do not contact the customer
unless is required.

The Resources page contains links to contact details and the Document
Verification System (DVS) request form.
