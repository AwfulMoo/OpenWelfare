Bankruptcy

Bankruptcy is a process that occurs when people who cannot pay their
debts give control of their finances to a trustee (by agreement or court
order), in exchange for protection against legal action from creditors.
The trustee is responsible for managing the debt owed by the bankrupt
person during the bankruptcy period. The sequestration date is the date
the customer was declared bankrupt.

See Debt Repayment, Collection and Debt macro, and manage the bankrupt
customer in line with Customer Management Approach (CMA) for Child
Support.
