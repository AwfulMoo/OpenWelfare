Invalid decisions

New Customer and Mainstream Services Program Support Managers (PSM) are
authorised to make certain parentage decisions invalid where an
application for assessment has been accepted or refused in error due to
the decision maker:

-   failing to take account of material evidence such as a birth
    certificate that was already in Services Australia’s possession
-   denying a customer procedural fairness by making a decision before
    the expiration of a policy stated time frame
-   failing to explore all nine fact situations that could have
    satisfied the presumption of parentage provisions
-   denying a customer procedural fairness by not consulting them before
    making the decision
-   making a keying error that resulted in the decision being
    incorrectly refused

All staff in the Child Support Program Advice Team are also authorised
to make these decisions. The decision to declare a decision invalid in
other circumstances can only be authorised by an Assistant Director in
Child Support Program Advice.

Support and Redress Division (for Part 6A decisions). National Manager,
