This document outlines the Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
system.

Use of CRM

All contacts with applicants must be recorded in the CRM as per the CRM
Hot Keys and also in the My Health Record Tracking Database (the
Tracker) as an event.

As the CRM is owned by the Australian Digital Health Agency, the Tracker
allows Services Australia to keep their own record of contact with
applicants.

Access to CRM

For access to CRM a form requesting a CRM licence is required to be
completed by the Team Leader (TL5). An email is sent to the My Health
Record Provider Operations Inbox to request a copy of the eHealth New
User Licence form.

The Resources page contains a link to the Contacts for the My Health
Record system.
