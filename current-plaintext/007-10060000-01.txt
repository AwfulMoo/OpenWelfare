Mutual obligation requirements

As part of the Online Participation workflow, a customer's job readiness
and capability to look for and accept work will be determined.

Principal carers on JobSeeker Payment (JSP), Youth Allowance (YA) job
seeker or Special Benefit (SpB) are subject to part-time mutual
obligation requirements regardless of the age of their youngest child.
Parenting payment Single (PPS) customers are subject to part-time mutual
obligation requirements from the date their youngest dependent child
turns six years of age.

During their participation interview, new customers will be advised of
their mutual obligation requirements and assistance available including:

-   the benefits of working and planning for future economic
    participation
-   the options and opportunities available
-   the range of services and support available for a planned return to
    work, and
-   the benefits of financial independence and eventual exit from income
    support

For Centrelink managed job seekers with mutual obligation requirements,
a Job Plan will be negotiated which will include activities that must
fully meet their mutual obligation requirements. Provider managed job
seekers will negotiate a Job Plan with their Employment Services
Provider.

Exemption from mutual obligation requirements

A temporary exemption from mutual obligation requirements may be
appropriate, depending on the customer's circumstances. Some exemptions
apply only to principal carers.

Incentives

There are a number of incentives for customers preparing for workforce
participation, including:

-   if the customer is under Age Pension age - working credits can
    reduce the effect of employment income on the customer's income
    support payments
-   if the customer is over Age Pension age - and in receipt of a
    pension (excluding PPS) they may be entitled to the Work Bonus.
    Note: the Work Bonus is not used in the customer's transitional
    rules calculation, however the Work Bonus will still be used in the
    comparison calculations and partners may still benefit by the
    reduction in total income
-   entitlement to certain benefits is maintained during an employment
    income nil rate period, however, customers receiving FTB Part A will
    be subject to the FTB Part A income test during this period
-   payment can be resumed within the employment income nil rate period
    without the need to reclaim if income decreases
-   exemption from the Parental Income Test (PIT) during the period that
    their working credits are being depleted if their dependent children
    are on YA
-   Additional Child Care Subsidy (ACCS) (Transition to Work) can be
    paid in addition to Child Care Subsidy Benefit (CCB) to provide
    additional child care fee assistance for customers transitioning
    from an income support payment to work. ACCS (Transition to Work) is
    time limited depending on the activity being undertaken
