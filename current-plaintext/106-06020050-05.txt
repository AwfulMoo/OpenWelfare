|                                   | Aaron is a New Zealand citizen on |
|                                   | JobSeeker Payment (JSP) who has   |
|                                   | been living in Australia on a 444 |
|                                   | visa. Home Affairs have cancelled |
|                                   | Aaron's latest visa. The Legal    |
|                                   | Residence (RSLEG) screen shows    |
|                                   | the latest 444 was ended. As the  |
|                                   | system will not automatically     |
|                                   | cancel the JSP, NCV will need to  |
|                                   | be coded on the RSLEG screen from |
|                                   | the visa date of cancellation +1. |
|                                   | This will ensure Aaron's payment  |
|                                   | ceases.                           |

|                                   | in Australia since they were      |
|                                   | young. Bill was originally        |
|                                   | granted a 175 permanent visa.     |
|                                   | Since travelling in recent years, |
|                                   | Bill returned to Australia on a   |
|                                   | 155 (returning resident) visa.    |
|                                   | Home Affairs have advised that    |
|                                   | Bill's visa has been cancelled    |
|                                   | and the 155 visa has been end     |
|                                   | dated on the RSLEG screen. As     |
|                                   | Bill has an 801 visa and further  |
|                                   | 155 visa entries recorded, Bill's |
|                                   | residence status has not been     |
|                                   | correctly reassessed. NCV will    |
|                                   | need to be coded on the RSLEG     |
|                                   | screen from the visa date of      |
|                                   | cancellation +1, ensuring Bill's  |
|                                   | payment ceases.                   |

|                                   | As CCS is continuing, NCV will    |
|                                   | need to be coded on the RSLEG     |
|                                   | screen from the visa date of      |
