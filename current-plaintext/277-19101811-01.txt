This document outlines how to process a residency determination as part
of an application for assessment in Pluto.

Residency decision

Child Support can become aware that a residency decision is required
when a customer:

-   makes an application for an assessment and
-   advises they or the other parent reside outside of Australia

A customer’s place of residence is a factor in determining a customer’s
eligibility to apply for a child support assessment. Therefore, a
residency decision needs to be made to determine that the customer is a
resident of:

-   of Australia, or
-   a reciprocating jurisdiction, or
-   a non-reciprocating jurisdiction

Residency decisions are completed by International Service Officers. For
information about referring customers to the International Team, see
Customer referral guidelines for Child Support staff.

Applications for overseas maintenance liabilities cannot be processed in
Pluto. These applications must be processed in Cuba, see Residency
decisions for Child Support customers - Specialist Service Officer

Pluto does not recognise all reciprocating jurisdictions

Pluto does not recognise Andorra and Albania as reciprocating
jurisdictions. Vatican City must be chosen when processing a residency
decision in Cuba and a customer resides in Andorra or Albania.

North Macedonia is not recognised by Pluto. Macedonia must be chosen
when processing a residency decision in Pluto and a customer resides in
North Macedonia.
