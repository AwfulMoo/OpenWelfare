Do not follow this procedure for self-isolation, quarantine or caring
periods, or second or subsequent claim periods that start on or before
17 January 2022. See Processing Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment Claims
in Customer First.

Customers can claim online again from 8am Wednesday 20 July 2022. If a
customer calls, tell them to visit
https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/pandemic-leave-disaster-payment for
how to claim online. If a customer does not have access to online
services, they can claim over the phone using Assisted Customer Claim
(ACC) from 9am on the same date.

There are different claiming periods depending on the self-isolation,
quarantine or caring period claimed. See the Resources page.

If a customer has lodged a claim online or using ACC that has not yet
been finalised, they cannot lodge another one. If a customer calls to
ask why they cannot lodge more than 1 claim, tell them:
‘You can lodge your next claim once you have received confirmation from
Services Australia on the claim outcome of your previous claim.’

Reminder: more than one Flexible Support Payment (including Pandemic
Leave Disaster Payment) cannot be paid on the same day. See Processing
Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment claims in Process Direct.

|                                   | Ask the customer how the reason   |

|                                   | period. For reason 5, this may be |
|                                   | due to receiving incorrect advice |
|                                   | from the agency, their employer   |

|                                   | Staff must consider if the period |
|                                   | between the late claim reason and |
|                                   | lodging the claim is reasonable.  |
|                                   | If not, the customer’s claim      |
|                                   | cannot be accepted.               |

|                                   | Staff may need to consider how    |
|                                   | certain sensitive situations can  |
|                                   | impact a person over a longer     |
|                                   | period of time.                   |

|                                   | For example:                      |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   |     family member may cause       |
|                                   |     longer term impacts for a     |
|                                   |     customer. A delay in lodging  |
|                                   |     a late claim could be         |
|                                   |     reasonable in this instance   |
|                                   | -   a customer may have been      |
|                                   |     admitted to hospital due to   |
|                                   |     the effects of COVID-19. They |
|                                   |     may have recovered not long   |

|                                   |     not to lodge a claim for      |
|                                   |     another 3 months. A delay in  |
|                                   |     lodging a late claim may not  |
|                                   |     be reasonable in this         |
|                                   |     instance                      |
