This document contains information about and outlines the steps in the
recovery of Medicare patient debts.

Patient debts

Medicare program areas refer patient debts to Medicare Recovery by:

-   A Report Management Distribution System (RMDS) report from the
    Medicare mainframe
-   A Debt Advice Notice (DAN) from the relevant program area
-   Voluntary recovery acknowledgement direct from the customer

Public Medicare Benefit Scheme (MBS) debts

Overpayments occur when Medicare benefits are overpaid in patient claims
because of incorrect information given by:

-   patients
-   providers, or
-   Service Officers

Follow up of debts under $100 is generally not needed. See Table 1 in on
the Process page.

When the overpayment amount is more than $100, normal recovery
procedures apply. The weekly report from the program area displays all
processed overpayments for patient claims over $100.

Report Management Distribution System (RMDS) report

The report includes MBS Public and Simplified Billing debts identified
by Medicare program areas.

Medicare Recovery uses the content of this report to:

-   process write-offs
-   create customers in SAP, and
-   allocate payments

Medicare Overpayment (MCO) and Bulk bill (BB) report

Medicare Recovery prepares the MCO and BB reports for program areas each
month.

The MCO and BB reports give program areas details of debts voluntarily
repaid by cheque. The report allows the program area to:

-   know of these repayments, and
-   get the correct information to adjust patient records

The Resources page contains a list of formulas and links to contact
details for program areas.
