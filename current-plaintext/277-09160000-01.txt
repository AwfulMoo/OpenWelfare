This document outlines the process for the management of customers by
the Solutions Gateway Team (SGT).

Solutions Gateway Team (SGT)

The SGT provides a real time telephone service offer to support
customers who need intensive short-term support for complex child
support matters. The SGT will also provide support to customers with
child support issues who have been unable to have them resolved at the
first point of contact.

SGT roles and Cuba naming restrictions:

-   Service Officer 5 (SO5) role is referred to as Solutions Gateway
    Team (SGT) Officer
-   Cuba processing and intrays guidelines refer to the previous name of
    Customer Review Gateway or CRG, rather than the new name of SGT

SGT referral criteria

The Resources page has a link to SGT Quick Reference Guide for more
information.

Customers are referred to the SGT according to the Customer referral
guidelines for Child Support staff.

SGT phone queue

The SGT has a separate phone queue, which is managed by SO5 SGT Service
Officers who immediately work with the customer to:

-   resolve issues at the first point of contact
-   coordinate assistance for customers facing significant disadvantage
    or multiple barriers and help them to access, navigate or interpret
    services across a range of payments, programs and services
-   focus on early intervention and transitioning the customer back into
    mainstream channels
-   identify and communicate the best approach for resolving their
    issues in a way that minimises the need for further contact
-   ensure customers who need intensive support receive a prompt,
    tailored service to achieve a quality outcome

SGT referral intrays

SGT Referral intrays are routed to each team's none position and are
used to refer different work items to SGT, such as:

-   Customers who have been unable to have their child support issues
    resolved at first point of contact
-   Complex work that requires detailed research and investigation,
    including complex error corrections
-   Data Integrity issues
-   Estimates / Estimate reconciliations requiring deletion
-   ES consolidated revenue reassignment referrals
-   Fraud tip off referral

SGT and existing Child Support processes

SGT does not replace existing processes for:

-   a Team Leader referral to Personalised Services
-   complaints and feedback
-   the Technical Support model, or
-   the management of Ombudsman, MP, Ministerial, privacy or security
    incidents

If a customer understands the decisions and actions taken on their case,
however is dissatisfied about service, inaction, or staff behaviour, see
Managing customer complaints and feedback.

Service recovery

Service recovery work in SGT can involve taking corrective action in
Cuba to ensure the child support case is correct.

Customers impacted by service recovery work are not always locked to SGT
Service Officers and, at times, exemptions are granted from SGT Service
Officers applying the full

Customer Management Approach (CMA) process.

SGT uses intrays to track and monitor work. All intrays that relate to
service recovery are locked to SGT PST National holding positions, or to
SGT teams or Services Officers. Services Officers outside of SGT should
not delete or route these intrays elsewhere, and customers must not to
be locked to holding positions.

The Resources page has a link to the SGT Quick Reference Guide and other
resources to assist in utilising the SGT.
