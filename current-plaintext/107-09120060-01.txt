This document outlines the process of raising debts for students who
fail to notify of ceasing studies.

Legally recoverable debt

Changes to a customer's circumstances will cause reassessment of:

-   ABSTUDY
-   Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) Scheme
-   Austudy
-   Department of Social Services Pensioner Education Supplement (PES)
-   Youth Allowance (YA)

In some cases, this occurs when parent and sibling circumstances change.
This reassessment may cause a positive or negative adjustment.

If the reassessment results in a negative adjustment, check:

-   the excess payment (and any component of it) is correct, and
-   whether it is a legally recoverable debt

Student Payment eligibility

To remain eligible, a student or trainee must continue to meet either:

the study requirements for:

-   ABSTUDY
-   Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) Scheme
-   Pensioner Education Supplement (PES)

the activity test requirements for:

-   Austudy
-   Youth Allowance (YA)

Prior to 1 January 2008, YA customers (under 21 years of age) could meet
their activity test requirements by means other than study. Investigate
each case to determine if the requirements have been met.

Youth Allowance (YA) paid on behalf of customer to parent

Youth Allowance is paid to the parents on behalf of a dependent person
under 18 years of age.

The person (and not the parent) is the legal recipient of the Youth
Allowance. This means that liability for any debt arising from a loss of
entitlement belongs to the person. This also applies where monies have
been misdirected away from the young person.

For more information, see Raising Parental Income Test (PIT) debts.

Participation failures

As of 1 January 2008, participation failures or breaches do not apply if
a customer's payment is cancelled.

Start date of debt

Raise debts for ABSTUDY, Austudy, AIC, PES and YA from the date after
the customer last studied.

Third Party debts

ABSTUDY and AIC Scheme debts may be the responsibility of a third party.
This could be an educational institution, parent or guardian. Check to
confirm which party directly received the payment.

Processing responsibilities

Processing responsibilities are:

-   ABSTUDY debts are raised by the ABSTUDY Smart Centre Network
-   Student debts generated by Centrelink Academic Reassessment
    Transformation (CART) reviews on the customer are to be finalised as
    part of the review by the CART processing team
-   Student debts generated by Tertiary Collection of Student
    Information (TCSI) reviews are to be finalised by the Study Load
    Intervention (SLI) team
-   AIC debts are raised by the AIC processing team
-   PES debts are raised by the PES processing team

Refer all other debts to Debt Programme and Compensation Recovery (DPCR)
and Compliance Programme Branch.
