This is a Family and Domestic Violence Interaction Point. If the
customer is with another person, on speaker phone, or already identified

This document outlines how to change the Personal Identification Number
(PIN) for a customer's BasicsCard, including for when a BasicsCard has
been posted in the mail.

Changing a BasicsCard PIN

A customer, or their payment nominee (if the BasicsCard was issued to
the payment nominee on behalf of the customer), can request to change
the PIN for their BasicsCard. This can be actioned by Service Officers
at:

-   Centrelink Service Centres
-   Remote Service Centres
-   Remote Servicing Team with Centrelink system connectivity, or
-   by contacting the Income Management Line

BasicsCard posted in the mail

Customers/nominees who have a BasicsCard posted in the mail need to
activate the card and change the PIN before they can use it. Once the
customer/nominee get the BasicsCard in the mail, they will contact
Services Australia for support with these actions. See BasicsCard
reactivate posted or previously suspended card for support with this
part of the process before changing the PIN.

BasicsCard blocked due to incorrect PIN

A customer's BasicsCard will be automatically blocked by the Card
Transaction Provider (CTP) if the customer makes six incorrect PIN
attempts in a row.

The BasicsCard will remain blocked until the customer contacts Services
Australia.
