This document outlines additional payment options that may be available
for Cashless Debit Card participants requesting an urgent payment.

Definition of an urgent payment

Urgent payment is the early delivery of part of a participant’s
entitlement because they are experiencing severe financial hardship due
to exceptional and unforeseen circumstances.

When a participant receives an urgent payment, their next regular
payment will be less than their usual entitlement.

Offering alternative help to participants

Before assessing a request for an urgent payment, Service Officers need
to explore other assistance options with the customer or check if they
have Cashless Debit Card funds available to use.

Effect of an urgent payment

Approved urgent payments are paid into a CDC participant’s unrestricted
bank account unless they ask for it to be paid to their CDC account.

Granting an urgent payment will result in the amount of a participant’s
next regular payment being reduced. This will also reduce the amount
paid to the participant's CDC account, which may prevent any regular
BPay or Direct Debit payments from the account due to insufficient funds
