This document outlines when a customer notifies a change of address and
an inter-environment transfer of a debt is required.

Transfer of record to a new environment

When a customer moves to a new area, the environment for their records
may also change and require updating. When scheduled for transfer, all
of the online files will transfer to the gaining environment. The
responsibility for transferring records between environments lies with
the staff member.

A record will not transfer if there are outstanding activities.
