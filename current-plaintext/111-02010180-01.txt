This document outlines the process of accessing archived Commonwealth
Seniors Health Card (CSHC) data using the Archiving and Culling Engine
(ACE) application.

General rules

The general rules for archiving CSHC records are:

-   The record must have been cancelled for 3 or more years
-   The record must not have a recent or unfinalised Debt, Appeal,
    Prosecution or Compensation activity

Service reasons to be archived

The only SHC service reason to be archived is CSHC (Commonwealth Seniors
Health Care Card).

Not all data for a 3 year old cancelled record is archived. Assessment
data, Summary files and Circumstance data relevant to CSHC are archived.
No Person data or common Circumstance data is archived, and this data is
retained in Centrelink system for use by other Common Platform Systems.

After a record has been archived, the CSHC data normally displayed on
the system will be displayed in a similar format in ACE.

The Resources page contains a link to the Archiving and Culling Engine
(ACE).
