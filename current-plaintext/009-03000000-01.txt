This document outlines information about Carer Allowance (CA).

CA is an income supplement for people who provide additional daily care
and attention for an adult or child with a disability or medical
condition, or an adult who is frail aged. CA is not taxable or assets
tested. To be eligible for CA, the carer’s and their partner’s combined
Adjusted Taxable Income (ATI) must be under $250,000 a year. This
includes deemed amount from account-based income streams if the account
holder is 60 years of age or older. The same income limit applies if the
carer does not have a partner.

The carer's and their partner's income does not affect the rate of CA
that is paid.

CA can be paid in addition to wages or another income support payment.
CA recognises the impact of a person's disability on the carer.
