This document outlines information for staff where a Centrelink,
Medicare or Child Support customer is identified as a Witness Protection
Program participant.

Government intent

The Australian Government recognises the importance of providing
assistance to Witness Protection Program participants while ensuring
that the security risks for these customers are minimised.

Customer identifies themselves as a Witness Protection Program participant

Customers may contact Services Australia and identify themselves as
having had a formal change of identity as part of entering into a
Witness Protection Program.

These customers will often request:

-   the creation of a new record in Centrelink, Medicare or Child
    Support; and/or
-   information to be transferred from the original identity to the
    current identity (new record)

Staff must not assist in creating a new record or transferring
information to a new record for these customers.

If a customer discloses their involvement in a Witness Protection
Program, the customer should be advised to contact their relevant State
or Territory Witness Protection Program case officer.

Services Australia has established a Witness Protection help line for
staff assisted enquiries only. Staff can contact this number for queries
or clarifications relating to Centrelink, Medicare and Child Support
witness protection matters.

Staff must not under any circumstances, identify or try to contact any
business areas who may be responsible for processes or policies relating
to witness protection matters within Services Australia.

Services Australia records identify customer as Witness Protection Program participant

Services Australia must not identify or record customers as being
Witness Protection Program participants.

If a Service Officer discovers a Centrelink, Medicare or Child Support
customer record which identifies the customer as being a Witness
Protection Program participant, contact the Witness Protection help
line.

The Resources page contains a link to the Witness Protection help line
for staff assisted enquiries.
