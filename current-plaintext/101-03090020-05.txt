|                                   | Glenda lodged an FTB claim on 15  |
|                                   | August 2012, and the claim was    |
|                                   | finalised on 30 August 2012.      |
|                                   | Glenda's CEA amount was           |
|                                   | determined when the FTB claim was |
|                                   | finalised.                        |

|                                   | As they received income support,  |

|                                   | was used to calculate their CEA   |

|                                   | reduced due to the income test,   |

|                                   | Part A rate exceeded their base   |
|                                   | rate, so the CEA was calculated   |
|                                   | based on their maximum rate of    |
|                                   | FTB Part A (excluding add-ons)    |
|                                   | for each FTB child.               |

|                                   | would be based on two children,   |
|                                   | and income and maintenance income |
|                                   | testing would reduce their Part A |
|                                   | to base rate, so the CEA amount   |
|                                   | would be based on their Part A    |
|                                   | base rate.                        |

|                                   | This shows that although a CEA is |
|                                   | not paid for a Regular Care       |
|                                   | Child, the Regular Care Child may |
|                                   | influence the rate of CEA paid    |
|                                   | for other FTB children in the     |
|                                   | family.                           |
