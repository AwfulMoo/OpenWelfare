This document outlines the process for correcting a duplicate Child
Support customer record.

Duplicate customer records

Duplicate records may occur due to:

-   staff error
-   customer error (for example, the customer gives an incorrect date of
    birth)
-   creating a new record without a proper Cuba search
-   registering the customers and/or children of the case without
    getting enough information
-   International case requirements, and
-   using the surname 'unknown'

It is essential to maintain a unique customer record because:

-   A customer with 2 separate payer records will be over-assessed for
    child support. This is because the multi-case allowance will not
    reflect in the other case
-   A parent with 2 separate payer records who is assessed to pay child
    support to more than 1 payee will only have payments disbursed to 1
    payee as the apportionment process cannot apply if the payer is
    making payments using multiple customer records (CSRN).
-   Customers may not match correctly with Centrelink records. This can
    cause problems with:
-   care decisions
-   child support assessments
-   collection from Centrelink payments
-   transfer of customer details between Centrelink and Child Support
    systems
-   Family Tax Benefit payments
-   reasonable maintenance action
