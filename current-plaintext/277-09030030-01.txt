This document explains the process for correcting a duplicate Child
Support customer record.

Duplicate customer records

Duplicate records may occur due to:

-   staff error
-   customer error (for example, the customer gives an incorrect date of
    birth)
-   creating a new record without a proper Cuba search
-   registering the customers and/or children of the case without
    getting enough information
-   International case requirements, and
-   using the surname 'unknown'

It is essential to maintain a unique customer record because:

A customer with 2 separate payer records will be over-assessed for child
support. This is because the multi-case allowance will not reflect in
the other case

A parent with duplicate collect records will get duplicate payer account
summary statements. Each statement will have a unique payment reference
number requesting them to pay their Child Support. If a payer makes
payment to one of these payment reference numbers, the other payee will
not get any disbursements

Customers may not match correctly with Centrelink records. This can
cause problems with:

-   care decisions
-   child support assessments
-   collection from Centrelink payments
-   transfer of customer details between Centrelink and Child Support
    systems
-   Family Tax Benefit payments
-   reasonable maintenance action
