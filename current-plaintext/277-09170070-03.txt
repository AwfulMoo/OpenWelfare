This page contains the process for making a summary disallow decision.

Effective 16 December 2014, decisions cannot be made on Change of
Assessment (COA) applications where the COA application was made AFTER
the assessment has ended for the child. Where an objection to a COA
decision is received where the COA application was lodged after the
assessment has ended for the child, escalate the case to the Child
Support Program Branch to seek advice about any action required on the
original COA decision.
