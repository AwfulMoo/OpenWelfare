|                                   | manually code the death action.   |

|                                   | partnered person the Notification |
|                                   | handler (NOHL) is incorrectly     |
|                                   | using the date of notification as |
|                                   | the date to increase the          |
|                                   | survivor's rate to the single     |
|                                   | rate. The workaround for this is  |
|                                   | to record the date of receipt     |
|                                   | (DOR) as the later of date of     |
|                                   | death or date paid to + 1. The    |
