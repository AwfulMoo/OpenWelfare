Maps of affected areas

Due to the ongoing nature of this event the Victoria Emergency Live Feed
Application should be used to assess if a customer is reasonably close.

Using the Google Maps measuring tool

If it is difficult to determine if a customer's principal place of
residence is 'reasonably close' to a burn scar, that is, within 5 to 10
kms using the Victoria Emergency Live Feed Application, use the Google
Maps measuring tool for further assistance. The Google Maps measuring
tool allows distances to be measured between an address and another
selected location.

    Emergency Live Feed Application and confirm the customer lives in a
    declared LGA
-   Determine where the closest fire is according to the Victoria
    Emergency Live Feed Application (zooming out may be required)

-   Place the customer’s address in Google Maps and select ‘search’
-   Once the address is located on Google Maps, zoom out
-   Compare this with the Victoria Emergency Live Feed Application
-   Pinpoint the approximate location of the burn scar on the Google map
-   Right mouse click on this location and select option 'Measure
    Distance'
-   Left mouse click on the customer's address
-   The distance will be displayed at the customer's address in
    kilometres (km)
