|                                   | Amy checks her bank account and   |
|                                   | realises that her income support  |
|                                   | payment of $200 (which is usually |
|                                   | in her account today) has not     |
|                                   | been received.                    |

|                                   | out why her payment has not been  |
|                                   | received. A Service Officer lets  |
|                                   | Amy know that her payment was     |
|                                   | paid to her account and that she  |
|                                   | will need to contact her bank to  |
|                                   | check what has occurred.          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Amy approaches her bank and finds |
|                                   | out that she overdrew her account |
|                                   | by $300 and her payment was used  |
|                                   | to repay the overdrawn amount.    |
|                                   | Amy’s bank disputes her           |
|                                   | entitlement to the money and      |
|                                   | indicates that they will not      |
|                                   | release her income support        |
|                                   | payment.                          |

|                                   | Amy contacts the agency again to  |
|                                   | see if anything can be done, as   |
|                                   | she now has no money for this     |
|                                   | fortnight. The Service Officer:   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   tells Amy that the agency has |
|                                   |     an agreement with certain     |
|                                   |     banks to make sure that if a  |
|                                   |     customer overdraws their      |
|                                   |     account they can keep at      |
|                                   |     least 90% of their payment in |
|                                   |     a given pay period            |
|                                   | -   checks that Amy’s bank is a   |
|                                   |     member bank of those          |
|                                   |     associations included in the  |
|                                   |     Code and that her payment is  |
|                                   |     also covered                  |
|                                   | -   suggests that Amy contact her |
|                                   |     bank and ask for help with    |
|                                   |     getting protection of her     |

|                                   | -   lets Amy know that, if        |
|                                   |     needed, with her consent,     |
|                                   |     they will contact her bank to |
|                                   |     discuss the return of 90% of  |

|                                   | With Amy present to provide       |
|                                   | consent, the Service Officer      |
|                                   | calls the bank on Amy’s behalf,   |
|                                   | discusses the Code and organises  |
|                                   | an appointment for Amy to         |
