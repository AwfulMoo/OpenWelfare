This procedure outlines how staff can view current or previous
assessment details. The CCS Social Services Plan (SSP) displays
eligibility and entitlement details for each assessment.

Check current assessment in Process Direct

Before finalising a claim or reassessment, view the SSP outcome to:

-   review eligibility and entitlement details
-   check the provisional outcome
-   ensure the result is correct and that any arrears/debt can be
    explained

View previous assessments in Customer First

This tool can be used to view assessments in chronological order.

It can be used to check the assessment on a certain date if the
Entitlement screen in Process Direct has since changed. The Entitlement
screen only shows the most recent assessment.

The Resources page contains user guides with example screen images.
