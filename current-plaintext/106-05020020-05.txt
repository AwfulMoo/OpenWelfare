| Item                              | Example                           |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Customer has ceased employment    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Lance ceases work and is paid 30  |
|                                   | days of unused annual leave for a |
|                                   | total amount of $2,100. Lance was |
|                                   | also paid Long Service Leave of   |
|                                   | 150 days and a payment of         |
|                                   | $15,000. Lance lodges a claim for |
|                                   | JobSeeker Payment (JSP). The IMP  |
|                                   | is calculated as follows:         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   $15,000/150 = $100 per day    |
|                                   | -   $2,100/30 = $70 per day       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The total IMP would be 180 days.  |
|                                   | The first 150 days at $100 per    |
|                                   | day and the last 30 days at $70   |
|                                   | per day.                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Lance finds work 2 weeks into the |
|                                   | IMP. However, Lance only worked   |
|                                   | for 6 weeks. On leaving this      |
|                                   | latest employer, Lance is paid 10 |
|                                   | days of unused sick leave of      |
|                                   | $800.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   $800/10 = $80 per day         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Lance's original IMP remains and  |
|                                   | Lance must now serve an           |
|                                   | additional 10 days at the rate of |
|                                   | $80 per day.                      |

|                                   | redundancy payment consists of:   |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | Gina's average weekly wage was    |
|                                   | $1,000. Gina applies for          |

|                                   | calculated as follows:            |

|                                   | -   $5,000 annual leave = 5 weeks |
|                                   | -   $14,500/$1,000 = 14.5 weeks   |
|                                   |     which is rounded down to 14   |
|                                   |     weeks                         |

|                                   | Gina's IMP will be 34 weeks at    |
|                                   | $1,000 per week and rounded down  |
|                                   | to the nearest day.               |
