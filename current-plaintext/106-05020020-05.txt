| Item                              | Example                           |

| 1                                 | Customer has ceased employment +  |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Lance ceases work and is paid 30  |
|                                   | days annual leave for a total     |
|                                   | amount of $2,100. Lance also      |
|                                   | received Long Service Leave of    |
|                                   | 150 days and a payment of         |
|                                   | $15,000. Lance lodges a claim for |
|                                   | JobSeeker Payment (JSP). The IMP  |
|                                   | is calculated as follows:         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   $15,000/150 = $100 per day    |
|                                   | -   $2,100/30 = $70 per day       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The total IMP would be 180 days.  |
|                                   | The first 150 days at $100 per    |
|                                   | day and the last 30 days at $70   |
|                                   | per day.                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Lance finds work 2 weeks into the |
|                                   | IMP. However, Lance only worked   |
|                                   | for 6 weeks. On leaving this      |
|                                   | latest employer, Lance receives   |
|                                   | 10 days sick leave payment of     |
|                                   | $800.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   $800/10 = $80 per day         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Lance's original IMP remains and  |
|                                   | Lance must now serve an           |
|                                   | additional 10 days at the rate of |
|                                   | $80 per day.                      |
