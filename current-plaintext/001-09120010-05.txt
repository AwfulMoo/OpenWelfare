Assessment of permanent medical conditions

Table 2: This table describes how to assess permanent medical conditions
and inviting job seekers to claim for Disability Support Pension (DSP).

| Assessment                        | Description                       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Difference between 'permanent     | It is important to distinguish    |
| medical condition' and 'long term | between a permanent medical       |
| incapacity for work'              | condition and a permanent (or     |
|                                   | long term) incapacity for work. A |
|                                   | job seeker who is permanently     |
|                                   | incapacitated for all work of 8   |
|                                   | hours or more per week (for at    |
|                                   | least 2 years) cannot generally   |
|                                   | be granted a temporary incapacity |
|                                   | exemption.                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A permanent medical condition     |
|                                   | may, or may not, cause a          |
|                                   | permanent incapacity for work     |
|                                   | depending upon circumstances. For |
|                                   | example, a person with            |
|                                   | well-controlled asthma may be     |
|                                   | suited to undertake full-time     |
|                                   | activities for mutual obligation  |
|                                   | requirements under normal         |
|                                   | circumstances. If they have a     |
|                                   | temporary exacerbation of their   |
|                                   | asthma, they may seek an          |
|                                   | exemption from mutual obligation  |
|                                   | requirements because of a         |
|                                   | temporary exacerbation of a       |
|                                   | permanent condition.              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | An exemption may be granted if it |
|                                   | is clear from all available       |
|                                   | information that the incapacity   |
|                                   | for work is likely to be          |
|                                   | temporary. For example, if the    |
|                                   | medical certificate lists the     |
|                                   | primary condition as 'permanent'  |
|                                   | and states that the prognosis     |
|                                   | (impacts on customer's capacity   |
|                                   | for work) is expected to be 3-12  |
|                                   | months. In this case a service    |
|                                   | officer may accept that this is a |
|                                   | temporary exacerbation of a       |
|                                   | permanent condition.              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Customers should not be asked to  |
|                                   | go back to their treating medical |
|                                   | practitioners, to change existing |
|                                   | opinion on whether a condition is |
|                                   | 'permanent' or 'exacerbation of a |
|                                   | permanent condition' or           |
|                                   | 'temporary'.                      |

|                                   | Example 1: A job seeker with an   |
|                                   | amputation has a permanent        |
|                                   | medical condition, which may      |
|                                   | affect their ability to work,     |
|                                   | according to the type of          |
|                                   | amputation. Consider whether      |
|                                   | there has been a missing limb     |
|                                   | from birth, or an amputation as   |

|                                   | Example 3 - the medical           |
|                                   | certificate provided by the job   |
|                                   | seeker was issued too long ago    |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   when deciding to apply this   |
|                                   |     reason, consider if it was    |
|                                   |     reasonable for the job seeker |
|                                   |     to supply their medical       |
|                                   |     evidence at an earlier date.  |
|                                   |     For example, if the job       |

|                                   |     not have someone to act on    |
|                                   |     their behalf, it would be     |
|                                   |     unreasonable for the job      |
|                                   |     seeker to provide the medical |
|                                   |     certificate until after they  |
|                                   |     were well enough to do so     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the job seeker is still        |
|                                   | seeking an exemption, advise them |
|                                   | they need to provide a valid      |
|                                   | medical certificate from their    |
|                                   | medical practitioner              |
