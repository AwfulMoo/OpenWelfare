|                                   | provide enough information to     |
|                                   | assess an exemption request       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Example 2 - the service officer   |
|                                   | is not satisfied with the         |
|                                   | integrity of the information on   |
|                                   | the medical certificate,          |
|                                   | including suspected fraud         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Example 3 - the medical           |
|                                   | certificate provided by the job   |
|                                   | seeker was issued too long ago    |
|                                   | and can no longer be considered a |
|                                   | current and valid assessment of   |
|                                   | their medical condition           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   when deciding to apply this   |
|                                   |     reason, consider if it was    |
|                                   |     reasonable for the job seeker |
|                                   |     to supply their medical       |
|                                   |     evidence at an earlier date.  |
|                                   |     For example, if the job       |
|                                   |     seeker was comatose and did   |
|                                   |     not have someone to act on    |
|                                   |     their behalf, it would be     |
|                                   |     unreasonable for the job      |
|                                   |     seeker to provide the medical |
|                                   |     certificate until after they  |
|                                   |     were well enough to do so     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the job seeker is still        |
|                                   | seeking an exemption, advise them |
|                                   | they need to provide a valid      |
|                                   | medical certificate from their    |
|                                   | medical practitioner              |
