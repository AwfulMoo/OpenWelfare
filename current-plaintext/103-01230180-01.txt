This document outlines how customers can transfer income managed funds
to their BasicsCard using their Centrelink online account. Customers can
also use the Express Plus Centrelink mobile app or phone self service.

Eligibility to use this service

A customer is eligible to use this service if they:

-   have active self service registration
-   hold an active BasicsCard
-   have an available Income Management Account balance greater than
    $0.99
-   have a BasicsCard balance less than or equal to $2,999.00
-   do not have a payment nominee arrangement in place

Using the service

Eligible customers can use this service to make an immediate transfer
from their available income managed funds onto their BasicsCard.

If the customer wants to set up a regular transfer to their BasicsCard
from income managed funds they will need to contact Services Australia.

There is no limit to the transfer amount, but the customer:

-   can only access their available income managed funds, and
-   cannot increase their BasicsCard balance to more than the limit that
    has been manually set or the default maximum limit of $3,000

Transfers generally occur in real time meaning that customers can access
the funds via their BasicsCard immediately.

If the customer wishes to transfer funds from their BasicsCard, see
Transfer BasicsCard funds to Income Management account online.
