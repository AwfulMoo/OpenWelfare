Act) revoke the previous care percentage:

Interim care decisions are made under the following sections of the Act:

s51, the actual care differs from the care arrangement and the person
with reduced care is taking reasonable action to ensure the care
arrangement is complied with. S51 also applies to actual care in special
circumstances where a parent is withholding care due to a substantial
risk to the wellbeing of the child. Examples include:

-   withholding essential medical care from the child
-   substantially failing to comply with legal schooling requirements
-   neglecting the child's basic needs

s52, the actual care differs from the care arrangement and the person
with reduced care is taking reasonable action to seek a new care
arrangement which is more than actual care but less than the existing
care arrangement, and there are special circumstances. In this context,
special circumstances refer to situations where the parent could not
continue to have the previous level of care. Examples include:

-   serious medical problems relating to the child or parents
-   one parent has moved a substantial distance away from their previous
    home without making care arrangements with the other parent for the
    child

that if special circumstances apply, the interim period can be extended
from 14 weeks up to a maximum of 26 weeks. Special circumstances in this
context include situations out of the ordinary where the resolution of
care issues are delayed. For example, a parent may have travelled

Delegations and authorisations

APS 3 or above

An APS 3 or above is authorised to:

-   determine a care percentage where a parent has had, or is likely to
    have, no pattern of care for a child (0% care) (s49)
-   determine a care percentage where a parent has had or is likely to
    have a pattern of care for a child (more than 0% care) (s50)
-   revoke an existing care percentage determination where a new care

    percentage (s54F)
-   revoke an existing percentage care determination where a new care
    percentage determination under s49 or s50 does not affect the cost
    percentage but would affect the care percentage (s54H)

except where:

-   the care percentage is to be determined for a period where 1 parent
    unexpectedly gains 100% care of the child for a specific period
    (one-off block of 100% care)
-   determine a care percentage where the care percentage is worked out
    other than on the basis of the number of nights a child is in the
    care of a person during a care period (hours in care)

APS 4 or above

An APS 4 or above is authorised to:

-   make any of the decisions authorised at the APS 3 level
-   determine a care percentage for a period where a parent unexpectedly
    gains 100% care of the child for a specific period (one-off block of
    100% care)
-   make a decision that the care that is actually occurring for a child
    does not comply with an existing care arrangement that is in force
    for that child and the person who has reduced care of the child has
    taken reasonable action to ensure that the care arrangement is
    complied with (s51)

    determined under s50 to have at least regular care of a child and,

    or a pattern of care that is less than regular care (s54G)

Note: most revocation decisions where care falls below regular care will
actually be made under section s54F.

except where:

-   the care that is actually occurring for a child does not comply with
    an existing care arrangement that is in force for that child, and
    the parent who has reduced care of the child is seeking a new care
    arrangement that provides more care than the person is actually
    having but less than the care provided by the existing care
    arrangement, and special circumstances exist (s52)
-   determine a care percentage where the care percentage is worked out
    other than on the basis of the number of nights a child is in the
    care of a person during a care period (daytime care)

APS 5 or above

-   make any of the decisions authorised at the APS 3 and APS 4 levels
-   make a decision that the care that is actually occurring for a child
    does not comply with an existing care arrangement that is in force

    person is actually having but less than the care provided by the
    existing care arrangement and special circumstances exist (s52)
-   determine an interim care period where the care period is between 14
    and 26 weeks (i.e. special circumstances apply) (s54C(4))

    care of a person during a care period (hours in daytime care)

Note: sections 54F, 54G, and 54H apply only where a new determination of
a responsible person's care percentage has been made under sections 49
and 50. The decision maker must be authorised under sections 49 and 50
to make a new care determination even where the authorisation to revoke
the existing care determination is at a lower level.

An officer at a lower level may still carry out the preliminary steps in
making care decisions with the support of their team leader, as long as
an officer with the appropriate level of authority makes the final
decision.
