|                                   | George is a 59 year old job       |
|                                   | seeker who has been receiving     |
|                                   | JobSeeker Payment (JSP) for 5     |
|                                   | years.                            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | During this period, George has    |
|                                   | had 2 casual jobs that lasted     |
|                                   | about 3 weeks each. Both of these |
|                                   | positions were in the seasonal    |
|                                   | picking area and George was       |
|                                   | unable to continue due to a       |
|                                   | 'broken down body'. George has    |
|                                   | never seen a medical practitioner |
|                                   | about the physical problems as,   |
|                                   | in George's opinion, it is just   |
|                                   | due to ageing and there is        |
|                                   | nothing a medical practitioner    |
|                                   | could do.                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | George's previous work history    |
|                                   | has been as a labourer. George    |
|                                   | started at 13 and worked for 40   |
|                                   | years on farms and in the         |
|                                   | building construction industry.   |
|                                   | George has no specific work       |
|                                   | qualifications and limited        |
|                                   | education although literacy       |
|                                   | skills are listed as 'fine'.      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | George has never had an           |

|                                   | (ESAt) or Job Capacity Assessment |
|                                   | (JCA) whilst receiving payment.   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | George tells the Service Officer  |
|                                   | during a recent contact that they |
|                                   | cannot do what they used to do    |
|                                   | anymore. George has always worked |
|                                   | and now no one wants to offer     |
|                                   | employment. However, George       |
|                                   | thinks undertaking light work for |
|                                   | a few hours a day, would require  |
|                                   | a rest when body aches starts, or |
|                                   | else it is hard to move the next  |
|                                   | day.                              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The Service Officer runs the Job  |
|                                   | Seeker Snapshot. The outcomes of  |
|                                   | the Job Seeker Snapshot determine |
|                                   | that George requires an ESAt      |
|                                   | because:                          |

|                                   |     possibly serious health       |
|                                   |     issues that are likely to     |
|                                   |     affect the ability to work    |
|                                   |     and look for work             |

|                                   | The Service Officer discusses the |
|                                   | benefit of a medical review and   |
|                                   | provision of medical evidence to  |

|                                   | Jack's injury. As Jack's injury   |
|                                   | appears to be temporary, an ESAt  |

|                                   | If Jack lodges further medical    |
|                                   | certificates, the situation       |
|                                   | should be reviewed. If Jack has   |

|                                   | of this injury, an ESAt referral  |
|                                   | may be appropriate to assess the  |

|                                   | the Assessor will be unable to    |

|                                   | assessment, and unnecessarily     |
|                                   | uses an appointment session which |
|                                   | could be preventing the           |
|                                   | assessment of a job seeker who    |
|                                   | has already provided evidence.    |

|                                   | Answer: If an ESAt request is     |
|                                   | made without current and relevant |
|                                   | medical evidence for conditions   |
|                                   | that significantly affect the job |
|                                   | seeker's ability to work and if   |
|                                   | there is no indication to the     |
|                                   | Assessor that there are           |
|                                   | non-medical barriers requiring    |
|                                   | assessment, the Assessor may need |
|                                   | to finalise the referral as       |
|                                   | 'unable to complete' (UTC).       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the report is finalised as UTC |
|                                   | for any reason where the Job      |
|                                   | Seeker Snapshot status is         |
|                                   | pending, the JSR/UPD 'ESAREFRQ'   |
|                                   | activity will then be re-created  |
|                                   | to indicate further action to     |
|                                   | manage the Job Seeker Snapshot.   |
|                                   | Unless there are non-medical      |
|                                   | barriers requiring assessment and |
|                                   | likely to affect the job seeker's |
|                                   | current servicing, the ESAt flag  |
|                                   | should generally be withdrawn on  |
|                                   | the grounds that the job seeker   |
|                                   | is unable to provide medical      |
|                                   | evidence.                         |

|                                   | If the job seeker subsequently    |
|                                   | provides suitable evidence, the   |
|                                   | Job Seeker Snapshot can be re-run |
|                                   | and a new ESAt request can be     |
|                                   | made if required.                 |
