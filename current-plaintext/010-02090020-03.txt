|                                   | Compliance processes currently    |
|                                   | focus on cases where the customer |
|                                   | has a high number of unapproved   |
|                                   | absences in a term. Absence from  |
|                                   | school does not result in loss of |
|                                   | qualification for payment.        |
|                                   | However, a high level of          |
|                                   | unapproved absence is an          |
|                                   | indicator that the student may    |
|                                   | have ceased studies.              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If investigation of the case      |
|                                   | shows that the student has not    |
|                                   | ceased studies, they remain       |
|                                   | qualified for payment but may     |
|                                   | potentially be required to enter  |
|                                   | into an Activity Agreement.       |
