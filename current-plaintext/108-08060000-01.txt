This document outlines how the Pharmaceutical Allowance (PhA) is paid as
a supplement along with the fortnightly payment of some income support
payments. It cannot be paid on its own. PhA is paid to assist customers
financially with the purchase of prescription medicines through the
Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme (PBS).

Eligibility requirements for PhA

PhA is a non-taxable benefit. It is payable each fortnight to single
eligible customers or to each entitled member of a couple, based on
their individual eligibility.

PhA is payable when the customer is in receipt of a qualifying payment
and meet certain conditions related to that payment. PhA is not payable
if the customer is:

-   absent overseas permanently
-   paid the proportional rate under an International Agreement
-   overseas for longer than the maximum portability period
-   being paid Veterans Supplement at the PhA rate (VSP) or high rate
    (VSH) by the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA)

Qualifying customers who are eligible for Working Credit will not be
paid PhA during periods where the customer is in an employment income
nil rate period.

Advance payments of PhA

Advance payments of PhA are available to DSP (under 21 with no dependent
children) and PPS customers. The advance payment equals 7 times the
fortnightly rate or the number of paydays remaining in the entitlement
year if this is less than 7.

Each member of a couple is assessed independently. One or both members
of a couple may be entitled to the advance at the same time.

Indexation of PhA

Pharmaceutical Allowance (PhA) is indexed each January in line with the
Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures and is paid at a single or partnered
rate.

PhA replaced by Pension or Veteran Supplement for some customers

Changes were made from 20 September 2009 to replace PhA with Pension
Supplement:

-   The PhA has been replaced by the Pension Supplement for eligible
    customers
-   The Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) ceased paying PhA and
    Telephone Allowance (TAL) and commenced paying Veteran Supplement
    payments
