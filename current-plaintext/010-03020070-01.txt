SY042 form and parental income

The SY042 form is used to assess eligibility for Additional Boarding
Allowance where parental income in the current tax year:

-   has substantially reduced compared to the base tax year, or
-   has increased by more than 25% over the base tax year and is also
    more than 25% higher than the parental income free area

Current income assessment

A current income assessment applies from the later of 1 January in the
year of study or the date of the drop in income. This assessment may be
approved if parental income is reduced for at least 2 years because of
any of the following:

-   permanent invalidity or retirement
-   natural disasters such as drought, fires or other circumstances
    beyond the control of the parent or guardian
-   unemployment for an extended period or retrenchment
-   any other circumstances causing hardship

Seasonal variations where income normally fluctuates (for example, in
the case of primary producers) are not the basis of current income
assessment unless the reduction in income is likely to last for at least
2 years.

If the form is lodged at a service centre, it should be checked to
ensure it is complete and then forwarded to the relevant Smart Centre.

Income increased

If a reverse current income assessment is necessary, entitlement is
reassessed from 1 October of the year of study.
