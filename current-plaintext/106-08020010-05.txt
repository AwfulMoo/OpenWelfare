This page contains a link to the Services Australia Website and an
explanation of how to manually calculate whether the exchange rate
actually used to convert income received by a customer varies by 5% or
more from the rate used by Centrelink, during what period the UK
exchange rate can be used and whether the customer will be paid arrears.

|                                   | Note: do not use the manual       |
|                                   | method below unless the system    |
|                                   | method is not available. The      |
|                                   | Process page provides the steps   |
|                                   | to automatically assess the 5%    |
|                                   | variation and calculate the       |
|                                   | difference in payment.            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Multiply the Centrelink exchange  |
|                                   | rate by 5%. Add this amount to    |
|                                   | the exchange rate to get the      |
|                                   | upper range and then subtract it  |
|                                   | from the exchange rate to get a   |
|                                   | lower range. If the exchange rate |
|                                   | provided to the customer is       |
|                                   | outside this range, then a        |
|                                   | reassessment can occur.           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | For example, the exchange rate is |
|                                   | 45.23                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | 5% of 45.23 is 2.2615 (45.23 x    |
|                                   | 5/100)                            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | 45.23 - 2.2615 = 42.9685 (lower   |
|                                   | range) and 45.23 + 2.2615 =       |
|                                   | 47.4915 (upper range)             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Therefore the acceptable          |
|                                   | variation range is 42.9685 to     |
|                                   | 47.4915. If the actual exchange   |
|                                   | rate used by the customer is less |
|                                   | than 42.9685 or more than 47.4915 |
|                                   | then a reassessment can occur.    |
|                                   | Note: an exchange rate which is   |
|                                   | lower than Centrelink's rate      |
|                                   | (that is, customer advises        |
|                                   | 41.5600 in the example above)     |
|                                   | could cause the customer's rate   |
|                                   | to reduce.                        |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The Centrelink exchange rate for  |
|                                   | any month is used from the first  |
|                                   | business day of the month to the  |
|                                   | day before the first business day |
|                                   | of the next month. For example,   |
|                                   | the first business day of June    |
|                                   | 2014 was 2 June 2014. Note: in    |
|                                   | some cases the first business day |
|                                   | of the month is not the first day |
|                                   | of the month. For example, if the |
|                                   | month of December 2012 was used,  |
|                                   | the first business day of the     |
|                                   | month would have been Monday, 3rd |
|                                   | December 2012. In this case the   |
|                                   | November 2012 exchange rate would |
|                                   | have continued to be applied up   |
|                                   | to and including 2nd December     |
|                                   | 2012.                             |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | adjusted. For example, if the     |
|                                   | exchange rate for June 2012 was   |
|                                   | used and the customer received a  |
|                                   | payment at an exchange rate of    |
|                                   | more than 5% difference for 4     |
|                                   | June 2012 to 28 June 2012 then    |
|                                   | this is the period which can be   |

|                                   | There are specific rules in       |

|                                   | As a basic rule of thumb in the   |
|                                   | case of exchange rates is, if the |
|                                   | customer applies for a formal     |
|                                   | review of decision within 13      |
|                                   | weeks of being notified by        |
