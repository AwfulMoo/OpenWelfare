Determining approval of courses for ABSTUDY

This table describes the action required to determine approval courses
for ABSTUDY.

A decision about whether a course is approved for ABSTUDY is normally
made by a Service Support Officer (Course Assessment and Liaison) in
conjunction with advice, where relevant, from the national Student
Programme Team.
