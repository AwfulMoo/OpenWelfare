This document outlines how to determine whether a student or Australian
Apprentice meets the definition of Australian Aboriginal or Torres
Strait Islander status for ABSTUDY.

Definition of Aboriginality or Torres Strait Islander status

An Australian Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person for ABSTUDY
purposes is one who:

-   is of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent
-   identifies as an Australian Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander
    person, and
-   is accepted as such by the community in which they live or did live

Aboriginality or Torres Strait Islander status on application

A student or Australian Apprentice's declaration during the ABSTUDY
claiming process is normally accepted as sufficient evidence of their
Aboriginality or Torres Strait Islander status.

Aboriginality or Torres Strait Islander status queries

Where uncertainty exists as to the Aboriginality or Torres Strait
Islander status of a student or Australian Apprentice, an ABSTUDY Smart
Centre Team Leader (APS6) may initiate an Aboriginality or Torres Strait
Islander status enquiry. For further information, see the Process page.
