This document outlines information about the Health Identifiers Provider
Directory Service (HI HPD).

Overview of HI HPD

The HI HPD is a Healthcare provider and provider organisation ‘read
only’ listing of provider information used for facilitating healthcare.
Listings are voluntary and include:

-   healthcare providers
-   provider organisations
-   provider/organisation relationships

The HI HPD is not available for public view. Entries in the HI HPD for a
provider are published with the consent of the Healthcare provider.
Entries in the HI HPD for a seed or network organisation are published
with the consent of the responsible Organisation Maintenance Officer
(OMO).

All Healthcare provider and provider organisation records that appear in
the HI HPD have an 'active' status. Healthcare providers can maintain
their own Healthcare Provider identifier - Individual (HPI-I) entries,
and OMOs can maintain the organisation Healthcare Provider identifier -
Organisation (HPI-O) entries. This is done online either using Health
professional online services (HPOS) or via Services Australia’s service
channels.

Note:

-   Updates to records are made to associated records through the HI
    Service which, with consent to publish, updates the record in the HI
    HPD
-   Deactivation and retirement of Healthcare provider and provider
    organisation records remove entries in the HI HPD
-   If a record previously existed in the HI HPD and the Healthcare
    provider or provider organisation record was retired in error and
    then subsequently reinstated, the entry is automatically restored as
    previous consent to publish had been given
-   Providers who have consented to appear in the HPD and are registered
    with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra)
    can only update details that are not part of the core data received
    from Ahpra. Any updates from Ahpra automatically update the same
    details in the HPD
