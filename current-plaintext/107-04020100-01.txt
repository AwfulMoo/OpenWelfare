This document outlines the process to investigate and determine whether
to raise a debt for Carer Payment.

Carer Payment (CP)

CP is an income support payment for those who provide full-time care.
Carers and Care Receivers must meet eligibility criteria, which includes
income and asset tests for both parties.

A CP customer can also:

-   be a nominee for the care receiver
-   have enduring power of attorney for the care receiver, and/or
-   conduct business with Services Australia on behalf of the care
    receiver

Overpayment of CP

An overpayment occurs where a care receivers estimated income is
assessed for a period of time, and evidence shows:

-   the income was underestimated, and
-   the actual taxable income of the care receiver is over the income
    limit

Raise these overpayments as a debt under subsection 1223 (1C) of the
Social Security Act 1991.

CP overpayments are not a debt unless there is definite indication the
Carer is involved in the care receiver's financial details. If the
customer can show it was not open for them to know about the
circumstances leading to the excess payment, there is no debt.
