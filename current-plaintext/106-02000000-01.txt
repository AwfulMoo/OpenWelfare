This document outlines content relevant to service and timeliness
standards for Centrelink payments and services (CLK).

Government intent

Services Australia has developed a number of standards in regard to
timeliness, service and completion of claims and forms. This will ensure
the agency provides support and assistance to customers, while providing
the agency with the ability to measure and improve customer service.

Timeliness standards (CLK)

The Department of Social Services (DSS) Partnership Agreement contains
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and these contain some standards that
Centrelink is to perform to.

In order to meet customer expectations and the KPIs under the Balanced
Scorecard, Services Australia has timeliness standards set for the
payments and services it offers.
