This document outlines details about bulk funding for approved
residential school activities in a semester for an education
institution.

Qualifications

Education institutions delivering a large number of approved residential
school activities may get bulk funding if they have the framework to
complete the administrative arrangements:

-   lodge their submission within at least 6 weeks before the start of
    the first residential school for the year, and
-   the submission has all the proposed residential schools for the
    year, a semester or a term where enough information is provided

Details of participating students

The education institution must advise the names of all students
participating in each residential school, when known. This allows for
checking of ABSTUDY eligibility and travel authorised in advance where
necessary.

After funding approval

The education institution must:

-   notify in writing of changes to any activity on the original
    submission, and
-   lodge an acquittal report at the end of year or by the end of the
    semester where approval was given for a period of less than one year

Education institutions, who do not lodge an acquittal report by 31
January in the following year, cannot have future submissions assessed.

An education institution may make a claim for annual administration and
audit costs incurred in administering bulk funding to Services
Australia's requirements.
