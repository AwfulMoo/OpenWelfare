+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Payment received - payee 1        |
|                                   | arrears only, payee 2 ongoing     |
|                                   | only                              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Amy makes a payment of $600 for   |
|                                   | child support payable to Billy    |
|                                   | and Clara. Billy has no current   |
|                                   | entitlement but is owed arrears   |
|                                   | of $1,000. Clara is owed no       |
|                                   | arrears but has a current         |
|                                   | entitlement of $500.              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Amy owes a total amount of        |
|                                   | $1,500.                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The $1,000 owed to Billy is 66.6% |
|                                   | of the total $1,500 owed by Amy.  |
|                                   | Billy will therefore receive      |
|                                   | 66.6% of any payment made by Amy. |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The $500 owed to Clara is 33.3%   |
|                                   | of the total $1,500 owed by Amy.  |
|                                   | Clara will therefore receive      |
|                                   | 33.3% of any payment made by Amy. |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Accordingly, the $600 payment     |
|                                   | will be apportioned, 66.6% to     |
|                                   | Billy being $400 and 33.3% to     |
|                                   | Clara being $200.                 |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 2                                 | Payment received - 2 payees equal |
|                                   | ongoing, payee 1 arrears          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Billy and Clara both have a       |
|                                   | current monthly entitlement of    |
|                                   | $500 each. Billy is also owed     |
|                                   | arrears of $1,000 but Clara is    |
|                                   | owed no arrears. Amy makes a      |
|                                   | payment of $600 for child support |
|                                   | payable to Billy and Clara.       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Amy owes a total amount of        |
|                                   | $2,000. $1,500 of this, or 75%,   |
|                                   | is owed to Billy. Therefore 75%   |
|                                   | of any payment made by Amy is     |
|                                   | payable to Billy.                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | $500 of the $2,000 (25%) is owed  |
|                                   | to Clara. Therefore 25% of any    |
|                                   | payment made by Amy is payable to |
|                                   | Clara.                            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The $600 payment will be          |
|                                   | apportioned, $450 to Billy and    |
|                                   | $150 to Clara.                    |
