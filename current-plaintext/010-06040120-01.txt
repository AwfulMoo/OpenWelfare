This document outlines information on assessing the away from home rate
of Youth Allowance (YA) where the customer cannot live in the parental
home as there is a compulsory requirement to reside at the educational
institution while studying. This criterion only applies to dependent YA
customers undertaking tertiary study.

Compulsory residence

Some courses have a compulsory requirement for the student to reside on
campus. In these cases, the student cannot actually undertake the course
without leaving home. As the student must live away from home the away
from home rate of YA may be payable.
