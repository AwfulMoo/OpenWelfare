Information and example - Special circumstances exemptions

Table 1: This table contains information and an example of special
circumstance exemptions and when they may be granted. A special
circumstance exemption may be granted if there are unusual and
unexpected circumstances. These generally relate to the customer's
circumstances rather than the child's. Requests must be considered on a
case by case basis.

|                                   | hearing and vision. This basic    |
|                                   | health check promotes early       |

|                                   | which may make it more difficult  |
|                                   | for children to learn when they   |

| 2                                 | Question: Why am I being asked to |
|                                   | do this, when my friend has a     |
|                                   | child the same age and isn't      |
|                                   | being asked to do this?           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: The aim of a preschool    |
|                                   | health check is to improve the    |
|                                   | health and well-being of          |
|                                   | Australian children. Health       |
|                                   | checks are available for all      |
|                                   | children and may detect problems  |
|                                   | affecting hearing and vision that |
|                                   | make it more difficult to learn.  |
|                                   | To ensure their children are      |
|                                   | healthy, fit and ready to learn   |
|                                   | when they start school, some      |
|                                   | families are being asked to have  |
|                                   | their child undertake a health    |
|                                   | check and notify the agency.      |

| 3                                 | Question: How much is this going  |
|                                   | to cost me?                       |

|                                   | Answer: The health check can be   |
|                                   | done by a recognised health       |
|                                   | professional such as a doctor,    |
|                                   | practise nurse or Aboriginal      |
|                                   | health worker and the customer    |
|                                   | should discuss any cost or        |
|                                   | potential Medicare refund with    |
|                                   | them.                             |

| 4                                 | Question: What happens if my      |
|                                   | child didn't pass the Health      |
|                                   | Check - do I still get my         |
|                                   | supplement?                       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: The requirement is for    |
|                                   | the customer's child to have a    |
|                                   | health check completed. The       |
|                                   | health check will be recorded as  |
|                                   | being completed, not the outcome  |
|                                   | of the health check. If the       |
|                                   | health professional identifies    |
|                                   | any issue that requires action or |
|                                   | follow-up, they will discuss this |
|                                   | with the customer.                |

| 5                                 | Question: I have not been able to |
|                                   | arrange a health check            |
|                                   | appointment before 30 June 2018   |
|                                   | for my child who turned 4 years   |
|                                   | of age in 2017-18 as there are    |
|                                   | limited services and appointments |
|                                   | in my area. Can I get an          |
|                                   | exemption from having to get the  |
|                                   | health check completed?           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: These circumstances do    |
|                                   | not qualify for an exemption. If  |
|                                   | the customer is unable to         |
|                                   | organise an appointment on or     |
|                                   | before 30 June 2018, they have    |

|                                   | which the child turned 4 years of |
|                                   | age. Re-reconciliation will occur |
|                                   | to pay any FTB Part A supplement  |
|                                   | (if entitled) for the child for   |
|                                   | any day/s where they or their     |
|                                   | partner were receiving an income  |

|                                   | age on or after 1 July 2018, the  |
|                                   | HSFS requirement is linked to the |
|                                   | customer’s rate of FTB Part A for |
|                                   | that child. The health check and  |
|                                   | notification must be met by the   |
