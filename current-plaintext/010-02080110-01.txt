This document outlines the period that a student, doing a full year
course, may be eligible for ABSTUDY, ABSTUDY Pensioner Education
Supplement (PES) or PES entitlement.

Period of eligibility

The significance of doing a full year course relates to the period of
eligibility for ABSTUDY, ABSTUDY PES and PES. A student doing a short
course (other than an articulated short course or a late starting course
normally can only be paid from the course start date. A student doing a
full year course, however, may be payable before the course starts.

ABSTUDY PES or PES students may be paid until 31 December if:

-   they complete their course after 15 September, and
-   the course is a full year or late starting course

A 'full year course' goes for more than 30 weeks (including vacations)
and starts between either 1 January and 31 March (inclusive) or 1 July
and 31 July (inclusive).

A course of 30 weeks or less is a short course, while a course lasting
more than 30 weeks that starts outside the dates above is a late
starting course. Customers completing a short course will only be paid
for the duration of the course.

Note: this procedure is not applicable for Australian Apprentice
customers.
