This document outlines the process of re-reconciliation which is an
automatic process that occurs when income or other family circumstances
are updated for the relevant financial year after Family Tax Benefit
(FTB) reconciliation has occurred.

FTB re-reconciliation

Re-reconciliation compares the customer's entitlement based on the new
information with the result of the previous reconciliation. It may
result in a top-up, overpayment or nil adjustment. A previous FTB
reconciliation top-up or overpayment will be included in the
calculation.

FTB Part A and Part B supplements and the Single Income Family
Supplement (SIFS) are included in the reconciliation calculation for
eligible customers once adequate income details are available for the
customer and their current partner.

For customers to receive their full annual FTB entitlement, income
lodgement requirements, must be met within the allowable period.

For the 2012-13 financial year onwards, special circumstances extensions
for families unable to meet lodgement and other specific requirements
for Family Tax Benefit (FTB) and Single Income Family Supplement (SIFS).

Debt offsetting can automatically apply during re-reconciliation if the
customer has an outstanding debt. Since 1 July 2009, this also includes
FTB qualification and non-lodger debts. From 10 June 2019, FTB top-ups,
supplements, lump sum claim amounts and instalment arrears can be used
to recover any family assistance, social security, student assistance
and Paid Parental Leave scheme payment debts. This will occur even if
the customer has a current payment arrangement. Previously, FTB amounts
could only be used to recover FTB, Child Care Benefit (CCB) and Child
Care Rebate (CCR) debts.

FTB re-reconciliation triggers

The following changes will trigger re-reconciliation of FTB:

-   A customer's and/or their partner's actual adjusted taxable income
    details are transferred by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). For
    example, the ATO transfers actual income details for a person whose
    estimated income was used to reconcile FTB, or the ATO advises
    amended actual income details for a customer or their partner
-   A customer or their partner lodges a tax return having previously
    advised they were not required to lodge a tax return, or having been
    treated as exempt from lodging
-   The customer revises their estimate by the end of the lodgement year
    (extended lodgement year for 2011-2012 and earlier years) or within
    52 weeks from date of notice of the reconciliation decision
-   The customer advises that their FTB deferred child's income was
    below / not below the child income limit for the relevant financial
    year and this is different to the information used in the previous
    reconciliation. Note: child income limit ceased to apply from 1 May
    2014
-   The customer advises a return to work after caring for a child
    during the relevant financial year. The FTB Part B quarantine
    provides extra assistance where one parent starts or returns to work
    after a period out of the workforce to care for a child
-   The ATO cancels a tax assessment before or after the Notice of
    Assessment is issued. Note: where a tax assessment cancellation is
    received from the ATO, the previous decision is maintained until new
    income details are received
-   There is a retrospective circumstance change (for example customer's
    income support payment is retrospectively cancelled or a partner is
    linked for a retrospective period)
-   There is a retrospective change (increase or decrease) to a child
    support assessment for a private collect customer
-   There is a retrospective change (increase or decrease) to a child
    support assessment for a child support collect customer and the
    Maintenance Income Credit (MIC) offset amount changes
-   There is retrospective change to a child's immunisation status or
    health check status which results in a reassessment of the FTB Part
    A rate reduction

Although customers have not been able to claim FTB via the ATO since 1
July 2009, reassessment of an ATO lump sum FTB claim may occur if
details used to calculate the customer's FTB lump sum claim entitlement
are updated.

Shared care percentage system issues

There are 2 system issues that may impact a customer's shared care
percentage:

-   P24845 - shared care is not being correctly applied when a child is
    in the care of a parent who has transferred their Family Tax Benefit
    (FTB) to their current partner (step parent). For more information
    see the Resources page of Assessment of shared care arrangements for
    Family Tax Benefit (FTB)
-   PM69793/PM72350 - resulted in shared care percentages being
    incorrectly applied for some FTB customers, causing incorrect
    re-reconciliation debts and arrears. For more information see the
    Resources page in Explaining Family Tax Benefit (FTB) reconciliation
    overpayments due to shared care
