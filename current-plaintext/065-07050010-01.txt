This document outlines information regarding cancellation and rejection
codes for the PBS.

Use of codes in Centrelink system

The Centrelink system uses codes when a decision to cancel or suspend a
payment, or to reject a claim, is recorded on the computer system. A
description of the code is used in correspondence with customers.

PBS registrations

Customers can be registered members of the Pension Bonus Scheme (PBS)
even if they will not be entitled to receive a Pension Bonus. At the
time of registration this must have been pointed out to the customer.
The registration will automatically cancel when a customer is paid the
Pension Bonus Payment (PBP). The Pension Bonus Scheme is closed to new
registrations from 1 July 2014. Applications to register in the PBS that
were lodged, or deemed to be lodged, before 1 July 2014 can be processed
as usual.

Cancelling or withdrawing PBS registration

Registration for the PBS cannot be suspended. Registration can remain
indefinitely on a customer’s record. Customers can request in writing
for their registration to be cancelled.

There are separate rejection codes for registration and for payment of
the pension bonus. Note: sometimes, customers may withdraw their claims
voluntarily. Withdrawn claims are not rejected, rather, withdrawn claims
are deemed to have never been made.

Review of decision

If the customer disagrees with the decision, normal review and appeal
processes apply.
