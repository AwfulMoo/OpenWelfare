|                                   | When the SME makes a decision, it |
|                                   | will be unfavourable or           |
|                                   | favourable. An unfavourable       |
|                                   | decision is an adverse decision.  |
|                                   | A favourable decision advantages  |
|                                   | the customer, but may still be    |
|                                   | adverse. For example, a debt is   |
|                                   | recalculated and the debt amount  |
|                                   | is reduced but the remainder must |
|                                   | be repaid. A decision that        |
|                                   | advantages the customer and has   |
|                                   | no adverse effect is a fully      |
|                                   | favourable decision.              |
