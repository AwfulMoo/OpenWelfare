This document explains information about Health compliance and education
activities for health professionals.

Government intent

Compliance activities focus on early intervention and prevention to help
health professionals:

-   get correct entitlements, and
-   to meet their obligations and responsibilities

Services Australia applies a balance of education and compliance
strategies to meet legislative requirements.

Prosecution is considered where fraud is identified.

Compliance activities

Targeted compliance activities undertaken by the Department of Health
vary depending on the type of non-compliance identified, including:

-   professional review if inappropriate practice is identified
-   letter campaigns where inadvertent non-compliance is identified
-   investigations are undertaken for suspected fraudulent activity and
    prosecution is considered where fraud is identified
-   audits where sustained or opportunistic non-compliance is identified

See the Resources page for a list of current compliance activities and a
link to the letter examples.
