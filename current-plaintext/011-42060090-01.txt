Intensive care management

Intensive care is extensive and continuous care and treatment provided
for an acutely ill patient, usually in a specially designated section
(intensive care unit) of a hospital.

Intensive care management items are divided into 2 categories.

-   Group T1 - Subgroup 9, procedures associated with intensive care and
    cardiopulmonary support, and
-   Group T1 -Subgroup 10, management and procedures undertaken in an
    intensive care unit

Management and procedures in intensive care

Medicare benefits are only payable for management and procedures in
intensive care covered by items 13870, 13873, 13876, 13882, 13885 and
13888 where the service is provided by a specialist or consultant
physician who is immediately available and exclusively rostered for
intensive care.

Intensive care units

A general intensive care unit means a separate hospital area that meets
all of the following:

is equipped and staffed so as to be capable of providing to a patient:

-   mechanical ventilation for a period of several days
-   invasive cardiovascular monitoring

is supported by all of the following:

-   at least one specialist or consultant physician in the specialty of
    intensive care who is immediately available and exclusively rostered
    to the ICU during normal working hours
-   a registered medical practitioner who is present in the hospital and
    immediately available to the unit at all times
-   a registered nurse for at least 18 hours in each day

has defined admission and discharge policies

A neonatal intensive care unit means a separate hospital area that meets
all of the following:

is equipped and staffed so as to be capable of providing to a patient,
being a newborn child all of the following:

-   mechanical ventilation for a period of several days
-   invasive cardiovascular monitoring

is supported by all of the following:

-   at least one consultant physician in the specialty of paediatric
    medicine, appointed to manage the unit, and who is immediately
    available and exclusively rostered to the ICU during normal working
    hours
-   a registered medical practitioner who is present in the hospital and
    immediately available to the unit at all times
-   a registered nurse for at least 18 hours in each day

has defined admission and discharge policies

Note: 'Immediately available' means that the intensivist must be
predominantly present in the ICU during normal working hours. Reasonable
absences from the ICU would be acceptable to attend conferences,
meetings and other commitments which might involve absences of up to 2
hours during the working day.

'Exclusively rostered' means that the specialist’s sole clinical
commitment is to intensive care associated activities and is not
involved in any other duties that may preclude immediate availability to
intensive care if required.

Admission criteria for intensive care units

Given that an intensive care unit must have defined admission and
discharge policies, the following guidelines should be followed in
relation to admission criteria for intensive care benefits:

Benefits are payable for admissions to an intensive care unit following
surgery only where clear clinical justification for post-operative
intensive care exists.

Benefits are payable for the admission of babies who meet at least one
of the following criteria:

-   all babies weighing less than 1000 grams
-   all babies with an endotracheal tube, and for the 24 hours following
    endotracheal tube removal
-   all babies requiring Constant Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) for
    acute respiratory instability
-   all babies requiring more than 40% oxygen for more than 4 hours
-   all babies requiring an arterial line for blood gas and pressure
    monitoring
-   all babies having frequent seizures

Benefits are not payable for intensive care services under items
13870-13888 for babies who are ready for discharge from the neonatal
intensive care unit, but are physically retained within the unit for
other reasons.

Benefits are not payable for intensive care services under items
13870-13888 for babies not meeting the above admission criteria who, for
whatever other reasons, are physically located within the neonatal
intensive care unit.

Note: the reference to a day relates to a calendar day not a 24 hour
period. A management fee should not be raised for periods when patients
are in an ICU for short periods of time, that is, less than two hours.

Transfers between intensive care units

Given that most services within the Schedule for ICU services are
structured to be itemised on a calendar day basis, where it is necessary
to transfer a patient from one ICU to another, the billing of the
patient is a matter for arrangement between the ICUs involved.

Services rendered by other practitioners

For services rendered by other practitioners, the following rules apply:

-   benefits are payable for an attendance by another
    specialist/consultant physician who is not managing the patient but
    who has been asked to attend the patient
-   where appropriate, accounts should be endorsed to the effect that
    the consultation was not part of the patient's intensive care
    management in order to identify which consultations should attract
    benefits in addition to the intensive care items
