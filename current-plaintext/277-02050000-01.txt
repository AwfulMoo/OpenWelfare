This document outlines the procedures to be followed when calculating
and processing inflation adjustments to child support payments because
of a clause in a court order, agreement or change of assessment
decision.

Inflation factors

A court order, agreement or change of assessment decision may include a
clause requesting that the periodic amount be reviewed regularly to
cover changes in the cost of living. These are called inflation factors.

This procedure will help to ensure that:

-   entitlements are varied in line with the specified inflation clauses
-   payments are correctly calculated
-   both parents are informed of the variation to their payments
