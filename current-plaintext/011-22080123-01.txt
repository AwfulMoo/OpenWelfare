This document outlines information for Service Officers when receiving
calls from customers about correspondence received about health research
and how to request to add a customer to the opt-out list.

Health research mailouts (assisted mailouts)

Services Australia receives a variety of requests for health research
related mailouts (assisted mailouts). For example, to help with
recruitment for health studies.

These requests come from:

-   universities
-   hospitals, and
-   health research organisations

The Health Research Coordination Team supports health researchers by:

providing them with access to health related data

sending letters to agency customers about health research and advice

-   these letters are personalised with customer address details and
    include a Services Australia cover letter that assures the recipient
    that their personal details have not been released to an external
    party

sending mail packs to selected cohorts of agency customers:

-   asking if they’d like to participate in various health studies
-   providing important health advice

Customers:

-   health data is not released without their consent
-   can opt-out of receiving correspondence about health research

Services Australia and the Department of Health and Aged Care must make
sure legislation and regulations allow the access, use and disclosure of
data, see Approval process and Legislation for more details.

The agency:

-   ensures the data the Health Research Coordination Team use and
    release helps to improve Australian health and welfare outcomes
-   is considered to be an integral part of health research in Australia
    due to the wealth of health data that is held by the Medicare
    program

Health advice mailouts

Health advice mailouts conducted on behalf of government
departments/agencies:

are targeted at specific cohorts, and

the correspondence is usually about pandemic or disaster advice

-   for example, a COVID vaccination letter was posted to consumers aged
    between 70-95 year olds, who had not yet been vaccinated

Approval process

A mandatory review process is required for all health research mailouts
and consent study requests. These requests are considered by the
External Requests Evaluation Committee (EREC).

The EREC:

are responsible for assessing requests to use the agency’s health data
for research, health service planning or other purposes

is governed by the below representatives:

-   Senior Medical Advisor
-   Legal and Privacy Advisors
-   Representatives from Services Australia and Department of Health
    relevant business areas i.e. Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS),
    Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS), Repatriation Benefits Scheme
    (RPBS) and Australian Immunisation Register (AIR)

These requests must have approval from a Human Research Ethics Committee
registered with the National Health and Medical Research Council to be
considered by the EREC.

Services Australia cover letter

All mailouts include a Services Australia cover letter (see Resources
for a link to an example) to assure recipients:

-   that the agency is not associated with the campaign or study, and
-   their personal information has not been released to external
    entities

The agency is obligated to ensure that all requests are released under
the relevant legislation.

Opt-out – customer has asked to be removed from future research mailouts

Customers can ask to be removed from future research mailouts.

The Health Research Coordination Team maintains a list of Medicare card
numbers of customer who have asked to be removed from mailing lists to
do with research mailouts.

This list ensures that these individuals and anyone else on their
Medicare card will not receive any further letters asking to participate
in health research.

If a customer wishes to be added to this opt-out list, see the Process
page for how to request to add customer to the opt-out list.

Legislation

Services Australia cannot legally use customer data for a purpose other
than what it was collected for unless there is legislative exception.

Subsection 95(4) of the Privacy Act 1988 allows the agency to use
personal information of customers without consent to conduct a mailout
for medical research purposes.

This is subject to the research being:

-   conducted in accordance with guidelines issued by the Chief
    Executive Officer of the National Health and Medical Research
    Council under subsection 95(1) of the Privacy Act 1988, and
-   approved from a Human Research Ethics Committee

See References page for the relevant legislation that is considered when
approving these requests.

Health research consented release requests

The agency helps health researchers by coordinating the consented
release of health data by:

-   reviewing their proposed documentation
-   submitting documentation to the internal approval committee
-   validating signed consent forms and provision of the requested data
