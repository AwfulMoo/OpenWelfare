This document outlines assessment and processing for a claim for Double
Orphan Pension (DOP) made by an Approved Care Organisation (ACO) for a
DOP child in their care.

Approved Care Organisation (ACO) qualification

An ACO qualifies for DOP if the organisation is:

-   Caring for a DOP child, and
-   Eligible for Family Tax Benefit (FTB) for the DOP child (or would be
    eligible for FTB except that the DOP child, or someone on their
    behalf, is receiving payments under a prescribed education scheme).
    This means that FTB child eligibility criteria must be met,
    including age related requirements. Children aged 16 or over must
    meet study/training requirements.

ACOs claiming DOP

An ACO can claim DOP by completing the Claim for Double Orphan Pension
(SC003). Service Officers should advise the ACO to leave blank any
questions which do not apply to an organisation, i.e. gender, DOB,
relationship status and residency.

Claims received at Centrelink Service Centres are registered and
immediately forwarded to the DOP and Bereavement Smart Centre Processing
Team. All DOP claims are processed by DOP and Bereavement Smart Centre
Processing staff.

Customers can call the DOP Helpdesk (freecall).
