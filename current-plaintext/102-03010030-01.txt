This document outlines information about what happens when a customer in
receipt of an asset and income tested payment temporarily vacates their
principal home. It also has information to help determine the home
ownership status of a Family Tax Benefit (FTB) customer during a
temporary vacation of their principal home.

Temporary vacation of principal home

When a customer temporarily vacates their principal home, the home
continues to be considered their principal home for an initial 12
months. Therefore the:

-   customer is a homeowner
-   home is exempt from the asset test, and
-   customer is assessed under the homeowner allowable asset limit

This exemption applies even if the customer indicates their absence may
be longer than the 12 month period.

Sale of principal home

If a customer sells their principal home, the portion of the proceeds
which the customer intends to use to purchase, build, rebuild, repair or
renovate a new principal home are an exempt asset for up to:

-   12 months from the date of sale for sale before 1 January 2023, with
    an extension of up to 24 months total in some circumstances
-   24 months from the date of sale for sales from 1 January 2023
    onwards, with an extension of up to 36 months total in some
    circumstances

Extended exemptions

Home is lost or damaged

When the customer's principal home is lost or damaged the temporary
absence can be extended up to a further 12 months if certain criteria
are met.

To gain an extended exemption beyond 12 months and up to 24 months, the
customer must have a continuing intention to purchase, build, rebuild,
repair or renovate their principal home and have:

-   made reasonable attempts to obtain a new principal home. This could
    be to purchase, build, rebuild, repair or renovate their principal
    home, and
-   been making these attempts within 6 months of the loss, damage or
    sale of the principal home, and
-   experienced delays beyond their control in obtaining a new principal
    home

If one of the above criteria is not met, the customer cannot gain an
extended exemption past 12 months up to 24 months.

If the customer moves into another property that they own, this property
will still be assessed as an asset while their principal home is exempt
from the asset test.

Unable to return from overseas travel

When a customer has vacated their home temporarily to travel overseas
and is unable to return due to reasons beyond their control, for example
due to Coronavirus (COVID-19), they may be eligible for an extended
exemption. The period of the exemption will depend on the customer’s
individual circumstances.

Vacation of home extended for a new reason

A customer can have 2 consecutive exemptions from the assets test if
their circumstances warrant. For example, a customer may have
temporarily vacated their principal home with the intention of
travelling for 12 months however, only 6 months into this exemption they
stopped travelling and moved into their parent's home to provide care
for one or both of them. The 2 year exemption starts from when the
customer starts to provide care.

A new 2 year exemption period does not apply if the customer moves from
one care situation to another care situation.

However, a person cannot ‘stack’ a 12 month absence for any reason on to
one of the other statutory periods for the same purpose. For example, a
2 year absence when they enter aged care followed by another year for
the same reason

Moved to a care situation or due to ill health

When the customer leaves their home to enter a care situation due to an
illness or to provide care, the home continues to be considered their
principal home, however:

-   the intention to return home is irrelevant
-   they may be eligible for a two year exemption

See Vacation of home due to illness and Vacation of principal home to
provide care.

Customers in receipt of FTB and/or CCS

Customers only receiving Family Tax Benefit (FTB) and/or Child Care
Subsidy (CCS) are not asset tested, therefore this procedure only
applies in determining their home ownership status.

Vacation of home review

When a customer temporarily vacates their principal home, which they
own, a vacation of home review is set before the end date of the
exemption period. For a temporary vacation of home, once the exemption
period has expired, if the customer has not returned to their principal
home:

-   they are assessed as a non-homeowner, and
-   the principal home is an assessable asset

Non-homeowners who temporarily vacate their principal home are not
subject to a vacation of home review.

Escalations for vacation of home review processing

An escalation for a vacation of home review may be needed for:

-   customer request for more time to provide requested information
-   customer seeking an extended exemption
-   restoration from suspension due to non-compliance with a home
    vacation review (including if the customer passed away)

Note: if the customer has passed away when the payment is suspended, HVR
processing are to restore payment from the date payment was suspended
and finalise the review activity. Service Officer(s) in service centre
or Smart Centres can then proceed with DEA action.
