|                                   | customer's rate increasing or     |
|                                   | remaining the same). These        |
|                                   | favourable determination rules    |
|                                   | all result in the Date of Effect  |
|                                   | (DOE) being the later of the Date |
|                                   | of Receipt (DOR) or the Date of   |
|                                   | Event (DOV), where the rate is    |
|                                   | increasing. It is almost always   |
|                                   | DOR, but if we have been notified |
|                                   | in advance, and the system is     |
|                                   | letting the date be processed     |
|                                   | rather than setting up a review,  |
|                                   | then it will be DOV.              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Where the rate remains the same,  |
|                                   | the Date of Effect (DOE) will     |
|                                   | equal the Date of Event (DOV).    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | When Rule 1 applies, the          |
|                                   | situation is usually that a       |
|                                   | change is notified and we then    |
|                                   | defer the effect of that change   |
|                                   | to the day we are notified. For   |
|                                   | example, the customer phones on   |
|                                   | 10 September to tell us about an  |
|                                   | increase in income from 1         |
|                                   | September. The change in rent is  |
|                                   | recorded on the relevant screen   |
|                                   | with a DOV of 1 September. The    |
|                                   | activity has a DOR of 10          |
|                                   | September. The date of effect     |
|                                   | rules say that the change in rate |
|                                   | is effective from 10 September.   |
|                                   | You will see Rule 1 applied on 1  |
|                                   | September and then, on 10         |
|                                   | September (the Date Of Effect for |
|                                   | the change), you will see Rule 11 |
|                                   | applied.                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | It is important to note that      |
|                                   | where the change in circumstance  |
|                                   | relates to employment income,     |
|                                   | rules 15 to 18 will display. This |
|                                   | is due to the fact a different    |
|                                   | Date of Effect is applied in      |
|                                   | order to apportion the employment |
|                                   | income over an entitlement        |
|                                   | period.                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | So when NOHL decides not to apply |
|                                   | a change in rate at the DOV but   |
|                                   | at a later date, you'll see the   |
|                                   | relevant rule at the DOV and a    |
|                                   | corresponding Rule 11 applied at  |
|                                   | the actual DOE.                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | For Parenting Payment Partnered,  |
|                                   | there is an exception built into  |
|                                   | the system. This exception        |
|                                   | applies where the PPP customer is |
|                                   | partnered to an NSS stimulus      |
|                                   | customer and the change of        |
|                                   | circumstances is, or includes, a  |
|                                   | change in income. The exception   |
|                                   | says that the date of effect of   |
|                                   | the change is the date of event   |
|                                   | of the change. For these cases,   |
|                                   | we have not deferred the date of  |
|                                   | effect so you'll only see Rule 1  |
|                                   | applied at the DOV. You will not  |
|                                   | see Rule 11 applied.              |

|                                   | Receipt.                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | When Rule 2 applies, the          |
|                                   | situation is usually that a       |
|                                   | change is notified and we then    |
|                                   | defer the effect of that change   |
|                                   | to the day we are notified. For   |
|                                   | example, the customer phones on   |
|                                   | 10 September to tell us about a   |
|                                   | decrease in investment income     |
|                                   | from 20 August. The change in     |
|                                   | income is recorded on the         |
|                                   | relevant screen with a DOV of 20  |
|                                   | August. The activity has a DOR of |
|                                   | 10 September. The date of effect  |
|                                   | rules say that the change in rate |
|                                   | is effective from 10 September.   |
|                                   | You will see Rule 2 applied on 20 |
|                                   | August and then, on 10 September  |
|                                   | (the Date of Effect for the       |
|                                   | change), you will see Rule 11     |
|                                   | applied.                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | It is important to note that      |
|                                   | where the change in circumstance  |
|                                   | relates to employment income,     |
|                                   | rules 15-18 will display. This is |
|                                   | due to the fact a different Date  |
|                                   | of Effect is applied in order to  |
|                                   | apportion the employment income   |
|                                   | over an entitlement period.       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | So when NOHL decides not to apply |
|                                   | a change in rate at the DOV but   |
|                                   | at a later date, you'll see the   |
|                                   | relevant rule at the DOV and a    |
|                                   | corresponding Rule 11 applied at  |
|                                   | the actual DOE.                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Rate Increase - Date of Effect =  |
|                                   | Date of Receipt                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | No Change - Date of Effect = Date |
|                                   | of Event                          |
|                                   |                                   |

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 3                                 | This rule generally only applies  |
|                                   | when we have advance stripped     |
|                                   | payments (the old holiday         |
|                                   | processing)                       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | In this scenario there is an      |
|                                   | unfavourable determination (rate  |
|                                   | decrease), the customer notifies  |
|                                   | the change of circumstances in    |
|                                   | the same entitlement period as    |
|                                   | the change occurs and we also     |
|                                   | action the change in that same    |
|                                   | period, but the period has        |
|                                   | already been paid or stripped.    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Date of Effect = Date of Event.   |
|                                   |                                   |

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 4                                 | This is a NOHL rule that makes    |
|                                   | Date of Effect (DOE) apply from   |
|                                   | the Entitlement Period Start Date |
|                                   | of the period in which we are     |
|                                   | actioning the change. This arises |
|                                   | when the customer tells us about  |
|                                   | a change which results in their   |
|                                   | rate going down (an unfavourable  |
|                                   | determination) and the customer   |
|                                   | has notified that change in time  |
|                                   | (within their notification        |
|                                   | period).                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | In this case, we have already     |
|                                   | stripped one payment for the      |
|                                   | customer between when the event   |
|                                   | occurred and when we action the   |
|                                   | change. The customer has told us  |
|                                   | in time so we do not want to      |
|                                   | raise a debt, however we do want  |
|                                   | to reduce their rate as soon as   |
|                                   | we can. This rule says we reduce  |
|                                   | their rate from the beginning of  |
|                                   | the entitlement period in which   |
|                                   | we action the change. So the      |
|                                   | customer keeps their entitlement  |
|                                   | for the period we had stripped    |
|                                   | before we action the change.      |
|                                   | Their full next entitlement       |
|                                   | period is paid at the decreased   |
|                                   | rate.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | When Rule 4 applies, we defer the |
|                                   | change in entitlement until the   |
|                                   | beginning of the period in which  |
|                                   | we action the change. This means  |
|                                   | you will generally see two rules, |
|                                   | at different dates, applied in    |
|                                   | the reassessment. For example,    |
|                                   | the customer phones on 10         |
|                                   | September to tell us about an     |
|                                   | increase in income from 1         |
|                                   | September. The change in income   |
|                                   | is recorded on the relevant       |
|                                   | screen with a Date of Event (DOV) |
|                                   | of 1 September. The activity has  |
|                                   | a Date of Receipt (DOR) of 10     |
|                                   | September. Their entitlement      |
|                                   | period ended on 7 September. We   |
|                                   | action the change on 10           |
|                                   | September. We have already paid   |
|                                   | the customer for the entitlement  |
|                                   | period ending on 7 September so   |
|                                   | the date of effect rules say we   |
|                                   | reduce their rate from 8          |
|                                   | September.                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | You will see Rule 4 applied on 1  |
|                                   | September and then, on 8          |
|                                   | September (the date of effect for |
|                                   | the change), you will see Rule 11 |
|                                   | applied.                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | So when NOHL decides not to apply |
|                                   | a change in rate at the DOV but   |
|                                   | at a later date, you'll see the   |
|                                   | relevant rule at the DOV and a    |
|                                   | corresponding Rule 11 applied at  |
|                                   | the actual DOE.                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Date of Effect = Date Paid To + 1 |
|                                   | Day                               |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 5                                 | This is a NOHL rule that sets the |
|                                   | Date of Effect (DOE) to the day   |
|                                   | after the end of the Notification |
|                                   | Period. It is similar to Rule 4   |
|                                   | in that it applies when we make   |
|                                   | an unfavourable determination     |
|                                   | (the customer's rate decreases)   |
|                                   | after being notified of a change  |
|                                   | in circumstances. The customer    |
|                                   | has notified the change of        |
|                                   | circumstances within their        |
|                                   | notification period. For this     |
|                                   | rule to apply, we haven't         |
|                                   | actioned the change until more    |
|                                   | than one payment has passed. We   |
|                                   | are not going to reduce the rate  |
|                                   | from the date of event but we are |
|                                   | going to recover as much as we    |
|                                   | reasonably can of the money we    |
|                                   | have paid the customer.           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The rule says the customer can    |
|                                   | keep any money for the full       |
|                                   | notification period but that we   |
|                                   | can recover entitlement for the   |
|                                   | period from the day after the end |
|                                   | of the notification period. The   |
|                                   | customer will have a debt from    |
|                                   | the day after the end of the      |
|                                   | notification period until the     |
|                                   | date they are paid up to (their   |
|                                   | "date paid to").                  |

|                                   | This is the same as the October   |
|                                   | 1997 changes in debt processing.  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | When Rule 5 applies, we defer the |
|                                   | effect of the change in           |
|                                   | entitlement from the Date of      |
|                                   | Event (DOV) until the day after   |
|                                   | the end of the notification       |
|                                   | period. This means you will       |
|                                   | generally see two rules, at       |
|                                   | different dates, in the           |
|                                   | reassessment. For example, the    |
|                                   | customer rings on 10 September to |
|                                   | tell us they moved into           |
|                                   | government housing on 1           |
|                                   | September. This means they are no |
|                                   | longer entitled to rent           |
|                                   | assistance and their overall rate |
|                                   | goes down (we make an             |
|                                   | unfavourable determination). The  |
|                                   | customer's entitlement periods    |
|                                   | end on 7 September, 21 September  |
|                                   | and 5 October. We do not action   |
|                                   | this change until 1 October. The  |
|                                   | customer has been paid for the    |
|                                   | entitlement periods ending on 7   |
|                                   | September and 21 September. The   |
|                                   | date of effect rules say we       |
|                                   | reduce their entitlement from 16  |
|                                   | September (their notification     |
|                                   | period ended on 15 September).    |
|                                   | There is a recoverable debt from  |
|                                   | 16 September until 21 September.  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | You will see Rule 5 applied on 1  |
|                                   | September and then, on 16         |
|                                   | September (the date of effect for |
|                                   | the change), you will see Rule 11 |
|                                   | applied.                          |

|                                   | So when NOHL decides not to apply |
|                                   | a change in rate at the DOV but   |
|                                   | at a later date, you'll see the   |
|                                   | relevant rule at the DOV and a    |
|                                   | corresponding Rule 11 applied at  |
|                                   | the actual DOE.                   |

|                                   | 11 will apply at DOR (which is    |
|                                   | the date of effect). Where the    |
|                                   | Date of Receipt is on or before   |

|                                   | a Rule 7 on the Date of Event,    |
|                                   | and no Rule 11.                   |

|                                   | rules 15-18 will display. This is |
|                                   | due to the fact a different Date  |

|                                   | customer and the change of        |

|                                   | You'll generally see two rules    |
|                                   | applied, at different dates, in   |
|                                   | this reassessment. Rule 8 will    |
|                                   | apply at the DOV and Rule 11 will |
|                                   | apply at DOR (which is the date   |
|                                   | of effect).                       |

|                                   | It is important to note that      |
|                                   | where the change in circumstance  |
|                                   | relates to employment income,     |
|                                   | rules 15-18 will display. This is |
|                                   | due to the fact a different Date  |
|                                   | of Effect is applied in order to  |
|                                   | apportion the employment income   |
|                                   | over an entitlement period.       |

| 11                                | In processing a number of changes |
|                                   | in circumstances, the date of     |
|                                   | effect rules require us to defer  |
|                                   | the Date of Effect (DOE) from the |
|                                   | Date of Event (DOV). For example  |
|                                   | in Rule 1 and Rule 7 where we     |
|                                   | defer the Date of Effect to the   |
|                                   | Date of Receipt (DOR), or in Rule |
|                                   | 4 where we defer the Date of      |
|                                   | Effect to the beginning of the    |
|                                   | entitlement period in which we    |
|                                   | action the change. At the Date of |
|                                   | event, you see which particular   |
|                                   | rule applied at that date (e.g.   |
|                                   | rule 1 or 4 or 7). The            |
|                                   | reassessment then works through   |
|                                   | any more dates and eventually     |
|                                   | comes to the date of effect we    |
|                                   | decided to use when we deferred   |
|                                   | the effect from DOV. When we      |
|                                   | reach this "deferred DOE" we say  |
|                                   | we are applying rule 11. This     |
|                                   | will always be shown in           |
|                                   | conjunction with a business rule  |
|                                   | (1-9).                            |

| 12                                | Rule 12 says "this is the system  |
|                                   | mirroring an earlier decision to  |
|                                   | apply a rate change at date of    |
|                                   | event". You can disregard the     |
|                                   | rule.                             |

|                                   | There are a series of "rules"     |

|                                   | change in the current activity.   |
|                                   | These are significant for refresh |
|                                   | and reassessment actions recorded |
|                                   | on the BA screen. These rules are |
|                                   | generally just the system saying  |
|                                   | it has checked what to do to make |
|                                   | sure it mirrors any decisions     |
|                                   | from previous activities.         |
|                                   | However, there is no legislative  |
|                                   | basis to increase the rate (and   |
|                                   | hence calculate arrears) from a   |
|                                   | date of effect in the past. Where |
|                                   | the decision is favourable, the   |
|                                   | date of effect will be deferred   |

|                                   | this resulted in the customer's   |
|                                   | rate decreasing. This change in   |
|                                   | custody was notified late and we  |
|                                   | applied date of effect Rule 6     |
|                                   | which meant date of effect was    |
|                                   | date of event.                    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Let's say the custody change was  |
|                                   | on 1 September and the change was |
|                                   | notified on 30 September. The     |
|                                   | date of effect rule applied when  |
|                                   | that reassessment was done was    |
|                                   | Rule 6 and the decrease in rate   |
|                                   | applied from 1 September. If, on  |
|                                   | 10 November, you code a refresh   |
|                                   | action on the BA screen and       |
|                                   | specify a date of effect on the   |
|                                   | refresh action as 25 August,      |
|                                   | then, in the refresh activity,    |
|                                   | the system needs to mirror the    |
|                                   | original decision not to defer    |
|                                   | the change which happened on 1    |
|                                   | September.                        |

| 13                                | There are a series of "rules"     |
|                                   | used when we are processing dates |
|                                   | before the earliest date of       |
|                                   | change in the current activity.   |
|                                   | These are significant for refresh |
|                                   | and reassessment actions recorded |
|                                   | on the BA screen. These rules are |
|                                   | generally just the system saying  |
|                                   | it has checked what to do to make |
|                                   | sure it mirrors any decisions     |
|                                   | from previous activities.         |
|                                   | However, there is no legislative  |
|                                   | basis to increase the rate (and   |
|                                   | hence calculate arrears) from a   |
|                                   | date of effect in the past. Where |
|                                   | the decision is favourable, the   |
|                                   | date of effect will be deferred   |
|                                   | to the start of the current       |
|                                   | entitlement period (generally     |
|                                   | date paid to + 1). (See also Rule |
|                                   | 12 and Rule 14.)                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | For example, if there was an      |
|                                   | earlier activity processing a     |
|                                   | decrease in income leading to an  |
|                                   | increase in rate.                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Let's say the income change was   |
|                                   | on 1 September and the change was |
|                                   | notified on 10 September and the  |
|                                   | date of effect rule applied when  |
|                                   | that reassessment was done was    |
|                                   | for example, Rule 1. We had       |
|                                   | decided to defer the effect of    |
|                                   | the change in rate from 1         |
|                                   | September (DOV) to 10 September   |
|                                   | (DOR, also DOE). If on 4 November |
|                                   | you code a refresh action on the  |
|                                   | BA screen and specify a date of   |
|                                   | effect on the refresh action as   |
|                                   | 25 August, then in the refresh    |
|                                   | activity the system needs to      |
|                                   | defer the change which happened   |
|                                   | on 1 September to the start of    |
|                                   | the current entitlement period.   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Rule 13 says "this is the system  |
|                                   | mirroring an earlier decision to  |
|                                   | defer a rate change". You can     |
|                                   | disregard the rule.               |

|                                   | on the BA screen. These rules are |

|                                   | Rule 14 applies at the "date of   |
|                                   | effect" of the action coded on    |

|                                   | of circumstances. This rule       |
|                                   | applies when we are looking at    |
|                                   | the first reassessment for a      |
|                                   | period before the first           |

|                                   | activity. The rate that is used   |
|                                   | is the calculated rate            |
|                                   | (significant for Refresh          |

|                                   | You can disregard this rule - it  |
|                                   | is just the system saying "I am   |

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 15                                | This is one of several rules      |
|                                   | about favourable determinations   |
|                                   | (determinations resulting in the  |
|                                   | customer's rate increasing) and   |
|                                   | includes changes to earnings.     |
|                                   | These favourable determination    |
|                                   | rules all result in the Date of   |
|                                   | Effect (DOE) being the later of   |
|                                   | the Entitlement Period Start Day  |
|                                   | (EPSD) of either the Date of      |
|                                   | Receipt (DOR) or the Date of      |
|                                   | Event (DOV). It is almost always  |
|                                   | EPSD of the DOR, but if we have   |
|                                   | been notified in advance, and the |
|                                   | system is letting the date be     |
|                                   | processed rather than setting up  |
|                                   | a review, then it will be the     |
|                                   | EPSD of the DOV.                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | When Rule 15 applies, the         |
|                                   | situation is usually that a       |
|                                   | change to earnings is notified    |
|                                   | and we then defer the effect of   |
|                                   | that change to the Entitlement    |
|                                   | Period Start Day of the day we    |
|                                   | are notified. For example, the    |
|                                   | customer phones on 10 September   |
|                                   | to tell us about a decrease in    |
|                                   | income from 1 September. The      |
|                                   | change in income is recorded on   |
|                                   | the relevant screen with a DOV of |
|                                   | 1 September. The Entitlement      |
|                                   | Period Start Day for the customer |
|                                   | is 31 August. The activity has a  |
|                                   | DOR of 10 September. The date of  |
|                                   | effect rules say that the change  |
|                                   | in rate is effective from 31      |
|                                   | August. You will see Rule 15      |
|                                   | applied on 31 August.             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | So when NOHL decides not to apply |
|                                   | a change in rate at the DOV but   |
|                                   | at a later date, you'll see the   |
|                                   | relevant rule at the EPSD of the  |
|                                   | DOV.                              |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | the system. This exception        |
|                                   | applies where the PPP customer is |

|                                   | says that the date of effect of   |
|                                   | the change is the date of event   |
|                                   | of the change. For these cases,   |
|                                   | we have not deferred the date of  |
|                                   | effect so you'll only see Rule 15 |
|                                   | applied at the EPSD of the DOV.   |
|                                   | You will not see Rule 11 applied. |

| 16                                | A favourable determination rule.  |
|                                   | In this situation the customer    |
|                                   | has notified of an earnings       |
|                                   | change late and has already been  |
|                                   | paid for the period in which the  |
|                                   | event occurred.                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Date of Effect (DOE) is the later |
|                                   | of Entitlement Period Start Date  |
|                                   | (EPSD) of the Date of Receipt     |
|                                   | (DOR) or Date of Event (DOV).     |
|                                   | Because we are dealing with       |
|                                   | changes which have been notified  |
|                                   | late, Date of Effect would        |
|                                   | normally be Entitlement Period    |
|                                   | Start Date of Date of Receipt.    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | When Rule 16 applies, the         |
|                                   | situation is usually that a       |
|                                   | change is notified and we then    |
|                                   | defer the effect of that change   |
|                                   | to the start of the entitlement   |
|                                   | of the day we are notified. For   |
|                                   | example, the customer phones on   |
|                                   | 10 September to tell us about a   |
|                                   | decrease in income from 20        |
|                                   | August. The Entitlement Period    |
|                                   | Start Day for the customer is 31  |
|                                   | August. The change in income is   |
|                                   | recorded on the relevant screen   |
|                                   | with a DOV of 20 August. The      |
|                                   | activity has a DOR of 10          |
|                                   | September. The date of effect     |
|                                   | rules say that the change in rate |
|                                   | is effective from 31 August. You  |
|                                   | will see Rule 16 applied on 31    |
|                                   | August.                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | So when NOHL decides not to apply |
|                                   | a change in rate at the DOV but   |
|                                   | at a later date, you'll see the   |
|                                   | relevant rule at the EPSD of the  |
|                                   | DOV.                              |

|                                   | customer has notified a change in |
|                                   | earnings in time and has not yet  |
|                                   | been paid for the period in which |
|                                   | the event occurred. This doesn't  |
|                                   | really make any difference - Date |
|                                   | of Effect (DOE) is the later of   |
|                                   | Entitlement Period Start Date     |

|                                   | and Date of Event (DOV). You'll   |
|                                   | generally see two rules applied,  |
|                                   | at different dates, in this       |
|                                   | reassessment. Rule 17 will apply  |
|                                   | at the DOV and Rule 11 will apply |
|                                   | at DOR (which is the date of      |
|                                   | effect). Where the Date of        |
|                                   | Receipt is on or before the Date  |
|                                   | of Event, there will be a Rule 17 |

|                                   | there is an exception built into  |
|                                   | the system. This exception        |
|                                   | applies where the PPP customer is |
|                                   | partnered to an NSS stimulus      |
|                                   | customer and the change of        |
|                                   | circumstances is, or includes, a  |
|                                   | change in income. The exception   |
|                                   | says that the date of effect of   |
|                                   | the change is the date of event   |
|                                   | on the change. For these cases,   |
|                                   | we have not deferred the date of  |
|                                   | effect so you'll only see Rule 17 |
|                                   | applied at the DOV. You will not  |
|                                   | see Rule 11 applied.              |

| 18                                | A favourable determination rule   |
|                                   | (the customer's rate is going to  |
|                                   | increase). In this situation the  |
|                                   | customer has notified of an       |
|                                   | earnings change late but has not  |
|                                   | yet been paid for the period in   |
|                                   | which the event occurred. This    |
|                                   | doesn't really make any           |
|                                   | difference - Date of Effect (DOE) |
|                                   | is the later of Entitlement       |

|                                   | Event (DOV). Because we are       |

|                                   | Effect would normally be          |
