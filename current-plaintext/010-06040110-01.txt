This document outlines the away from home rate of Youth Allowance (YA)
where an equivalent activity is not available locally. This criterion
applies to dependent YA customers undertaking secondary study only.

Equivalent activity not available locally

Dependent YA secondary students may be eligible for the away from home
rate where they cannot study locally because:

-   an equivalent course is not available locally
-   the student's academic needs are not met by local educational
    facilities, or
-   there is no local facility

Approval for the away from home rate under this category can only be
granted where excessive travelling time is involved.

Circumstances to demonstrate a need to live away from home may include,
but not limited to the following:

-   the student has special abilities/talents whose educational needs
    are not met by the local school
-   the student has specific career interests and needs to attend a
    non-local school to study special subjects that will benefit their
    education and employment prospects, as the local school does not
    offer these subjects
-   the student has been excluded or suspended from the local government
    school and there is no other government school in the local area for
    the student to attend
-   the student attends a non-local school because the syllabus and
    teaching arrangements are specifically geared to cater for the needs
    of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students and where the
    first language of most students attending the school is not English
-   the student's parents have moved resulting in the student being
    unable to study the same subjects to complete their year 12
    certificate and/or tertiary entrance requirements, and there is no
    local school that offers the same subjects
-   the state/territory education authority agrees the local school is
    inappropriate for a student or group of students, because it does
    not meet their educational needs

Students with special talents or career interests

Students may be assessed as eligible for the away from home rate of YA
if they need to live away from home and bypass a local school as it will
be beneficial for their:

-   education, and/or
-   employment prospects

Give consideration in such cases to the special abilities of the student
and whether their needs can be met by the local school.

The student should provide, where possible, evidence their educational
and/or employment prospects will be better met by study at the non-local
education provider. This evidence may be statements from school
principals, teachers, or others acting in an official role with the
school. The evidence needs to indicate the subject/s for which the
student has a special career interest in/are undertaken as part the
young person's year 12-certificate and/or tertiary entrance curriculum.

Schools with limited programs

A secondary school listed as a limited program school does not offer a
full program at the year or grade in which the student is qualified to
enrol. See the Resources page for schools listed as having a limited
program.

The away from home rate can be approved for a student to bypass the
limited program school and attend another institution offering an
appropriate program if they are not within reasonable travelling time or
distance of other government schools at which the student is qualified
to enrol.

The Resources page contains examples of equivalent activity not
available locally and links to current and historical documents with the
local government schools listed as having a limited program by the
state/territory education authorities.
