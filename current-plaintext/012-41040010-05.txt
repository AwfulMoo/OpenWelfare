This page contains links to forms, contact details and examples relating
to the Location Specific Practice Number (LSPN) Register.

Registration start and end dates

This table describes the relevant month to use for start (day
application processed) and end (last day of the month) dates. These end
dates correspond to the months allocated for the automatic generation of
reminder letters for updating LSPN registrations. If an end date falls
outside the months listed a reminder letter will not be generated, the
LSPN will cease and all Medicare claims will be rejected. Reminder
letters for updating details are only generated for LSPNs with end dates
between March and November each year.

Note: register new LSPN registrations for a minimum of 12 months.

Equipment type for updating purposes

The agency must be notified if the diagnostic imaging or radiation
oncology practice purchases new equipment that is not of a type already
recorded on the register for that site, prior to the equipment being
used to perform Medicare funded services. Equipment must be listed on
the Register on the date of service before it is eligible to perform
Medicare funded services. The agency must also be notified within 28
days if the diagnostic imaging or radiation oncology practice removes
any equipment.

Capital sensitivity on equipment

The capital sensitivity measure’s purpose is to encourage diagnostic
imaging practices to regularly upgrade, and replace their equipment.
This provides more access to higher quality equipment.

This means that any diagnostic imaging services that have been performed
are no longer payable where that equipment:

-   has exceeded its effective life age, or
-   maximum extended life age

Except for those with a current approved exemption.

This is in place for almost all diagnostic imaging equipment providing
services (excluding PET and radiation oncology) under Medicare.

See Eligibility and Location Specific Practice Number (LSPN) for
Diagnostic Imaging (DI) and Radiation Oncology (RO) for more details.

Mobile equipment base registration

Each base for mobile diagnostic imaging or radiation oncology equipment
must complete a Register for or amend a Location Specific Practice
Number form. Upon registration, all mobile equipment stored at this
location must use the same LSPN. The distinction between a premises and
a mobile base will depend on where most services are performed and the
number of equipment used on premises or as a mobile service.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Item                              | Example                           |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Where equipment is used as a      |
|                                   | dedicated ‘mobile’ service then a |
|                                   | mobile base registration is       |
|                                   | appropriate. However, if the      |
|                                   | mobile equipment used for         |
|                                   | services is frequently carried    |
|                                   | out off the premises but on       |
|                                   | occasions is also used at the     |
|                                   | premises (where other equipment   |
|                                   | is also used) then the mobile     |
|                                   | equipment can be listed for the   |
|                                   | premises and the mobile services  |
|                                   | are to use that LSPN.             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | When equipment is taken from      |
|                                   | premises and used, either on an   |
|                                   | ad hoc or emergency mobile basis, |
|                                   | this is not considered a mobile   |
|                                   | service for the purpose of LSPN   |
|                                   | registration. A premises that     |
|                                   | provides this service must        |
|                                   | register once only as a premises. |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 2                                 | Where the equipment remains in a  |
|                                   | mobile unit, for example a        |
|                                   | vehicle, plane, or a vessel that  |
|                                   | is dedicated to providing the     |
|                                   | mobile service, and if the        |
|                                   | equipment is ordinarily removed   |
|                                   | from a mobile unit after use, the |
|                                   | base is the location where the    |
|                                   | equipment is ordinarily located   |
|                                   | when not in use.                  |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 3                                 | If the equipment remains in a     |
|                                   | mobile unit, the base is where    |
|                                   | the mobile unit is garaged. This  |
|                                   | could be the residential address  |
|                                   | of the driver or the address of   |
|                                   | the base where a fleet of mobile  |
|                                   | units is secured.                 |

|                                   | proprietor, with mobile units and |
|                                   | all units are returned to a base  |
|                                   | for garaging, the base must be    |
|                                   | registered and all mobile units   |
|                                   | operating from that base will use |
|                                   | the one LSPN.                     |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 5                                 | For practical purposes where a    |
|                                   | mobile unit is stored within a    |
|                                   | 50km radius of its home base, it  |
|                                   | does not need to apply for a      |
|                                   | separate LSPN. The home base will |
|                                   | register for the LSPN and all     |
|                                   | mobile units attached to it,      |
|                                   | within a 50km radius, will use    |
|                                   | the LSPN of its home base. Where  |
|                                   | a mobile unit is stored outside   |
|                                   | the 50km radius, it will need its |
|                                   | own LSPN.                         |
