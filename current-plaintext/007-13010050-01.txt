    overseas for a continuous period of 56 weeks from the original date

FTB paid under Special Benefit rules

Where the customer is paid Family Assistance and/or Paid Parental Leave

Automatic reviews are set up to reassess a customer's rate once a
customer or their child/ren have been overseas for a continuous period
of 6 weeks. These are called Future Rate Calculation Reviews.
