This document outlines the action required when determining if more than
one Customer Reference Number (CRN) belongs to the same customer.

Same customer assessment

All Centrelink records must be considered to belong to different people
until proven otherwise. A same customer assessment is the process of
comparing information on Centrelink records to determine if more than
one CRN belongs to the same customer.

A customer with more than one Centrelink record has a 'primary' record
and one or more 'multiple' records.

When more than one CRN appears to belong to the same person, the records
must be referred to the Data Quality Unit (DQU) via the Multiple CRN
Referral Fast Note.

No updates are to occur on these records until DQU confirm if they are
for the same customer and determine the primary CRN.

When different customers have the same or similar details and the wrong
customer record is updated the records become intertwined. No further
processing is to occur on intertwined records and, even if the incorrect
data has been deleted, the CRNs must be referred to DQU using the
Intertwined Referral Form. (See Resources for a link).

Refer to the Data Quality Unit Intranet page for additional information.
