|                                   | A person can be working varying   |
|                                   | hours on a casual basis as long   |
|                                   | as they complete a minimum of 960 |
|                                   | hours during each 12 month bonus  |
|                                   | period. A seasonal worker could   |
|                                   | work a high number of hours per   |
|                                   | week during their 'season' and    |
|                                   | exceed the 960 hours needed for   |
|                                   | the bonus period. The customer    |
|                                   | would not need to work during the |
|                                   | remainder of that full year bonus |
|                                   | period.                           |

|                                   | Betty works for 1680 hours and    |
|                                   | Bob works for 700 hours.          |

|                                   | Therefore, Bob's work is          |
|                                   | disregarded and they each accrue  |
|                                   | a full year bonus period on the   |
|                                   | basis of Betty's work. Betty's    |

|                                   | transferred to top up Bob's.      |

|                                   | non-accruing period. However,     |
|                                   | sick leave is regarded as         |
|                                   | discretionary and will not extend |
|                                   | John's bonus period because the   |
