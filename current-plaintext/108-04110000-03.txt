|                                   | The income from a life interest   |
|                                   | can be coded as other ordinary    |

|                                   | If an income stream is being      |

|                                   | procedure should be used:         |

|                                   | -   calculate the deemed rate of  |
|                                   |     income on the capitalised     |

|                                   | -   compare total income          |
|                                   |     including the actual income   |
|                                   |     foregone with the income      |

|                                   | and income which could be derived |
