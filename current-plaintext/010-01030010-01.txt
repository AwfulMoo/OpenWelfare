This document outlines the responsibility Services Australia has in
providing information about education and training opportunities to the
public.

Services Australia's role

The agency's role is to provide customers with access to information
about education and training opportunities to maximise their abilities.
Under duty of care, staff should not discuss the relative merits of one
university or higher education institution over another. It is the
responsibility of the customer to find an appropriate tertiary course
and to arrange enrolment for themselves.

The Resources page contains more information about the ways that a
student can access information about universities in Australia,
including links to education related websites.
