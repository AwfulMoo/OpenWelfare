This document outlines how Service Officers identify and capture
circumstances impacting capacity to comply with compulsory requirements
for job seekers or ParentsNext participants.

Personal responsibility

Job seekers and ParentsNext participants are expected to take personal
responsibility managing and ensuring they can meet their requirements.

This includes:

-   talking with their Employment Services Provider (or the Digital
    Services Contact Centre (DCSS) if they are a Workforce Australia
    Online for Individuals) or ParentsNext provider about circumstances
    that may be impacting their ability to participate, so the
    requirements or activities in their Job/Participation Plan are
    appropriate and achievable
-   recording Personal Events via their Individual Homepage (Workforce
    Australia job seekers) or Online Dashboard (DES/ParentsNext
    Participants) to ensure their provider is aware of personal
    appointments/commitments
-   letting their provider know beforehand if unable to attend a
    compulsory appointment or activity, and
-   recording their own attendance at compulsory requirements if they
    are able to do so

Those who are unable to manage their participation themselves using
their homepage need to discuss other arrangements with their provider or
if they are in Workforce Australia Online, with the DSCC.

If a job seeker or participant who usually manages their own
participation is unable to record their attendance on a given day (for
example, due to an internet outage) they must contact their provider or
the DSCC by close of business that day and ask them to update their
record.

Circumstances that are likely to have ongoing impacts

If job seekers, including ParentsNext participants, have circumstances
that are likely to impact on their capacity to comply, Services
Australia and providers flag these in the relevant system. This ensures
their personal circumstances are considered when negotiating a Job Plan
or if non-compliance occurs.

Services Australia responsibilities

All Service Officers and specialists have responsibility for
identifying, recording and reviewing job seeker circumstances that are
ongoing in nature and are likely to have an impact on the job seeker's
capacity to comply with requirements. Job seekers who present with
family and domestic violence or have a current Family
relationship/Domestic violence circumstance recorded must have a
consultation with a PST-skilled social worker. See Accessing a
PST-skilled social worker.

When job seeker circumstances are recorded or reviewed, Service Officers
must remind job seekers of their personal responsibilities.

These responsibilities include:

-   talking to their provider (or the DSCC if they are in Workforce
    Australia Online) about any circumstances that are likely to impact
    their ability to comply with requirements
-   fully participating in compulsory activities included in their Job
    Plan/Participation Plan
-   keeping the calendar up to date in their homepage so their provider
    is aware of personal commitments, such as school pick up times,
    medical appointments or work, when scheduling requirements or
    compulsory appointments

Recording circumstances impacting capacity to comply with compulsory requirements

The Circumstances Impacting Compliance screen displays all circumstances
that have been identified as potentially impacting the job seeker's
capacity to comply with compulsory requirements.

Before recording a job seeker circumstance impacting compliance, Service
Officers should consider the impact the circumstance is likely to have
on the job seeker's ongoing capacity to comply with compulsory
requirements. Circumstances that are unlikely to affect the job seeker's
capacity to comply should not be recorded and any existing circumstances
that is no longer impacting should be ended. Do not delete a
circumstance that no longer applies, record an end date as appropriate
based on the job seeker’s advice.

The Services Australia system will automatically create job seeker
circumstances when:

-   providers record circumstances in the Capability Management Tool in
    the Employment Services System (ESS)
-   Homelessness Indicators have been recorded
-   an Employment Services Assessment (ESAt)/Job Capacity Assessment
    (JCA) or Job Seeker Snapshot identifies factors likely to impact a
    job seekers capacity to comply

When job seeker circumstances have been automatically created, they
contain minimal information and need to be assessed as appropriate
during interactions with PST-skilled Service Officers.

When Services Australia Service Officers identify new job seeker
circumstances during any contact, a circumstance can be created manually
using the Circumstances Impacting Compliance workflow.

Disclosing information to providers

Providers need to know about circumstances that are impacting
compliance:

-   to ensure compulsory requirements are reasonable
-   so they can identify appropriate support services
-   so they can undertake their roles and responsibilities in relation
    to administration of social security law

Section 202 of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 provides
Services Australia with the authority to disclose information to
providers, which is relevant to their servicing and assists the provider
to deliver an effective service to the job seeker.

By using the Circumstances Impacting Compliance workflow, Services
Australia ensures that relevant information about a job seeker's
circumstances is made available to their provider. For certain
circumstances, as long as the appropriate minimum evidence has been
recorded, the information Services Australia record is shared
electronically with the provider as a Vulnerability Indicator. Providers
use the Capability Management tool in the Employment Services System
(ESS) to display a job seeker/ParentsNext participant’s existing
circumstances/Vulnerability Indicator.

The Resources page contains attachments describing when the various job
seeker circumstances categories can be added, updated or ended, and the
evidence required for different circumstances.
