|                                   | of money'. This applies           |
|                                   | irrespective of when the advance  |
|                                   | payment was paid during the       |
|                                   | financial year. Advance payments  |
|                                   | do not attract any additional tax |
|                                   | liability as they are not an      |
|                                   | extra payment but a lump sum      |
|                                   | payment of the customer's ongoing |
|                                   | entitlement.                      |

|                                   | as a lump sum or instalments?     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: All advances can be paid  |
|                                   | as a lump sum into the customer's |
|                                   | normal bank account.              |

|                                   | advance payments can also be paid |
|                                   | in 2 instalments.                 |

|                                   | instalment to be paid. Staff must |
|                                   | code this date in line with       |
|                                   | current payment processing times. |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | For pension customers, the        |
|                                   | instalment date is coded as 2     |
|                                   | working days prior to the date    |
|                                   | the customer has requested the    |
|                                   | funds be paid. For non-pension    |
|                                   | customers, the instalment date is |
|                                   | coded as 1 working day prior to   |
|                                   | the date the funds are required   |

|                                   | The second instalment must be     |
|                                   | paid within 6 months of grant.    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | When a customer elects to have    |
|                                   | instalments, the recovery rate is |
|                                   | calculated on the full amount to  |
|                                   | be advanced.                      |

|                                   | Answer: No, it cannot be undone,  |
|                                   | but the date of delivery of the   |
|                                   | second instalment can be changed  |
|                                   | to still deliver the advance in 2 |
|                                   | instalments, but over consecutive |

|                                   | Answer: If the advance has been   |
|                                   | processed due to a fraudulent     |
|                                   | claim or has been granted on an   |
|                                   | incorrect record, the advance can |
|                                   | be removed by ICT. See, Deletion  |

| 5                                 | Question: If a customer calls to  |
|                                   | request an advance payment (and   |
|                                   | it has been processed), can the   |
|                                   | customer contact the agency later |
|                                   | the same day to advise they no    |
|                                   | longer wish to receive the        |
|                                   | advance and request it be         |
|                                   | cancelled?                        |

|                                   | Answer: No. Once the advance has  |
|                                   | been processed, the decision has  |

|                                   | meet the customer's request. The  |
|                                   | customer should be advised the    |
|                                   | advance has been processed and    |
|                                   | payment has been made.            |

|                                   | have a temporarily written off    |
|                                   | overpayment?                      |

|                                   | Answer: A temporarily written off |

|                                   | recoverable debt owing to the     |
|                                   | Commonwealth Government and       |
|                                   | therefore the customer is not     |

|                                   | ex-partner non-lodger debt or     |
|                                   | bankruptcy debt, these debts will |
|                                   | not affect their eligibility for  |

| 3                                 | Question: Should a Service        |
|                                   | Officer grant a customer an       |
|                                   | advance when they apply with an   |
|                                   | outstanding debt balance of less  |
|                                   | than 5 cents?                     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: Yes. When a customer pays |
|                                   | an outstanding balance of a debt  |
|                                   | but a rounding amount remains     |
|                                   | outstanding, any advance payment  |
|                                   | application will automatically    |
|                                   | reject. Service Officers are      |
|                                   | allowed in these instances to     |
|                                   | override the rejection using the  |
|                                   | advance payment workflow where    |
|                                   | the customer has an outstanding   |
|                                   | debt balance of less than 5       |
|                                   | cents. This is so the customer is |
|                                   | not disadvantaged by the          |
|                                   | administrative process which      |
|                                   | occurs as the remaining rounding  |
|                                   | amount will not clear until after |
|                                   | the customer's next pay day.      |

|                                   | $234.67, they attend a Post       |
|                                   | Office to pay the full amount in  |
|                                   | cash but due to rounding can only |
|                                   | pay $234.65 (the customer cannot  |
|                                   | pay more than the amount due).    |
|                                   | The $0.02 (2 cents) outstanding   |

| 4                                 | Question: If the customer has a   |
|                                   | Compensation Insurer debt that    |
|                                   | has not been repaid, can they     |
|                                   | receive an advance payment?       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: This type of debt does    |
|                                   | not meet the qualification        |
|                                   | requirements and should not       |
|                                   | prevent the customer from         |
|                                   | receiving an advance. The debt is |
|                                   | owed to the Commonwealth by the   |
|                                   | insurer, not the customer.        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | As the system is unable to        |
|                                   | identify this type of debt from   |
|                                   | other debts, the workflow will    |
|                                   | automatically reject the          |
|                                   | application. In these cases, the  |
|                                   | rejection should be overridden.   |

|                                   | amount is accepted and updated on |
|                                   | the customer's record when the    |
|                                   | advance payment is being granted. |

|                                   | than the system generated amount, |
|                                   | the customer's advance payment    |
|                                   | will be rejected as the customer  |

|                                   | repayment.                        |

EPED system limitation

There is a known system limitation for advance payments of pensions that
arises when an advance payment was granted on the customer's Entitlement
Period End Date (EPED).

Where an advance payment was granted to a customer on their EPED, the
final repayment will be deducted on the 13th EPED following the date of
grant. This is also the date that is calculated as the 'next available
date' for a further advance payment. However, the final repayment may
not update on the customer's record until the following day. This means
that although the required number of days since the previous advance
payment has lapsed, and the advance payment has been fully repaid, the
system will not recognise this until the following day.

Customer contacting on their EPED

For customers contacting on their Entitlement Period End Date (EPED) to
apply for a new pension advance payment:

-   Check if the customer was granted their previous advance payment on
    their EPED
-   If yes, check if the final repayment is due to be made today
-   If this is the 13th EPED from the date of grant of the advance
    payment, the final repayment will not update until the day after the
    EPED

Customers in this situation will need to be advised to wait until the
day after the EPED to apply for an advance payment.

Next eligibility date for advance payment

Customers should be informed that any advice provided about their future
eligibility for an advance payment is indicative only and that the only
accurate assessment is on the day of application.

To calculate the next available date manually

-   Identify oldest advance granted within the last 26 weeks/13
    fortnights that has not yet been repaid
-   Find the customer’s Entitlement Period End Day (EPED) code on the
    Entitlement Delivery (RAD) page.
-   Using the Centrelink Calendar (OS035) count forward 13 EPEDS from
    the entitlement period that the advance was granted in (inclusive)
    and add one day. Example: customer is granted an advance on 2
    February 2017 (EPEDC '5’), however their standard entitlement period
    EPED is EPED code (EPEDC) ‘B' on 7 February 2017. 13 x EPED code ‘B’
    = 25 July 2017 = 1 day = 26 July 2017. Customer would be eligible
    for the next advance on 26 July 2017.

If the outstanding advance was granted on the Entitlement Period End
Date (EPED) for the customer, the next advance will not be available
until 13 EPEDs plus 14 days from when the advance was granted. This is
because the recovery is not commenced within the fortnight the advance
is paid. Example: Customer applies for an advance on 25 January 2017.
This is EPEDC ‘C’. It is also the customer’s Entitlement Period End date
(EPED). As no recovery of the advance can be made in this fortnight, the
customer will not be eligible for their next advance until 11 August
2017 (13 EPEDs + 14 days)

|                                   | On 8 April 2018 (after the March  |
|                                   | 2018 CPI increase) the customer   |
|                                   | applies for and is granted the    |
|                                   | remaining allowable amount of     |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | On 12 May 2018 the customer       |

|                                   | for an advance payment. The       |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | On 12 May 2018, as 13 fortnights  |
|                                   | have elapsed since 10 November    |
|                                   | 2017, the earlier of the          |
|                                   | customer's 2 advances has now     |
|                                   | been repaid and has no effect on  |
|                                   | the calculation.                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | However, the advance for $861.10  |
|                                   | is still relevant to the          |
|                                   | calculation and is deducted from  |
|                                   | the new maximum rate of $1286.10. |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This leaves $425.00 allowed. But  |
|                                   | as this is less than the new      |
|                                   | minimum since the March CPI of    |
|                                   | $428.70, the customer is          |
|                                   | ineligible for an advance and     |
|                                   | will need to wait until 13        |
|                                   | fortnights have elapsed from the  |
|                                   | 8 April advance before again      |
|                                   | being able to test their          |
|                                   | eligibility for another advance   |
|                                   | payment.                          |
