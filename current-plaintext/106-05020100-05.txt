|                                   | A person is not entitled to       |
|                                   | payment if the person's           |
|                                   | unemployment is due to industrial |
|                                   | action that they are directly     |
|                                   | involved in. This also applies to |
|                                   | a person who is not directly      |
|                                   | involved in that industrial       |
|                                   | action but the trade union of     |
|                                   | which they are a member is        |
|                                   | involved.                         |

|                                   | If the industrial action is in    |

|                                   | State industrial authority, the   |

|                                   | Federal Court, then the customer  |
|                                   | would not be eligible for payment |
|                                   | until at least 6 weeks after the  |
|                                   | industrial action has ceased.     |

|                                   | A stand down occurs when an       |
|                                   | employer is unable to offer       |
|                                   | employees work due to the         |
|                                   | industrial action of others, and  |
|                                   | as a result employees are stood   |
|                                   | down without pay until the        |
|                                   | situation improves. If a person   |
|                                   | who is stood down is not a member |
|                                   | of the same union as the workers  |
|                                   | taking the industrial action,     |
|                                   | then that person may be qualified |
|                                   | for JobSeeker Payment (JSP) or    |
|                                   | Youth Allowance (YA) even though  |
|                                   | they have not been dismissed.     |
|                                   | Those who are members of the same |
|                                   | union would not be eligible for   |
|                                   | JSP, YA or Special Benefit (SpB)  |
|                                   | although their partner may have a |
|                                   | qualification for SpB. The        |
|                                   | situation may arise when a person |
|                                   | is dismissed due to industrial    |
|                                   | action of others. In these cases  |
|                                   | they should be treated in the     |
|                                   | same way as a person that has     |
|                                   | been stood down.                  |

|                                   | usually takes about 3 months      |
|                                   | until resignation is formally     |
|                                   | accepted.                         |

|                                   | look at what eligibility a        |

|                                   | payment as they may have an       |
