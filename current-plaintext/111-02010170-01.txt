This document outlines the process of accessing archived Residential
Care Assistance (RCA) data using the Archiving and Culling Engine (ACE)
application.

General rules

The general rules for archiving RCA records are:

-   The record must have been cancelled for 3 or more years
-   The record must not have a recent or unfinalised Debt, Appeal,
    Prosecution or Compensation activity

Service reasons to be archived

The only RCA service reason to be archived is RCA (Residential Care
Assistance).

Not all data for a 3 year old cancelled record is archived. Only
Assessment, Summary and Circumstance data relevant to RCA is archived.
No Person data or common Circumstance data is archived, and this data is
retained in the Centrelink system for use by other Common Platform
Systems.

After a record has been archived, the RCA data normally displayed on the
system will be displayed in ACE.

The Resources page contains a link to the Archiving and Culling Engine
