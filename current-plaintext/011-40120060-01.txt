Procedures for contacting a PSO

The Health Service Delivery Division has a team of Programme Support
Officers (PSO) to assist Services Australia staff with most health
related programme enquiries. Staff should contact the appropriate PSO
line for advice and only transfer a call at a PSO's request.

Staff must endeavour to resolve enquiries at first point of contact to
provide accurate and timely service in line with the Minister's
expectations.

The Resources page contains a link to the PSO contact details and PSO
