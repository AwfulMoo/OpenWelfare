|                                   |     reason for this is that the   |
|                                   |     customer's approval may no    |
|                                   |     longer be relevant, therefore |
|                                   |     they must advise of changes   |
|                                   |     to their departure dates so   |
|                                   |     the reason for approval       |
|                                   |     remains valid. It is          |
|                                   |     therefore important to advise |
|                                   |     them to tell Services         |
