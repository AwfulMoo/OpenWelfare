This document outlines information about reissuing an End of Year (EOY)
circumstance review form for Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC). An
AIC EOY review form and questionnaire is sent to current AIC applicants
during the last week in October to confirm an AIC student's
circumstances (for example education details, isolation conditions and
living arrangements) for the following year and to determine their
eligibility for continuing entitlements.

Applicant requires duplicate review form

If an applicant did not receive the review form or has misplaced it, the
form may either be reproduced on the system, or if a reprint cannot be
produced, a manual form may be sent.

EOY review form not automatically sent

The EOY review form is automatically sent to all AIC applicants unless
the student belongs to one of the following groups:

-   AIC Pensioner Education Supplement (PES) students
-   students that are current with a future cancellation date of other
    than 1 January next calendar year
-   secondary students in Years 12 or 13
-   students who will be over the maximum AIC age by 1 January of the
    following year
