Relationship parent - definition

The definition of 'Relationship parent' and 'relationship child', in the
Social Security Act 1991 refers to the interpretation of a child in the
Family Law Act 1975. These definitions intend to include as parents both
people in a same-sex or heterosexual relationship, where:

-   one of the people is the biological parent of the child
-   that person was in a relationship with the other person when an
    artificial conception procedure was carried out, and
-   the other person agreed to the procedure

In such cases, the child is a relationship child of the biological
parent and the other intended parent.

Parents of children born under surrogacy arrangements, where a court has
made an order that the child is their child, are also included in the
definition of relationship parent.
