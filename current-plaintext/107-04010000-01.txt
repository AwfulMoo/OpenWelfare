This document outlines a number of procedures for raising Centrelink
debts that are common to all payment types.

Raising Centrelink debts

Staff should:

-   raise a recoverable debt as quickly as possible
-   inform the customer of the debt as soon as it happens
-   process debts correctly to avoid Manual Follow-up (MFU) activities

Access requirements to action debt activities

Debt staff

Debt staff have the required system access to perform debt related
functions, such as running the Debt Script.

Non-debt staff

Non-debt staff required to perform a debt related action need the
appropriate security access. See the Resources page for details.

Process Direct

See Raising Child Care Subsidy (CCS) debts in Process Direct.

Customer record updates not generating debt shells

If a user makes an update that should be generating a debt shell, but
the system does not create one, see Create a new debt record manually on
the Debt Management and Information System (DMIS).

The Resources page contains:

-   Tax adjustment information
-   Common tax adjustment errors
