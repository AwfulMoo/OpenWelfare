Webform requests

Request for document rescan, retrieval or location webform

Rescans and retrievals can take some time to action, and the customer
may be disadvantaged as a result. Consider if the information is already
available, or can be gathered in another way.

After opening the form, select Centrelink or Medicare.

Provide as much information as possible to support the request.

If a rescan or retrieval request is rejected or cannot be completed, it
is the responsibility of the requesting Service Officer to update the
customer record.

If documents were lodged or scanned in a service centre, completing the
webform request will send an email to the positional mailbox for that
site to action as well as a copy to the requesting officer.

Returning documents to customers

Table 3: when and how documents received by post are returned to a
customer.

After sighting the original document , it is photocopied and the copy
stamped with 'original sighted and returned'. The document is then
scanned and the original returned to the customer. Documents with the
'original sighted and returned' stamp cannot be retrieved as they have
already been returned.

Documents listed in the table below will be automatically returned to
the customer. As staff preparing documents for scanning do not read
entire documents, they may not notice if a customer has requested the
return of documents other than those listed below (for example bank
statements).

If the customer has requested the return of other documents and there is
no stamp indicating they have been sighted and returned, the Service
Office must print the relevant documents and post them to the customer.

A retrieval request should be submitted for any of the following
original documents if there is no stamp indicating the documents have
been sighted and returned.
