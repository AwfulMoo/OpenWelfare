This document outlines what can occur when the partner of a customer who
receives ABSTUDY payments commences or returns to work.

Means test

Independent students applying for ABSTUDY Living Allowance are subject
to the Personal Income Test and, if partnered, the Partner Income Test.

Partner Income Test

An ABSTUDY customer under 22 years of age will have their payment
reduced by 60 cents for every $1 their partner is paid over the Partner
Income Free Area.

An ABSTUDY customer who is 22 years or over will have their payment
reduced by 50 cents for every $1 their partner is paid over the Partner
Income Free Area.

For further information on the Partner Income Test and how to calculate
the Partner Income Free Area, see:

-   Partner Income Test for ABSTUDY customers 22 years and over
-   Partner Income Test for ABSTUDY customers under 22 years old,
    Austudy and Youth Allowance students and Australian Apprentices

Ongoing income

If the partner's income is ongoing and above the limit for the customer
to continue to receive ABSTUDY Living Allowance, the student's payment
will remain current at a zero rate to enable the ABSTUDY customer to
remain eligible for other ABSTUDY entitlements. e.g. Incidentals
Allowance.
