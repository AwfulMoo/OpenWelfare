Agreements and arrangements

The agency’s relationships with other government departments are bound
by a high level multilateral strategic partnership document and several
detailed Bilateral Management Arrangements (BMA), between the agency and
individual departments.

BMAs specify Commonwealth services to be provided by the agency and
conditions applying to the provision of those services. They improve
assurance arrangements to provide greater transparency over the agency’s
performance in meeting service delivery outcomes, risk management and
accuracy targets.
