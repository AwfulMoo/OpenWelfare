For Services Australia social workers only.

If a child is in immediate danger or risk of harm you must act, and a
delegate must call 000.

This document outlines the exclusion assessment procedure for recording
'Not Practicable due to Support and Demonstrated Capacity' for
Vulnerable Welfare Payment Recipients (VWPR) in the Social Work
Information System (SWIS), for young people subject to automatically
triggered VWPR.

Eligibility triggers for VWPR

Young people can be subject to automatic triggers for VWPR if they meet
one of the following eligibility triggers:

-   aged under 16 years and in receipt of a Special Benefit (SpB-USY)
-   16 years of age or over and in receipt of an independent rate of
    Youth Allowance, Disability Support Pension or ABSTUDY Living
    Allowance due to meeting the Unreasonable to Live at Home (UTLAH)
    status, or
-   under the age of 25 and receive a Crisis Payment (CrP) within the
    last 13 weeks due to prison release or psychiatric confinement

Customers will not be identified for Income Management if they are:

-   full-time students
-   Australian apprentices
-   currently on Voluntary Income Management (VIM)

Not Practicable - Support and Demonstrated Capacity Exclusion

Social workers may determine Income Management is 'Not Practicable due
to Support and Demonstrated Capacity' as the customer has been on VWPR
Youth Income Management for 12 months, and they have:

-   successfully engaged in a supportive relationship that provided
    mentoring, coaching or case management that included a transition to
    independence, or
-   demonstrated the skills and ability to manage their money and to
    live independently, and
-   the social worker is satisfied the customer is likely to continue
    participating in appropriate activities/supportive arrangements and
    therefore do not need to remain on Income Management

A Social Work Information System (SWIS) report must be completed for
these exclusion assessments (granted or rejected).

The VWPR exclusion assessment is generally part of a complex social work
intervention requiring a number of contacts with customers and third
parties if appropriate.

There is no maximum number of contacts that can be recorded, and this
should reflect the complexity of the customer's circumstances as well as
the social work assistance provided.

Welfare Payment Recipient (VWPR Youth) Income Management by social
workers.

Child safe framework

Services Australia has a zero tolerance approach to child abuse.

A staff member must act when they see or hear behaviour that raises
concern about a child or young person’s safety. Follow the agency's Risk
Identification and Reporting model when identifying and responding to
child safety concerns. See Risk identification and management of threats
to the safety or welfare of a child.
