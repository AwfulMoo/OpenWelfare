Scenarios of how to manually calculate payments for SFA (Group 2)

These amounts may not be current. They are examples only. For current
payments, see Rates and Thresholds.

Note: before 1 January 2019, payments to boarding schools and hostels
were paid as a term-in-advance method for each term entitlement period.
When calculating a period before 1 January 2019, use the number of days
in the relevant term entitlement period, for example 90 days for Term 1.

For the purposes of SFA (Group 2) School Fees calculations, the
student's 'boarding' entitlement, which may include Living Allowance,
Rent Assistance (RA) and Remote Area Allowance (RAA), may also be known
as Living Allowance.

Note: RAA is not included in the calculation of the customer's maximum
payment rate or the family pool maximum payment rate.

This table describes scenarios for the manual calculation of SFA (Group
2). Rates are current as at 16 June 2021.
