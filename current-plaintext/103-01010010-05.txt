|                                   | John has been income managed      |
|                                   | under Child Protection Income     |
|                                   | Management (CPIM) for the last 12 |
|                                   | months. The Child Protection      |
|                                   | Authority has decided not to      |
|                                   | extend the notice to income       |
|                                   | manage John’s payments so they    |
|                                   | are due to come off CPIM.         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | However, as John has been in      |
|                                   | receipt of JobSeeker Payment for  |
|                                   | the last 18 months and is living  |
|                                   | in the Northern Territory, when   |
|                                   | the Child Protection notice       |
|                                   | expires John will not come off    |

|                                   | When John moves from CPIM to      |

|                                   | income support payment that is    |
|                                   | income managed will reduce from   |
|                                   | 70% to 50%. Failure to review     |
|                                   | John's expenses could result in   |
|                                   | John having more than 100% of     |
|                                   | income managed funds allocated,   |
|                                   | which in turn will cause expenses |
|                                   | to be undelivered due to          |
|                                   | insufficient funds being          |
|                                   | available.                        |

|                                   | income managed. A review will     |
|                                   | allow the Service Officer to      |
|                                   | explain to Julie why they are     |
|                                   | still being income managed. Julie |
|                                   | can choose to end the payment     |
|                                   | nominee relationship if the       |

|                                   | longer suits their requirements,  |
|                                   | at which time NIM-CIM would be    |
|                                   | ended. If the arrangement is to   |
|                                   | remain in place, Julie’s priority |
|                                   | needs should be reviewed to       |
|                                   | ensure their needs continue to be |
|                                   | met.                              |
