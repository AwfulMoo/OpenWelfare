This document outlines a process for Service Officers assessing the
combined care provisions for carers claiming Carer Payment (CP) (child).

CP combined care

If a carer does not qualify for CP (child) for 1 child, they may qualify
if they provide care for 2 to 4 children under 16 years of age, each of
whom has a disability or medical condition, their combined care equal to
the care load of 1 child with a severe disability or severe medical
condition.

In addition to the above, to be eligible for CP (child) combined care:

-   the carer must personally provide constant care to the combined care
    receivers
-   the care provided to the care receivers when combined attains a
    qualifying rating of intense under the Disability Care Load
    Assessment (child) Determination (DCLAD) (2010)
-   the provision of the care must severely restrict the carer's
    capacity to undertake paid employment
-   all care receivers must meet all other care receiver qualifications
    criteria

Note: a carer caring for 2 to 4 care receivers under 16 years of age can
also be assessed under the short term or episodic care provisions. This
would limit the grant to either a short term or episodic grant.

Carer Allowance (auto)

CA (auto) is available to all recipients of CP (child).

If CP (child) cancels, CA (auto) will cancel automatically at the same
time). The carer will need to lodge a new claim for CA (child) if the
child still requires and receives additional daily care due to their
disability or medical condition.
