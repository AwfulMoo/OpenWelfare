This document outlines information about identifying and managing
Western Australian (WA) ex-nuptial cases.

Western Australia and the child support scheme

The child support scheme is a Commonwealth legislative scheme. The
Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act gives the Commonwealth
Parliament power to make laws about marriage and children of those
marriages.

WA was the only Australian state that had not yet referred its power to
the Commonwealth to make laws about children whose parents are not
married. The WA Parliament retained its powers to make laws about WA
ex-nuptial children, including child support laws, until the
introduction of the CS (CP) Act on 15 May 2019.

Prior to referring their powers to the Commonwealth, the WA Parliament
had to enact laws adopting changes to Commonwealth child support
legislation, including amendments. However, this did not occur at the
same time as the Commonwealth laws commenced in the rest of Australia.
The Registrar had to make different arrangements for child support cases
that involve WA ex-nuptial children (WA ex-nuptial cases).

and the child support scheme.

Note: Christmas and Cocos (Keeling) Islands are not part of WA, being
external territories.

Definition of a WA ex-nuptial case

Before 15 May 2019 WA ex-nuptial case existed where:

-   the parents were not married (and did not subsequently marry), and
-   the child and carer were residing in Western Australia

WA ex-nuptial customers after 15 May 2019

Since 15 May WA ex-nuptial customers are treated in the same way as all
other customers.

The system will be enhanced to automatically treat WA ex-nuptial
customers correctly where:

-   care is notified outside of 28 days - late notified care change
-   disputed care - possible interim period - is notified
-   an amended tax assessment is lodged
-   a payee is entitled to child support under an agreement. The care
    they have of the child in the agreement falls below 35%

Until this enhancement occurs manual workarounds are required to ensure
the child support assessment is correct.
