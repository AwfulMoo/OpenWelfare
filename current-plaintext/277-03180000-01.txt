This document outlines information about identifying and managing
Western Australian (WA) Ex-nuptial cases.

Western Australia and the child support scheme

The child support scheme is a Commonwealth legislative scheme. The
Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act gives the Commonwealth
Parliament power to make laws about marriage and children of those
marriages.

WA was the only Australian state that did not refer its power to the
Commonwealth to make laws about children whose parents are not married,
until the introduction of the CS (CP) Act on 15 May 2019.

Before referring their powers to the Commonwealth, the WA Parliament had
to enact laws adopting changes to Commonwealth child support
legislation, including amendments. However, this did not occur at the
same time as the Commonwealth laws commenced in the rest of Australia.
The Registrar had to make different arrangements for child support cases
that involve WA Ex-nuptial children (WA ex-nuptial cases).

and the child support scheme.

Note: Christmas and Cocos (Keeling) Islands are not part of WA, being
external territories.

Definition of a WA Ex-nuptial case

Before 15 May 2019, a WA Ex-nuptial case existed where:

-   the parents were not married (and did not subsequently marry), and
-   the child and carer were residing in Western Australia

WA Ex-nuptial customer after 15 May 2019

Since 15 May 2019, WA Ex-nuptial customers are treated in the same way
as all other customers.

The system was enhanced on 18 June 2022 to automatically treat WA
Ex-nuptial customers correctly prospectively where:

-   Child Support Periods (CSPs) are automatically raised on or after 18
    June 2022
-   new cases are registered, or cases are restarted, with a start date
    of liability (SDOL) on or after 18 June 2022

As this enhancement was prospective, workarounds continue to be required
for cases with WA Ex-nuptial CSPs where:

-   care is notified outside of 28 days - late notified care change
-   disputed care - possible interim period - is notified
-   an amended tax assessment is lodged
-   a payee is entitled to child support under an agreement. The care
    they have of the child in the agreement falls below 35%
