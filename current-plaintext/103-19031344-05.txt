| Example 1                                                             |
|                                                                       |

| incorporated, it is also not an unincorporated association rather it  |
| is a non-corporate Commonwealth entity and part of the legal entity   |
| that is the Commonwealth of Australia. See information about          |

| Example 2                                                             |
|                                                                       |
| The St Aloysius Catholic College in Tasmania is an Other              |
| Unincorporated Entity but is a part of the Roman Catholic Trust       |
| Corporation of the Archdiocese of Hobart, which is a body corporate.  |
| It is therefore not an unincorporated association but simply an       |
| entity that is not incorporated because it belongs to a larger        |
| entity. See, Other entities, Religious organisations.                 |

| Example 3                                                             |
|                                                                       |
| Aboriginal Corporations incorporated under the Corporations           |
| (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander) Act 2006 (CATSI Act) will be  |
| marked as an Other Unincorporated Entity on Australian Business       |
| Number (ABN) Lookup. However, if the Business name includes the       |
| phrase Aboriginal Corporation it is likely to be incorporated under   |
| the CATSI Act. This can be confirmed by searching for the business on |
| the ORIC website. See Resources for a link. For further information   |
| see Companies.                                                        |
