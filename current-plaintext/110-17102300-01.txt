This document outlines how Service Officers can help customers unable to
successfully report employment income via self service. They may be
using their Centrelink online account, the Express Plus Centrelink
mobile app, or phone self service.

Possible reasons for difficulties

service because they:

    need to be reset)
-   have been manually excluded from this service
-   have changed their relationship status during the fortnight
-   are a job seeker receiving JobSeeker Payment (JSP), Youth Allowance
    (YA) or Parenting Payment Single (PPS) with mutual obligation
    requirements and have not met their requirements or finished their
    requirements as outlined in their Job Plan in the reporting period
    fortnight
-   are receiving Parenting Payment (PP) where they will be cancelling
    payment within 4 weeks
-   are receiving Carer Payment (CP) and have not included their
    activity test details
-   are receiving Carer Payment (XWP) and paid employment or other
    activity hours are more than 25 hours per week

    reporting
