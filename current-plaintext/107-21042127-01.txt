This document outlines information on how to prepare reports for
Medicare Recovery.

For Medicare Debt Management Officers (DMO) only.

Monthly Reconciliation

Medicare Recovery conducts monthly General Ledger (GL) account
reconciliation.

The following reports are required from SAP to verify reconciliation:

-   Ageing
-   Customer list
-   Customer transaction

Data is collated and the final report is sent to the Team leader for
quality assurance checking. This includes reconciliation for:

-   unidentified administered receipts
-   debt waiver
-   accounts receivables (various GL’s), and
-   provision for doubtful debts (where required)

The Team Leader:

-   provides the signoff, and
-   reports to the Cash Management and Reporting Services team

Change of GL account

To ensure transactions allocate to the correct GL account:

-    a transfer of the customer master record to the correct GL may be
    required
-    the customer’s account must have a $0 balance to allow the transfer
-   reversing or clearing any outstanding invoice/payment must take
    place first
