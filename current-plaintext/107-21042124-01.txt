This document outlines information on the types of Medicare program
debts and the recovery processes.

For Medicare Debt Management Officers (DMO) only

Patient debts (MBS)

Patient debts come to Medicare Recovery by:

-   voluntary acknowledgement direct from the customer
-   a Report Management Distribution System (RMDS) report from the
    Medicare Mainframe
-   a Debt Advice Notice (DAN) from the relevant program area

Provider bulk bill debts

Bulk billing is when a Medicare card holder assigns their MBS benefits
to the health professional. The health professional claims the Medicare
benefit directly on behalf of the patient for medical or allied health
services.

Private Health Fund debts

Simplified billing debts arise from incorrect claims submitted through
the Simplified billing (SB) claim channel. Private Health Insurers make
claims on behalf of the patient. Debts may be identified by the:

-   Health Insurer
-   Medical Practitioner, or
-   Services Australia

Medicare Compensation debt recovery

Some compensation payments are subject to reimbursement to Medicare. See
the Process page for details.

Program specific debts

Medicare recovers debt on behalf of the Department of Health and Aged
Care. Where a debt occurs, Medicare Recovery pursue repayment of these
debts.
