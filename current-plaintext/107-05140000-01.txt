Transferring debt repayments

Transfer a debt repayment to another debt if:

-   the debt is over recovered and the Debt Management Officer (DMO) has
    confirmed the amount is transferable to another debt
-   an identified system issue resulted in the repayment incorrectly
    applying to one debt when it should be on another debt

Refunding debt repayments

From October 2020, refunds for over recovered Child Care Subsidy (CCS)
debts are auto paid to the customer. The auto refund will be actioned
after:

-   7 days if the Repayment Source is 'Cheque' or 'Credit card'. Note: a
    manual refund can be processed if the customer contacts between 2
    and 7 days
-   2 days in all other cases

The manual refund process remains in place for all other over recovered
debts.

Refund a debt repayment to the customer if the:

-   debt is over recovered and the DMO has confirmed the amount is not
    transferable to another debt
-   customer requests a refund of their debt repayment and they are
    experiencing hardship due to exceptional and unforeseen
    circumstances
-   repayment was not correctly applied to the debt, due to an
    administrative error
-   agency identifies a business need and issues a directive to refund a
    repayment
