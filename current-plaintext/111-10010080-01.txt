This document outlines information about inbound desktop faxes from
third parties and the action to take if the faxes cannot be read or
used.

Desktop faxes

Inbound desktop faxes are generally sent by external contactors such as
employers and solicitors.

The faxed images are attached automatically or manually to customer
records. View them in Document Tools in Customer First.

If an image has been received by fax Services Australia will not have
the original document.

If a faxed image does not display clearly or is incomplete and cannot be
used for processing, the Service Officer must contact the sender to
obtain the required information, or to ask them to resend the fax.

The original fax should be deleted once the information or replacement
fax has been received. The Service Officer must complete and send an
Enterprise Content Records Management (ECRM) Action Request form to
request the deletion.

If unable to contact the original sender, Service Officers should seek
advice from a Service Support Officer (SSO) or other technical support
to decide what action is needed.

The Resources page contains links to the ECRM Deletion Request form and
Office Locator.
