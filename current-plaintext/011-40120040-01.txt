This document outlines information about call tracing for Medicare and
PBS telephony.

Call observation

Call observation takes place to improve call quality. Service Officers
should be given a choice on how and when call monitoring occurs, for
example, remote or in person monitoring.

The parties to a telephone conversation must have knowledge that the
conversation will be monitored, in accordance with the
Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979. Call monitoring must be
discontinued if and as soon as the caller objects.

Team Coaches are encouraged to use the Medicare Australia's Team Coach
Guide. This guide allows for a nationally consistent approach in call
assessment and allows for Team Coaches to rate Service Officers skills
and identify areas of improvement.

Call coaching in telephony processing teams

Call coaching occurs on a day-to-day basis. Formal coaching sessions
must be scheduled to ensure that Service Officers receive support in
developing their skills.
