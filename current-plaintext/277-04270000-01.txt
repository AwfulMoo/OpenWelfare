This document outlines the process where a payer has failed to pay the
initial payment due after registration (Initial Payment Defaulter –
IPD), or has defaulted on a payment after a period of compliance (First
Time Defaulter - FTD).

Payment defaulter

Undertaking timely action on payment defaults is an essential component
of effective case management on our collect cases. After investigating
the case contact the payer and request the immediate payment of the
outstanding amount in accordance with the debt repayment methodology.

If payment cannot be negotiated, pursue enforcement action including
employer withholding and collection through third parties via a
garnishee notice.

The Registrar is required to collect registered maintenance liabilities
by employer withholding from the payer's wage or salary if it is
practicable to do so. Some contractors are also subject to these
provisions. However, the Registrar can accept a payer's election to make
payments directly if the Registrar is satisfied the payments will be
made on time.

Where a customer has had an election for employer withholding not to
apply accepted, and the customer subsequently defaults on a payment,
employer withholding can occur without customer contact.

Consider the customer’s previous payment history and if special
circumstances apply, before establishing employer withholding without
customer contact.
