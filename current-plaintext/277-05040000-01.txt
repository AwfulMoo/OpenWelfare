This document outlines information about circumstances that may lead to
the ending of a Stage 1 child support case/liability. Links on this page
may be unavailable to external audiences.

Overview

When certain events occur, child, spousal or de facto maintenance orders
may cease to be in force and the case may end. When notification is
received about an event which may end a Stage 1 liability there is a
need to identify whether the order is still in force and whether any
changes are required to the case.
