|                                   | The most common condition that    |
|                                   | affects refugees is               |
|                                   | post-traumatic stress disorder.   |
|                                   | This develops in people who have  |
|                                   | experienced extreme emotional or  |
|                                   | physical stress. It is a normal   |
|                                   | reaction to an abnormal           |
|                                   | situation.                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Symptoms can fluctuate over time  |
|                                   | and increase during periods of    |
|                                   | stress. Symptoms include          |
|                                   | insomnia, panic attacks,          |
|                                   | hallucinations, impaired memory   |
|                                   | and concentration.                |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This can affect participation in  |
|                                   | employment and education. People  |
|                                   | affected may have trouble         |
|                                   | remembering an appointment or     |
|                                   | even being able to put their case |
|                                   | as to why they have not been able |
|                                   | to meet commitments.              |

|                                   | the behaviour associated with     |
|                                   | post-traumatic stress personally. |
|                                   | Periods of anger and hostility,   |
|                                   | or disinterest and withdrawal are |
|                                   | common amongst survivors of       |
|                                   | torture. Their feelings of anger  |
|                                   | are usually not directed at       |
|                                   | Service Officers, but are a       |
|                                   | result of their experiences.      |
|                                   | Often, acknowledgment of a        |
|                                   | survivor's anger at the situation |
|                                   | they find themselves in may help. |

|                                   | making eye contact and using a    |

|                                   | comfortable with eye contact so   |
|                                   | do not force it.                  |
