Remediating issues when the letter has not been issued between the Quarterly Review (QR) period

Table 3: This table describes the steps to take when the Income Tested
Care Fee (ITCF) amount has been correctly applied in the Aged Care
Management Payment System (ACMPS) between the QR periods, but no letter
has been issued to the aged care service.

This process applies to:

-   ITCF queries for the pre-delimiter period (before 1 January 2020)
    and/or deceased care recipients, and
-   cases where the ITCF has been applied correctly in the Fees and
    Charges tab and the payment statement

Services Officers from the Aged Care Payments Team (Aged Care and Allied
Health Branch) can action.
