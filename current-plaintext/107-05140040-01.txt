Payment schedules

Payment schedules apply to regular payment arrangements. Payment methods
include:

-   cash
-   direct debit or
-   a non-percentage regular garnishee

Any payment/s not paid in full or not paid at all show as ‘Part’ or
‘Due’ on the schedule.

Debt Management Officers are able to mark a payment as 'payment missed'.
This can occur before or after the payment due date. Once a direct debit
arrangement breaks, due payments cannot be missed. A new arrangement is
required.

If there is more than one arrangement in place:

-   a message will display advising there is another current arrangement
-   the payment details of the other arrangement are not included on
    this payment schedule
