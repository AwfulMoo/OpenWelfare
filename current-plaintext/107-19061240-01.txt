For staff in Compliance and Debt Operations only.

This documents outlines information on processing Manual Follow-up (MFU)
tax activities for Advance recoveries.

Advance payment

An Advance payment is paid as a Basic component of a customer’s
entitlement. This must be reported on their payment summary. The system
will reduce the Basic paid on the amended payment summary when the debt
is paid.

If the Advance recovery is taken from a non-reportable component, a
negative amount will display on the payment summary. The Service Officer
must investigate and resolve the issue.

Actioning MFU tax activities

If a MFU tax activity displays on the customer record the payment
summary will not issue.

Correct any negative amount(s) on the MFU tax activity, and issue a
payment summary.

Compliance and Debt Operations (CDO) debt staff have access to the
‘Change’ function on the Tax Payment Summary (TXGS) screen. CDO debt
staff will process Advance recovery corrections.
