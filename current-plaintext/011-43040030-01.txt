This document outlines how Service Officers reverse a Medicare claim for
bulk bill later day adjustments (LDA). Note: as at 1 July 2016 Norfolk
Island is covered under Medicare provisions.

Reverse an adjusted claim

The DHRI transaction allows the update of an adjusted claim to be
reversed on the same date of processing.

The transaction does not delete the claim but changes the claim status
from ADJ HIST, ADJ OPAY or ADJ PAID to ADJUST.

Using the DHAI transaction the claim can be recalled from pend to be
reassessed.

Claims with a status of ADJ PAID, ADJ OPAY or ADJ HIST cannot be
reversed if the date of processing is different to the date the claim
was updated. This is because the claim has passed through overnight
processing and the details of the claim have been reconciled.

If an attempt is made to reverse the update of a claim on a date not
equal to the date of processing, the system returns the error message
3-STATUS.
