|                                   | For example, secured creditors    |
|                                   | are repaid before unsecured       |
|                                   | creditors. On wind up, if any     |

|                                   | liquidation, the aim is to        |

|                                   | liquidation includes realising    |

|                                   | solvent company may provide a     |
