|                                   | Notional Assessment (PNA) is      |
|                                   | created. The PNA is not           |
|                                   | transmitted to Centrelink via the |

|                                   | PNA period, Child Support will    |
|                                   | transfer the actual agreement     |
|                                   | amount, which will show as an     |

|                                   | parent at least 23 days from the  |
|                                   | date the PNA is issued to seek a  |
|                                   | variation to the PNA. The PNA     |
|                                   | becomes a Notional Assessment     |
|                                   | (NA) 23 days after the PNA is     |
|                                   | issued, or, if an application for |
|                                   | variation is made, on the day     |
|                                   | Child Support vary the PNA or     |
|                                   | refuse to vary the PNA. Once the  |
|                                   | PNA becomes an NA, Child Support  |
|                                   | will transmit the Notional        |
|                                   | Assessment to Centrelink via the  |
