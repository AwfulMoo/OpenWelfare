This document outlines how the FAO Income for Previous Year Copy (FIPY
Copy) and Parental Income Test Copy (PIT Copy) process occurs for
dependent Youth Allowance (YA), ABSTUDY and Assistance for Isolated
Children (AIC) scheme customers.

FIPY Copy and PIT Copy

The FIPY Copy and PIT Copy processes generate when family assistance
actual income data is re-used from a parent or guardian's record. These
processes occur:

-   during YA. ABSTUDY and AIC claim processing, known as FIPY Copy, and
-   from 1 July to 31 December every year when confirmed parental income
    is received from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) for the Youth
    Allowance and ABSTUDY annual parental income review, and the AIC End
    of Year review processes, known as PIT Copy

If a parent/guardian has a family assistance non-lodger exemption, they
must provide Services Australia with their parental income details,
including if their taxable income is below the Tax Free Threshold, via
the:

-   Advise Parental Income online service
-   MOD JY - Parent(s)/Guardian(s) details - for the BASE Tax Year and
    CURRENT Tax Year for Dependent Youth Allowance or ABSTUDY Customers
    form, or
-   SY012, Youth Allowance or ABSTUDY Parental Income Assessment
-   Group 17 AIC End of Year review or SY040 Claim for AIC

Reason FIPY Copy occurs

FIPY Copy occurs during the new claim processing, where the actual
parental income (if available) is automatically imported onto a
dependent customer's record from the family assistance record, to assist
with more efficient claim processing.

Parents and guardians will still need to complete and lodge their
details via the Advise Parental Income online service, MOD JY, or SY040,
as this collects information other than parental income that could
affect the rate of payment or whether YA, ABSTUDY or AIC is payable. For
example:

-   family home address for Relocation Scholarship purposes
-   parent/guardian marital status
-   parent/guardian contact details
-   whether a current year assessment needs to apply due to a drop in
    income
-   voluntary maintenance arrangements
-   rent details
-   details for other dependent children
-   bank account details (for under 18 year old customers)
-   tax file number declaration

FIPY Copy is sufficient to verify the parental income components
provided by the parent/guardian via the Advise Parental Income online
service, MOD JY or SY040.

The FIPY Copy process will only occur when:

-   there is a current PIT link
-   the customer is claiming YA, ABSTUDY or AIC, and
-   the parent(s)/guardian(s) record has verified actual income from the
    ATO

FIPY Copy will occur when the PIT links have been established within a
claim. For claims processed in:

-   Process Direct, a FIPY Copy will import available parental income
    data from FAO to the Manage Parental Income (NHI) table
-   Customer First or Customer Record, a FIPY Copy will import available
    parental income data from FAO to the Household Income and Assets
    (NHI) screen when the PIT links are created or confirmed from the
    PIT Parent Selection (NPPS) screen

For more information on when a parent/guardian (and their partner) is
required to supply their income details for a claim, see Completing
Parent(s)/Guardian(s) details for the Base Tax Year and Current Tax Year
(MOD JY).

Reason PIT Copy occurs

From 1 July to 31 December each year, the actual parental income
recorded on a Family Assistance parent or guardian's record, for the
most recently completed financial year will be copied to the dependent
YA, ABSTUDY or AIC customer's record. This occurs where the dependent
customer is currently being assessed on base tax year actual income
details only (that is, not a base or current tax year estimate).

A PIT Copy will only occur when:

-   a dependent YA, ABSTUDY or AIC payment is current, suspended or
    assessed
-   there is no estimated parental income currently recorded on the NHI
    screen
-   a parent/guardian, of a dependent customer, received Family Tax
    Benefit or Child Care Benefit in the most recently completed
    financial year
-   all assessable parents are PIT linked to the dependent customer and
    have finalised their income tax returns and the ATO have returned
    this data to the parent(s)/guardian(s) FIPY screen
-   the ATO assessed actual income is greater than zero for a single
    parent/guardian or for both parents/guardians if they are both PIT
    linked
-   the Maintenance Paid field on the NHI screen from the previous base
    tax year is zero

Note: if a customer is linked to two parents/guardians, a PIT Copy will
only occur when both parents/guardians have had their income tax returns
finalised by the ATO and both sets of income data have been returned to
both parent/guardian records. If one parent/guardian has had their tax
return finalised by the ATO, and the other has not, a PIT Copy will not
occur.

Reason PIT Copy does not occur

The PIT Copy process does not occur when:

there is no current PIT link

the benefit status is cancelled

a parental income estimate is coded for the relevant financial year

the customer is independent

the Maintenance Paid field on the NHI screen has a figure greater than
zero

NHI has already been coded with the same details as those recorded on
the FIPY screen for the relevant financial year

the parents' or guardians' income data has not yet been confirmed by the
ATO

the following income is recorded on the FIPY screen or the relevant
Family Assistance screens for the appropriate tax year:

-   Tax Exempt Foreign Income (FEF screen)
-   Foreign Income (FFI screen)
-   Tax Free Pension/Benefit (FTF screen)
-   Deductible Child Maintenance Expenditure (FDM screen)

PIT Copy process for YA customers that have been suspended for not returning their annual PIT review form (SUS-YAR)

If a YA customer has been suspended for failing to return their annual
PIT review (SUS-YAR), the system will continue to check and see if a PIT
Copy can be undertaken during the suspension period. If, during the
suspension period, the system is able to successfully undertake a PIT
Copy, the parental income data will be copied to the customer's record
and an automatic restoration will occur.

PIT Copy process from 1 January

Where:

-   a YA customer's parent/guardian has not completed the annual PIT
    review, and a PIT Copy was not able to occur before the end of the
    last entitlement period of the year, the customer's payment will
    CAN-PIA (Parental Income and Assets Not Provided) from the
    Entitlement Period Start Date immediately before or on 1 January
-   an ABSTUDY customer's parent/guardian has not completed the annual
    PIT review, and a PIT Copy was not able to occur before 1 January,
    the customer's payment will go to a zero rate from 1 January
-   An AIC applicant has not provided parental income in the End of Year
    review, and a PIT Copy was not able to occur before 1 January, the
    applicant will no longer receive Additional Boarding Allowance

These payments will not automatically restore, including when sufficient
parental income (for a PIT Copy to occur) becomes available on the FIPY
screen, for:

-   YA determine whether the payment can be restored because sufficient
    parental income (for a PIT Copy to occur) became available within 13
    weeks of the cancellation decision
-   ABSTUDY, the parental income can be recorded from information
    obtained from the parent/guardian. Parental income can be updated on
    the NHI screen, which will result in a reassessment of the ABSTUDY
    record
-   AIC, the parental income can be updated on the NHI screen when
    obtained from the applicant and staff will need to follow Dealing
    with Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) applicant enquiries
    about End of Year (EOY) review forms

Verification of the parental income is not required for annual PIT
reviews. Data from FIPY can be used providing parent/guardian is asked
whether they receive any of the following income in the relevant tax
year:

-   Foreign Income
-   Tax Free Pension/Benefit
-   Maintenance Paid

PIT Copy Manual Follow Up (MFU)

A PIT Copy manual follow up (CLI/MFU) will be created on the YA, ABSTUDY
or AIC record, where a:

-   PIT Copy has previously occurred
-   the ATO sends new income data to the FIPY screen due to a
    reassessment of an income tax return

Unfavourable decisions

When making an unfavourable decision, speak to the customer:

-   explain the decision
-   give them a chance to provide more information, and
-   advise their review and appeal rights
