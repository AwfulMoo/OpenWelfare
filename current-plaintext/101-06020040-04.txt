Agreements and arrangements

Services Australia's relationships with other government departments are
bound by a high level multilateral strategic partnership document and
several detailed Bilateral Management Arrangements (BMA), each between
the Services Australia and individual departments.

BMAs specify Commonwealth services to be provided by the Services
Australia and conditions applying to the provision of those services.
They improve assurance arrangements to provide greater transparency over
the Services Australia's performance in meeting service delivery
outcomes, risk management and accuracy targets.

See Department of Social Services (DSS) Relationship Team.
