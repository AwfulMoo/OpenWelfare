Basic eligibility criteria for AGDRP and ex-gratia DRP claims

Table 3: This table describes the steps to assess basic eligibility for
AGDRP/ex-gratia DRP for those affected by Far North Queensland Floods,
February 2019. Service Officers should not process a claim unless they
have completed formal training. Note: if a customer is not eligible for
AGDRP/ex-gratia DRP claims are still to be recorded and the outcome
noted as rejected. Claims cannot be rejected until formal approval has
been provided. Staff will be notified via an Operational Message once
they are able to reject payments.

Basic eligibility criteria for DRA/ex-gratia DRA

Table 4: This table describes the steps to assess basic eligibility for
DRA/ex-gratia DRA for those affected by Far North Queensland Floods,
February 2019. Service Officers should not process a claim unless they
have completed formal training. Note: if a customer is not eligible for
DRA/ex-gratia DRA claims are still to be recorded and the outcome noted
as rejected. Claims cannot be rejected until formal approval has been
provided. Staff will be notified via an Operational Message once they
are able to reject payments.
