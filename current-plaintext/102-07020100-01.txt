This document outlines whether an AIC applicant can continue to receive
Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) for a student who becomes
incapacitated. When a student becomes incapacitated but is still
considered to be a full time student by their educational institution,
they remain eligible for AIC payment.

The purpose of AIC

Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) is available for primary,
secondary and certain tertiary students who are unable to attend an
appropriate state school due to geographic isolation, or special
health-related or educational needs. The purpose of AIC is to recognise
that families living in areas without access to appropriate schools
incur additional costs in the education of their children.

The Resources page contains links to further information about
Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme (AIC), on the Services Australia
website, and, links to the Claim form for AIC (SY040).
