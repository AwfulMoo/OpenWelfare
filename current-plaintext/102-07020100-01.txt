This document outlines whether an AIC applicant can continue to receive
Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) for a student who becomes
incapacitated.

Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC)

AIC is payable in respect of students who undertake approved studies and
are isolated from their nearest appropriate state school or meet special
needs or deemed isolated criteria.

Students must satisfy the eligibility conditions for AIC and they and
the applicant should assess the most beneficial alternative payments
that may be available.

When a student becomes incapacitated but is still considered to be a
full time student by their educational institution, the applicant
remains eligible for AIC payment.

The Resources page contains links to further information about
Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme (AIC), on the Services Australia
website, and, links to the Claim form for AIC (SY040).
