This document outlines how to add, amend and view Sensitive Information
Indicators in CDMS.

Sensitive Information Indicators

Sensitive Information Indicators identify customers with various
circumstances who need additional support and understanding.

The indicators:

-   improve staff awareness of a customer's personal situation, and
-   support the delivery of safe and respectful services

Staff can access Sensitive Information Indicators in the CDMS through:

-   Amend, or
-   Inquire on Consumer Details

There are 11 Sensitive Information Indicators grouped into 5 categories:

Care of a child:

-   Care of a child

Communication:

-   Hearing and speech
-   Interpreter language

Identity:

-   Password for enquiries

Safety:

-   Family and domestic violence
-   Serious privacy concerns

Service:

-   Complaint
-   Customer incident
-   Full service restrictions
-   Partial service restrictions
-   Urgent Medicare benefit paid

Service Officers must continue checking comments in the Comments tab as:

-   a customer may present with circumstances not captured as a
    Sensitive Information Indicator
-   comments in the Comments tab are not converted into Sensitive
    Information Indicators automatically

Sensitive Information alert and pop up table

The Sensitive Information alert prompts Service Officers to check
Sensitive Information Indicators for a person or group.

The alert displays:

-   in Personal, upon selecting a customer with an active indicator
-   in Group, upon entering a record where at least one member has an
    active indicator

The Sensitive Information pop up table shows a summary of active
indicators. This can be accessed by selecting the Sensitive Information
Yes link from the:

-   Consumers table in Personal
-   Members Details tab in Group

The Sensitive Information tab shows detailed information about
indicators, including the end date.

Once the end date is reached, the indicator:

-   will no longer trigger the Sensitive Information alert
-   will not be displayed in the Sensitive Information pop up table
-   can only be viewed in the Sensitive Information tab in Inquire

Service Officer role

Service Officers must add a Sensitive Information Indicator if any of
the 11 Sensitive Information Indicators apply to the customer’s
circumstances. This will alert other Service Officers:

-   about the customer’s circumstances, and
-   to support them in protecting the customer’s safety, privacy and
    dignity

If a customer has a Sensitive Information alert on their record, Service
Officers must:

-   check the indicators immediately after authenticating the customer
    as the customer may have a password for enquiries
-   only check indicators for the customer being served and their
    dependent children under 15 years
-   not discuss indicators about other people on the Medicare card

Service Officers must amend or end date the relevant indicator if:

-   the customer advises a change in their circumstances. For example,
    they no longer need an interpreter
-   the agency receives information indicating a change in
    circumstances. For example, the informal care of a child becomes a
    formal care arrangement
-   the indicator is no longer appropriate. For example, a complaint is
    resolved

Note: to avoid causing distress or offence to a customer, do not ask a
customer if their hearing and speech difficulties have changed.

If a customer is in need of specialist support, Service Officers can:

-   consult with an internal specialist
-   offer referrals to available resources, supports or other service
    providers for help

Privacy

Service Officers must only access Sensitive Information Indicators for
the customer being served and their dependent children under 15 years.

Do not discuss the indicators with other people on their Medicare card.

Inappropriate management of details in the Sensitive Information
Indicators may be a breach of privacy law, secrecy provisions or duties
of confidentiality. Serious consequences may occur:

-   for Services Australia, and
-   for the affected customers

For example, the disclosure of indicators about family and domestic
violence to a customer’s family members may undermine the customers’
physical safety and emotional wellbeing.

Family and domestic violence

Service Officers must assure customers that the agency will keep private
information they provide about family and domestic violence concerns.

This will:

-   minimise customer distress
-   give customers clarity about the information on their record, and
-   allows them to ask questions about their privacy, if they have any
    concerns
