This document outlines assessing itinerant families for ABSTUDY away
from home rate.

Itinerant family

ABSTUDY students may be approved for away from home entitlements where:

-   the parent(s) or guardian(s) occupations require them to spend at
    least 40 weeknights during the calendar year travelling long
    distances and as a result the children have no fixed residence, or
-   the occupation of the parent(s) or guardian(s) involves frequent,
    lengthy travel and the student is denied access to appropriate
    schooling because the parent(s) or guardian(s) are not normally
    resident at a fixed location during the school week, such as the
    sole parent is an interstate truck driver

Where the student has 2 parents or guardians, both need to be itinerant
for the student to be eligible. If 1 parent or guardian has a stable
location, the family is not considered itinerant.

Constant family movements

ABSTUDY secondary school students may also be approved for away from
home entitlements where:

-   the family is constantly relocating due to personal or occupational
    demands:
-   the student boards away from home, and
-   for at least half the school year, on a monthly, weekly or daily
    basis, the student’s permanent home address is such that the student
    would not have reasonable access to that school

Occupations that may require constant movement include:

-   fencing contractors
-   railway workers
-   fruit pickers
-   shearers
-   performers and show workers

'Occupation’ is a person’s regular work or profession, job or principal
activity. Any activity a person spends time on can be considered their
occupation.

Temporary movement for employment

Where families are not normally itinerate but are moved temporarily in
their employment or must move several times throughout the year in
search of employment, away from home entitlements may be approved to
enable the student to avoid frequent changes of school.

Temporary family residence at location of student

If a family temporarily resides in the location of where the student is
boarding or spends time in this location as part of their regular
movements, the following applies:

-   where it would be reasonable to expect the student to cease boarding
    and rejoin their parent(s)/guardian(s), whether on an extended basis
    or for short periods on a regular basis, boarding benefits are not
    payable for those periods, and
-   where the student cannot attend the school except as a boarder, or
    the school would charge full boarding fees anyway, the student
    remains eligible for the away from home rate

Permanent residence during a school year

Where the family has been accepted as itinerate for a year but takes up
permanent residence during the course of that year at a fixed address
which provides access to suitable schooling, the student will remain
eligible for the remainder of the year, providing continuity of study
rules are met.

Ineligibility for away from home rate

A student cannot be approved for the away from home rate if either:

-   their family could be reasonably expected to maintain a fixed
    address because the movement required by working is over a limited
    area, such as within the metropolitan area or at no time more than
    56km from 1 centre offering adequate schooling
-   the parents’ occupation requires a transfer every 2 or 3 years and
    the family could normally expect to spend at least 1 full year in a
    location but happens to be moved more than once in a school year

Claiming

Away from Home rate can be claimed:

-   for new customers, via the ABSTUDY Claim Form B, or
-   for existing customers, via a statement (verbal or written)
    indicating the criteria under which they are seeking approval

Tertiary students impacted by COVID-19

During the COVID-19 pandemic which occurred in Australia from March
2020, some students were required to leave their on campus term
accommodation. Many students also transitioned to online study as
face-to-face teaching was unavailable.

Students who were receiving the away from home rate, and temporarily
transitioned to online learning as a result of COVID-19, remain eligible
for the away from home rate. Tertiary students must return to
face-to-face study as soon as it becomes available to continue to be
eligible for the away from home rate.

Where a student had to move out of education provider accommodation
(such as on campus) and are, or were temporarily staying with their
parents, will remain eligible for the away from home rate providing
they:

-   remain enrolled in their course of study, and
-   intend to return to their campus accommodation as soon as the
    education provider allows them to return

This includes students who:

-   had their accommodation arrangement cancelled by the education
    provider and have moved their belongings out of that accommodation
-   were approved for the Residential Cost Option (RCO)

Note: the away from home rate of ABSTUDY Living Allowance can be paid
for any period that the education provider does not charge a residential
fee, rather than the reduced rate of Living Allowance.

Unfavourable decisions

When making an unfavourable decision, speak to the customer:

-   explain the decision
-   give them a chance to provide more information, and
-   advise their review and appeal rights
