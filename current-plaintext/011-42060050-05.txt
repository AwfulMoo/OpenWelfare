| Example A                         | When 2 surgeons act in both roles |
|                                   | (principal/specialist surgeon),   |
|                                   | e.g. Surgeon A is performing item |
|                                   | 45564 on the right breast and     |
|                                   | item 45565 on the left breast,    |
|                                   | and Surgeon B is performing 45565 |
|                                   | on the right breast and 45564 on  |
|                                   | the left breast.                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Question: Can a surgeon be both a |
|                                   | principal and conjoint surgeon on |
|                                   | the same occasion with respect to |

|                                   | Answer: Yes. As this claim        |
|                                   | applies to the bi-lateral         |
|                                   | reconstruction of the breast,     |
|                                   | there is no issue with the        |
|                                   | surgeons claiming the principal   |
|                                   | surgeon item (45564) on 1 side    |
|                                   | and the conjoint surgeon item     |
|                                   | (45565) on the other. The 2       |

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Example A                         | The surgeon is claiming item      |
|                                   | 51021x2 and 51041x2. They have    |
|                                   | stated they are using a different |
|                                   | approach, e.g. right and left     |
|                                   | approach when performing the      |
|                                   | fixation of motion segment with   |
|                                   | vertebral body screw.             |

|                                   | Question: Can the surgeon claim   |
|                                   | items 51021x2 and 51041x2, by     |
|                                   | providing text/notation stating   |
|                                   | that a different approach was     |
|                                   | used, e.g. right and left         |
|                                   | approach when performing the      |
|                                   | fixation of motion segment?       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: No. Items 51021 and 51041 |
|                                   | should not be claimed more than   |
|                                   | once for a single operation. The  |
|                                   | surgeon should bill the most      |
|                                   | clinically relevant item,         |
|                                   | determined by the number of       |
|                                   | motion segments operated on, and  |
|                                   | the method of exposure, e.g.      |
|                                   | open, microscopic, minimally      |
|                                   | invasive, lateral, bilateral,     |
|                                   | navigated has no relevance.       |
