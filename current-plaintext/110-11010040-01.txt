This document explains when and how critical decisions are recorded
during fraud investigations.

Direction of investigation

The Australian Government Investigations Standards (AGIS) states that
critical decisions are those decisions made during an investigation that
lead to a significant change of direction in the investigation,
resources involved in the investigation, or any decision that may impact
on the investigation achieving its stated outcomes.

These decisions can arise as a result of external developments, evidence
that has or has not been obtained, or change of strategy.

Substantiating decisions

Services Australia is committed to ensuring that significant decisions
made during an investigation are defensible and clearly articulate why
the proposed course of action was taken. This will provide assurance
that decision makers are accountable for the quality and integrity of
their actions and any decisions made are done so transparently and with
the appropriate level of managerial oversight.

All critical decisions made during an investigation should be made by an
appropriate officer and documented on the investigation record or file.

Approval

Critical decisions require management approval before the proposed
action is implemented. Depending on the decision, approval sits with
either the Senior Investigator/ Approver of Investigations or the
Regional Investigation Operations Meetings. Critical decision points and
responsibility for approval.
