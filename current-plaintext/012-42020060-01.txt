This document outlines information about the recognition of additional
mental health training in focussed psychological strategies (FPS).

Focussed psychological strategies

FPS are specific mental health care management strategies, derived from
evidence based psychological therapies.

Recognition of a medical practitioner's additional skills and ongoing
training in FPS are important elements of maintaining high quality
standards within the provision of FPS for assessed mental disorders.

Eligibility for Recognition

For recognition to claim or bill for FPS services for Medicare purposes,
the medical practitioner must satisfy the requirements for higher level
mental health training and skills as determined by the General Practice
Mental Health Standards Collaboration (GPMHSC).

Specialists and consultant physicians are not eligible for FPS
recognition.

Notification that a medical practitioner has completed additional
training in FPS is received directly from the GPMHSC.

Access to Medicare

Recognition as a medical practitioner trained in FPS for Medicare
purposes allows the medical practitioner to access relevant FPS items in
the MBS.

Continued access to FPS MBS items requires the medical practitioner to
continue to meet the eligibility requirements as detailed in the Health
Insurance (General Medical Services Table) Regulations 2021.

Application for Recognition

Medical practitioners who have determined by the GPMHSC as trained in
FPS do not need to submit an application to Services Australia directly.
The GPMHSC will notify Services Australia that the medical practitioner
meets the training and skill requirements.

The Resources page contains contact information for the GPMHSC.

Legislation Recognising Focussed Psychological Strategies

Recognition of a medical practitioner for FPS is made by the Chief
Executive Medicare (or their delegate) under the Health Insurance
(General Medical Services Table) Regulations 2021 and Health Insurance
(Section 3C General Medical Services Other Medical Practitioner)
Determination 2018 made under the Health Insurance Act 1973.

Recognition is recorded on the medical practitioner's stem on the
Provider Directory System (PDS).

The References page contains a link to the regulation.

Removal of Recognition

Where a medical practitioner is no longer eligible to access FPS items,
GPMHSC will notify Services Australia directly.

Disputes about recognition
