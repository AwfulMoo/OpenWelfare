This page contains a list of schools with special programs approved for
the away from home rate of ABSTUDY. Students studying at these schools
must be enrolled in the special program to qualify for the away from
home rate due to needing to attend a special course. This means that
students attending the school who are not studying the specific special
program will not qualify for the away from home rate for this reason.

There have been significant changes made to the 2017 list. As a result,
there are a number of special courses/programs that are no longer
approved. Where a student was previously approved in 2016 for the away
from home rate due to being enrolled in special course/program, the
student will continue to be eligible under the continuity of ABSTUDY
away from home criteria if they are still enrolled in the program.
