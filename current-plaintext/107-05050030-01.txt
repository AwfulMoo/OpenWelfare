This document outlines information for Compensation Recovery Team (CRT)
about the application of a garnishee to a customer's compensation
settlement to recover a debt.

Garnishee from compensation payments

Review customer records carefully before applying a garnishee. The CRT
must make a reasonable effort to contact the customer before placing a
garnishee.

Garnishee recovery:

-   can occur whether or not there is a social security charge from the
    compensation payment
-   can include all outstanding debts payable by the customer from any
    remaining compensation payment

The CRT must send a covering letter with the garnishee notice stating
the garnishee is a separate matter to the compensation charge.
