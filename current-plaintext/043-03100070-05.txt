|                                   | charter business. The yachts from |
|                                   | the charter business are serviced |
|                                   | by using the marine slipway.      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The marine slipway business makes |
|                                   | an overall loss, while the yacht  |
|                                   | charter business makes an         |
|                                   | assessable profit.                |

|                                   | Only the portion of the losses of |
|                                   | the marine slipway business that  |
|                                   | relate to the specific yachts     |
|                                   | serviced from the yacht charter   |
|                                   | business can be offset against    |
|                                   | the assessable profit from the    |
|                                   | yacht charter business. If the    |
|                                   | marine slipway had serviced 100   |
|                                   | yachts, three of which are from   |
|                                   | the yacht charter business, only  |
|                                   | the part of the loss relating to  |
|                                   | the slipway's expense of          |
|                                   | servicing those three yachts, can |
|                                   | be offset against the profit of   |
|                                   | the yacht charter business.       |

|                                   | Bill and Joan own a farm which is |
|                                   | held by their family trust. The   |
|                                   | trust is attributed 50% each to   |
|                                   | Bill and Joan. Their partnership  |
|                                   | operates the farming enterprise,  |
|                                   | and pays lease income to the      |
|                                   | trust of $10,000, and the trust   |
|                                   | consequently makes a profit of    |
|                                   | $10,000. However, the partnership |
|                                   | pays the land rates for the       |
|                                   | property of $2,000 and a loss of  |
|                                   | $2,000 was distributed to Bill    |
|                                   | and Joan ($1,000 each). The       |
|                                   | attribution income is reduced by  |
|                                   | $1,000 each from the partnership  |
|                                   | loss; $4,000 each is attributed   |
|                                   | to Bill and Joan.                 |

|                                   | Bill and Joan are partners in a   |
|                                   | farm business which is run on a   |

|                                   | family trust that is attributed   |
|                                   | 100% to Bill. Their partnership   |
|                                   | operates the farming enterprise,  |
|                                   | and pays lease income to the      |
|                                   | trust of $10,000 and the trust    |
|                                   | consequently makes a profit of    |
|                                   | $10,000. However, the partnership |
|                                   | pays land rates for the property  |
|                                   | of $2,000 and a loss of $2,000    |
|                                   | was distributed to Bill and Joan  |
|                                   | ($1,000 each). The attribution    |
|                                   | income to Bill is reduced by      |
|                                   | $1,000 from Bill's partnership    |
|                                   | loss, $9,000 is attributed to     |
|                                   | Bill. Joan's $1,000 loss from the |
|                                   | partnership cannot reduce the     |
|                                   | attributed income as Joan is a    |
