|                                   | example makes is that a home is   |

|                                   | stakeholder(s) who reside in the  |

|                                   | which their home is situated. The |
|                                   | home, valued at $100,000, would   |
|                                   | be an exempt asset, but only for  |

|                                   | home, valued at $100,000, would   |

|                                   | that was borrowed to purchase the |
|                                   | whole farm, the assessment would  |
|                                   | change. The liability would be    |
|                                   | apportioned so that only the      |

|                                   | This also applies where the       |
|                                   | customer's home is owned by an    |
|                                   | entity (trust or company) of      |
|                                   | which he is a controller.         |

|                                   | adjusted before being attributed  |
|                                   | to that controller.               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | However, no adjustment is made    |
|                                   | for controllers whose principal   |

|                                   | by the entity. Appropriate coding |
|                                   | will ensure that each controller  |

|                                   | Colin and Diana. The trust owns   |
|                                   | one property, on which are two    |
|                                   | homes. The property is worth      |
|                                   | $1,000,000 in total and there is  |
