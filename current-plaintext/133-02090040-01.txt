The Process page explains when customers cannot submit their claim
online.

Submitting a claim

The quickest and easiest way for customers to receive their Medicare
benefit is by asking their doctor to submit the claim for them. The
customer will get their Medicare benefit paid into their bank account.

If this service is not available, the customer can submit their claim
online. They can do this if they have set up access to Medicare self
service (online account or app).

Note: digital self service claims for items more than $9,999.99 must be
submitted using a Medicare claim (MS014). The Resources page has a link
to MS014.

The Resources page contains links to more information and support. It
also explains upload error messages for the app.
