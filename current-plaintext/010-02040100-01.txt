This document outlines how to assess and record a student or Australian
Apprentice's independence for ABSTUDY if they have Special Adult Status
in a traditional community.

Independence criteria

Students or Australian Apprentices applying for ABSTUDY are considered
independent if they have Special Adult Status in a traditional
community.

This category of independence is permanent. Once granted, the student or
Australian Apprentice remains eligible for independent status for this
claim, and any other claims for ABSTUDY. For example, they remain
eligible for independence if they move outside the community after being
granted independence under the Special Adult Status criteria.
