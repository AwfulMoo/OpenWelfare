Example of new agreement request

On 15 August, Jennie requests entry into a new Voluntary Income
Management agreement. The Service Officer checks her record and notices
Jennie exited Voluntary Income Management on 1 August.

As it has been less than 21 days since Jennie's last Voluntary Income
Management Agreement ended, she will need to wait a further six days
before she can enter into a new Voluntary Income Management Agreement.
