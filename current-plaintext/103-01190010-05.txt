Example of new agreement request

On 28 August 2023, Jenny requested to enter into a new VIM Agreement
with the agency. The Service Officer saw that Jenny had terminated her
previous VIM Agreement on 15 August 2023. As it was less than 21 days
since Jenny terminated that agreement, the Service Officer told Jenny
she needed to wait a further seven days before she could enter into
another agreement.

However, due to the closure of the IM program to new entrants on 4
September 2023, when Jenny became eligible to enter into a new agreement
on 5 September 2023, she entered into a voluntary enhanced IM agreement
with the agency. Therefore, she started participating in the enhanced IM
program under the VeIM measure. She could no longer choose to enter into
a VIM Agreement and participate in the IM program under the VIM measure.
