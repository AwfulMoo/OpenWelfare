This document outlines how periodic compensation recovery occurs for
customers who are partnered and one member of the couple receives an
arrears of periodic compensation payment. The Compensation Recovery Team
(CRT) will send recovery notices when the payment falls under the
compensation provisions of social security law.

Recovery of payments

Partner payments can only be recovered if:

-   the compensation recipient has received a Compensation Affected
    Payment (CAP) during the periodic payment period
-   the compensation recipient is partnered when the arrears is
    received, and
-   the compensation payer is under a preliminary notice

Payments received by former partners cannot be recovered.

A single social security charge is sent to the compensation payer which
includes recovery of payments received by the partner and the
compensation recipient during the arrears period:

Charge notices are sent to compensation payers who have:

-   yet to release the arrears payment, or
-   received a preliminary notice before they paid the compensation

Separate recovery notices

Separate recovery notices must be sent to both the customer and their
partner in the following situation:

-   the compensation payer was not on notice and
-   the recipient was in receipt of a CAP at the date of the compensable
    incident compensation arrears charge is sent to the customer under
    section 1184I and raised under Section 1223(1)
