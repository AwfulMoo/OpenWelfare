|                                   |     differs from state to state.  |

|                                   |     Generally the customer will   |

|                                   |     the land it sits on (site fee |
|                                   |     or lease arrangement). These  |
|                                   |     homes can be bought and sold  |
|                                   |     like a residential house if   |
