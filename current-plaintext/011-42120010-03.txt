This page contains the relevant procedures to process composite items.

Process composite and not composite items

When a composite situation is detected, the system displays the message
6-CMP. The composite item that needs to be paid is shown as part of the
message (for example, 6-CMP58112) and the individual items that form the
composite item are highlighted.

When the Service Officer presses [Enter], the system calculates the
Medicare benefit payable and the payment process continues in the normal
manner.

Process composite items where services are composite or individual

This table describes how Service Officers process composite and not
composite services.
