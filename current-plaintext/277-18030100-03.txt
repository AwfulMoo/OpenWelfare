|                                   | An agreement may have a clause    |
|                                   | that allows the roles of payee    |

|                                   | care changes. The role swap       |
|                                   | clause will be activated when the |
|                                   | level of care (as specified in    |
|                                   | the agreement) is applied in the  |
|                                   | assessment. This could be when    |
|                                   | the payee ceases to be an         |
|                                   | eligible carer or when they have  |

|                                   | by the agreement will then become |

|                                   | 65% or lower. For example, the    |
|                                   | agreement cannot provide that the |
|                                   | roles will swap if the payee has  |
|                                   | a care percentage at or below 80% |
|                                   | as this would mean the other      |
|                                   | parent could have 20% care and    |
|                                   | they would not be an eligible     |
