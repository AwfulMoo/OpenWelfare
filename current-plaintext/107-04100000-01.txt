This document outlines information about raising Child Care Benefit
(CCB) debts before the 2018/2019 financial year.

On this Page:

CCB approved care debts

All debts of CCB for approved care are raised after the end of the year
reconciliation process.

CCB approved care debts can be identified in the following ways:

-   Through the reconciliation process, for example customers over or
    under estimating their income
-   By the individual, Approved Child Care Organisation (ACO) or child
    care service notifying Services Australia that the customer/child's
    circumstances have changed

CCB for registered care is not subject to the reconciliation process.
Potential overpayments are not been triggered by the system and must be
raised manually.

CCS debts

For Child Care Subsidy (CCS) debts see Child Care Subsidy (CCS) debts.

Withholdings from CCS

Withholdings from a customer’s CCS entitlement can only be used to
recover Child Care debts. This includes:

-   CCB
-   CCF, and
-   CCS debts

Non Debt Management staff

Where a potential debt is identified and a debt shell is not generated:

-   record details on a minimum standard ACTDOC, and
-   transfer to the relevant Debt Raising Team

The Resources page contains a link to Processing Services for Debt
Raising.
