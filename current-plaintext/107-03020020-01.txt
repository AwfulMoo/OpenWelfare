This document outlines how to use Debt Explanation (ADEX).

ADEX

Use ADEX:

-   to explain undetermined debts wherever possible
-   for any positive or negative retrospective adjustment to the
    customer's payments
-   as calculation documentation for system generated debts, if the
    debts raised match the estimated amount

Audit trail requirements are met and no further action is needed if all
information relating to the debt is obtained within:

-   the DOC, and
-   ADEX screen storage

ADEX Scheduler

The ADEX Scheduler:

-   provides a simple fortnightly breakup of an employment income
    reassessment
-   gathers information from ADEX and the Centrelink system to construct
    a debt schedule that is provided to the Director of Public
    Prosecutions (DPP) for prosecution referrals

Staff required to explain debt calculations or prepare cases for
review/appeal may also find the tool useful.
