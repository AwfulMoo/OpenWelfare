This document outlines how to determine and record decisions about when
the away from home (AFH) rate of YA would start and stop.

Start date

Eligibility for the away from home rate of YA starts on the later of the
date the customer:

-   leaves the parental home for an approved reason
-   starts the activity for which they have been approved to live away
    from the parental home, or
-   notifies Services Australia of a change. See Change of circumstance
    for Youth Allowance (YA)

Note: customers who are required to quarantine due to COVID-19 border
closures are only eligible for the AFH rate as per the above.

A customer is considered to have already started an activity if they
are:

-   an Australian Apprentice or continuing/returning to a course of
    study they have already started, and
-   they were previously granted/qualified for the away from home rate
    for the activity they are returning to

Date of cessation

Eligibility for the away from home rate of YA ceases on the earliest
date the customer:

-   returns to the parental home (unless they are exempt from the
    accommodated independent status, or return to the parental home for
    a holiday and they are maintaining their term accommodation), or
-   completes or ceases the activity for which they have been approved
    to live away from the parental home (for example, the date after the
    date the customer completes their approved course)

Note: a review of the YA customer's situation can occur when they advise
they are remaining away from home to either commence a new course or
they meet one of the other eligibility criteria to retain the higher
rate.

See the Resources page for more examples.

Disadvantaged students

Dependent students living away from the family home or independent
students who are disadvantaged by personal circumstances and are
enrolled in an approved scholarship course may also be qualified to
receive the Relocation Scholarship (RS).

Dependent Secondary students receiving YA at the away from home rate

If a secondary student has a change in circumstances which ceases their
eligibility to the away from home rate, they may continue to receive YA
at the at home rate. The student’s parent/guardian does not need to
claim Family Tax Benefit, unless the payment would be more beneficial.
See Identifying the most beneficial payment for students or Australian
Apprentices.

Where a dependent secondary student was previously receiving YA at the
away from home rate and a new claim is required, the student’s
circumstances must be reassessed to determine their eligibility for away
from home rate of payment.

Tertiary students impacted by COVID-19

During the COVID-19 pandemic, which occurred in Australia from March
2020, some tertiary students were required to leave their on campus term
accommodation. Many tertiary students also transitioned to online study,
as face-to-face teaching was unavailable.

YA students who were receiving the away from home rate, and transitioned
to online learning as a result of COVID-19 remain eligible for the AFH
rate. Students must return to face-to-face study once available to
continue to be eligible for the away from home rate.

Where a student had to move out of education provider accommodation
(such as on campus) and are, or were temporarily staying with their
parents, will remain eligible for the AFH rate providing they:

-   remain enrolled in their course of study, and
-   intend to return to their campus accommodation as soon as the
    education provider allows them to return

This includes students who have had their accommodation arrangement
cancelled by the education provider and have moved their belongings out
of that accommodation.

Unfavourable decisions

When making an unfavourable decision, speak to the customer:

-   explain the decision
-   give them a chance to provide more information, and
-   advise their review and appeal rights
