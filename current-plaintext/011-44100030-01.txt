This document outlines information about duplicate Personal
Identification Number (PIN) and Consumer IDs in Medicare.

Definition of duplicate PIN and consumer IDs

-   A duplicate PIN occurs when a person is enrolled in Medicare more
    than once
-   A duplicate consumer occurs when a person has more than 1 consumer
    ID with no other associated program entitlement

Note: if the consumer record has an attached program and does not have a
Medicare PIN, the owning program area is responsible for the action
below.

Duplicate PIN or Consumer ID previously created

Report potential duplicates via the Consumer Directory Maintenance
System (CDMS) for a previously created duplicate PIN or consumer ID.

Duplicate PIN or consumer ID resolution guidelines

The Medicare Customer Data Integrity Unit (MCDIU) investigates potential
duplicate PINs or consumer IDs to establish if the records are genuine
duplicates. Make sure that any actions needed to correct the consumer
record(s) have been performed prior to referral

Amend customer details in the Consumer Directory Maintenance System
(CDMS) for Medicare

Where it is identified that a duplicate consumer ID or PIN has been
created, MCDIU will decide the appropriate action. This could include:

-   deleting the consumer record
-   merging the records

Not a Duplicate PIN - records that have an associated program but no Medicare entitlement

If the consumer record has an associated program and does not have a
Medicare entitlement, the owning program area is responsible to:

-   investigate, and
-   fix the duplicate records

See Register a customer for Medicare in the Consumer Directory
Maintenance System (CDMS) to:

-   search for a consumer, and
-   check their entitlement details

If the consumer record has an associated program, and does not have an
attached Medicare entitlement, follow the relevant process to send to
the correct team. If one or more of the records:

-   is an IHI only record with no Medicare program attached, refer to
    the Tier 3 HI Service and My Health Record. Use the process in Merge
    Individual Healthcare Identifier (IHI) in Healthcare Identifiers
    (HI) Service
-   only has the AIR program, refer to the AIR program. Use the process
    in Merge or match individual records and SIN records in Australian
    Immunisation Register (AIR)
-   only has the AODR program, ask the program if the program can be
    transferred

Integrity Unit (MCDIU) and an error message.
