|                                   | disconnected:                     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   they must call back by midday |
|                                   |     the next business day, and    |
|                                   |     that                          |
|                                   | -   if they do not call back this |
|                                   |     may affect their payments, if |
|                                   |     the decision is made to apply |
|                                   |     the serious failure for       |
|                                   |     persistent non-compliance,    |
|                                   |     and they wish to access       |
|                                   |     waiver provisions to have     |
|                                   |     payment reinstated            |
|                                   | -   if the serious failure is     |
|                                   |     applied, the job seeker can   |
|                                   |     have the penalty waived if    |
|                                   |     they agree to undertake a     |
|                                   |     Compliance Activity. They     |
|                                   |     will only be entitled to a    |
|                                   |     waiver from the date they     |
|                                   |     contact and agree to a        |
|                                   |     Compliance Activity. It is    |
|                                   |     therefore important that they |
|                                   |     re-contact PST before midday  |
|                                   |     on the following business     |
|                                   |     day.                          |
