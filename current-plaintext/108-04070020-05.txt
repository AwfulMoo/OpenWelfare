|                                   | principal home not within a       |
|                                   | reasonable period                 |

|                                   | An extended exemption does not    |
|                                   | apply if the customer has not     |
|                                   | made reasonable steps to obtain a |
|                                   | new principal home within a       |
|                                   | reasonable period (i.e. 6 months) |
|                                   | of the sale of the old principal  |
|                                   | home.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Example: Sam and Jenny sold their |
|                                   | principal home on 20 December     |
|                                   | 2006. They went overseas and came |
|                                   | back to Australia on 30 October   |
|                                   | 2007. They entered into a         |
|                                   | contract of sale to purchase a    |
|                                   | new home on 15 December 2007 and  |
|                                   | settlement occurred on 15 March   |
|                                   | 2008. In this case, although Sam  |
|                                   | and Jenny made reasonable         |
|                                   | attempts (that is, they entered   |
|                                   | into a contract of sale to        |
|                                   | purchase a new home within 12     |
|                                   | months) they did not make those   |
|                                   | attempts within a reasonable      |
|                                   | period (i.e., within 6 months)    |
|                                   | from the date of sale. In this    |
|                                   | case, Sam and Jenny cannot gain   |
|                                   | an extended exemption for         |
|                                   | principal home sale proceeds.     |

|                                   |     particular area, for example  |
|                                   |     due to a natural disaster     |
|                                   |     like a flood or cyclone       |
|                                   |     damage to area                |

|                                   | Example: The Smiths sold their    |
|                                   | principal home in October 2007.   |
|                                   | They purchased a block of land in |
|                                   | January 2008 and, due to delays   |
|                                   | with developers, were unable to   |
|                                   | commence building on the land     |
|                                   | until June 2008. The Smiths       |
|                                   | signed a contract in June 2008    |
|                                   | for completion of the building by |
|                                   | January 2009. The builder also    |
|                                   | experienced delays and the new    |
|                                   | home was only partially complete  |
|                                   | by January 2009. The builder      |
|                                   | estimates completion of the home  |
|                                   | by March 2009. In this case, the  |
|                                   | Smiths are eligible for the       |
|                                   | extended exemption for the period |
|                                   | from October 2008 to the end of   |
|                                   | March 2009 as they:               |

|                                   | -   made reasonable attempts      |
|                                   |     (that is, buying a block of   |
|                                   |     land and signing a contract   |
|                                   |     to build a home within 12     |
|                                   |     months)                       |
|                                   | -   made those attempts within a  |
|                                   |     reasonable period (buying a   |
|                                   |     block of land within 6        |
|                                   |     months), and                  |
|                                   | -   experienced delays beyond     |
|                                   |     their control (developer and  |
|                                   |     builder delays)               |

|                                   | that may be exempt is the value   |
|                                   | of the proceeds of the sale of    |
|                                   | the old principal home.           |

|                                   | Example 1: Sally purchased a      |
|                                   | block of land for $100,000 prior  |
|                                   | to selling the principal home.    |
|                                   | Sally sold the principal home and |
|                                   | received $350,000 on 30 July      |
|                                   | 2007. Sally used some of the      |
|                                   | proceeds to pay off the mortgage  |
|                                   | on the block of land. The balance |
|                                   | of the settlement money went into |
|                                   | a bank account. Sally intends to  |
|                                   | use this to build a new principal |
|                                   | home on the block of land. In     |
|                                   | this case, the block of land and  |
|                                   | the money in the bank account can |
|                                   | be exempt from 30 July 2007.      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Note: the exempt value of the     |
|                                   | land and the money in the bank    |
|                                   | account is the lesser of the      |
|                                   | amount received for the old house |
|                                   | and the amount they will spend on |
|                                   | the new one including the land.   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Example 2: John has a block of    |
|                                   | land worth $200,000 with a        |
|                                   | $100,000 mortgage. John sells the |
|                                   | principal home for $300,000 and   |
|                                   | intends to build on the block of  |
|                                   | land. John uses $100,000 from the |
|                                   | sale proceeds to pay off the      |
|                                   | mortgage on the land and intends  |
|                                   | to use the balance of the funds   |
|                                   | ($200,000) to build a new         |
|                                   | principal home.                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The value of equity in the land   |
|                                   | and money from the proceeds of    |
|                                   | the sale is $400,000; this is     |
|                                   | $100,000 more than the amount     |
|                                   | received from the sale. An        |
|                                   | exemption applies only to         |
|                                   | $300,000 (the amount the          |
|                                   | principal home sold for). The     |
|                                   | exemption would apply to the      |
|                                   | amount paid to pay off the land   |
|                                   | ($100,000) and the balance of     |
|                                   | funds from the sale ($200,000).   |
|                                   | The $100,000 equity previously    |
|                                   | owned for the land is still an    |
|                                   | assessable asset as the exemption |
|                                   | amount cannot be more than the    |
|                                   | proceeds from the sale of the old |
|                                   | principal home.                   |
