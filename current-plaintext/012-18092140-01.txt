This document outlines what to do when a caller requests a Healthcare
Identifiers (HI) Service form.

Available online applications

Through Health Professional Online Services (HPOS), applicants can:

-   register seed organisations in the Healthcare Identifiers (HI)
    Service and My Health Record
-   request and link National Authentication Service for Health (NASH)
    Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificates for healthcare provider
    organisations
-   request and link Medicare PKI site certificates
-   replace a Responsible Officer (RO) for a seed organisation
-   add or remove an additional Organisation Maintenance Officer (OMO)
    for a seed or network organisation
-   transfer an existing Healthcare Provider Identifier – Organisation
    (HPI-O) to another organisation

A Provider Digital Access (PRODA) account is needed to access HPOS.

A PRODA account can also be used to request NASH PKI certificates.

Requests for hard copy forms

The preference is for applicants to use the online application processes
available in HPOS.

To support this, HW018, HW021, HW037 and HW040 forms have been removed
from the Services Australia website.

There may be a valid reason why a caller asks for a hard or soft copy
form. All forms, see below, are available on the Intranet so that
Service Officers can print or email forms if required.

-   HW018 – Application to Register a Seed Organisation form
-   HW021 – Application to request a National Authentication Service for
    Health Public Key Infrastructure Certificate for Healthcare Provider
    Organisations form
-   HW037 – Application to amend a Healthcare Organisation record form
-   HW040 – Application to replace a Responsible Officer or add/remove
    an Organisation Maintenance Officer for an organisation form

See the Process page for how to handle such calls.

The Resources page contains links to the HW018, HW021, HW037 and HW040
forms, contact details for the Healthcare Identifiers (HI) Service and
Services Australia website for PRODA and HPOS pages including contact
details.
