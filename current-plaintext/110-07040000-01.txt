This document outlines information about processing end of course
reviews for students to establish continuing qualification for income
support payment.

Student reviews

All students will receive a review form or letter before their student
end date. These reviews are necessary to confirm the student's future
study intentions. That is to determine whether or not the student will
be continuing in the same course, changing course or ceasing study
altogether.

Reviews for YA, Austudy and ABSTUDY

Reviews for ABSTUDY customers will be issued 8 weeks prior to the
recorded student end date currently held on the student's record.
Reviews will be issued 4 weeks before the recorded student end date for:

-   Pensioner Education Supplement (PES) paid under Social Security Law
-   Youth Allowance (YA)
-   Austudy and
-   ABSTUDY PES

The exceptions to this are:

-   where the course duration is 8 weeks or less
-   where the ABSTUDY claim was finalised less than 8 weeks prior to the
    recorded student end date
-   where the YA, Austudy or ABSTUDY PES claim was finalised less than 4
    weeks prior to the recorded student end date, or
-   the ABSTUDY, YA or ABSTUDY PES was not current (i.e. was suspended)
    at the date the end of course review would have been issued

In these cases, a review will not be issued. The customer will need to
be manually issued the appropriate end of course review form or letter:

-   'Information required for continuation of YA' letter, or
-   Information required for continuation of ABSTUDY (SY075(m))

Processing help

Use the Generic Letter guided procedure to issue the form/letter.

The Resources page contains a link to the SY075(m).
