This document outlines how eBusiness/eServices handles requests for
provider statements for Electronic Medicare Claiming (EMC) channels.

On this Page:

Assistance for providers accessing statements

Encourage providers to contact eBusiness if they are not sure how to get
a provider statement or need further assistance.

eBusiness does not process requests for manual claiming provider
statements.

Access provider statements through HPOS

Providers with a Provider Digital Access (PRODA) account can access the
Health Professional Online Services (HPOS). They can also subscribe to
the HPOS Mail Centre to receive copies of statements or reports such as:

Medicare statements

-   90 day pay doctor cheque scheme EFT payments
-   Medicare bulk bill statements

Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) statement of payment

Rural Incentive Program

-   statements and notification, payment advice, payment summary

Midwives Professional Indemnity (MPIS)

-   Notifications, payment statement and request for information

-   Incentives News Update, Payment advice and Annual Confirmation
    Statement

Workforce Incentive Program (WIP) – Practice Stream Online

-   Payment advice and Quarterly Confirmation Statement

Track and scale notification

-   19AB exemption reminder notification, scaling completion letter

DVA Coordinated Veterans’ Care Program

-   Patient Treatment Reports (PTR) individual and summary
-   DVA Webclaim statements.

Providers subscribed to the above statements on HPOS do not receive
paper statements from Services Australia. They must access their
statements via HPOS. Note: once a provider has started a subscription,
it cannot be cancelled for 13 weeks.

Providers can call eBusiness for help with:

-   accessing Medicare Easyclaim reports on HPOS
-   accessing Medicare Webclaim reports on HPOS
-   accessing DVA Webclaim reports on HPOS
-   subscribing and using the HPOS Mail Facility

For more information about HPOS, see Health Professional Online Services
(HPOS).

Access provider statements through Online Claiming Software

Providers submitting Medicare claims through their Online Claiming
Software must obtain their statements via the reporting function within
their software. If unsure how to use this functionality, refer the
provider back to their software developer.

Request duplicate provider statements

If no other option, a provider or their staff can call eBusiness to find
out how to request duplicate provider statements.

eBusiness staff are required to investigate why providers are unable to
access their online claiming statements through their system, before
advising the provider to contact eServices with the request.

If required, advise the provider that their software vendor can contact
the Online Technical Support Helpdesk for further investigations. If all
these measures fail, advise the provider of the following:

requests for online claims:

-   request to eServices by email (for more than 5 claims)
-   cover letter must include payee provider number, provider name,
    provider signature and claim identifiers (IDs)
-   reason for request

requests for Medicare Easyclaim:

-   request to eServices by email
-   cover letter including payee provider number, provider name and
    provider’s signature
-   date of Lodgement or date range
-   reason for request

requests for Medicare Webclaim:

-   request to eServices by email
-   cover letter including payee provider number, provider name and
    provider’s signature
-   date of Lodgement or date range
-   reason for request

If the above requirements are not met, the request will reject.

Note:

-   Duplicate statements can only be provided for the last 2 year period
-   eServices personnel are unable to access duplicate statements for 90
    day pay doctor cheque scheme EFT payments
-   Duplicate statement requests for DVA claims are actioned by the
    Veterans Affairs Processing team

Once a request is received by eServices, it must be escalated to Digital
Channel Management (DCM) for determination. Requests for statements will
be determined on a case by case basis
