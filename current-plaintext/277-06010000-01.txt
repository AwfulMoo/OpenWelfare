Child support disbursements

Disbursement is the process of distributing child support to payees.
Payees can get child support from the eighth day of the month (or the
next business day if the eighth falls on a weekend or public holiday)
and every business day thereafter until the end of the month.

Funds can only be disbursed if:

-   Child Support has received a payment, and
-   the amount is due and payable to the payee

Payees receive disbursed funds via direct credit into their nominated
bank account.
