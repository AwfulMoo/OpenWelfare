|                                   | Example: a child is born on 1     |
|                                   | March 2016 and the customer       |
|                                   | claims NBS. The income estimate   |
|                                   | for the 2015/2016 period is above |
|                                   | the income threshold, however     |
|                                   | income is below the threshold for |
|                                   | the 2016/2017 financial year. The |
|                                   | NBS start date is 1 July 2016 and |
|                                   | the customer is paid the 16/17    |
|                                   | rate for 91 days.                 |

|                                   | When 2015/2016 reconciliation is  |
|                                   | finalised the income is found to  |
|                                   | be less than the estimate, and    |
|                                   | the customer meets the 2015/2016  |
|                                   | FTB A income test. The NBS start  |
|                                   | date then moves back to the       |
|                                   | child’s DOB 1 March 2016. The NBS |
|                                   | is now included in the 2015/2016  |
|                                   | reconciliation assessment.        |
