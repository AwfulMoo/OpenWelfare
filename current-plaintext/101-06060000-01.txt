This document outlines information about the concession entitlement
system and the procedures that it manages.

Information provided by the Concession Entitlement System

The Concession Entitlement System manages the application of concession
card rules, processing information from all the relevant Centrelink
computer systems to determine both card entitlement and to apply the
card hierarchy.

It also enables a Service Officer to view concession entitlement, update
delivery preferences (for example, remove or display an alternate
address on card).

Some of the key elements the Concession Entitlement System manages
include:

-   Concurrent eligibility to more than one concession card (for
    example, Parenting Payment Single (PPS)/Family Tax Benefit (FTB)
    customer has Pensioner Concession Card (PCC) and Health Care Card
    (HCC) entitlement)
-   Retention of concession eligibility after payment has cancelled,
    typically where payment has ceased due to increased earnings from
    employment
-   No entitlement to concessions while payment is being made (for
    example, while they are out of Australia)
-   Current recipients of payment may or may not be eligible for a
    concession card
