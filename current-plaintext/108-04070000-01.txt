This document outlines how the customer's home ownership status
determines the applicable Assets Test limit. A customer can be either a
homeowner or a non-homeowner under social security law. This topic and
its procedures provides information about determining homeowners and
non-homeowners.

Assessment of home ownership

Determining whether a customer is considered a homeowner or
non-homeowner is necessary for situations where a home is used to
operate a business, is a dual-occupancy home or a home owned by a trust
or company. Different assessments apply for the situation where a
customer is selling a home and/or purchasing another residence. A
customer may have a right to reside in a home for life and in that
situation the life interest in a home must be assessed.

The principal home and the private land (curtilage) adjoining the home
may not be considered an asset under the Assets Test.

Home ownership also needs to be assessed for customers who pay site
fees, mooring fees and/or live in a caravan, boat or park home.

The Training & Support page contains links to the courses/training
modules in the Learning Portal relevant for this topic and its
procedures.
