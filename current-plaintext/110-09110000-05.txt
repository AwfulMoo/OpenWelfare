|                                   | an officer s159 Child Support     |

|                                   | For example, a parent lodges an   |
|                                   | estimate of $0 and advises he is  |
|                                   | no longer working for ABC PTY     |
|                                   | LTD. Two months later a Service   |
|                                   | Officer receives an s120 notice   |
|                                   | response from a bank, which shows |
|                                   | that the parent has continued to  |
|                                   | receive regular deposits from ABC |
|                                   | PTY LTD. This information         |
|                                   | suggests that the parent may have |
|                                   | provided a false statement to     |
|                                   | Child Support and this should be  |
