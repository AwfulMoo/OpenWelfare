Suggested text when recovery ceasing permanently

CUS had accrued a debt with NZ which we were recovering under the
authority of Article 19 of the NZ Agreement. CUS is no longer receiving
any Income Support from Australia so no further recovery is possible.
Liaison sent to MSD (NZ) advising of the above.
