Function of NPS

NPS is an external organisation funded by the Department of Health and
Aged Care to undertake research and analysis of doctors' prescribing
behaviours. The department provides NPS with Medicare Benefits Schedule
(MBS) and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) data for this purpose.

Providers are sent individual feedback data by NPS that show their
prescribing trends in comparison to other doctors that practice in the
same geographic area.

Change of address

When the provider wishes to change their preferred mailing address,
action request as per the normal change of address procedure. The change
of address details will be automatically provided to NPS.

Opt-out of mailing list

NPS maintains an opt-out list to prevent a provider being sent future
feedback data.

If the provider wishes to be removed from the NPS mailing list refer
provider to NPS.

The Resources page contains links to the NPS website for contact details
and other useful information.
