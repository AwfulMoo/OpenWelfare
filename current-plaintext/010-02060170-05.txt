Schools/providers seeking approval to offer Third Party Indigenous Scholarships

The Department of Social Services determines which scholarships are
approved for away from home rate for schools or providers seeking to be
recognised as a Third Party Indigenous Scholarship provider.

Third Party Indigenous Scholarships are normally managed and delivered
by a number of provider organisations, who have contracts or funding
arrangements with either the Department of Social Services or the
Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet.

Services Australia has no role in assessing or determining either the
scholarships or a qualifying school.

Schools or provider organisations that offer a scholarship of their own
and seek for that scholarship to be approved as a Third Party Indigenous
Scholarship must approach the Department of Social Services, (see Third
Party Indigenous Scholarships) for approval.
