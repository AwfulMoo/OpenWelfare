|                                   | (the date of event is the date of |
|                                   | arrival)                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Jane is an Australian citizen who |
|                                   | travels overseas. While overseas, |
|                                   | Jane enters into a relationship   |
|                                   | with Rodney and gives birth to a  |
|                                   | child as a result of that         |
|                                   | relationship. Jane lives overseas |
|                                   | with Rodney (partner) and their   |
|                                   | child for 4 years before          |
|                                   | separating from Rodney and        |
|                                   | returning to Australia, having    |
|                                   | been offered a job in Australia.  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Rodney is residing in a country   |
|                                   | that has a reciprocal arrangement |
|                                   | with Australia, which allows Jane |
|                                   | to seek maintenance from Rodney.  |
|                                   | Jane decides not to pursue this.  |
|                                   | Jane also decides not to claim    |
|                                   | FTB straight away after returning |
|                                   | to Australia, as the anticipated  |
|                                   | income is too high and Jane may   |
|                                   | not be eligible for a payment.    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | However, Jane's new employment    |
|                                   | contract is subsequently          |
|                                   | withdrawn and Jane then claims    |
|                                   | FTB 10 weeks after returning to   |
|                                   | Australia. As Jane has been able  |
|                                   | to apply for child support since  |
|                                   | returning to Australia, Jane's    |
|                                   | DMA period starts on the day Jane |
|                                   | arrived in Australia. Jane has 3  |
|                                   | weeks remaining to take           |
|                                   | reasonable action to obtain       |
|                                   | maintenance, without the rate     |
|                                   | being reduced to the base rate of |
|                                   | FTB Part A.                       |

|                                   | Australia on 1 January and lodges |
|                                   | a claim for FTB. Lynne-Michelle   |
|                                   | is required to serve a Newly      |

|                                   | for FTB Part A, but is granted    |
|                                   | FTB Part B immediately.           |
|                                   | Lynne-Michelle is then granted    |
|                                   | FTB Part A 12 months later.       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Consideration should be given to  |
|                                   | manually providing Lynne-Michelle |
|                                   | with a DMA period from the date   |
|                                   | Lynne-Michelle becomes eligible   |
|                                   | for FTB Part A. This is because   |
|                                   | even though Lynne-Michelle could  |
|                                   | have applied for child support    |
|                                   | when arriving in Australia,       |
|                                   | Lynne-Michelle may not have known |
|                                   | to apply (or the consequences of  |
|                                   | not applying).                    |

|                                   | that Lynne-Michelle could not     |
|                                   | have reasonably been aware of the |
|                                   | need to take maintenance action,  |
|                                   | and refers the case for PDE to be |
