| 1                                 | Meaning of receiving FTB Part A   |
|                                   | at more than the base rate + Read |
|                                   | more ...                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Section 151A of the Child Support |
|                                   | (Assessment) Act 1988 applies to  |
|                                   | a person who is considered to be  |
|                                   | entitled to FTB at more than the  |
|                                   | base rate even though they may    |
|                                   | not be receiving their full       |
|                                   | entitlement by instalments. A     |
|                                   | person can choose to receive less |
|                                   | than their fortnightly            |
|                                   | entitlement by taking up an       |
|                                   | option under More Choice For      |
|                                   | Families. The person is choosing  |
|                                   | to receive a notional entitlement |
|                                   | as opposed to their legislative   |
|                                   | entitlement. The decision about   |
|                                   | whether they are receiving more   |
|                                   | than the base rate for the        |
|                                   | purpose of subsection 151A should |
|                                   | be based on their legislative     |
|                                   | entitlement.                      |

|                                   | A blended family is a couple with |
|                                   | more than one child in their      |
|                                   | care, where:                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   one child is from a previous  |
|                                   |     relationship of one member of |
|                                   |     the couple, and               |
|                                   | -   another child is from the     |
|                                   |     current relationship, or from |
|                                   |     the previous relationship of  |
|                                   |     the other member of the       |
|                                   |     couple                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Members of a blended family may   |
|                                   | choose for one person to claim    |
|                                   | FTB or for each member of the     |
|                                   | couple to claim and receive a     |
|                                   | nominated percentage of the       |
|                                   | family's FTB entitlement.         |
|                                   | Therefore, the situation may      |
|                                   | arise where the partner of the    |
|                                   | payee is receiving FTB in respect |
|                                   | of the child support child.       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Section 151A applies to payees    |
|                                   | where their current partner is    |
|                                   | receiving more than the base rate |
|                                   | FTB for the child. This is        |
|                                   | because the maintenance action    |
|                                   | test (MAT) applies to both the    |
|                                   | FTB recipient and their partner   |
|                                   | (that is, the case ending may     |
|                                   | cause FTB recipient to fail the   |
|                                   | MAT). If the customer wants more  |
|                                   | information, warm transfer them   |
|                                   | to Centrelink on 136 150.         |
