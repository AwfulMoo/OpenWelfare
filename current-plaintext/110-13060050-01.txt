For staff conducting Customer Compliance Division Interventions only

This document outlines the process for adding manual partner
interventions within Customer Compliance Division.

Partner intervention identified

If during the intervention process, it is identified that the
intervention outcome could have an impact on a partner's (or
ex-partner's) entitlement (current or past) a manual partner
intervention must be created on the partner's/ex partner's record.

This will ensure all updates made to the customer's and
partner's/ex-partner's records are attributed to the intervention
results.

A manual partner intervention should not be loaded if the
partner/ex-partner:

-   was not in receipt of a Centrelink payment during the period of the
    intervention
-   has a primary intervention in their own right

Note: this process does not apply to Employment Income Matching (NEIM)
