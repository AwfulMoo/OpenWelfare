This document outlines an overview of Additional Child Care Subsidy
(ACCS) (Temporary Financial Hardship).

ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship)

Additional Child Care Subsidy (ACCS) (Temporary Financial Hardship)
provides short-term support to families experiencing significant
financial stress due to circumstances beyond their control. This
additional financial assistance will help ensure continuity of care for
the child and support families when they need it most.

This subsidy provides eligible customers with:

-   up to 100 hours per fortnight of subsidised child care, and
-   a subsidy equal to 100% of the fee charged, up to 120% of the hourly
    rate cap
-   ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship) is third in the hierarchy of
    ACCS payments

General eligibility for ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship)

A customer may be eligible for ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship) if
they are first assessed as eligible for Child Care Subsidy (CCS) and:

-   are assessed as experiencing temporary financial hardship for an
    event that occurred no more than six months before the application
    is made, and
-   have had a substantial reduction in their ability to pay child care
    fees as a direct result of the temporary financial hardship

Note: a family’s income does not preclude them from being eligible for
ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship). This means a customer may be
eligible for CCS and have an entitlement of 0 per cent, but may be
eligible for ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship) if they satisfy the
eligibility criteria.
