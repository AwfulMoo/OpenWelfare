| Payment less than accrued         | The available amount in the       |
| entitlement                       | script is less than the           |
|                                   | customer's accrued entitlement:   |

|                                   | When the system assesses the      |

|                                   | as an urgent payment, it          |
|                                   | withholds the total value of      |
|                                   | deductions such as debt           |

|                                   | This leaves enough funds to meet  |
|                                   | these commitments. The available  |

| Payment granted inappropriately   | What should a staff member do if  |

|                                   | can be very grey. For example,    |
|                                   | what one staff member believes    |
|                                   | could be foreseen, another may    |
|                                   | not. In addition, due to the      |
|                                   | sensitive nature of these types   |
|                                   | of decisions, all staff should    |
|                                   | support the decision made by the  |
|                                   | decision maker.                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If a customer is unhappy with the |
|                                   | decision, follow the              |
