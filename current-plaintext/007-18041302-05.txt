Workaround

P24845 problem and workaround

The P24845 system issue may impact in the following scenarios.

-   Where a step parent is claiming Family Tax Benefit (FTB) that has
    been transferred to them from a biological parent, and the other
    biological parent also becomes entitled to receive FTB, for example
    their percentage of care increases to above 35%, and they make a
    claim
-   Where the biological parent transfers their FTB to a step parent and
    they later separate. Care details for the child will not be
    transferred correctly to Child Support if a past period care refresh
    is requested
-   The care may transfer to the step parent's child support record
    (with incorrect child relationship details) causing inaccurate child
    support assessments and impacts to multiple parties

As a result, where FTB is transferred out to partner ('TOP' is coded on
the Child Override/Claim (CHOC) screen - from parent to step parent) and
the customer is a Centrelink and Child Support mutual customer, these
records are to be referred for investigation. See the Resources page of
Assessment of shared care arrangements for Family Tax Benefit (FTB) for
further information, including details of the workaround and recording
of Display on Access (DOA) DOCs.

Workflows for Parenting Payment (PP)

Table 6: this table describes the most common staff workflows in
Customer First that will be presented in the Parenting Payment (PP)
Social Application (claim workflow) and the order in which they must be
actioned.

Note: other workflows may display based on the customer's circumstances.
For example, 'Refer to Complex Assessment Officer' or 'Generate
Compliance Action'. Any additional workflows are a trigger that further
action may be required. Further processing must be completed in
Workspace.
