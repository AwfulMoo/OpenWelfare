For Integrated Care staff managing care decisions only.

This document outlines the process for Integrated Care Service Officers
in making and giving effect to decisions when Services Australia is
notified of a care change for a child.

On this Page:

Integrated Care

Integrated Care Service Officers manage disagreed and disputed care
changes for customers across the Child Support and Centrelink Programs.

For the Child Support Program, these Service Officers manage:

-   Child Support referrals for disagreed care change notifications
    where there is no pending registration
-   Child Support referrals for disputed care change notifications
-   Actual care in special circumstances

For the Centrelink Program, these Service Officers manage:

-   Centrelink referrals for disagreed care changes notifications
-   Centrelink referrals for disputed care change notifications
-   Actual care in special circumstances

Integrated Care Service Officers provide customers with a holistic
case-managed approach for disagreed and disputed care change
notifications. The Service Officers ensure care is reflected accurately
in Child Support and Centrelink systems, and assess the impacts of the
care change on Family Assistance, Child Care Subsidy, Child Support,
Income Support and Medicare Basics, or refer for action as appropriate.
They provide customers with the information and connections they need to
access services from relevant community support organisations and
government departments.

To assist with actioning a change in care notification, see Integrated
Care - Notification of change in care to access care-related resources
and tools.

Note: contact Operational Blueprint to obtain previous versions of care
procedures.

Integrated Care Customer Management

Integrated Care Service Officers undertake work in both the Centrelink
and Child Support programmes for their customers, therefore their
customer management process includes:

-   Child Support’s Customer Management Approach (CMA), where staff
    undertake Minimum Collection Activity and common activities until
    the care decision is made. See Common and specialised activities for
    Child Support staff
-   Completing Centrelink Business Imperatives within scope. The
    Resources page contains a link to the Business Imperatives homepage.

Note: Subject Matter Expert (SME) work in Integrated Care is located
through the ‘Ready for Work’ option in Customer First. Some Operational
Blueprint content refers to locating SME work via a report, however this
is not the process for Integrated Care

Real-time expectations

While on the phone with a customer, Service Officers will undertake the
above activities and any other items within scope to finalise or
progress as far as possible. This would generally not include Family Tax
Benefit (FTB) new claims unless the customer is experiencing financial
hardship.

See the Customer Referral Guidelines to determine when a customer is
transferred or referred to Integrated Care.

Where integrated Care Service Officers receive customer transfers, they
should manage the call by progressing all in-scope issues as far as
possible, then:

Check routing of the SCT Referral intray or other SCT intray (whether on
the customer transferred or associated customer record), if the SCT
intray is:

-   already routed to an Integrated Care (IC) Service Officer, lock
    relevant customers to that Service Officer
-   routed to a team’s none position, lock customer to that team’s none
    position
-   not allocated and sitting in the Z – DISAGREED REFERRALS, receiving
    IC Service Officer should retain ownership and lock customers in
    dual systems as appropriate.

Actual Care in Special Circumstances (ACSC) Officer

The roles and responsibilities for the ACSC Officers are:

-   examine and review Disputed care referrals and consider if actual
    care in special circumstances applies
-   conduct investigations
-   make ACSC care determinations
-   explain an ACSC determination to customers
-   give effect to the decision to apply to the customers' relevant
    child support and/or family assistance assessment(s)
