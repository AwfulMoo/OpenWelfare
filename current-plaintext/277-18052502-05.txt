|                                   | their percentage of care has      |
|                                   | fallen to 0%. When a terminating  |

|                                   | even if the agency is notified    |
|                                   | after 28 days. Mum and Dad would  |
|                                   | also lose their entitlement to    |
|                                   | FTB and the aunt will have the    |
|                                   | option of making a claim.         |
