|                                   | weeks of Clarence's death, so the |
|                                   | start date can be backdated to    |

|                                   | Neville has just retired due to   |
|                                   | ill health. Carol, Neville's      |
|                                   | partner, has decided to take long |
|                                   | service leave to care for         |
|                                   | Neville. On 17 July, Neville      |
|                                   | passes away.                      |

|                                   |     on 10 August                  |
|                                   | -   Carol's long service leave    |
|                                   |     will end on 20 August when    |
|                                   |     Carol retires. Until then,    |
|                                   |     Carol's earnings do not       |
|                                   |     entitle Carol to any income   |
|                                   |     support payment               |

|                                   | August. Although this claim is    |
|                                   | within 4 weeks of Neville's       |
|                                   | death, it cannot be backdated to  |
|                                   | 17 July because Carol is not      |
|                                   | qualified for Age Pension at that |
|                                   | date. Carol's start date for Age  |
|                                   | Pension is 20 August, due to the  |
|                                   | effect of Carol's earnings        |
|                                   | precluding payment until then.    |
