This document explains when a customer requests a review of their
priority needs or they have had a change in their circumstances.

Review of priority needs

Before changing any regular expenses Service Officers are to confirm a
person's priority needs are being met.

When completing a review of priority needs, Service Officers are to also
review any voluntary deductions (that is, Centrepay and Rent Deduction
Scheme payments).

Under Child Protection Income Management (CPIM), the State or Territory
Child Protection Authority may recommend where income managed funds
should be directed. Social workers who assess a customer as a Vulnerable
Welfare Payment Recipient (VWPR) can also recommend how income managed
funds should be directed.

Service Officers do not need to comply with the recommendation, but
should document how these needs will be met when conducting an
assessment or reviewing a customer's priority needs.

An understanding of how to determine a customer's priority needs is
required, before making any changes.
