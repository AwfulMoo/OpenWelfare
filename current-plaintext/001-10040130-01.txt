This document outlines information for identifying, gathering and
weighing evidence to establish the facts which are relevant to a
compliance investigation.

Conducting an evidence-based compliance investigation

Compliance investigations are conducted by Participation Solution Team
(PST)-skilled Service Officers and service centre Service Officers with
UNPP security resource to determine whether a financial penalty should
be applied following an incident of non-compliance with a compulsory
requirement. During the investigation the PST-skilled Service Officer
gathers sufficient evidence to determine the facts and relevant matters
to make an evidence-based decision that applies legislation and policy
consistently.

All compliance investigations include evidence from both the person who
reported the failure or generated the investigation, and the job seeker.
Whether any further evidence is required to reach a decision, will
depend on the clarity and consistency of these 2 forms of primary
evidence.

Responsibility for gathering information and weighing evidence

The Participation Solution Team (PST)-skilled Service Officer or service
centre Service Officer with UNPP security resource is responsible for:

-   identifying the facts relevant to the reported non-compliance event
    and conducting an investigation focused on the relevant facts
-   giving the job seeker the opportunity to respond to any adverse
    claim that has been made against them and to disclose any further
    information they would like considered
-   making contact with the provider or relevant third party to assist
    in establishing the facts, when evidence provided by the job seeker
    contradicts the reported non-compliance event
-   assessing and weighing the available information to reach a
    conclusion about what occurred, or in the case of conflicting
    information, what is more likely to have occurred
-   consultation with a Participation Solutions Team (PST)-skilled
    Service Support Officer (SSO), social worker, specialist officer or
    Indigenous Cultural Consultant may be appropriate to establish the
    impact of job seeker circumstances on capacity to comply as this may
    be considered evidence to inform the decision

Substantiating facts

Facts that are relevant when considering a non-compliance event are
substantiated with evidence. Any evidence collected as part of a
compliance investigation should:

-   be specific to the non-compliance event that has been reported
-   focus on the relevant matters that can be considered to make a
    determination under the applicable legislation and policy
-   be from a reliable, trustworthy source
-   documented in a clear and concise manner including how the evidence
    informed the decision and if appropriate, the reasons certain facts
    were given a greater weight

Weighing the evidence

Assessing and weighing each piece of evidence will determine how much
impact the evidence has on the investigation. As a general rule,
evidence given the most weight in an investigation will be:

-   directly relevant to the incident and the rules governing the
    decision
-   precise in nature
-   deemed to be from a reliable, trustworthy source, and
-   would be viewed as credible by others

Gathering sufficient evidence

When the key facts relevant to a case that have been reported by a
provider, and the statement provided by the job seeker is consistent,
the verbal statement may be all that is required to establish what
occurred and make a decision.

When information is inconsistent, or statements made by one of the
parties is challenged by someone with an opposing interest, or the
decision maker has concerns about the inherent likelihood or
unlikelihood of a matter asserted, more concrete evidence may be
required.

Attempts to gather further evidence should only be made if the potential
evidence is relevant and will influence the outcome of the decision. For
example, when prior contact was required but did not occur, evidence to
support non-compliance with the requirement would not be required if it
was reasonable to expect prior contact as this would not change the
outcome of the decision.

If possible a compliance investigation should be completed on the day of
contact. This is particularly important for decisions relating to a
financial penalty for a mutual obligation failure as job seekers cannot
finalise reporting until the decision has been finalised and mutual
obligation failures cannot be held pending the return of evidence.

Generally evidence should be collected during the contact with the job
seeker as this means timely decision making and avoids the job seeker
having to contact again. Preferably, third party contact should be made
by phone to discuss relevant matters and clarify discrepancies. When the
decision maker requires assistance with assessing the impact of a
specific circumstances on the capacity to meet a compulsory requirement,
consultation with a Participation Solutions Team (PST)-skilled Service
Support Officer (SSO), PST-skilled social worker or specialist also
provides part of the evidence base for the decision.

Balance of probability

When some of the facts are conflicting and no further evidence is
available, a decision based on the balance of probability is made.

If it is more probable than not that the non-compliance event, including
failure to make prior contact, occurred without good reason then a
failure has been committed and compliance action will apply.

If based on the established facts, it is more probable a non-compliance
event did not occur or a job seeker had reasonable excuse, and met prior
contact requirements, then compliance action will not apply.

Recording evidence relevant to the decision

All information relevant to the investigation and decision must be
documented in the Participation Compliance workflow. This is an
essential part of transparent decision making and ensures the integrity
of the job seeker compliance system.

Documentation must include a sufficient level of detail to ensure
someone reviewing the decision will be able to identify:

-   the facts that were considered relevant to the decision and the
    supporting evidence, and
-   the manner and rationale used in weighing the evidence

The Resources page includes examples to assist with weighting evidence
and links to additional resources about the role of evidence in decision
making.
