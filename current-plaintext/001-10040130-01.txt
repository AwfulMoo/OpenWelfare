This document outlines information for identifying, gathering and
weighing evidence to establish the facts which are relevant to a
compliance investigation.

Conducting an evidence-based compliance investigation

Compliance investigations are conducted by Participation Solution Team
(PST)-skilled Service Officers and Service Officers with UNPP security
resource. The aim of the compliance investigation is to determine
whether a financial penalty should be applied following a reported
incident of non-compliance with a compulsory requirement. During the
investigation the Service Officer gathers sufficient evidence to
determine the facts and considers relevant matters to make an
evidence-based decision that applies legislation and policy
consistently.

All compliance investigations include evidence from both the person who
reported the failure or generated the investigation, and the job seeker.
Whether any further evidence is required to reach a decision, depends on
whether the 2 forms of primary evidence are:

-   clear and consistent, and
-   sufficient to support a decision about what is most likely to have
    occurred

Responsibility for gathering information and weighing evidence

The Participation Solution Team (PST)-skilled Service Officer or Service
Officer with the UNPP security resource is responsible for:

-   identifying the information relevant to the reported non-compliance
    event and conducting an investigation focused on the relevant facts
-   giving the job seeker the opportunity to respond to any adverse
    claim that has been made against them and to disclose any further
    information they would like considered
-   making contact with the provider or relevant third party to assist
    in establishing the one singular version of events, where evidence
    provided by the job seeker contradicts the information reported in
    the non-compliance event
-   assessing and weighing the available information to reach a
    conclusion about what occurred, or in the case of conflicting
    information, what is more likely to have occurred
-   consultation with a PST-skilled Service Support Officer (SSO),
    social worker, specialist officer or Indigenous Cultural Consultant
    may be appropriate to establish the impact of job seeker
    circumstances on their capacity to comply and may be considered
    evidence to inform the decision

Substantiating facts

Information that is relevant when considering a non-compliance event
should be substantiated with evidence. Evidence collected as part of any
compliance investigation should:

-   be specific to the non-compliance event that has been reported
-   focus on the relevant matters that can be considered to make a
    determination under the applicable legislation and policy
-   be from a reliable source
-   be documented clearly and concisely, being sure to include how the
    evidence collected has informed the decision and if appropriate, the
    reasons certain facts were given more weight than others

Weighing the evidence

Assessing and weighing the evidence will help determine how much impact
the evidence has on the investigation. Generally, evidence given the
most weight in an investigation will be:

-   relevant to the incident
-   relevant to the rules governing the decision
-   specific
-   provided by a reliable source
-   able to be substantiated, and
-   would be viewed as credible by others

Gathering sufficient evidence

When information reported by a provider as a part of the non-compliance
event and the statement made by the job seeker are consistent, the job
seeker's verbal statement should be all that is required to establish
what occurred and make a decision. This is because the events are not
disputed.

When information is inconsistent, or the decision maker has concerns
about what the most likely version of events is, more concrete evidence
may be required.

Attempts to gather further evidence should only be made if the potential
evidence is relevant and will influence the outcome of the decision. For
example, when prior contact was required but did not occur, evidence to
support non-compliance with the requirement would not be required if it
was reasonable to expect prior contact as this would not change the
outcome of the decision.

The compliance investigation should be completed on the day of contact,
where possible. This is particularly important for decisions that may
result in a financial penalty for a mutual obligation failure as job
seekers cannot complete their reporting until the decision has been
finalised. Mutual obligation failures cannot be held pending the return
of evidence.

Generally evidence should be collected during the contact with the job
seeker. This helps deliver timely decision making and prevents the job
seeker from having to contact again. Preferably, third party contact
should be made by phone during the initial contact with the job seeker
to discuss relevant matters and clarify discrepancies. When the decision
maker requires assistance assessing the impact of job seeker's
circumstances on their capacity to meet a compulsory requirement,
consultation with a Participation Solutions Team (PST)-skilled Service
Support Officer (SSO), PST-skilled social worker or other relevant
specialist is encouraged and can also be used as evidence to support the
decision.

Balance of probability

If there is conflicting information and no further evidence is
available, a decision must be based on the balance of probability.

That means, if it is more probable than not that the non-compliance
event, including failure to make prior contact, occurred without good
reason then a failure has been committed and compliance action will
apply.

Compliance action will not apply if, based on the established facts, it
is more probable:

-   a non-compliance event did not occur, or
-   a job seeker had reasonable excuse, and
-   prior contact requirements were met, or it was unreasonable to
    expect prior contact to be made

Recording evidence relevant to the decision

All information relevant to the investigation and decision must be
documented in the Participation Compliance workflow. This is an
essential part of transparent decision making and ensures the integrity
of the job seeker compliance system.

Documentation must include a sufficient level of detail to ensure
someone reviewing the decision will be able to identify:

-   the facts that were considered relevant to the decision and the
    supporting evidence, and
-   the manner and rationale used in weighing the evidence

and links to additional resources about the role of evidence in decision
making.
