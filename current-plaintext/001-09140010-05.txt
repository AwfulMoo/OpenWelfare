Scenarios to code employment income in the rate estimator

This table describes how to code the employment income (per fortnight)
'current situation' field and the Employment income (per fortnight)
'proposed situation' field so that the Financial Suitability Test (FST)
questions will present for the appropriate customer group.

Gross employment income should always be used, as the FST will calculate
tax liability.
