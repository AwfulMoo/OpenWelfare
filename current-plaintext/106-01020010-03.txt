|                                   | interpreter as this excludes the  |
|                                   | customer. If this is required,    |

|                                   | Before the seminar, explain to    |
|                                   | the interpreter the topics that   |
|                                   | will be discussed and provide any |

|                                   | referred to during the seminar:   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   introduce the interpreter to  |
|                                   |     the group and explain their   |

|                                   | -   present to the group          |
|                                   |     directly, not to the          |
|                                   |     interpreter                   |
|                                   | -   during question time, look    |
|                                   |     directly at the person asking |
|                                   |     the question. Do not provide  |
|                                   |     the interpreter with the      |
|                                   |     answer privately and expect   |

|                                   |     question in English, allow    |
|                                   |     the interpreter to interpret  |
|                                   |     this first for the group      |
|                                   |     before answering the          |
|                                   |     question. Remember to allow   |

|                                   |     understand, ask the           |
|                                   |     interpreter to clarify the    |
|                                   |     question with the person in   |
