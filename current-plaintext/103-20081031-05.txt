Scenarios of documents received to support an application

Example 1 - SS526 signed on 01 September 2020

-   3 months of bank statements provided up to 17 August 2020
-   This is acceptable, as it is within the allowable one month time
    period

Example 2 - SS526 signed on 01 September 2020

-   3 months of bank statements are provided ending on 30 July 2020
-   This will be returned for insufficient evidence, as the statements
    are not within one month of the SS526 being signed

Example 3 - SS526 signed on 01 September 2020

-   Participant has provided supporting documents after the exit
    application form has been submitted. Bank statements provided show
    transactions up to 15 September 2020
-   This would mean bank statements are needed for before the 3 month
    period 16 June 2020 to 15 September 2020

Acceptable documents

Participants should provide supporting documents at the time of
submitting their application form. If the participant does not provide
the documents at the time of submitting their application form, they
must send them within 14 days, plus any extra time for mail delivery as
outlined in Allow extra time for mail delivery. See Process Table 2 for
steps to undertake when this occurs.

Participants must provide copies of documents with details of bank,
building society or credit union account balances and transactions for
the last 3 months. If they are within 1 month of the exit application
form being signed, these can be accepted. See Resources page for
scenarios of document date ranges.

Participants will also need to provide the following documents (if
applicable):

-   School attendance reports for each school aged child they are
    responsible for, provided by their school. The report should list
    the number of explained and unexplained absences for the last 4
    school terms. School attendance records can be provided over
    consecutive years. If the child has not yet completed a full year of
    school, attendance report for the school terms the child has
    attended are required
-   Evidence to support their claims of having a disability or care
    arrangements, such as a medical certificate or National Disability
    Insurance Agency (NDIA) agreements
-   If the participant transfers funds to another person’s account to
    meet their primary needs, the participant will need to provide
    evidence these needs are being met. This could include proof of
    housing payments, rental statements or details of their housing
    situation loan payments direct debit arrangements, utility
    statements
-   Credit or store card statements for the last 3 months
-   Transaction details for any Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) services, such
    as Afterpay, or Zip, for the last 3 months. See the Buy Now, Pay
    Later Fact Sheet for a comprehensive explanation of what is
    required.

Documentation can include:

-   Proof of housing payments
-   Rental statements
-   Details of the participants housing situation
-   Direct debit arrangements
-   Evidence of bill payments
-   Details of any state or territory fines.

Bank/credit or store card statements as acceptable evidence

For supporting bank/credit or store card statements for all accounts
owned (including joint accounts) to be deemed as acceptable evidence,
they must have:

-   Full name, BSB and account number on the first page
-   Dates of transactions and running balance
-   Details of transactions, and
-   Page and/or date sequencing

For joint accounts, the participant must get consent from the other
account holder(s) to provide the agency with the joint account
information.

When documents (for example, bank statements) do not have detailed
transactions listed, or a running balance staff must request more
evidence, such as screenshots or interim statements.

The following formats of bank/credit/store card statements can be
accepted as evidence:

Bank/credit/store card statements (printed)

Transaction/Online Statements

Interim statements (printouts over the bank counter)

-   This can only be accepted in conjunction with a bank or transaction
    statement to be classed as acceptable evidence

Screenshots can be accepted if they meet the standards outlined above,
i.e. full name, account number and running balance etc.

Customers are not required to provide statements for their loan
accounts. This includes home loans, personal loans, debt consolidation
loans or Payday loans.

Not all BNPL merchants provide their customers with a statement. In the
absence of a participant being able to provide a transaction statement,
the agency will accept the following types of evidence which includes a
screenshot of their account.

-   Account with order amount, amount owing and upcoming payments;
-   Payment schedule with details of the latest transactions;
-   Completed order list

Note: all screenshots should include the participant’s name.

See the Buy Now, Pay Later Fact Sheet.

If the participant has had a significant change in financial
responsibilities/circumstances in between the time they provided the
bank statements with the signed exit application form and their
interview, the participant may need to provide updated bank statements
(and other documents if required) as evidence of this.
