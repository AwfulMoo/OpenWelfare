This document outlines the criteria to be eligible for the ABSTUDY
Schooling B Award.

Study load concessions

The student must continue to study full-time in their approved course to
remain eligible for assistance under the ABSTUDY Schooling B Award
unless they meet the eligibility criteria for either two-thirds study
load concession, disability study load concession, or pensioner study
load concession.

Secondary school studies with a TAFE component

Secondary studies at high school that have a TAFE component to the
studies are becoming more common. The TAFE studies are vocationally
oriented, to provide the student with an opportunity to gain their
schooling qualification and a certificate qualification via the TAFE
system. These students are enrolled as full time secondary students
under their State Education system, and thereby would receive Schooling
B Award payments. Their status should be confirmed to ensure that
Schooling B Award is appropriate. It is possible that Tertiary Award may
apply in some cases.

Allowances and Benefits available under the Schooling B Award

A student approved for a Schooling B Award may be entitled to 1 or more
of the following benefits:

-   Living Allowance or Pensioner Education Supplement (PES)
-   School Fees Allowance
-   Fares Allowance
-   Away from Base assistance
-   Remote Area Allowance
-   Pharmaceutical Allowance
-   Additional Assistance
-   Relocation Scholarship
-   Incidentals Allowance (where the student is 18 years or over at 1
