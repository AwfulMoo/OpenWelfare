    Process Direct
-   Table 5 Step 11 Processing DRA and NZ DRA claims in Customer First

Automation of ineligible claims – AGDRP only

From 10 April 2022, the system will automatically assess and finalise
ineligible AGDRP claims where specified business rules are met and the
customer:

is not residentially qualified (NRQ)

-   The customer does not meet the residence requirements for AGDRP

does not live in New South Wales (the qualifying area, NQL) and

-   they have not been seriously injured
-   a dependent child has not been seriously injured, or
-   an immediate family member has not died or is missing as a direct
    result of the major disaster

Note: automation of ineligible claims does not apply to NZ DRP, DRA or
NZ DRA

Rejecting claims - AGDRP and NZ DRP only

AGDRP and NZ DRP - all claims can be rejected.

Due to the sensitivities of the current flood events, when talking to
customers, do not use the term rejection. Use the term ineligible.
For example, “After assessing your claim we have found it does not meet
the conditions of the payment and therefore your claim outcome is
ineligible.”

Contacting customers before rejecting a claim

While all claims can now be rejected, the need to make genuine
attempt(s) to contact the customer is based on the:

-   LGA, and
-   claim reason

For the number of contact attempts needed before rejecting a claim, see
the Process page.

A specialist team will be allocated claims where 2 genuine attempts to
contact a customer are needed. For staff outside the specialist team,
see Step 7 in the Assess and finalise claim table for how to allocate
these claims to the correct team to action.

Before rejecting a claim, staff must check the claim and any DOC on the
customer’s record to make sure the customer is not eligible. Staff must
determine if the claim should be granted or rejected.

To reject a claim, see the Assess and finalise claim table in Processing
AGDRP and NZ DRP claims in Process Direct.

Rejecting claims - DRA and NZ DRA only

From 12 April 2022, all DRA and NZ DRA claims for this event that do not
meet eligibility criteria can be rejected.

Due to the sensitivities of the current flood events, when talking to
customers, do not use the term rejection. Use the term ineligible.
For example, “After assessing your claim we have found it does not meet
the conditions of the payment and therefore your claim outcome is
ineligible.”

Before rejecting a claim, staff must check the claim and any DOC on the
customer’s record to make sure the customer is not eligible. Staff must
determine if the claim should be granted or rejected.

Staff must consider if:

the reason the claim was placed on hold pending rejection

the customer has claimed the incorrect event

-   for example, DRA instead of NZ DRA

any change to the list of declared LGAs has now made this claim eligible

claim can be assessed on the information provided by the customer in the
claim

-   that is, if claim was held pending evidence there may be sufficient
    detail in the claim to grant the payment

a Request for Information (RFI) has been issued for information such as
Tax File Number (for DRA) or evidence of participation in Australian Tax
System (for NZ DRA)

Contacting customers before rejecting a claim

All DRA and NZ DRA claims must have 2 genuine attempts to contact the
customer before rejecting the claim. Record the outcome of each contact
attempt in a DOC.

If contact with customer is successful and claim is to be rejected:

discuss the option of other Income Support Payment (ISP) (such as
JobSeeker Payment or Parenting Payment) - noting that customers who
claimed NZ DRA will have limited ISP options because of residency

-   provide details about income and asset tests for ISP (including
    partner income for customers who are partnered and parental income
    for customers under 22)
-   if the customer wants to test eligibility for ISP refer them to the
    appropriate Online Claim process

document any discussion about potential ISP claim and that customer was
advised to make an Online Claim

To reject a claim for:

-   DRA, see the Assess and finalise claim table in Processing DRA in
    Process Direct
-   NZ DRA, see the Rejecting claims in Customer First in Processing DRA
    and NZ DRA in Customer First
