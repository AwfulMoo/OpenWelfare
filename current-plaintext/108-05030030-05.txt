|                                   | child due on 23 July. Within the  |

|                                   | year estimate of $35,000 and a    |
|                                   | next financial year estimate of   |
|                                   | $20,000.                          |

|                                   | Both estimates will need to be    |
|                                   | recorded during claim processing  |
|                                   | using the date of event (DOV):    |

|                                   |     estimate, and                 |
|                                   | -   1 July for the next financial |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Danielle receives a phone call    |
|                                   | from the processing team to       |
|                                   | discuss Danielle's current year   |
|                                   | income estimate to ensure PPL has |
|                                   | been included as it is a taxable  |
|                                   | payment.                          |

|                                   | Danielle provides a revised       |
|                                   | estimate. The estimate change is  |
|                                   | a non-income related change as it |
|                                   | relates directly to the birth of  |
|                                   | the child, therefore the DOV is   |
|                                   | 28 November (date of birth).      |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | Barry is currently receiving FTB  |
|                                   | based on an estimate of $50,000   |
|                                   | for 2 school-aged children. Barry |
|                                   | contacts on 5 February to advise  |
|                                   | a 2 year old family member came   |
|                                   | into Barry's care on 11 January.  |
|                                   | Because of this, Barry has to     |
|                                   | reduce hours of work and provides |
|                                   | a revised estimate of $40,000.    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The estimate change is a          |
|                                   | non-income related change as it   |
|                                   | relates directly to a child       |
|                                   | coming into care. Therefore, the  |
|                                   | DOV is 11 January (date the       |
|                                   | family member came into Barry's   |
|                                   | care).                            |

|                                   | On 1 October, Diane lodges a      |
|                                   | claim for Paid Parental Leave     |
|                                   | (PPL) and FTB for the birth of a  |
|                                   | second child, born on 28 July. At |
|                                   | the same time, Diane provides a   |
|                                   | new estimate.                     |

|                                   | Diane receives a phone call from  |
|                                   | the processing team to discuss    |
|                                   | Diane's current year income       |
|                                   | estimate, to make sure PPL has    |
|                                   | been included and to determine    |
|                                   | the reason for the change in      |
|                                   | income. Diane advises that the    |
|                                   | change in income is due to a      |
|                                   | change in salary from 5 September |
|                                   | and is not related to the birth   |
|                                   | of the child.                     |

|                                   | As an income related change       |
|                                   | exists, the DOV of the income     |
|                                   | estimate is the date of           |
|                                   | notification, 1 October. The      |

|                                   | depend on whether it is a         |
