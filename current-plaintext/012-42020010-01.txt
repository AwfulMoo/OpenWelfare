This document outlines information on acupuncture accreditation for
Medicare.

Acupuncture items

Acupuncture items 193, 195, 197 and 199 in the Medicare Benefits
Schedule (MBS) are used by general practitioners (as defined in the
Health Insurance Act 1973) who are accredited acupuncturists.

Eligibility

The Joint Consultative Committee on Medical Acupuncture (JCCMA) receives
and assesses applications for medical acupuncture accreditation. The
Royal Australian College of General Practitioners advises Services
Australia of accredited acupuncturists.

The JCCMA is a tripartite committee with representatives from:

-   the Australian Medical Acupuncture College (AMAC)
-   Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP)
-   Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine (ACRRM)

Accreditation is available to all medical practitioners however, only
recognised general practitioners who are accredited acupuncturists can
access MBS items 193, 195, 197 and 199.

When the medical practitioner ceases to be a 'general practitioner' they
are no longer eligible to access the general practitioner acupuncture
MBS items.

contact details.

General practitioner

A general practitioner is defined in the Health Insurance Act 1973 and
supporting Regulations as a medical practitioner who:

holds specialist registration in the specialty of General practice with
the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra)

holds general registration as a General practitioner on the Vocational
Register

is in an approved program placement which gives them access to General
Practitioner MBS items, for example, general practice training (GPET)
placement, or

is a medical practitioner registered in an approved 'other medical
practitioner' program at an eligible location, such as:

-   the Rural Other Medical Practitioners program
-   the Outer Metro Other Medical Practitioners program
-   MedicarePlus Other Medical Practitioners program

Access to Medicare benefits

Eligibility provides access to the general practitioner acupuncture
items in the MBS. Further information about the items and rules is in
the MBS.

Payment of Medicare benefits for these services is subject to the
general practitioner being registered with Ahpra and satisfying any
other legislative provisions that may apply at the date of service.
