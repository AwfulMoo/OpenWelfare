Update a Centrelink care record

Centrelink 'pending', 'preliminary' or 'deleted' care records starting
on or after 01/07/2010 (3^(rd) March 2011 for WA Ex-nuptial cases) are
updated via data exchange for mutual customers.

Note: only update a Centrelink care record in Cuba manually where the
care percentage in the Cuba record is incorrect. This includes
situations where a third party is involved (refer to Care - Additional
Carers intray) or where parties have reconciled (refer to Care - Case
Review Required intray). For other updates, either warm transfer the
customer to Centrelink or notify Centrelink of the update required.

Steps for updating a Centrelink care record

This table describes the process for updating an 'accepted' Centrelink
care record. The Care Details of an accepted Centrelink care records can
be updated based on new Centrelink information, except for the 'Type'
and 'Status' fields.

|                                   |     record. For example: a payee  |

|                                   |     Grandma has 40%. The          |
|                                   |     Centrelink care record        |
|                                   |     received shows the payee with |
|                                   |     60% care. Cuba incorrectly    |
|                                   |     defaults the remaining 40%    |
|                                   |     care to the payer and not     |
|                                   |     Grandma. In this instance,    |
|                                   |     update the care to show 60%   |
|                                   |     care to payee and 0% care to  |

|                                   |     Centrelink will transfer care |
|                                   |     as 100% to one party and 0%   |

Check Centrelink Care Indicators

When care information is transferred via the data exchange, Cuba looks
at the type of information being exchanged in order of the hierarchy and
creates an intray based on the first indicator identified. Once an
indicator is identified, Cuba stops processing for that care record and
creates the Centrelink intray type based on the first indicator that was
identified.

The type of Centrelink intray that generates is based on the following
intray hierarchy.

1.  Care - Data Mismatch
2.  Care - New Child
3.  Care - Potential Reconciliation
4.  Care - Review of Decision Rcvd
5.  Care - Additional Carers
6.  Care - Interim Determination
7.  Care - Case Review Required

Example: A care record is received with both an Additional Carer
indicator and Objection Review indicator set to Finalised. As the Care -
Review of Decision rcvd intray has a higher ranking in the hierarchy
this intray will be created - the Care - Additional Carers intray will
not generate.

Where multiple children of the customer each have care records sent,
only one Centrelink intray will create for the customer regardless of
how many indicators are attached to each child's record.

If Cuba cannot determine which intray to create or what action needs to
be taken, the Centrelink Care - Case Review Required intray will create
as a fall-back measure.

It is important not to finalise the intray until all indicators have
been identified and actioned appropriately. Where a Centrelink intray
has been deleted prior to all relevant indicators being actioned, a
Centrelink intray will continue to recreate on the customer until all
indicators have been addressed.

Note: where Child Support has made a decision not to add a new child as
a relevant dependent child (for example as the new child record has been
received on the step parent) to an assessment a Centrelink intray may
continue to generate on the customer. Currently there is no way to
exclude this information in the data exchange.

Steps to check Centrelink Care Indicators

This table describes how to finalise a Centrelink care record to prevent
Centrelink care intrays from recreating unnecessarily where possible.
