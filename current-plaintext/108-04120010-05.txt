| 1                                 | Examples of circumstances where   |
|                                   | it may be unreasonable to expect  |
|                                   | the sale of an asset:             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A farm operated as a partnership  |
|                                   | and the partnership agreement     |
|                                   | prevents partnership assets being |
|                                   | sold. A copy of the partnership   |
|                                   | agreement would be considered     |
|                                   | evidence of this arrangement      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A pending property settlement.    |
|                                   | Verification via court papers or  |
|                                   | solicitor details would be        |
|                                   | examples of evidence              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A farm comprising several parcels |
|                                   | of land may be operated as the    |
|                                   | one farming enterprise. It is not |
|                                   | unreasonable to expect a customer |
|                                   | to sell some of the land if the   |
|                                   | viability of the enterprise and   |
|                                   | the income of the customer are    |
|                                   | not likely to be significantly    |
|                                   | affected. The customer's          |
|                                   | statement as to the necessity of  |
|                                   | a parcel of land for the          |
|                                   | viability of the farm should be   |
|                                   | accepted                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If a customer is unable to sell   |
|                                   | the property without the consent  |
|                                   | of other tenants-in-common and    |
|                                   | the tenants refuse to sell. The   |
|                                   | customer's statement is           |
|                                   | sufficient verification that the  |
|                                   | owner(s) of property refuse to    |
|                                   | sell, or refuse to mortgage the   |
|                                   | property                          |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | accepted if the family member has |
|                                   | worked the property continuously  |
|                                   | since leaving school) and the     |
