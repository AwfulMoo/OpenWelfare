This document outlines information about the screens used to record
Service Profile information on a customer's record. Service Profiling is
a way of selectively targeting Centrelink services and assistance to our
customers. Service Profiling identifies which customers need a more
focused/targeted level of service to assist them in meeting program
outcomes (e.g. declaring their income and assets).

Customer Profiles

Customers are placed in Profiles, based on the Predictors that already
exist on the customer's record. It is important to note that this is
information that already exists on the customer's record (for example,
the length of time on payment, address history, any overpayments,
relationship status, children in care etc.). Service Profiling simply
automates the process of going through a customer's record to determine
this information.

A summary of all current Profiles for the customer is displayed on the
Profile Summary (PQS) screen. Further information for each Profile can
be viewed on the Profile Details (PQD) screen. There is also a history
of the customer's Profiles on the Profile History (PQH) screen.
