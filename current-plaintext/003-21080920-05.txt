Due to changes in relevant areas deemed a COVID-19 hotspot since August
2021, staff must carefully check which of the 3 impact reasons and
relevant area a customer is claiming under.

Customers claiming the COVID-19 Disaster Payment can claim under 1 of 3
impact reasons

-   L - live or work in a relevant area subject to a state public health
    order for restricted movement that is a deemed a COVID-19 hotspot by
    the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer, or
-   P - were present in a COVID-19 hotspot at the time the restricted
    movement was declared and are now subject to a second public health
    order that restricts their movement in the state or territory they
    are currently in, or
-   I - live or work in a state or territory that has an area subject to
    a state public health order for restricted movement by the
    Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer
    Note: for online claims, this shows as ‘I am impacted by a COVID-19
    restricted movement/lockdown, but do not live, work and was not
    present in a COVID-19 hotspot area’

For relevant period 14, customers will only be able to apply:

if they received payment ($200) for relevant period 13 and continue to
meet the eligibility criteria

under 1 impact reason:

-   F - received the final payment that was released in the relevant
    period in which the 80% target was met. Note: while this is not 1 of
    the 3 impact reasons a customer can claim under for earlier relevant
    periods, for the final relevant period, it is the only option a
    customer can claim under. The customer must have previously received
    a payment for 1 of the 3 impact reasons to receive a payment for the
    final relevant period

Greater Melbourne/Golden Plains and Greater Melbourne RP 1-5

Table 1: shows the impact reasons a customer can claim, depending on the

Due to changes in relevant areas deemed a COVID-19 hotspot since August
2021, staff must carefully check which of the 3 impact reasons and
relevant area a customer is claiming under.

Customers claiming the COVID-19 Disaster Payment can claim under 1 of 3
impact reasons

-   L - live or work in a relevant area subject to a state public health
    order for restricted movement that is a deemed a COVID-19 hotspot by
    the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer, or
-   P - were present in a COVID-19 hotspot at the time the restricted
    movement was declared and are now subject to a second public health
    order that restricts their movement in the state or territory they
    are currently in, or
-   I - live or work in a state or territory that has an area subject to
    a state public health order for restricted movement by the
    Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer
    Note: for online claims, this shows as ‘I am impacted by a COVID-19
    restricted movement/lockdown, but do not live, work and was not
    present in a COVID-19 hotspot area’

For relevant period 14, customers will only be able to apply:

if they received payment ($200) for relevant period 13 and continue to
meet the eligibility criteria

under 1 impact reason:

-   F - received the final payment that was released in the relevant
    period in which the 80% target was met. Note: while this is not 1 of
    the 3 impact reasons a customer can claim under for earlier relevant
    periods, for the final relevant period, it is the only option a
    customer can claim under. The customer must have previously received
    a payment for 1 of the 3 impact reasons to receive a payment for the
    final relevant period

Geospatial tool

Due to changes in the relevant areas deemed a COVID-19 hotspot for
different parts of Victoria since August 2021, staff must use this tool
to carefully check the relevant area a customer is claiming under to
determine if they live, work or were present in a COVID-19 hotspot area
for the relevant period.

Note: for customers outside a COVID-19 hotspot, staff need to check the
residential and/or employer addresses provided for the relevant period
are in Victoria.

To assess if a customer lives, works or was present in a relevant area:

-   Open the VIC Live Feed App
-   Place the address given by the customer in the search box.
    Residential, employer and/or present in addresses may need to be
    checked
-   Select the correct address that populates in the drop down

When using the Victoria geospatial tool:
- blue are areas deemed hotspots
- red are areas not deemed hotspots
Select the layer based on the relevant period the customer is claiming.
The colours will help staff work out which impact reason the customer
can claim.
The colours do not represent which workflow to use. Go to Check the
relevant area so the correct workflow is run below on how to select the
