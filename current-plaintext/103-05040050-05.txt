|                                   | This tool is used where a         |
|                                   | customer in exceptional           |
|                                   | circumstances needs to make a     |

|                                   | This would allow the customer to  |

|                                   | advance and subsequently, if      |
|                                   | eligible, apply for a new         |

|                                   | Problem: Customer has an          |
|                                   | outstanding balance on their      |
|                                   | advance payment of $78.03. The    |
|                                   | Service Officer incorrectly       |
|                                   | rounds this amount up $78.05 and  |
|                                   | issues a receipt to the customer  |
|                                   | for this amount. However, the     |
|                                   | outstanding balance will not      |
|                                   | update when the Advance Payments  |
|                                   | workflow is run.                  |

|                                   | Solution: Do not round up the     |
|                                   | amount outstanding, or accept a   |
|                                   | repayment that is greater than    |
|                                   | the actual outstanding balance.   |
|                                   | In this example, the customer     |
|                                   | could repay the outstanding       |
|                                   | amount by a cheque for $78.03, or |
|                                   | by cash of no more than $78.00.   |
|                                   | If cash of $78.00 is accepted,    |
|                                   | then there will still be $0.03    |
|                                   | cents outstanding, which will be  |
|                                   | recovered from the next           |
|                                   | fortnightly payment. This is      |
|                                   | correct processing.               |

|                                   | Problem: Customer had an          |
|                                   | outstanding advance payment of    |
|                                   | $420.00. They attended the        |
|                                   | Service Centre and repaid the     |
|                                   | amount, but this was not recorded |
|                                   | in ESSentials until 2 days later. |
|                                   | Another deduction was made from   |
|                                   | their fortnightly payment. The    |
|                                   | Service Officer was then unable   |
|                                   | to update the outstanding         |
|                                   | balance, as the balance was now   |
|                                   | lower than the amount repaid.     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Solution: Record the repayment in |

|                                   | possible after the cash is        |
|                                   | received. It is the               |

|                                   | staff to ensure that they have    |

|                                   | will mean that after the          |

|                                   | (advance 1) and $59.50 (advance   |

|                                   | accepts $114.10 and issues an     |
|                                   | ESSentials receipt for this       |
|                                   | amount. Then the Service Officer  |

|                                   | outstanding advance to enable a   |
|                                   | new advance application to be     |
|                                   | granted. The Service Officer      |
|                                   | accepts the cash, issues the      |
|                                   | receipt, and uses the workflow to |
|                                   | update the outstanding balance to |
|                                   | nil. The Service Officer then     |
|                                   | processes a new advance payment   |
|                                   | application, which rejects        |
|                                   | because there were other reasons  |
|                                   | preventing the payment of an      |
|                                   | advance.                          |

|                                   | In an attempt to solve this, the  |
|                                   | Service Officer then returns the  |
|                                   | cash to the customer and cancels  |
|                                   | the receipt. The Service Officer  |
|                                   | then discovers that they are not  |
|                                   | able to restore the balance of    |

|                                   | to its previous amount, as once   |
|                                   | the balance becomes nil no        |
|                                   | further alterations can be made.  |

|                                   | wish to proceed with the cash     |
|                                   | repayment if it will not assist   |

|                                   | For FTB advance payments only, an |
|                                   | outstanding advance balance of    |
|                                   | less than $0.05 is disregarded    |
|                                   | when calculating the maximum      |
|                                   | advance payment amount available  |
|                                   | to a customer but the amount is   |
|                                   | still recovered from the          |
|                                   | customer's next payment of FTB    |
|                                   | Part A.                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | For social security payment       |
|                                   | advance payments, any outstanding |
|                                   | amount (even where less than      |
|                                   | $0.05) is taken into account in   |
|                                   | the calculation of the available  |
|                                   | amount when determining           |
|                                   | entitlement to a new advance      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Example: Customer on maximum rate |
|                                   | DSP wishes to claim another       |
|                                   | advance. Maximum advance amount   |
|                                   | was $1192.80 and customer was     |
|                                   | previously paid an advance of     |
|                                   | $795.00. This left an amount of   |
|                                   | $397.80 still available. Customer |
|                                   | has repaid all but $0.04 of the   |
|                                   | first advance. Available amount   |
|                                   | today is only $397.76 as amount   |
|                                   | is reduced by outstanding balance |
|                                   | of previous amount. As this is    |
|                                   | more than the minimum amount of   |
|                                   | $397.60, customer can be paid     |
|                                   | advance amount. (Rates current at |
|                                   | March 2014).                      |
