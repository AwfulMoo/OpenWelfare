Search for and retrieve archived records

The Customer Archive Retrieval (CAR) allows staff to retrieve, view and
print archived customer data that has been stored off-line. The
procedures in this topic explain how to search for and retrieve archived
records.

Services Australia collects huge quantities of data in the course of its
normal operations, both via computer and from paper sources. This topic
refers only to electronic data stored on the agency's computer systems.
To keep the system manageable, there is a need to periodically remove
data that is no longer needed online. Some data is archived, while
dispensable data is culled out.

When records and information that is no longer available online are
needed by Service Officers or other agency staff, these must be able to
be retrieved from the archives.

The CAR system has been designed to store historical data, including
advices produced by the Online/Batch Laser Advice (OLA/BLA) system,
payment details, activities, group deduction notices, and childcare
listings, to name just some. Not all records are archived in CAR - other
historical data may be found on the Income Security Integrated System
(ISIS), Archiving and Culling Engine (ACE) or microfiche.

The Resources page has tips on using CAR.
