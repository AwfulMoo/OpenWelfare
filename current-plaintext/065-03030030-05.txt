+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Details                           | The Age Pension New Claim (Submit |
|                                   | and DOC) script is run from       |
|                                   | Customer Record when an Age       |
|                                   | Pension claim is ready to be      |
|                                   | submitted. The script will submit |
|                                   | the activity and create a DOC     |
|                                   | containing relevant information   |
|                                   | from the record, including income |
|                                   | and assets with the exception of  |
|                                   | employment income. A DOC will     |
|                                   | also be recorded on the partner's |
|                                   | record if the partner is also     |
|                                   | claiming Age Pension.             |

|                                   | management' DOC is not created on |
|                                   | the record, as this Trial has     |
|                                   | ceased. Removal of this DOC is    |
|                                   | mandatory to ensure customer      |
|                                   | records accurately reflect the    |
|                                   | assessment method used and meet   |
