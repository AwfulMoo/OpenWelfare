For Data Quality Unit (DQU) staff only.

This document outlines information to assist in identifying a customer's
primary Customer Reference Number (CRN). This process is for Data
Quality Unit (DQU) staff only.

Multiple records

Multiple records can be detected when:

-   a national index and/or Multiple Match List (MML) search presents
    multiple matches for the same customer
-   processing a CLI/MLC activity confirms that a multiple record exists
-   the Service Delivery Network (SDN) refer customer data to DQU via
    the Multiple CRN Fastnote Referral

When multiple records are identified for the same customer, the case
must be referred to DQU using the Multiple CRN Fastnote Referral to
determine which record is the customer's 'primary' record. The remaining
record(s) are referred to as 'multiple' records.

Customers may have other types of records, for example, Unauthenticated
Online Entity (UOE) which are not considered 'multiples'.
