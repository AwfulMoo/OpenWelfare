|                                   | When the ATO loads the customer’s |

|                                   | Integrated Core Processing (ICP), |

|                                   | is recorded in Cuba which may be  |

|                                   | Sometimes the ATO makes           |

|                                   | have selected a customer’s tax    |
|                                   | return for additional analysis.   |
|                                   | When the ATO reprocesses the tax  |
|                                   | return, they may add income that  |
|                                   | was not initially declared by the |
|                                   | customer.                         |

|                                   | When the income is reprocessed, a |
|                                   | second income message is sent to  |
|                                   | Child Support. This results in an |
|                                   | additional taxable income (not an |
|                                   | Amended Taxable Income) for the   |
|                                   | same financial year being loaded  |
|                                   | in Cuba.                          |

|                                   | As the first and second incomes   |
|                                   | loaded in Cuba relate to the same |
|                                   | tax return, the lodgement dates   |
|                                   | will be the same on both incomes. |
|                                   | The second taxable income is the  |
|                                   | correct income for Child Support  |
|                                   | to use in the assessment. It      |
|                                   | represents the final amount as    |
|                                   | assessed by the ATO.              |

|                                   | A second taxable income may also  |
|                                   | be received when the ATO have     |
|                                   | completely cancelled the first    |
|                                   | tax return and replaced it with a |
|                                   | re-lodged return. The 2 incomes   |
|                                   | loaded in Cuba may often have     |
