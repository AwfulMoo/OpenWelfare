| 1                                 | James is travelling to New        |
|                                   | Zealand to appear as a witness in |
|                                   | an assault case + Read more ...   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | James is in receipt of JobSeeker  |
|                                   | Payment (JSP) and receives a      |
|                                   | letter from the New Zealand       |
|                                   | Department of Public Prosecutions |
|                                   | (DPP). The letter states James is |
|                                   | required to appear as a witness   |
|                                   | on 20 November in a court case    |
|                                   | against a person charged with     |
|                                   | assault. The DPP would also like  |
|                                   | to discuss the case with James on |
|                                   | 15 November. James is leaving on  |
|                                   | 13 November and will remain until |
|                                   | 22 November. This is a reasonable |
|                                   | absence and JSP is paid for the   |
|                                   | whole absence.                    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | On 20 November James contacts to  |
|                                   | advise that the court hearing was |
|                                   | postponed until 14 December and   |
|                                   | so is staying with parents until  |
|                                   | 16 December. James is not         |
|                                   | eligible to receive payment for   |
|                                   | the intervening period and        |
|                                   | payment will still cease on 22    |
|                                   | November.                         |

|                                   | Peter is a refugee from Europe    |
|                                   | currently receiving JSP and       |
|                                   | wishes to return to the country   |
|                                   | of birth to lodge a claim for     |
|                                   | war-related compensation. In this |
|                                   | case, Peter's JSP is not payable  |
|                                   | due to the following              |
|                                   | considerations:                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   Peter is instigating the      |
|                                   |     proceedings on his own behalf |
|                                   | -   the case is a civil           |
|                                   |     proceeding for financial gain |
|                                   |     where Peter is not 'required' |
|                                   |     to attend a court case        |
|                                   |     (failure to attend would      |
|                                   |     result in the claim being     |
|                                   |     rejected), and                |
|                                   | -   this type of claim could be   |
|                                   |     dealt with by a legal         |
|                                   |     representative in Peter's     |

|                                   | (YA) as a Jobseeker. Gary is      |
|                                   | travelling to Indonesia as part   |
|                                   | of a Red Cross volunteer team to  |
|                                   | assist in earthquake relief       |
|                                   | effort for 2 months.              |

|                                   | type reason for travel, it does   |
|                                   | not fall under the Social         |
|                                   | Security Act definition of        |
|                                   | humanitarian reason, and          |
|                                   | therefore is not an approved      |
|                                   | reason for payment. Gary's        |
|                                   | payment will stop on the          |
|                                   | departure date and may be         |
|                                   | restored if Gary returns to       |
|                                   | Australia within 13 weeks.        |

|                                   | expected that any preliminary     |

|                                   | Australia by correspondence or    |
|                                   | phone. In addition, these matters |
|                                   | can take a long time and only     |
|                                   | require occasional attention from |
|                                   | the customer.                     |

|                                   | lead to qualification for the     |
|                                   | Paralympic Games. Two days is     |
|                                   | acceptable travel time, so David  |
|                                   | can be paid DSP for the duration  |
|                                   | of his trip 10 March to 22 March. |
