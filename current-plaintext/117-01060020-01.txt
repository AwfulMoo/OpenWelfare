This document outlines how to finalise a manual compensation claim on
the Compensation Management System (CMS).

Finalising compensation claims

Compensation claims can be finalised if:

-   The customer or their solicitor advises no further claim for
    compensation can or will be made
-   The compensation payer advises no compensation payment received and
    their file is closed
-   Periodic compensation is ongoing and neither the customer nor their
    partner is receiving a compensation affected payment
-   Reasonable action has been taken to obtain compensation but no claim
    is proceeding

Only the Compensation Recovery Team (CRT) can finalise a compensation
claim.
