This document outlines how to use the Quality and Support Tool (QST) for
quality checking. It includes the process for disputing quality checking
error results and how to submit work for pre-checking.

Quality and Support Tool (QST)

The QST randomly selects and allocates work for quality checking.

Using the QST enables Quality Checkers to:

-   positively acknowledge staff by providing quality checking feedback
-   identify learning and development opportunities for staff by
    providing quality checking feedback
-   identify and develop process improvements

The QST:

-   provides quality checking results for analysis of errors and trends
-   supports our quality commitment towards the Enterprise Quality
    Framework

Quality Checkers

Quality checking in the QST is completed by accredited Quality Checkers.

Quality Checker's must complete:

-   quality checking accreditation skills assessment
-   QST training
-   refresher training every 12 months to retain accreditation

Quality checking own work

Quality Checkers cannot check their own work. This maintains the
integrity of the quality checking results.

The QST has been coded to not allocate any files to Quality Checkers
that were originally completed by them.

Quality checking disputes

Service Officers can initiate a quality checking dispute if they believe
they have received incorrect feedback or an unwarranted error. But first
Service Officers must refer to their QC feedback email and speak to
their Team Leader.

Types of checks

The following checks are completed using the QST

-   Pre-check
-   Targeted check
-   Programme check
