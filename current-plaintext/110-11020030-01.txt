This document outlines requirements for a brief of evidence once a
decision has been made to refer an investigation to the Commonwealth
Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP).

Purpose of the brief

The brief of evidence provides all relevant material so a matter can be
assessed for prosecution action. Briefs must be in a standard format to
allow the CDPP to:

-   evaluate the brief
-   understand the allegations
-   assess the evidence against the allegations
-   decide what charges are available against whom and whether charges
    should be laid
-   identify what further evidence the investigator should attempt to
    obtain
-   provide appropriate disclosure of the prosecution case to the
    defence
-   prosecute the case in court

Format and content of brief

The approved template should be used to ensure the brief:

-   contains all necessary evidence to prove the alleged offence which
    alleviates the need for the CDPP to request additional material
-   is set out in a logical and standard order
-   contains concise analysis, comments and observations
-   includes necessary disclosure information

The Resources page contains a link to the CDPP secure Partner Agencies
portal.
