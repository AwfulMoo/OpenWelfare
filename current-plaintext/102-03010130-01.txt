This document outlines what happens when an ABSTUDY customer has
returned to their parental home when in receipt of the Away from Home
rate.

On this Page:

Away from Home (AFH)

The Away from Home (AFH) rate of ABSTUDY is a higher rate of payment
available to students or Australian Apprentices who are required to live
away from the parental home in order to:

-   access full-time study, or
-   undertake a full-time Australian Apprenticeship

Customers who are currently receiving the AFH rate may return to the
parental home:

-   temporarily, or
-   permanently

If the customer returns temporarily, their reasons for doing so should
be investigated to see if their rate of payment and/or entitlement to
Rent Assistance (RA) should be reviewed.

From 1 January 2020, customers aged 16-19 years receiving a means tested
ABSTUDY payment (such as Living Allowance and/or School Fees Allowance
(Group 2)) can still be considered an FTB child if they are:

-   a full time secondary student
-   approved to live away from home to study, and
-   boarding to attend secondary school

Temporary return to the parental home

If it is a temporary return, in order to keep receiving the AFH rate,
the customer must have:

-   returned home to undertake a part of their course (for example,
    practical training) for up to one term/semester (depending on the
    structure of the course)
-   returned home during a vacation period, (secondary students only)
-   returned home during a vacation period and continue to maintain
    their secondary location residence (secondary non-schooling,
    tertiary students or Australian Apprentice), or
-   returned home for a short visit (for example, a weekend visit)

If the customer has not returned for a valid reason, their eligibility
for ABSTUDY and/or Rent Assistance (RA) may be affected.

If the customer is entitled to continue to receive the AFH rate they
must notify Services Australia within 14 days of any changes in their
circumstances, including if they:

-   cease their course or training
-   cease their Australian Apprenticeship
-   change their rent details, or
-   return to their parental home permanently

Tertiary students impacted by COVID-19

During the COVID-19 pandemic which occurred in Australia from March
2020, some students were required to leave their on campus term
accommodation. Many students also transitioned to online study as
face-to-face teaching was unavailable.

Students who were receiving the Away from Home (AFH) rate, and
temporarily transitioned to online learning as a result of COVID-19
remain eligible for the AFH rate. Tertiary students must return to
face-to-face study as soon as it becomes available to continue to be
eligible for the AFH rate.

Where a student had to move out of education provider accommodation
(such as on campus) and are, or were temporarily staying with their
parents, they will remain eligible for the AFH rate providing they:

-   remain enrolled in their course of study, and
-   intend to return to their campus accommodation as soon as the
    education provider allows them to return

This includes students who:

-   had their accommodation arrangement cancelled by the education
    provider and have moved their belongings out of that accommodation
-   were approved for Residential Cost Option (RCO)

Note: the AFH rate of ABSTUDY Living Allowance can be paid for any
period that the education provider does not charge a residential fee,
rather than the reduced rate of Living Allowance.

Permanent return to the parental home

If the customer returns home permanently, they must continue to meet
their obligations under the study requirements for ABSTUDY or as an
Australian Apprentice their Commonwealth registration number must remain
current in relation to their Australian Apprenticeship for ongoing
entitlement to ABSTUDY. Their rate of payment and their entitlement to
Rent Assistance (RA) will be reviewed. Where applicable the customer's
independent status will also be reviewed.

If a parent/guardian has been receiving FTB for the customer:

-   FTB will cease to be paid for the customer if they are receiving
    ABSTUDY at home rate
-   FTB may still be payable for the customer if they are continuing in
    full-time secondary study and they are no longer receiving ABSTUDY

Independent customers

A customer who is approved for independent status is not in receipt of
the 'Away from Home' rate of payment, but instead receives a higher rate
of allowance that is determined by whether they live in, or away from
the parental home. An independent customer who returns to the parental
home will require a review of independence for ABSTUDY.
