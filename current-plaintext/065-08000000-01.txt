This document outlines the Home Equity Access Scheme (the Scheme) to
help Service Officers answer enquiries from customers, and escalate
questions that are more complex.

Government intent

Customers and self-funded retirees who are Age Pension age (or partnered
to a person who is) can access equity in their Australian real estate
asset(s) under the Home Equity Access Scheme to supplement their
retirement income.

What is the Scheme

The Scheme is a voluntary arrangement that provides financial support to
customers in the form of a non-taxable, government funded loan.

The loan:

-   accrues compound interest each fortnight, currently 3.95% per annum,
    until repaid in full
-   is secured against Australian real estate owned by the customer
    and/or partner

Customers:

can repay the loan electronically in full or in part at any time through
their Centrelink online account or BPAY® even though there are no
mandatory repayments

must settle the loan:

-   at the sale of the secured property, or
-   through the deceased customer’s estate

The Scheme loans are paid as an advance lump sum, fortnightly payments
or a combination of both for a short or indefinite period until their
loan balance reaches their Maximum Loan Amount.

The Maximum Loan Amount is based on the age of the customer and partner
(if applicable) and how much equity there is to offer as security.

Tell customers they should seek independent legal or financial advice
before applying for a loan under the Scheme.

Background

The original Scheme was set up in 1985 when the assets test was
introduced.

On 10 July 1996, a new scheme commenced and new applications were no
longer accepted under the old provisions.

On 1 July 2019, the current scheme expanded:

-   to increase the maximum fortnightly loan rate, and
-   the eligibility criteria to allow more people to participate

Before 1 July 2019, to be eligible the customer’s qualifying payment
rate had to be a reduced rate because of their income or assets. Nil
rate customers could apply as long as their pension rate was reduced to
nil by only one (not both) of the income or assets tests. These
requirements were removed from 1 July 2019, enabling maximum rate
pensioners to participate in the scheme, and people who are not eligible
for a pension under both the income test and assets test.

On 1 January 2022, the Scheme was renamed to the Home Equity Access
Scheme.

On 1 July 2022, the Scheme introduced access to lump sum advances and a
No Negative Equity Guarantee.

Service Officer role in the Scheme

The role of Service Officers (frontline and telephony) is to:

answer basic questions about the Scheme using Operational Blueprint

provide information such as the Scheme eligibility

support customers to claim or make changes to their Scheme payments
using digital channels

refer an authenticated Scheme customer to the Home Equity Access Scheme
Summary screen in the Centrelink online account for their loan details

Escalate enquiries to a Complex Assessment Officer (CAO)

Do not escalate general enquires about claim timeliness or the progress
of a claim.

If a customer asks about their Scheme claim, confirm a claim has been
lodged and advise it will be allocated for processing in due course.

If the customer asks for priority processing, see Immediate new claim
and non-new claim priority processing to assess the customer’s
circumstances. Requests for urgent processing may be appropriate if
Service Officers identify a customer as being at risk.

Financial hardship provisions do not apply to the processing of Scheme
claims, however if the customer asks for priority processing, see
Request for urgent processing of a new claim when experiencing financial
hardship.

Enquiry types that may be escalated include:

-   making a repayment or settling a Scheme loan
-   when instructed by Operational Blueprint

To escalate an enquiry to a CAO, see Home Equity Access Scheme.

Scheme eligibility and applications

See:

-   Eligibility for the Home Equity Access Scheme
-   Home Equity Access Scheme - only customers
-   Claiming a Home Equity Access Scheme loan including required
    documentation

Impact of the Scheme on other income support payments

The loan amount a customer owes under the Scheme can be deducted from
the value of the customer's assessable real estate for social security
payments or benefits.

As the amount owing increases with each payment made under the Scheme:

-   the value of the customer's assessable assets may decrease
    (depending on whether the value of the asset is appreciating)
-   their pension payable under the assets test may increase, and
-   this may lead to the customer’s fortnightly loan amount reducing

No reduction in the overall value of assessable assets occurs where the
person's principal home is the security for the loan as this is an
exempt or non-assessable asset. The only exception is when the principal
home is partly assessable because the house and curtilage exceeds 2
hectares and does not meet the extended land use test.

Home Equity Access Scheme only customers

The Scheme is also open to self-funded retirees so long as they qualify
for (but not necessarily receive) one of the qualifying pensions.

This may be because they:

-   are not eligible to receive a pension under the income and assets
    test, or
-   have chosen not to claim a pension

Customers who receive their entire payment as a Scheme loan without any
qualifying payment components are ‘the loan-only’ customers. These
customers do not meet the definition of an income support payment (ISP)
recipient, as they do not receive a payable rate of a social security
pension or benefit.

Service Officers can identify a loan-only customer if the Scheme
qualifying payment is Current Zero Rate (CZR) because of nil rate reason
PLS.

The loan-only customers are not entitled to a Pensioner Concession Card
(PCC). However some customers may have a grandfathered entitlement to a
non-pensioner PCC (see Pensioner Concession Cards (PCC) for details).
Customers who wish to test their eligibility for a concession card can
lodge an online claim for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card (CSHC).

Customers that get their income support payment entirely as a loan
payment under the Scheme, can only be transferred to Age Pension.

Before transferring a Scheme only customer to Age Pension, Age
Processing must contact the Home Equity Access Scheme National team to
determine if the transfer is appropriate.

See Home Equity Access Scheme reviews for more details.

Payment method

The Scheme loan payments are paid as a rate component of the qualifying
pension

Loan payments display on the Payment Details (PD) screen as:

-   LON for fortnightly payments, and
-   LONA for advance payments

For the loan-only customers, this is the only component that displays

The loan information displays on the Home Equity Access Scheme Summary
screen in the customer’s Centrelink online account

Rate payable

The maximum Scheme rate payable per fortnight is 150% of the maximum
payment rate of the qualifying payment (1.5 times the maximum payment
rate of the qualifying payment)

The maximum payment rate is the sum of the maximum basic rate of
pension, and any supplements (for example, Pension Supplement and Energy
Supplement) and Rent Assistance a person is eligible for

Customers can get:

-   fortnightly payments
-   lump sum advances, or
-   a combination of both

If a customer has received an advance payment, the maximum fortnightly
amount available reduces if the customer has received an advance payment
in the last 26 fortnights

Customers can choose the amount of fortnightly payment that they would
like to get

They can choose to get:

-   the maximum amount available (loan type ‘maximum’), being 150% (1.5
    times) the maximum payment rate
-   a percentage that is lower than 150% (loan type ‘percent’). For
    example, 120% p/f (maximum payment rate x 1.2) or 80% (maximum
    payment rate x 0.8), or
-   a fixed flat rate (loan type ‘fixed’) for example, $500 p/f

If a customer gets a pension:

the loan is added to the pension each fortnight

the combined amount of pension and loan can’t exceed 150% of the maximum
payment rate

the loan amount will automatically increase or decrease:

-   if their pension rate changes in order to maintain their chosen
    percentage for that fortnight (which may be 150% or a lower percent)

if a customer does not want their loan amount to increase over a certain
amount:

-   they can choose to receive a fixed loan amount each fortnight

the combined fixed rate of loan and actual pension rate can’t exceed
150% of the maximum rate of pension

If the customer or their partner received a Department of Veterans'
Affairs disability payment before 1 January 2022, their maximum payment
rate for the Scheme purposes would have been affected by any Defence
Force Income Support Allowance (DFISA) they received. The maximum Scheme
rate was reduced by the amount of DFISA received. This was to ensure
that a person could not receive more in income support payments than the
maximum payment rate.

The Resources page has examples of rates payable.

Advance Payments

-   Customers can apply under the Scheme to get advance payments of a
    loan secured against their Australian real estate
-   The most customers can advance in a 26 fortnight period is 50% of
    their annual maximum pension rate. There is a limit of 2 advance
    payments in a 26 fortnight period
-   The Scheme also provides the option for customer to get fortnightly
    loan payments, however customers do not need to get fortnightly
    payments to apply for an advance payment
-   Advance payments of the loan may reduce the maximum fortnightly loan
    amount available to the customer for 26 fortnights (364 days from
    the date the advance is granted)
-   Advance payments of the loan are added to the customer’s loan
    balance, and must be repaid to the Commonwealth. Interest is
    calculated on the loan balance, compounding fortnightly

See Advance payments for Home Equity Access Scheme loans for more
details.

No Negative Equity Guarantee (NNEG)

The NNEG only applies when a customer settles their Scheme loan

Customers are not required to repay more than the current market value
of the property/s used as security, less any mortgages or encumbrances

The NNEG will not apply if a customer:

-   intentionally increases encumbrances (such as mortgage) on the
    secured property and limits the Commonwealth’s ability to recover
    the full amount of the loan balance, or
-   misrepresents their circumstances while participating in the Scheme,
    or
-   commits fraud

Maximum Loan Amount (MLA)

The MLA:

is the loan balance at which a person’s fortnightly payments will stop,
and/or they will not be eligible for an advance payment

depends on:

-   the value of their equity in Australian real estate, and
-   their Scheme age component based on the customer’s age, or in some
    cases their partner’s age if they are younger

is not necessarily a fixed set amount

is re-calculated:

-   at least once every 12 months when the person’s age component is
    reassessed on their (or their younger partner’s) birthday
-   when there’s a change in circumstances (for example, changed value
    of the secured real estate, separation)

Complex Assessment Officers (CAO) assess MLA at the time of claim.

The customer:

can ask to change their MLA at any time via by completing a Home Equity
Access Scheme variation form (SA497)

can increase their MLA if they have enough loan security for the higher
amount:

-   if partnered, their partner must give written approval to increase
    the MLA
    Note: even if the partner is not named as an owner in the title
    certificate or title search of the property

Any requests to change the MLA can be done by completing a SA497.

See Security for the Home Equity Access Scheme on how the MLA is
calculated.

The Resources page contains links to the SA497 form and to the Payment
and Service Finder on the Services Australia website. This is where
customers are asked questions to see if they qualify for the Home Equity
Access Scheme.

The Scheme loan balance, legal costs and compound interest

The Scheme loan balance

The amount the customer must repay to the Commonwealth.

It is:

-   the sum of the principal loan payments made to the customer
-   plus legal costs
-   plus previously accrued interest
-   less any repayments made by the customer

Compound interest

Interest is charged on the loan balance each fortnight until the
outstanding loan balance is repaid in full.

As of 1 January 2022, the interest rate for the Scheme is 3.95% per
annum – compounding fortnightly.

Compound interest:

-   increases the amount the customer must repay to the Commonwealth,
    and
-   may mean the person’s total loan balance increases beyond their
    Maximum Loan Amount (MLA)

The interest rate is set by the Minister for Families and Social
Services, and is published in the Australian Government Gazette.

Itemised statement

Sent to customers around their (or their younger partner’s) birthday and
includes:

-   information about the loan amount paid including any advance
    payments
-   the interest accrued
-   the costs associated (such as legal costs)
-   the transaction (e.g. payments, repayments, interest accrual) on the
    loan

Legal costs

Costs incurred by the Commonwealth in registering, changing and removing
the charge and/or caveat on the real estate used by the customer to
secure repayment of the loan.

These costs:

-   depend on the customer’s circumstances (e.g. how many properties
    they offer)
-   are payable by the customer
-   get added to their Scheme loan balance
-   accrue compound interest

The agency notifies the customer in writing when the legal costs are
added. The customer can choose to pay the costs immediately or at
another time.

Consent required for online requests

-   If a nominee requests a change to the loan, customers must give
    their consent
-   Partnered customers making a request must have their partners
    consent. This includes if the partner does not own the security
    property

See Home Equity Access Scheme consent for more details.

Repaying Scheme loans

Electronic repayments are available using BPAY® and credit and debit
cards through Centrelink online account.

There are no mandatory repayments over the life of the loan.

The outstanding loan amount must be repaid:

immediately, when the property used to secure the loan is sold, or

in the event of the customers death or the death of their surviving
partner (if applicable)

-   the loan amount will be recovered from their estate unless a
    surviving partner is over Age Pension age, and
-   a Deceased Estate Letter is sent and is followed by a Deceased Loan
    Statement each year to the executor

See Repayment of Home Equity Access Scheme loans for more details.
