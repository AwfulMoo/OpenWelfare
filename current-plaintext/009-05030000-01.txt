DCLAD (2010) requirements

The Disability Care Load Assessment (child) Determination (DCLAD) (2010)
will require all CP (child) (excluding terminal care receivers) and CA
(child) (excluding List of Recognised Disabilities (LoRD) care
receivers) claimants to achieve a qualifying rating of 'intense'.

A qualifying rating of intense will be achieved if the carer and care
receiver have achieved a score of:

-   'greater than zero' on the Treating Health Professional (THP)
    functional assessment questions
-   85 or greater on the carer's Care Needs Assessment (CNA)

THP medical reports and a CNA form will assess the DCLAD 2010
eligibility criteria.

Re-use and reclaim provisions

For claims and reclaims of CP/CA (child), the most recent CNAs and
Medical Reports gathered under the following for new and existing carers
may be re-used if the carer, care receiver and the report meet re-use or
reclaim eligibility criteria:

-   Child Disability Assessment Determination (CDAD) 2001
-   DCLAD 2009
-   DCLAD 2010
-   List of Recognised Disabilities (LoRD) or
-   terminal condition assessment for CP (child) including those under
    pre 1 July 2009 Profoundly Disabled Child provisions

CP and CA Grandfathering provisions

The following carers will maintain qualification and payability under
Grandfathering provisions from 1 July 2010:

-   Carers current or suspended on 30 June 2010 who were granted CP
    (child) under DCLAD (2009) will maintain qualification and
    payability under their existing provisions until they are selected
    for review under DCLAD 2010 or lose qualification on or after 1
    July 2010. This group of care receivers will not appear on the
    carer's record.
-   Carers current or suspended on 30 June 2010 who were granted CA
    (child) under Child Disability Assessment Determination
    (CDAD) (2001) will maintain qualification and payability under their
    existing provisions until they are selected for review under DCLAD
    2010 or lose qualification. This group of care receivers will not
    appear on the carer's record. Note: if a carer of a CA (child) only
    claims CP and fails to receive a qualifying DCLAD 2010 score, their
    CA (child) will need to be manually cancelled as the new DCLAD 2010
    score overrides grandfathering provisions.
-   Carers current or suspended on 30 June 2010 who were granted CP
    (child) due to caring for a Profoundly Disabled Child (PDC) or for
    two children who require the equivalent care will maintain
    qualification and payability under PDC provisions until they are
    selected for review under DCLAD 2010 or lose qualification on or
    after 1 July 2010. Carers in this group who reclaim CP (child) for
    the same care receiver will be required to provide a DCLAD 2010 care
    load assessment and medical report from 1 July 2010. This group of
    care receivers will appear on the carer's record.
