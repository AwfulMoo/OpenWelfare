This document outlines information about Youth Allowance (YA) (job
seeker).

Government intent - Youth Allowance (YA) (job seeker)

YA (job seeker) is a payment made to young people aged 16 to 21 if they
are unemployed and satisfying their mutual obligation requirements as a
job seeker, or engaged in a combination of approved activities.

It is a more flexible payment allowing customers to change their
activities without having to change their payment type. YA job seekers
may have a temporary reduced work capacity, a partial capacity to work
(due to disability) or a part-time participation requirement (for the
principal carer of a dependent child).

Early School Leavers

Customers under 22 years of age and who have not completed year 12 (or
equivalent) or a Certificate III or higher, are identified as Early
School Leavers. They are required to undertake approved activities
and/or job search in order to qualify for payment of YA.
