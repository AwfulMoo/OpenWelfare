This document outlines the processes that apply when a job seeker fails
to attend or satisfactorily participate in a compulsory activity, using
the Targeted Compliance Framework.

Requirement to attend and satisfactorily participate in compulsory activities

Job seekers, including ParentsNext participants, receiving a
participation payment are required to attend and participate in
compulsory activities to help prepare them for the workforce.

Note: this excludes job seekers in Community Development Program (CDP)
as activities are voluntary in CDP.

The job seeker's Job/Participation Plan sets out the compulsory
activities they must attend and satisfactorily participate in.

Providers have responsibility for negotiating the compulsory activities
included in the Job/Participation Plan with the job seeker. As part of
this negotiation, job seekers are expected to take responsibility for
discussing with their provider any circumstances that have the potential
to impact on their ability to participate.

When negotiating a Job/Participation Plan, the provider must ensure:

-   compulsory activities are consistent with relevant legislation and
    policies
-   compulsory activities do not exceed the maximum hourly limits set in
    social security law
-   the job seeker's circumstances and assessed capacity have been
    appropriately considered
-   the job seeker is capable of meeting all the requirements in their
    Job/Participation Plan

Once the Job/Participation Plan is agreed to, the job seeker is expected
to:

-   participate in the activity on the scheduled days
-   be on time, and remain until the completion of the activity
-   act appropriately while participating in the activity, and
-   contact before the start time if they are unable to attend

Job seekers who need to arrive late or leave early from an activity on a
specific day should discuss this with their provider or the activity
coordinator beforehand. If the job seeker had a reasonable excuse but
failed to make prior contact to explain why they were unable to attend
an activity, compliance action may still apply.

When a job seeker fails to attend a compulsory activity, or acts
inappropriately during a compulsory activity, this is managed using the
Targeted Compliance Framework.

Requirement to record own attendance

Most job seekers with Workforce Australia or Workforce Australia Online
are responsible for recording their own attendance at compulsory
activities and appointments. Job seekers who are experiencing
difficulties with recording their attendance should discuss this with
their provider. If the provider has determined the job seeker is not
capable of recording or reporting their own attendance, the provider is
responsible for monitoring and recording the job seeker's attendance on
a daily basis.

Where a job seeker who usually records their own attendance is unable to
do so on a particular occasion (for example, due to an internet outage),
they must contact their provider, or the Department Education, Skills
and Employment's Digital Services Contact Centre (DSCC) if they are in
Workforce Australia Online before close of business on the day of the
activity.

Attendance not scheduled on a specific day

When the job seeker fails to comply with a compulsory activity in the
Job/Participation Plan, which does not require attendance on a specific
day, a mutual obligation failure is committed at the end of that
fortnight. For example, when the job seeker does not undertake their
compulsory activity to do 20 hours of private study per fortnight a
mutual obligation failure is committed.

Inappropriate behaviour while participating in a compulsory activity

Job seekers are required to behave in an appropriate manner while
participating in an activity.

When inappropriate behaviour occurs while participating in a compulsory
activity, the job seeker will be managed using Targeted Compliance
Framework.

Misconduct or behaving inappropriately means failing to behave in
accordance with the standards that would be expected in a workplace.
This includes, but is not limited to:

-   not following reasonable instructions
-   being disruptive or uncooperative
-   behaving in a manner that is aggressive, violent or offensive
-   harassing other people
-   behaving in a manner that causes risk to the health and safety of
    themselves or other participants
-   being intoxicated or consuming intoxicants during the activity
-   behaving in a manner that may harm the reputation of the program

Generally this type of behaviour is only considered inappropriate when
serious in nature, deliberate and within the job seeker's control.

If misconduct has occurred, a reasonable excuse assessment is not
required because there is no reasonable excuse for behaviour that is
within a job seeker's control. If Services Australia establish the
behaviour was not in the job seeker's control, free text is sent to the
provider to ensure this can be considered for future servicing.

Managing non-compliance when a job seeker fails to attend or satisfactorily participate in a compulsory activity

Under the Targeted Compliance Framework, when a job seeker fails to
attend or satisfactorily participate in a compulsory activity, a mutual
obligation failure has been committed. When a job seeker is required to
record their own attendance but fails to do so, including when they
attend but forget to record, a mutual obligation failure has also been
committed and will be reported electronically to Services Australia by
the Employment Services System (ESS).

Following a reported mutual obligation failure, participation payments
are not payable until the job seeker contacts their provider and meets
the reconnection requirement notified by the provider. Participation
payments are cancelled if the reconnection requirement is not met within
4 weeks.

Job seekers in the green or warning zone will accrue one demerit if the
provider is not satisfied the job seeker has a valid reason for failing
to attend or satisfactorily participate in a compulsory activity. When
the provider is able to establish that the job seeker attended but
failed to record their attendance, a demerit will not be applied.

Job seekers in the financial penalty zone will incur a financial
penalty, unless:

-   their provider closes the Non-Compliance Report (NCR) because they
    are satisfied the job seeker has a valid reason
-   Services Australia conducts a compliance investigation and
    establishes that the job seeker has a reasonable excuse.
    Participation Solutions Team (PST) skilled Service Officers are
    responsible for conducting these compliance investigations

Managing non-compliance - Job Seeker Compliance Framework

The Job Seeker Compliance Framework ensures Community Development
Program (CDP) job seekers comply with their mutual obligation
requirements. The model is a mix of incentives, deterrents and safety
nets, intended to:

-   deliver a consistent and reasonable approach to supporting job
    seeker participation and engagement with their CDP provider, and
-   protect vulnerable job seekers from incurring penalties for
    circumstances beyond their control

Refer to Job Seeker Compliance Framework further information on managing
non-compliance for CDP job seekers.
