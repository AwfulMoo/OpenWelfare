| 1                                 | School term end date is after end |
|                                   | of the instalment period          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Dougal was studying and boarding  |
|                                   | privately all year, however       |
|                                   | Dougal's parents advise that      |
|                                   | Dougal will cease study at the    |
|                                   | end of Term 2 due to taking up    |
|                                   | employment. The relevant School   |
|                                   | Term 2 ends on 6 July. As the     |
|                                   | school term date is after the end |
|                                   | of the Term 2 Instalment Period,  |
|                                   | AIC is payable to 6 July.         |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 2                                 | School term end date is before    |
|                                   | end of the instalment period      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Edna is studying by distance      |

|                                   | advise Edna will return to        |
|                                   | mainstream school at the end of   |
|                                   | Term 3. Edna's school term 3 ends |
|                                   | on 28 September. As this date     |
|                                   | precedes the end of the Term 3    |
|                                   | Instalment period, AIC is payable |
|                                   | to 30 September.                  |

|                                   | AIC Boarding Allowance was        |

|                                   | Chelsea ceased boarding at the    |
|                                   | end of Term 2. AIC entitlement is |
|                                   | payable to the end of the Term 2  |
|                                   | instalment period (30 June) as    |

|                                   | entitlement ceases as of the      |

|                                   | AIC boarding allowance was        |
|                                   | granted and paid as fortnightly   |
|                                   | payments for Davida. In May, the  |
|                                   | AIC applicant advises that Davida |
|                                   | did not resume studies on time    |
|                                   | for Term 2 as the family was on   |
|                                   | holidays. The Term 2 study start  |
|                                   | date was 3 April and Davida       |
|                                   | resumed on 21 April. As Davida    |
|                                   | did not resume study within 14    |
|                                   | days of the start of term and the |
|                                   | delay was within the family's     |
|                                   | control the AIC entitlement is    |
|                                   | affected. As Davida completed     |
|                                   | Term 1, the AIC entitlement for   |
|                                   | that term is payable to the term  |
|                                   | instalment end date (31 March).   |
|                                   | As Davida did not start the next  |
|                                   | term on time, the AIC entitlement |
|                                   | for that term starts on the date  |
|                                   | Davida returned to study (21      |
|                                   | April). A debt may be incurred if |
|                                   | AIC entitlement was received for  |
|                                   | the period 1 April to 20 April.   |

|                                   | AIC Second Home Allowance has     |
|                                   | been granted for Eduardo from 1   |
|                                   | Jan. At the start of Term 3,      |
|                                   | Eduardo's parent advises that     |
|                                   | Eduardo has changed to private    |
|                                   | boarding allowance on 8 July.     |
|                                   | There is no change in school and  |
|                                   | Eduardo has returned to study on  |
|                                   | time. Term 2 ended on 28 June.    |
|                                   | Term 3 started on 12 July. Where  |
|                                   | the student resumes study on time |
|                                   | but the allowance type for which  |
|                                   | the student qualifies has         |
|                                   | changed, the allowance type       |
|                                   | payable on resumption of studies  |
|                                   | is payable for the vacation       |
|                                   | period. Therefore AIC Second Home |
|                                   | Allowance was payable to the end  |
|                                   | of Term 2 (28 June). AIC Boarding |
|                                   | Allowance is payable from the     |
|                                   | next day (29 June).               |
