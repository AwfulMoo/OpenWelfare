This document outlines the impact on Centrelink debts when a customer is
declared bankrupt.

Customer contact

The work undertaken in the Bankruptcy Team is specialised. If a
customer's enquiry cannot be resolved at the first point of contact,
advise them someone from the Bankruptcy Team will contact them. See the
Process page.

Escalation required

Bankruptcy Processing Officers should discuss a case with the Bankruptcy
APS5 officer if:

-   the case is unusual and not covered in the relevant Operational
    Blueprint
-   referral to relevant Helpdesk, policy team and/or Legal Services is
    required

Debt incurred during bankruptcy

The period when a debt is incurred determines whether a debt, or part of
a debt, is written off as a result of a customer's bankruptcy.

Debts incurred due to fraud

A debt incurred due to fraud is recoverable and not released via
bankruptcy. These debt(s):

-   must be repaid in full after discharge from the bankruptcy period
-   must be rolled over into a subsequent bankruptcy/s, whether
    concurrent, consecutive or otherwise
-   can be pursued by the creditor (Services Australia) by the usual
    methods of recovery, once the bankruptcy period is discharged

Reparation and judgement orders

Treatment of a debt changes depending on the dates the bankruptcy and
reparation and/or judgement order occurred.

The Resources page contains links to the Australian Financial Security
Authority (AFSA) website, EQUIFAX and contact details.
