This document outlines the homeless supplement for aged care services.
The supplement aims to better support residential aged care homes that
specialise in caring for people with a history of, or who are at risk of
homelessness. The homeless supplement is a component of the Viability
Supplement expansion and is not applicable for Home Care services.

Eligibility

To be eligible for the homeless supplement the aged care home needs to
meet all of the following criteria:

-   Be registered with the Department of Health for the homeless
    component of the Viability Supplement
-   Have more than 50 per cent of all residents meeting the Viability
    Expansion Component and Homeless Supplement Assessment criteria, and
-   Send the Viability expansion component and homeless supplement
    assessment form (AC024) to Services Australia

The AC024 form consists of 4 pages.

Aged care services retains the Assessment section (pages 1 and 2) and
sends the Confirmation section (pages 3 and 4) to Services Australia for
processing.

When processing the AC024 form, Service Australia’s role is to process
the form and check the following details are completed on the form:

-   Care recipient details including ID number
-   Entry date
-   Receipt date (this date cannot be a future date and must be more
    than 28 days from date of entry)
-   Authorised person’s details including signature and date the form
    was signed

It the aged care service’s responsibility to ensure the care recipient
meets the eligibility requirements, outlined on pages 1 and 2 of the
AC024 form, before submitting the forms.

The Resources page contains questions and answers about the homeless
supplement, a link to contact details for Aged Care, and a link to the
Department of Health and Services Australia websites.
