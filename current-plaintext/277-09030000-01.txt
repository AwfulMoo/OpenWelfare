This document outlines information about correcting errors on Child
Support cases.

Correcting errors

Errors include decisions that have not yet been made or processed in a
suitable timeframe. Not all errors need to be corrected. The Registrar
may decide to leave an error uncorrected or correct an error from a
particular date, for example, a case that ended 3 years ago with no
arrears or an agreement where a CPI increase has not been applied for
the past 10 years.

Do not follow the correcting errors process for:

-   a document that needs to be deleted from a customer's record, see
    Documenting Child Support information
-   a name mismatch between Child Support and Centrelink, identified
    through any Centrelink care intray
-   disputed decisions, see Child Support objections

Correcting errors principles

Service Officers (including Change of Assessment (CoA) and Part 6A
Internal Decision Makers) can correct simple errors, taking into account
individual capability. If a Service Officer is unsure or not confident
in correcting the error, they must seek technical support.

Change of Assessment and Part 6A Internal Decision Makers should seek
support from the CoA and Part 6A Decision Makers Program Support Manager
(PSM).

Service Officers at the SO3 and SO4 levels must refer complex error
recommendations to a Service Support Officer (SSO) for authorisation.

Change of Assessment and Part 6A Internal Decision Makers, complex case
managers in Customer Services Branch and PSMs are authorised to make
these decisions.

All error correction decisions must be documented in the most relevant
window in Cuba.

Cases involving suspected fraudulent activity must be reported, see
Report Suspected Fraud and Corruption.

The Resources page contains examples of simple, complex and other types
of errors.

Invalid decisions

New Customer and Mainstream Services Program Support Managers (PSM) are
authorised to make certain parentage decisions invalid where an
application for assessment has been accepted or refused in error due to
the decision maker:

-   failing to take account of material evidence such as a birth
    certificate that was already in agency possession
-   denying a customer procedural fairness by making a decision before
    the expiration of a policy stated time frame
-   failing to explore all nine fact situations that could have
    satisfied the presumption of parentage provisions
-   denying a customer procedural fairness by not consulting them before
    making the decision
-   making a keying error that resulted in the decision being
    incorrectly refused

to make these decisions. The decision to declare a decision invalid in
other circumstances can only be authorised by and Assistant Director in
