This document outlines details about when a ParentsNext participant may
be exited or exempted from the ParentsNext program. Eligibility for
ParentsNext is automatically determined by the system. For further
information, see ParentsNext eligibility and servicing.

Automatic exits

Once a customer has been selected for ParentsNext, a change of
circumstances may result in them being automatically exited from the
program. This is because they no longer meet the eligibility criteria.

ParentsNext participants will be automatically exited from the program
by the system when 1 of the following occurs:

their youngest Parenting Payment (PP) child turns 6 years of age

their PP cancels for any reason, including cancelling for failing to
report (FRP)

a Service Officer records one of the following on the customer's record:

-   current study
-   maternity/paternity leave
-   leave with a job to return to

the customer turns 55 years of age

the customer passes away

a provider exits a ParentsNext participant due to stabilised earnings

the customer relocates to a Community Development Program (CDP) area or
Norfolk Island

they commence (have been recorded as attending an appointment) in
Disability Employment Services (DES) after being selected for
ParentsNext

retrospective updates are made to the customer's record which determine
the customer is no longer eligible for ParentsNext. That is, updating
information for circumstances which were present from a date before
their selection into ParentsNext

Retrospective updates made to a customer's record after selection in ParentsNext

ParentsNext eligibility is determined using information on the
customer's record at the time of the eligibility assessment. For
example, the age of the youngest PP child, or whether the customer has
completed Year 12 or an equivalent qualification or higher. Incorrect or
out of date information may affect this assessment. The customer may be
selected as eligible, when they otherwise would not be.

In these cases, the customer's record must be updated with the correct
information. The date of event must be before the date of selection for
ParentsNext to invoke a reassessment of eligibility.

-   Retrospective child - The customer had a PP child younger than 9
    months of age in their care before their selection date however, it
    was either not recorded, or was not correctly coded on the
    customer's record. Once the child's details are updated (with a date
    of event before the customer's selection date in ParentsNext), the
    system will automatically reassesses eligibility and exit the
    customer
-   Retrospective Year 12 or equivalent qualification - The customer was
    selected for the reason of Early School Leaver or 2 Years or more on
    Income Support but they provide evidence of achieving Year 12 or an
    equivalent qualification before their ParentsNext selection date.
    Once the education details are recorded as verified, with a date of
    event prior to the selection date, the customer will be
    automatically exited
-   Retrospective study - The customer commenced studying prior to
    selection for ParentsNext but they are not in receipt of Pensioner
    Education Supplement (PES). Once the customer provides evidence of
    meeting the minimum ParentsNext study requirements, and the
    ParentsNext Study Guided Procedure is completed with a study start
    date prior to the ParentsNext selection date, the customer will be
    automatically exited
-   Retrospective PES - The customer lodged a claim for PES which is
    granted with a commencement date prior to the ParentsNext selection
    date. Once the claim is granted the customer will be automatically
    exited

Current study - retrospective study exit

Customers who are studying (full or part time) and are in receipt of PES
will not be selected for ParentsNext if their record is up to date and
reflects their current study.

Customers not in receipt of PES who commenced study before selection
into ParentsNext but do not yet have the current study recorded on their
Centrelink record for ParentsNext purposes will be selected for
ParentsNext in the first instance. Where the customer provides evidence
of undertaking a course that commenced prior to their ParentsNext
selection date and meets the minimum ParentsNext study requirements,
they will be exited for the duration of the course once the study is
recorded.

Customers who commence studying after they have been selected for
ParentsNext will continue to remain eligible for ParentsNext and cannot
be exited for retrospective study.

Evidence of current study

Proof of Enrolment documents verifying the study is for at least 4 hours
per week for a duration of at least six weeks must be provided and may
include:

-   the institution's enrolment advice to the student
-   an enrolment fee receipt
-   Mainstream Enrolments Via the Internet (MEVI) receipts - (for TAFE
    courses only, and can only be accepted if the nominal course hours
    are on the receipt)
-   a Commonwealth Assistance Notice (this document shows enrolment in
    subjects at census date, subjects may have different census dates
    and customers will receive a separate Commonwealth Assistance Notice
    for each census date)
-   a student identification card (where period of enrolment is
    specified on the card)
-   a statement from the institution advising acceptance into the course
-   proof of registration for Open Learning Students
-   Productivity Places Programme letter of notification
-   electronic confirmation of a placement in Skills for Education and
    Employment (SEE)

Review of study

Where the duration of the study is more than 12 months, service officers
will be required to create a manual review to reassess at the 12 month
point that the customer is still currently studying and meeting the
minimum requirements.

Maternity/Paternity leave and leave with a job to return to

There is generally no requirement to record maternity/paternity leave or
leave with a job to return to for a PP customer. Therefore, customers
are unlikely to have these details recorded on their Centrelink record
before selection for ParentsNext.

There is no minimum duration of leave for it to be coded on the
customer's record providing they are returning to work at the end of the
leave period.

Evidence of leave

Customers who have been selected for ParentsNext who are on
maternity/paternity leave or leave with a job to return to must provide
evidence from their employer.

This evidence must include:

-   customer's name
-   employer name and phone number
-   employer's Australian Business Number (ABN)
-   start and end date of leave
-   confirmation there is a job to return to when the leave ends

Once verified, and the relevant guided procedure has been completed, the
customer will be automatically exited from ParentsNext. The customer's
eligibility will be automatically reassessed 4 weeks after the end date
of the leave, (if they are still in receipt of Parenting Payment). This
4 week period allows the customer time to record income if they have
returned to their employment.

Review of leave

Where the duration of the leave is more than 12 months, service officers
will be required to create a manual review to reassess at the 12 month
point that the customer is still currently on leave and still has a job
to return to.

Stabilised earnings

Only ParentsNext providers have the delegation to exit a ParentsNext
participant where they are satisfied their employment is 'stabilised'.
Stabilised earnings are defined as an average of at least 15 hours of
paid employment per week that is expected to be ongoing. This can
include self-employment.

Note: when a provider records an exit due to stabilised earnings, a
review is automatically created on the customer's record within the
Services Australia system. This review will mature 14 days after the
exit and will determine whether the customer is declaring income. If no
income has been declared to the agency within 14 days of the exit, the
customer will be automatically re-selected as a compulsory ParentsNext
participant. In this scenario an alert notification is sent to their
provider to re-engage with the customer as they are not declaring
income.

Exit reason No Longer Eligible

The exit reason 'No Longer Eligible' was a 'one off' exit reason which
identifies those customers who were compulsory ParentsNext participants
in the previous model of ParentsNext as at 30 June 2021 however, they
did not meet the new eligibility criteria on 1 July 2021.

New child in care after ParentsNext selection date

Once a customer has been selected for ParentsNext, a new child entering
care does not impact on eligibility and they will remain as a compulsory
ParentsNext participant. Where the new child is under 9 months of age
the customer will be eligible for a Temporary Period of confinement
exemption. The customer will not be required to participate until the
child turns 9 months of age.

Manual exits cannot be recorded

All eligibility for ParentsNext is automatically assessed by the system.
When a customer no longer meets the eligibility criteria, the system
will automatically exit them from the program.

If a Service Officer believes that a customer no longer meets the
eligibility criteria for ParentsNext but they have not been
automatically exited, they must lodge an incident via mySupport.

Service Officers do not have the discretion or delegation to apply a
manual exit, and do not have the required access to do so.

Where a customer is experiencing ongoing personal issues that are
impacting on their ability to participate, they can discuss their
eligibility for an exemption with their ParentsNext provider or the
agency. In the case of future study or employment, the provider will
determine if this should be included as an activity within their
participation plan. For employment, the customer's ParentsNext provider
can also determine if they may be exited due to stabilised earnings.

Exemptions

The majority of mutual obligation requirements exemptions are also
applicable for ParentsNext participants however, there are some
circumstances where the exemption type and coding differ for ParentsNext
participants.

There are two ParentsNext specific exemptions:

-   Temporary Period of Confinement exemption
-   Bereavement exemption

ParentsNext exemptions can be recorded by either the agency or the
ParentsNext provider. This will exempt the customer from the requirement
to participate in ParentsNext (for the duration of the exemption). The
customer is not subject to the Targeted Compliance Framework during the
exemption period. The exemption also results in the suspension of
provider servicing.

The granting of an exemption does not change a ParentsNext participant's
eligibility status or their reason for selection. Exemptions applied by
the agency or a ParentsNext provider, will display on the ParentsNext
Summary page, under the heading of Current Exemptions and on the
Activities and Exemption (AEX) screen.

See the Resources page for a list of all the available exemptions that
can be applied to ParentsNext participants by the agency and by
ParentsNext providers including the duration of each exemption type.

Family and domestic violence

This is a Family and Domestic Violence Interaction Point. If the
customer is with another person, on speaker phone or has already
identified family and domestic violence concerns, continue with the
current business conversation. Otherwise, go to the Family and domestic
violence procedure to conduct the risk identification and referral
process.

In cases of family and domestic violence, the customer should be
referred to a Services Australia social worker. Consideration should be
given to the assessment made by the social worker as to whether an
exemption should apply and the appropriate length of the exemption. The
initial exemption must be for the maximum 16 week period. This may be
extended for 1 or more further periods of up to 16 weeks if appropriate.
The duration of the further periods of exemption will again be
determined by the social worker's assessment, as part of their review of
the customer's circumstances.

Action at the end of an exemption

Where a customer was not yet referred to a ParentsNext provider at the
time the exemption was recorded by the agency, the system will
automatically book an appointment with the agency for a time after the
exemption has ended. Exemptions recorded by the agency will be
automatically end dated if a customer exits the program.

Where an exemption is applied after the customer has already been
referred to a ParentsNext provider, it will be the responsibility of the
ParentsNext provider to re-engage with the customer at the end of the
exemption. The agency is not required to undertake any follow up at the
end of the exemption period in this instance.

Note: some exemptions may require social work intervention and
recommendation (for example, in the situation where a customer is
experiencing extreme stress, or homelessness because of a relationship
breakdown). The social worker may make an assessment and provide a
recommendation in relation to whether an exemption should be granted.
Any Service Officer (APS 3 and above) can assess and grant Service
Australia exemptions available for ParentsNext participants. Service
Officers must not send a referral to the social work team to code a
ParentsNext exemption.

ParentsNext specific exemptions and processes

ParentsNext Temporary Period of Confinement exemption

The Temporary Period of Confinement (PTC) exemption is specific to the
ParentsNext program and applies where:

-   the customer is pregnant and within 6 weeks of their expected date
    of confinement, or
-   a new child under the age of 9 months enters the customer's care

Customers are required to provide evidence of the expected date of
birth/child entered care. Evidence of the expected date of delivery can
include a letter from a doctor or registered midwife. It does not need
to be a Services Australia medical certificate.

ParentsNext Bereavement exemption

The bereavement exemption may be granted for ParentsNext participants
for a maximum period of 16 weeks and is specific to ParentsNext. It is
relevant to the following circumstances:

Death of a partner

-   When a ParentsNext participant's partner passes away, they may be
    considered for a Bereavement exemption (different to the Bereavement
    Mutual Obligation exemption) of up to 16 weeks.
-   Where the Miscellaneous Update Details (NMIS) screen is coded in
    relation to the partner's death a Mutual Obligation Bereavement
    Period - Partner exemption will be automatically granted for a
    maximum of 14 weeks.
-   The manual Bereavement exemption should still be coded to ensure the
    customer is granted the maximum period of 16 weeks allowable for PP
    customers

Death of an immediate family member - When a ParentsNext participant has
an immediate family member pass away, a Bereavement exemption (different
to the Bereavement Mutual Obligation exemption) should be coded

Customer is pregnant when partner passes away

If the customer is pregnant at the time their partner passes away, they
will be exempt for a period of 16 weeks from the date of death or to the
end of the pregnancy, whichever is longer. The Bereavement Period -
Pregnant Partner exemption is automatically coded based on coding of the
partner's death on the Miscellaneous Update Details (NMIS) screen.

Where the customer is still a compulsory ParentsNext participant when
the expected date of confinement is reached the system will
automatically apply a ParentsNext temporary period of confinement
exemption.

Caring Responsibilities

Where a ParentsNext participant has caring responsibilities, the Special
Family Circumstances exemption can be applied for up to 16 weeks.

Note: the specific caring exemption is not available for ParentsNext
participants as the maximum duration is limited to 14 weeks (applicable
to job seekers).

Where the customer has long term caring responsibilities (foster carer,
non-parent carer, home schooling etc.), see Exempting a job seeker from
mutual obligation requirements due to special circumstances.

Exemptions and reporting requirements

In the majority of cases, customers will still be required to report
fortnightly during an exemption period. They may need to declare income
and confirm the circumstances remain current and therefore that they are
still eligible for the exemption.

Where a ParentsNext participant is granted a 'long term' exemption, they
will be automatically assessed for eligibility for variable 12 weekly
reporting. If the customer or their partner (where partnered) are
declaring income when the long term exemption is granted or commence
declaring income during the exemption period or have a current debt they
will either remain on or be reverted to 2 weekly (fortnightly)
reporting.

Exemptions which are considered long term for ParentsNext variable
reporting purposes are:

-   Caring for a child not eligible for CP
-   Carer Non-Parent State/Terr Care Plan
-   Carer Non-Parent Fam Law Court
-   Distance Education Child
-   Home Schooling
-   Foster Carer
-   Large Family
-   Temp Incap - Serious Illness

If a customer on a long term exemption ceases to declare income for a
period of 12 weeks, they will be reassessed for eligibility for
variable, 12 weekly reporting.

Note: all reporting requirements for ParentsNext are automatically
determined by the system. Service Officers do not have the ability to
manually update reporting requirements for ParentsNext participants.

ParentsNext provider exemptions

ParentsNext providers are also able to record exemptions for ParentsNext
participants who have already commenced in the program (that is, they
are linked to a provider) with the exception of the customers overseas
exemption. In this scenario, the agency will automatically apply the
exemption on advice of overseas travel.

Service Officers have visibility of exemptions applied by ParentsNext
providers but are not able to make updates.

The Resources page contains a list of the ParentsNext exemptions that
are available to the agency and ParentsNext providers.
