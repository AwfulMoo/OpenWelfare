| Example                           | Description                       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Example 1                         | Carer claims CA and lodges claim  |
|                                   | and medical report. Claim is      |
|                                   | processed 3 months later. CA      |
|                                   | rejected due to non-qualifying    |
|                                   | DCLAD. Carer qualifies for CA HCC |
|                                   | only.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Carer appeals decision within 13  |
|                                   | weeks and provides a new THP      |
|                                   | professional questionnaire, with  |
|                                   | a qualifying LoRD condition.      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | In this example CA can be granted |
|                                   | from the date of claim using the  |
|                                   | latest medical report if the      |
|                                   | recognised disability existed at  |
|                                   | the time the claim was lodged.    |

| Example 2                         | Carer claims CA for 2 children    |
|                                   | who are twins. Both children have |
|                                   | the same conditions. The THP has  |
|                                   | ticked a box in the               |

|                                   | medical report certifying 1 child |
|                                   | as having a recognised disability |
|                                   | but has not certified the same    |
|                                   | for the other child.              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | CA has been granted for 1 child   |
|                                   | and rejected for the other child. |
|                                   | Medical advice is sought from the |
|                                   | HPAU to ensure the correct        |
|                                   | decision is made regarding this   |
|                                   | condition.                        |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | professional questionnaire, with  |
|                                   | a qualifying LoRD condition.      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | HPAU confirms that both children  |
|                                   | satisfy the                       |

|                                   | In this example CA can be granted |
|                                   | from the date of claim using the  |
|                                   | latest medical report as the      |
|                                   | recognised disability existed at  |
|                                   | the time the claim was lodged.    |

| Example 3                         | Carer claims CP and lodges claim  |
|                                   | and medical report. Claim is      |
|                                   | processed 3 months later. CP      |
|                                   | rejected due to non-qualifying    |
|                                   | DCLAD.                            |

|                                   | certified as terminally ill.      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | In this example CP can be granted |
|                                   | from the latter date using the    |

|                                   | because the terminal illness did  |
|                                   | not exist at the time the         |
|                                   | original claim was lodged.        |
