This document outlines an explanation of how income and assets from a
cooperative are assessed for Centrelink purposes.

Shareholders in a cooperative

A cooperative is an organisation which is established for the mutual
benefit of its members for some specific purpose such as making loans or
providing goods and services. Customers who are members of a cooperative
are shareholders, and they may receive bonus shares in place of the
payment of a rebate for past purchases. This is a notifiable event.

Shares held in cooperatives are financial assets which are assessable at
their current market value.

The annual income derived from a customer's investment in a cooperative
is deemed unless the security is exempt from deeming. The actual income
a customer receives from a financial investment that has been granted an
exemption is assessable.

Income from cooperatives is not employment income, it is other ordinary
income and is not used when calculating the accrual of Working Credits.
The customer is unable to use their Working Credit Balance or the Work
Bonus (if over Age Pension age) to offset this income.

iA).
