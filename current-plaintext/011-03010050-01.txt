This document outlines the policy for healthcare providers to create a
Provisional IHI.

On this Page:

Create a Provisional IHI

This function is available via Business to Business (B2B) where a
provider has authenticated access to the HI Service.

A Healthcare provider can create a Provisional IHI for an individual
when both the below occur:

-   the individual is unconscious, incapable of communicating, unable to
    be identified, and
-   a third party is not available to identify the individual

A Provisional IHI must not be created if sufficient identification is
supplied by a third party at the healthcare event on behalf of the
incapacitated individual. In this case the HI Service must be searched
to ensure the individual does not already have an IHI.

Mandatory data elements to create a Provisional IHI are:

-   family name
-   gender
-   date of birth
-   date of birth accuracy indicator

Service Officers cannot allocate a Provisional IHI

Service Officers must not create Provisional IHIs. The process to create
a Provisional IHI is specifically for the use of Healthcare providers in
an emergency-type situation at a healthcare event.

Where an individual has identification or a third party is able to
identify the individual and a general search of the HI Service finds a
unique match showing that the individual has an IHI, the existing IHI
must be used.

Provisional IHI record restrictions

The below restrictions are associated with Provisional IHIs:

-   duplicate checking is not applied during the create process
-   Provisional IHIs are expired after 90 days of inactivity

Note: an expired Provisional IHI cannot be reinstated.
