This document outlines the processes for completing care related intrays
in Cuba, including those created by Child Support and automatically
created intrays from the Centrelink data exchange.

Intrays covered in this document

The following intrays, listed in hierarchical order, are covered in this
document:

Care - Data Mismatch Intray

Care – New Child Intray

Care - Potential Reconciliation Intray

Care - Review of Decision Rcvd Intray

Care - WA Ex Nuptial Intray

Care - Additional Carers Intray

Care - Interim Determination Intray

Care - Case Review Required Intray

Care - Child Data Mismatch Intray

Additional support - International - care changes involving children in
international registrations

Important information about data exchange and intrays

Centrelink automatically exchanges data with Child Support for mutual
customers. It is recorded in the External Information Care window. The
care information will automatically apply to the child support
assessment where possible.

Where automatic processing is not possible Cuba looks at the type of
information being exchanged in an hierarchical order and creates a care
intray based on the first indicator identified.

Where multiple children of the customer each have care records sent,
only one care intray will create for the customer regardless of how many
indicators are attached to each child's record.

If Cuba cannot determine which intray to create or what action needs to
be taken, the Care - Case Review Required intray will create.

It is important to identify and action all indicators appropriately
before finalising the intray. Where a care intray has been deleted prior
to all relevant indicators being actioned, new intrays will continue to
recreate on the customer until all indicators have been addressed.
