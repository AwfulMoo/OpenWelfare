|                                   | For 2006-07, Bo is entitled to    |
|                                   | $2000 in child support, however   |
|                                   | receives $3000. As the amount Bo  |
|                                   | received is more than the amount  |
|                                   | entitled to, the excess of $1000  |
|                                   | is treated as arrears.            |

|                                   |     is lower than the amount of   |

|                                   |     $5000, therefore accrues the  |
