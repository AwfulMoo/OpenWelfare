This document outlines the prescriber number information that can be
released in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS).

Release of prescriber numbers

Services Australia can release a practitioner's prescriber number to a
pharmacist where the practitioner has failed to include the number on a
PBS prescription (excluding prescriptions from participating public
hospitals, dentists, optometrists, midwives and nurse practitioners) or
Doctor's Bag Order Form (DBOF). The pharmacist requires the prescriber
number to enable payment for the supply of the prescribed PBS medicines.

Prescription from a participating hospital

A practitioner's prescriber number is required for prescriptions from
participating public hospitals and must be shown on the prescription
form. Where a practitioner's prescriber number has been omitted from a
prescription of a participating hospital, the pharmacist can contact the
hospital directly to obtain the prescriber number.

Dentists, optometrists, midwives and nurse practitioners

Prescriber numbers are required to be on each script written by one of
these prescribers.

Release of doctor's details to software vendors or developers

Services Australia cannot release a list of doctor provider and/or
prescriber details to software vendors or developers. Release of the
above information by Services Australia is restricted by the secrecy
provisions.

The References page contains legislation relevant to the secrecy
provisions.
