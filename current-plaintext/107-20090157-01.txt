This document provides the process for waiving or writing off Centrelink
debts.

Waivers and write offs

Services Australia may not enforce its legal right to recover a debt in
some circumstances. Legislation allows for Centrelink debts to be waived
or written off. Consider waiving a debt before any other non-recovery
action.

Considering a waiver

A waiver is permanent. Recovery of the debt cannot be pursued at a later
date.

The decision to waive a debt is subject to review. If, upon review, the
decision to waive the debt is set aside and substituted with a new
decision, the (previously waived) debt may be recoverable.

Consider a waiver if:

-   a customer or their nominee asks
-   factors indicate that waiver may apply

A decision to waive a debt can be made:

-   before or after determining the debt
-   before or after the debt has been recovered

Other factors:

-   A debt may be waived partially or in full
-   A debt can occur at any time during a payment period
-   Only part of the debt may be subject to waiver

Considering a write off

Write off stops recovery action either for a defined or an undefined
period. At any time, the write off can be reversed and recovery
proceedings begun where circumstances change. Unlike a waiver, write off
does not extinguish the debt.

Consider:

-   waiving a debt before taking any other non-recovery action, and
-   the cost effectiveness of recovery
