|                                   | Mum decides to invest $100,000 in |
|                                   | her daughter's company. Prior to  |
|                                   | her investment the company is     |
|                                   | valued at $200,000. The only      |
|                                   | shareholders are her daughter and |
|                                   | son-in-law. Each holds 1 A class  |
|                                   | share. For her $100,000           |
|                                   | investment, Mum receives 1 C      |
|                                   | class share.                      |

|                                   | injection has occurred. Mum's     |
|                                   | investment of $100,000 increases  |
|                                   | the value of the company by       |
|                                   | one-third. In return she receives |
|                                   | a one-third share holding in the  |
|                                   | company and entitlement to        |
|                                   | one-third of any dividends.       |

|                                   |     by the customer, and will     |

|                                   | is not regarded as an asset of    |
