Isolated Children (AIC) applicants and Australian Apprentices.

Appropriate modules and forms

When a customer lodges a claim as:

-   a student
-   an AIC applicant, or
-   an Australian Apprentice

Additional forms and modules may be required so that entitlement can be
accurately assessed. This procedure outlines the appropriate modules and
additional forms that may be necessary for the above claims.

Completing modules and forms

Forms and modules enable a customer to provide information for their
claim.

In completing modules and forms:

-   all relevant questions on the module/form must be answered
-   the module/form is to be signed

The Process page contains a list of forms which are used in conjunction
with the claim forms or issued when additional information is required.

The Resources page contains a link to the Services Australia website
which includes access to claim forms used by students and Australian
Apprentices.
