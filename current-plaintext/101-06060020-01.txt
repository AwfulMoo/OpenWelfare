Reasons for using manual override

The assessment of concession entitlement for a customer and their
dependants relies on correct processing within the relevant host systems
(for example, FAO, NSS, PGA and PEN). A manual override should only be
applied when the host system has been coded correctly but the concession
entitlement is not correct.

For example, if a dependant does not appear on a card because that child
was not added to the host system, the dependant should be added to the
appropriate host system rather than applying an override.

The only reasons for which a manual override can be used are:

-   to backdate for medical service or treatment
-   to add a dependant
-   appeals - a valid appeal number for the customer is required
-   system limitation
-   system fault - a valid mySupport number is required
-   temporary application of an approved policy enhancement pending
    system release, such as the continuation of a Health Care Card (HCC)
    to customers whose Mobility Allowance is cancelled due to the
    customer becoming a funded participant of the National Disability
    Insurance Scheme (NDIS)
-   Ministerial decisions

Authorised levels for override

Level 2 Concession Entitlement Systems Team and the Level 2 Policy Help
Desk (Concessions) have the only authorised access to the override
facility for concession cards. Policy approval for backdating an
entitlement start date to a date of medical service or treatment beyond
prescribed timeframes is required from the Level 2 Policy Help Desk -
Concessions. If granted, the Level 2 Policy Help Desk will implement the
override.

The Resources page contains links to the Level 2 Policy Helpdesk and
mySupport.
