|                                   | to determine whether the customer |
|                                   | is likely to have their payments  |
|                                   | income managed within the next 60 |
|                                   | days. Service Officers should     |
|                                   | consider:                         |

|                                   | cancelling, consider the reason   |
|                                   | and history of cancellations. For |
|                                   | example:                          |

|                                   |     cancellation reason. If the   |
|                                   |     reason is unknown, it is      |
|                                   |     likely the customer will be   |
|                                   |     income managed within 60 days |
|                                   | -   CAN/CLR: check for details of |
|                                   |     why the customer requested    |
|                                   |     cancellation of their         |
|                                   |     payment. If the reason is     |
|                                   |     unknown, it is likely the     |
|                                   |     customer will be income       |
|                                   |     managed within 60 days        |

|                                   |     likely Income Management will |
|                                   |     be reinstated within 60 days  |
|                                   |     once any outstanding report   |
|                                   |     is lodged. However, if there  |
|                                   |     is information on the         |
|                                   |     customer's record that        |

|                                   |     to receive income support     |
|                                   |     payments, it is not likely    |
|                                   |     they will be income managed   |
|                                   |     within 60 days                |

|                                   | Note: disbursement of funds       |
|                                   | should commence no more than 60   |
|                                   | days after Income Management has  |
|                                   | ended.                            |
