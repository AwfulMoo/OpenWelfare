This document outlines how to record details when a claim for Dad and
Partner Pay (DAP) is made not effective (NEF), rejected or withdrawn by
the claimant. Notification will be provided to the claimant for all NEF
and rejected claims, explaining the reason for the decision and the
action the claimant needs to take.

General requirements for an effective early claim

Requirements for an effective claim:

-   the claim has been lodged within the family assistance, PPL and DAP
    allowable early claim period
-   the claim is lodged via the Claim for Dad and Partner Pay (FA080) or
    the [] online claim
-   information and evidence (if required) on whether the claimant meets
    the Australian residence requirements
-   the claimant's Tax File Number (TFN)
-   the claimant's bank account details
-   the expected date of birth or adoption date
-   the claimant's DAP period nominated start date
-   information and evidence (if required) about how the claimant meets
    the DAP work test, and
-   information and evidence (if required) about how the claimant meets
    the DAP income test

NEF claims

If the claim is NEF, a decision cannot be made about the claimant's
entitlement. The claimant must be advised why the claim is NEF and, in
most cases, the claimant will need to lodge a new claim and/or the
outstanding requested information to be assessed for payment.

The claimant can ask for a review of the decision that made the claim
NEF. If the claim is still found to be NEF, a new claim will need to be
lodged. If the claim was NEF because it was lodged too late, a new claim
would still be too late and would be NEF.

Rejected claims

Claimants must meet the eligibility requirements to avoid claim
rejection. Claims will either be rejected automatically according to
details recorded on the claimant's record, or manually rejected when
assessing the claim. A claim for DAP will be rejected if:

-   DAP has already been paid for the child (to the claimant, partner or
    another person)
-   the DAP income test is not met
-   the DAP work test is not met
-   the claimant does not satisfy residence requirements
-   the child's birth is not registered
-   DAP has already been paid for another child in the multiple birth
-   Paid Parental Leave (PPL) is payable on the first day of the DAP
    period
-   maximum amount of PPL has already been paid to the claimant
-   the child is not in care of the claimant on the first day of the DAP
    period
-   the claimant is working or on paid leave on the first day of the DAP
    period

Early claims can be rejected by a discretionary decision, for example,
if the income is clearly above the allowable limit.

Withdrawal of claim

Claimants, or their correspondence nominees, may withdraw an effective
claim for DAP at any time before a payability determination is made.
Where a claimant wishes to withdraw their claim, the claimant or their
nominee, can do so either in writing, verbally or [] online.

When a claimant chooses to withdraw a claim, the claim is taken never to
have been made. The claim is indexed and then cancelled.

Duplicate claim

A duplicate claim is where the customer has lodged an effective claim in
the first instance and then lodges a subsequent claim with the same
information.

Some customers may, in error submit a claim more than once for the same
payment and child. These duplicate claims should be assessed as not
effective. The online claim assists to prevent this duplication of
claims
