| 1                                 | Question: Will this be expanded   |
|                                   | to all vaccinations?              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: No. The Scheme relates    |
|                                   | only to Therapeutic Goods         |
|                                   | Administration (TGA) approved     |
|                                   | COVID-19 vaccinations that were   |
|                                   | part of the Australian Government |

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 2                                 | Question: My claim relates to a   |
|                                   | clinical condition in Table 1. Is |
|                                   | this automatically covered by the |
|                                   | Scheme?                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: The Scheme is specific to |
|                                   | a list of adverse effects and     |
|                                   | injuries. These are medically     |
|                                   | diagnosed clinical conditions     |
|                                   | considered likely to be related   |
|                                   | to a TGA approved COVID-19        |
|                                   | vaccination. The treating doctor  |
|                                   | will need to provide an opinion   |
|                                   | that the condition is most likely |
|                                   | caused by the COVID-19 vaccine as |
|                                   | part of the patient’s diagnosis.  |

| 3                                 | Question: My claim relates to an  |
|                                   | injury received when the vaccine  |
|                                   | was administered. Is this covered |
|                                   | by the Scheme?                    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: If the harm relates to    |
|                                   | the administration of the         |
|                                   | vaccine, the same evidence        |
|                                   | requirements would apply from the |
|                                   | patient’s treating doctor (rather |
|                                   | than the vaccine administrator).  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The claim would be referred to a  |
|                                   | panel of independent legal        |
|                                   | experts for assessment, who will  |
|                                   | make a recommendation whether     |
|                                   | compensation should be paid, and  |
|                                   | if so the amount.                 |

|                                   | cover?                            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: The Scheme compensates    |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   suffered moderate to          |
|                                   |     significant injury, or        |
|                                   | -   persons who have died,        |
|                                   |     resulting from the vaccine or |
|                                   |     its administration of a TGA   |
|                                   |     approved COVID-19 vaccine     |

|                                   | The Scheme will not cover         |
|                                   | compensation for an amount        |
|                                   | already awarded for the same      |
|                                   | injury through another scheme or  |
|                                   | court process.                    |

|                                   |                                   |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: A person making the claim |
|                                   | does not need to establish that   |
|                                   | anyone in particular was at       |
|                                   | fault. However, the claimant must |
|                                   | provide evidence to establish     |

|                                   | death) was likely caused by a TGA |
|                                   | approved COVID-19 vaccine or its  |
|                                   | administration.                   |

| 4                                 | Question: Is compensation capped? |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: No. The Scheme does not   |
|                                   | have an overall cap on the        |
|                                   | compensation that may be paid to  |
|                                   | an eligible claimant. However,    |
|                                   | guidance will be provided to the  |
|                                   | panel consistent with             |
|                                   | compensation payments under the   |
|                                   | Civil Liability Act (NSW). The    |
|                                   | intention is to ensure            |
|                                   | consistency in compensation       |
|                                   | payments awarded by specifying    |
|                                   | guidance for the different        |
|                                   | categories of loss (lost          |
|                                   | earnings, care services, out of   |
|                                   | pocket expenses, pain and         |
|                                   | suffering).                       |

| 5                                 | Question: Will there be any       |
|                                   | conditions placed on me if I      |
|                                   | accept a payment under the        |
|                                   | Scheme?                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: Yes. If you agree to      |
|                                   | accept compensation under the     |
|                                   | Scheme, you will need to agree in |
|                                   | writing to repay any further      |
|                                   | compensation received. This is up |
|                                   | to the amount of that             |
|                                   | compensation for the same         |
|                                   | clinical condition or harm from   |
|                                   | someone else (e.g. from a         |
|                                   | workers’ compensation insurer). A |
|                                   | principle of the Scheme is that a |
|                                   | person is not compensated twice   |
|                                   | for the same harm.                |

|                                   | Answer: Services Australia will   |
|                                   | try to action each claim as soon  |
|                                   | as possible. Claims will have an  |
|                                   | initial assessment before         |
|                                   | progressing to both medical and   |
|                                   | legal experts for review. There   |
|                                   | are other variables which may     |
|                                   | impact the ability to meet these  |
|                                   | timeframes including:             |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | Answer: Services Australia will   |
|                                   | issue each eligible applicant a   |
|                                   | deed to review and accept prior   |

|                                   | Answer: No. It is not a           |
|                                   | requirement to respond to the     |
|                                   | Deed of Settlement.               |

|                                   | Settlement is required for        |
|                                   | payment to be made. Further,      |
|                                   | accepting the Deed of Settlement  |
|                                   | also means that the terms of      |

|                                   | COVID-19 vaccine. The treating    |
|                                   | doctor will need to provide       |
|                                   | advice that the condition is most |

|                                   | If the injury relates to the      |
|                                   | administration of the vaccine,    |
|                                   | the same evidence requirements    |

|                                   | vaccine administrator), and the   |
|                                   | claim would be referred to a      |
|                                   | panel of independent legal        |

|                                   | whether compensation should be    |

| 2                                 | Question: Will the Scheme         |
|                                   | reimburse costs to individuals    |
|                                   | who choose to pursue a claim      |
|                                   | through the courts?               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: No. The Scheme will not   |
|                                   | cover the costs to individuals    |
|                                   | who choose to pursue a claim      |
|                                   | through the courts.               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Although people will not be       |
|                                   | prevented from taking action      |
|                                   | through the courts (unless that   |
|                                   | person has agreed to accept       |
|                                   | compensation under the Scheme),   |
|                                   | the Scheme has been designed as   |
|                                   | an alternative to legal           |
|                                   | proceedings.                      |

| 3                                 | Question: What happens if a       |
|                                   | person pursues a claim through a  |
|                                   | court process but is unsuccessful |
|                                   | or thinks that compensation       |
|                                   | awarded has been insufficient,    |
|                                   | are they able to claim through    |
|                                   | the Scheme?                       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: The intent of this Scheme |
|                                   | is to provide patients with       |
|                                   | quicker access to compensation    |
|                                   | that would be similar to what is  |
|                                   | awarded through a court process.  |
|                                   | Should a payment be made through  |
|                                   | a court process, a claimant would |
|                                   | be ineligible for the Scheme, as  |
|                                   | it is an alternative to a court   |
|                                   | process, not in addition.         |

| 4                                 | Question: Can I apply for         |
|                                   | compensation under the Scheme if  |
|                                   | I am also obtaining benefits      |
|                                   | under the National Disability     |

|                                   | Answer: The Scheme will not       |
|                                   | prevent an individual who         |
|                                   | receives compensation from        |
|                                   | accessing the NDIS but the amount |
|                                   | received through the NDIS might   |
|                                   | be affected.                      |

|                                   | Answer: No. Compensation is       |

|                                   | example, can you only claim for   |
|                                   | vaccination injuries under the    |
|                                   | Scheme?                           |

|                                   | Answer: The intent of the Scheme  |
|                                   | is not to replace existing        |
|                                   | workers compensation              |
|                                   | arrangements. It also does not    |
|                                   | remove an individual’s right to   |
|                                   | pursue workers compensation if    |
|                                   | eligible or seek to litigate in   |
|                                   | relation to an adverse outcome    |
|                                   | from vaccination. However, the    |
|                                   | Scheme will provide claimants     |
|                                   | with a more efficient             |
|                                   | administrative option to seek     |
|                                   | compensation and an outcome       |
|                                   | similar to a court process,       |
|                                   | rather than having to undertake a |
|                                   | complex and costly court process. |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | related to an adverse reaction to |
|                                   | a Therapeutic Goods               |
|                                   | Administration (TGA) approved     |
|                                   | vaccine, any payments received by |
|                                   | way of workers’ compensation      |
|                                   | would be taken into account so    |
|                                   | that the claimant is not          |
|                                   | compensated twice. Where          |
|                                   | compensation is also paid under   |
|                                   | the Scheme for the same injury,   |
|                                   | the claimant may be required to   |
|                                   | repay either the Australian       |
|                                   | Government or the relevant        |
|                                   | workers’ compensation scheme.     |

|                                   | employee suffers an adverse       |
|                                   | effect following the vaccine as   |
|                                   | part of our workplace vaccine     |
|                                   | program?                          |

|                                   | Answer: If your employee has      |
|                                   | suffered an adverse effect        |
|                                   | related to a TGA approved         |

|                                   | course of employment, they may be |

|                                   | evidence from a healthcare        |
|                                   | practitioner confirming that they |
|                                   | suffered harm as a result of      |
|                                   | receiving a TGA approved COVID-19 |

| 3                                 | Question: Will employers be       |
|                                   | responsible for an adverse event  |
|                                   | that occurred as part of our      |
|                                   | employee vaccination program?     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: The Scheme does not       |
|                                   | replace workers compensation      |
|                                   | arrangements. However, the Scheme |
|                                   | will provide claimants with an    |
|                                   | administrative option to seek     |
|                                   | compensation rather than a        |
|                                   | complex and costly court process. |

|                                   | Scheme, the Australian Government |
|                                   | will not consider responsibility  |
|                                   | of employers in relation to harm  |
|                                   | suffered by a claimant, or death  |
|                                   | of an employee, that is directly  |
|                                   | a result of a workplace COVID-19  |
|                                   | vaccination. However, employers’  |
|                                   | broader responsibilities are not  |
|                                   | being indemnified through this    |
|                                   | Scheme.                           |

|                                   | Answer: Claimants are not         |

|                                   | and businesses?                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: If an eligible claimant   |
|                                   | is injured as a result of a TGA   |
|                                   | approved COVID-19 vaccination     |
|                                   | received in the workplace, the    |
|                                   | individual can submit a claim     |
|                                   | under the Scheme where the        |
|                                   | minimum threshold is $1,000.      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If a claimant is a sole trader or |
|                                   | business owner, the impact on     |
|                                   | their income as a result of the   |
|                                   | harm suffered as a result of      |
|                                   | receiving a TGA approved COVID-19 |
|                                   | vaccine will likely be relevant   |
|                                   | to assessing any compensation     |
|                                   | amounts for lost earnings by that |
|                                   | individual.                       |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: Yes. The Australian       |

| 1                                 | Question: I am a nurse working in |
|                                   | a private clinic administering    |
|                                   | COVID-19 vaccinations, what does  |
|                                   | the Scheme mean for me?           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: The Scheme is universally |
|                                   | available to eligible claimants   |
|                                   | who suffer harm as a result of    |
|                                   | receiving a Therapeutic Goods     |
|                                   | Administration (TGA) approved     |
|                                   | COVID-19 vaccine from an approved |

| 2                                 | Question: My patient has suffered |
|                                   | an adverse effect to a TGA        |
|                                   | approved COVID-19 Vaccine, what   |
|                                   | steps should I take?              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: While side effects from   |
|                                   | COVID-19 vaccinations can occur,  |
|                                   | most are mild and last no longer  |
|                                   | than a couple of days. Serious    |
|                                   | and life-threatening side effects |
|                                   | are very rare. The Scheme         |
|                                   | provides a safety net to support  |
|                                   | those affected by providing       |
|                                   | eligible claimants with access to |
|                                   | compensation where they suffer a  |
|                                   | moderate to severe harm or death  |
|                                   | caused by a TGA approved COVID-19 |
|                                   | vaccination.                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If your patient has suffered a    |
|                                   | moderate to significant harm or   |
|                                   | death caused by a TGA approved    |
|                                   | COVID-19 vaccine, you can refer   |
|                                   | them (or the executor or          |

|                                   | the event of death) to register   |

|                                   | As part of the claims process the |
|                                   | patient will need to provide      |
|                                   | evidence in support of their      |
|                                   | claim that their harm has been    |
|                                   | caused by the vaccine. This       |
|                                   | evidence will include a medical   |
|                                   | report from their treating doctor |
|                                   | or a hospital physician           |
|                                   | indicating the nature of the harm |
|                                   | suffered by the patient post      |
|                                   | vaccination, the duration of that |
|                                   | condition and the causative link  |
|                                   | to the TGA approved COVID-19      |
|                                   | vaccine.                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | It is also important that any     |
|                                   | adverse reaction to a TGA         |
|                                   | approved COVID-19 is reported to  |
|                                   | the TGA as part of their usual    |
|                                   | surveillance program.             |

| 3                                 | Question: Would I be subjected to |
|                                   | any legal proceedings?            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: A key aim of the Scheme   |
|                                   | is to reduce the risk of a legal  |
|                                   | action against a healthcare       |
|                                   | practitioner who is involved in   |
|                                   | the COVID-19 vaccination program. |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The Scheme does not prevent       |
|                                   | someone from taking action        |
|                                   | through the courts, however, the  |
|                                   | Scheme has been designed as a     |
|                                   | streamlined alternative to court  |
|                                   | proceedings.                      |

|                                   | submitted by a claimant that      |
|                                   | there may have been harm caused   |
|                                   | by a registered health            |
|                                   | practitioner in the               |
|                                   | administration of the vaccine.    |
|                                   | They may recommend a referral to  |

|                                   | (Ahpra) for a review of the       |
|                                   | practitioner’s conduct or         |
|                                   | performance by the relevant       |
|                                   | professional board.               |

|                                   | Unsatisfactory conduct or         |
|                                   | performance is relatively rare.   |
|                                   | However, these steps are in       |
|                                   | keeping with the Australian       |
|                                   | Government's intention that       |
|                                   | health practitioners continue to  |
|                                   | practise with skill and diligence |
|                                   | and to promote confidence in the  |
|                                   | population being vaccinated.      |
|                                   | These measures will support the   |
|                                   | integrity of the COVID-19         |
|                                   | vaccination program and the       |
