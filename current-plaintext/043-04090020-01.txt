This document outlines information about the recording of liabilities of
a trust or company.

Recording of liabilities

To calculate the attributable assets of a trust or company both the
liabilities and the assets of the trust or company need to be recorded.
The attributable assets of a trust or company are the gross assets less
the allowable liabilities.

The Trust/Company Liabilities (TRLD) screen is used to record the
liabilities of a trust or company. Where a liability is recorded on the
TRLD screen and a Customer Reference Number (CRN) is recorded on that
screen as being the lender or debtor, the liability amount will pass to
the customer's record and be assessed as an asset of the customer.

The Resources page contains examples of how to record liabilities for
trusts and companies.
