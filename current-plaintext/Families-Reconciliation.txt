Families and Child Care Peak and Reconciliation/Payment balancing

[Expand/Collapse all sections]Expand all

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​FTB and CCS reconciliation is the balancing of customer's
payments/entitlements after the e​nd of the financial year. It's the way
we compare their actual income against their estimat​ed income to check
we paid their FTB and/or CCS correctly. This page provides links to
reconciliation network communications, resources and support tools.

Key dates to remember for 2021 reconciliation:

-   1 July, FTB reconciliation begins
-   5 July to 15 July, FTB 2020/21 bulk reconciliation process takes
    place
-   9 August, CCS reconciliation begins
