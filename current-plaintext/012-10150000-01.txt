This document outlines the PIP GP ACAI and how to assess and process the
PIP Service Incentive Payments (SIP) banking details form (IP011).

Aim of GP ACAI

The GP ACAI encourages general practitioners (GP) to provide increased
and continuing services in residential aged care facilities (RACF).

Eligibility and payment types

Qualifying Service Levels (QSL)

The GP ACAI has 4 payment tiers known as QSLs. These are based on a GP
providing the required number of eligible Medicare Benefits Schedule
(MBS) services in Commonwealth-funded RACFs in a financial year. This
includes those provided to Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA)
patients.

See the Resources page for information about QSLs and eligible MBS items
numbers.

Payments to bank accounts

GP ACAI payments are paid to:

-   the GP who provided the services, unless there are other
    arrangements
-   a GP's nominated bank account in the next payment quarter, once the
    required number of services has been claimed

To be eligible for the GP ACAI payments, the GP must:

-   be registered as an associated GP under a general practice that is
    approved for PIP and meets the PIP eligibility requirements
-   provide eligible MBS services to residents in RACFs
-   reach the QSLs by providing the required number of MBS services in
    RACFs in a financial year
-   provide MBS services using a Medicare provider number that is linked
    to a PIP practice

A GP does not need to apply to participate in the GP ACAI.

GPs who are eligible for payments must provide bank account details
using the Practice Incentives Program Service Incentive Payments banking
details form (IP011). Service Incentive Payments (SIP) are then paid
directly to the GP based on the eligible MBS services provided during
the payment reference period. Eligibility and payments are based on the
services provided under the provider stem - it is not location specific.

See Provider number for health professionals in Medicare for more
information about the structure of a provider number.

Changes to the GP ACAI

Changes to the GP ACAI were announced in the 2021-22 Federal Budget. The
GP ACAI was boosted to increase face-to-face servicing by GPs in RACFs.
The maximum payment for GPs for a financial year has doubled to $10,000,
with the number of service level payment tiers increasing from 2 to 4.
See the Resources page for more information about the payment tiers.

Changes to GP ACAI payments:

-   commenced in November 2021
-   be based on services provided from 1 July 2021

The August 2021 GP ACAI payments will be adjustment payments for the
2020-21 financial year. These payments will be calculated based on the
previous GP ACAI payment tiers and qualifying service levels.

Ceased incentives

On 31 July 2019, the following incentives ceased:

-   Asthma Incentive
-   Cervical Screening Incentive
-   Diabetes Incentives

GPs had until 31 March 2021 to submit a Practice Incentives Program
Service Incentive Payments banking details form (IP011) to update their
bank details for payment of any of the ceased incentives. From 1 April
2021, all remaining held payments associated with the ceased incentives
were forfeited.

Privacy and security of information

Information about GP ACAI payments can only be released to the GP who
provides the services. Do not give details to a practice owner or
authorised contact person who is not the ACAI GP.

Service Officers must perform a telephone security check before
releasing any information.

The GP can give verbal consent to release details to another person.
Service Officers must get verbal consent at the start of each call.

See Enquiry management for PIP and WIP – Practice Stream for information
on telephone security checks.

The Resources page contains a link to PIP letters, forms, contacts and
guidelines, as well as information on error messages, QSLs and eligible
MBS items numbers.
