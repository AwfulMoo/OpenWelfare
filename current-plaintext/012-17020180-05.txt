| 1                                 | Question: My services have not    |
|                                   | paid the GST for the EP item      |
|                                   | claimed. I thought EP services    |
|                                   | pay GST?                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: EP items are paid GST     |
|                                   | when the provider registers their |
|                                   | ABN with Services Australia. They |
|                                   | will need to call the GST Hotline |
|                                   | to check the ABN and register the |
|                                   | ABN with the department. EP items |
|                                   | will still pay at the schedule    |
|                                   | fee if the provider has not       |
|                                   | notified their ABN.               |

| 2                                 | Question: I have claimed an EP30  |
|                                   | item and it has not been paid.    |
|                                   | The statement indicates RSN 550   |
|                                   | code.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: In order to be paid, the  |
|                                   | item EP30 requires an initial     |
|                                   | consultation item to be paid in   |
|                                   | the previous 12 months.           |
