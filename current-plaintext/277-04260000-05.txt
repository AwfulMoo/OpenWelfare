|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Child support payers can meet an  |
|                                   | enforceable maintenance liability |
|                                   | directly via cash payments to the |
|                                   | Registrar, or via NAPs (s71, s71A |
|                                   | or s71B of the CSRC Act). A NAP   |
|                                   | has the effect of reducing the    |
|                                   | amount payable to the Registrar,  |
|                                   | it is not a payment paid to the   |
|                                   | payee pursuant to s76 of the CSRC |
|                                   | Act.                              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | As NAPs reduce the amount payable |
|                                   | to the Registrar, the NAP amount  |
|                                   | is credited against the liability |
|                                   | prior to cash being credited.     |
|                                   | Crediting amounts in this order   |
|                                   | ensures that any cash that is     |
|                                   | paid in excess, to the amount the |
|                                   | payer was required to pay to the  |
|                                   | Registrar, is treated as excess   |
|                                   | to the liability.                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The nature of NAPs also means     |
|                                   | that a NAP cannot create an       |
|                                   | overpayment, pursuant to s69B, as |
|                                   | a NAP credit is not an amount due |
|                                   | to the Registrar or payable under |
|                                   | s76. Therefore, a NAP overpayment |
|                                   | is not considered a debt to the   |
|                                   | Commonwealth and is not           |
|                                   | recoverable by the Registrar.     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | When a retrospective variation    |
|                                   | has reduced a liability, which    |
|                                   | has been met by a NAP credit,     |
|                                   | that credit will be applied to    |
|                                   | any child support debt amount     |
|                                   | that remains owing. Where a       |
|                                   | retrospective variation has       |
|                                   | reduced the liability and an      |
|                                   | overpayment is created, Services  |
|                                   | Australia (the agency) must       |
|                                   | determine if this overpayment is  |
|                                   | a s69B (cash) overpayment, if it  |
|                                   | is an excess NAP credit, or both. |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | As NAPs reduce the amount payable |
|                                   | to the Registrar when a liability |
|                                   | is retrospectively reduced and    |
|                                   | the amount paid (by NAPs, cash or |
|                                   | a combination of the two) is      |
|                                   | excess to that liability, cash    |
|                                   | payments must be uncredited       |
|                                   | first. The cash payment           |
|                                   | represents an amount the payer    |
|                                   | paid to the Registrar in excess   |
|                                   | of the amount the payer was       |
|                                   | liable to pay to the Registrar.   |

| 2                                 | Example: A child support          |
|                                   | liability of $10,000 was met by   |
|                                   | $5,000 of NAPs, and $5,000 of     |
|                                   | cash payments. A retrospective    |
|                                   | variation reduced the liability   |
|                                   | to $5,000. There is a $5,000      |
|                                   | overpayment. + Read more ...      |

|                                   | The NAPs had already reduced the  |
|                                   | amount payable by the payer to    |
|                                   | the Registrar to $5,000.          |
|                                   | Therefore, the amount payable to  |
|                                   | the Registrar, after the          |
|                                   | variation, would be $0. The payer |
|                                   | has already paid $5,000 to the    |
|                                   | Registrar, which was paid to the  |
|                                   | payee under s76. As the amount    |
|                                   | the payee was entitled to under   |
|                                   | s76 is reduced to $0, they will   |
|                                   | have been overpaid (s69B) by the  |
|                                   | $5,000 they received from the     |
|                                   | Registrar.                        |
