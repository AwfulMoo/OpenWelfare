|                                   | (HIV) is a virus which harms the  |
|                                   | immune system by destroying the   |
|                                   | white blood cells that fight      |
|                                   | infection. Acquired Immune        |
|                                   | Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) occurs |
|                                   | when the immune system has been   |
|                                   | permanently damaged by HIV and is |
|                                   | no longer effective at protecting |
|                                   | the body.                         |

|                                   | HIV and AIDS are not the same.    |
|                                   | HIV is the virus that leads to    |
|                                   | AIDS. Not everyone who has HIV    |
|                                   | will develop AIDS.                |

|                                   | In the early 1980’s, when the     |
|                                   | HIV/AIDS epidemic began, patients |
|                                   | rarely lived longer than a few    |
|                                   | years. But today, there are many  |
|                                   | effective medicines to fight the  |
|                                   | infection, and people with HIV    |
|                                   | have longer, healthier lives.     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | These medicines help people with  |
|                                   | HIV, but they are not perfect.    |
|                                   | They do not cure HIV/AIDS. People |
|                                   | with HIV infection still have the |

|                                   | An ABI is not the same as an      |
|                                   | intellectual disability. People   |
|                                   | with an ABI usually retain their  |
|                                   | intellectual abilities but have   |
|                                   | cognitive problems such as        |
|                                   | difficulty controlling,           |
|                                   | coordinating and or communicating |

|                                   | actions. Customers with an ABI    |
|                                   | can experience a significant      |
|                                   | recovery with appropriate         |

|                                   | Accident (CVA) – A stroke can     |
|                                   | cause brain damage when a blood   |
|                                   | vessel within the brain is        |

|                                   | tumour will depend on its size,   |

|                                   | brain. There are three main types |
|                                   | of brain tumours:                 |

|                                   | -   Malignant (primary) tumours – |
|                                   |     begin in the brain and        |
|                                   |     progressively invade the      |

|                                   |     slow growing and may cause    |
|                                   |     symptoms due to pressure on   |

|                                   | Infections – The brain has a      |
|                                   | protective barrier called the     |
|                                   | blood brain banner. This can be   |
|                                   | broken by bacteria or viruses,    |
|                                   | which can result in meningitis or |

|                                   | Lack of oxygen – This can occur   |
|                                   | in the case of a drowning or      |
|                                   | heart attack, where the heart     |
|                                   | ceases to beat and the oxygen     |
|                                   | supply is affected. A lack of     |
|                                   | blood supply can cause brain      |
|                                   | damage. The longer the brain goes |
|                                   | without a blood supply, the more  |
|                                   | severe the injury will be         |

|                                   | Recovery from an ABI will vary    |
|                                   | from person to person and the     |
|                                   | outcome is very difficult to      |
|                                   | predict. Recovery is usually      |
|                                   | rapid at first, with improvements |
|                                   | occurring rapidly as swelling and |
|                                   | bruising subsides. The most       |
|                                   | significant improvements usually  |
|                                   | occur within the first three to   |
|                                   | six months. After this, the       |
|                                   | recovery process slows.           |

|                                   | There are generally three stages  |
|                                   | of recovery from an ABI:          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   Acute stage – the period of   |
|                                   |     intense treatment where the   |
|                                   |     main priority is the survival |
|                                   |     and medical treatment of the  |
|                                   |     person                        |
|                                   | -   Rehabilitation stage – this   |
|                                   |     involves intensive therapy    |
|                                   |     aimed at the natural process  |
|                                   |     of recovery which aims to     |
|                                   |     reduce the long term effects  |
|                                   |     of the disability. It focuses |
|                                   |     on regaining previous skills  |
|                                   |     and overcoming ongoing        |
|                                   |     problems. This stage may take |
|                                   |     between six to twelve months  |
|                                   | -   Community re-entry stage –    |
|                                   |     this focuses on issues of     |
|                                   |     everyday living and returning |
|                                   |     to previous activities such   |
|                                   |     as work, study and leisure.   |
|                                   |     This will help the person and |
|                                   |     their family to adapt to any  |
|                                   |     long term effects of the      |
|                                   |     injury. This stage of         |
|                                   |     recovery may go for a long    |
|                                   |     period of time                |

|                                   | Post traumatic amnesia (PTA) is a |
|                                   | state of acute confusion          |
|                                   | characterised by difficulty with  |

|                                   | remembering, and concentration.   |
|                                   | PTA is the time between the       |
|                                   | injury and the recovery of        |
|                                   | continuous memory. The length of  |
|                                   | time of PTA may predict the       |
|                                   | severity and outcome of the brain |
|                                   | injury. A general assessment is,  |
