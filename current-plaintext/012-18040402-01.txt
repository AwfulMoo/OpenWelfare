This document outlines how to complete the monthly MI administrative
processes.

Monthly MI processes

The monthly MI administrative processes cover all activities the MI team
need to carry out each month (which are not covered in the registration,
assessment and payment of MI application processes) including
legislative requirements and housekeeping. These activities include:

-   managing monthly correspondence with Medical Indemnity
    Insurers (MII) and Medical Defence Organisations (MDO)
-   scanning documents
-   uploading files to HP Records Management, and
-   archiving corporate files

The Resources page contains an attachment to the Claims on Hand
spreadsheet and links to the Services Australia Website.
