This document outlines the process of creating a Carer Payment (CP) link
for paper claims between the carer and the care receiver’s record during
the new claim process where the care receiver is the partner of the
carer.

CP link

If a CP record does not have a valid CP link, one must be created. The
link assists in the administration of CP, allowing Service Officers to
identify both the carer and the care receiver when changes to
circumstances are advised. As a variation in circumstances to either
party can impact on both payments, it is important for Service Officers
to be able to easily identify, access and check both records when
actioning changes.

E525PN: Must link the carer to the care receiver error message indicates
that the carer or partner receives or has received CP and there is no
current CP link. If CP is current or is being granted or restored, this
edit is generally resolved by creating a CP link from the earliest
payment start date, or deleting the end date of an ended CP link if the
person is still caring for the same care receiver.

The Resources page contains a link to the online incident reporting
form.
