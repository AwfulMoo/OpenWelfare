This document outlines the process for conducting the phone hook-up with
New Zealand Child Support authorities on a bi-weekly basis.

New Zealand phone hook-up

The New Zealand phone hook-up occurs every Tuesday and Thursday between
Inland Revenue, New Zealand (NZIR) and the International Central
Authority (CA) team. The purpose of the hook-up is to clarify any
ongoing issues with NZIR. For example, a Service Officer has requested
information several times and the response is still not clear or
complete.
