PBS Online claiming reason code scenarios

Table 1: This table outlines the potential PBS Online reason codes the
pharmacy may receive in some substitution prescription scenarios.

The pharmacy must ensure they have met the requirements of the specific
SSSI before dispensing the substitutable medicine. All pharmacy actions
in this table are on the assumption the pharmacy has met the
requirements of the SSSI.
