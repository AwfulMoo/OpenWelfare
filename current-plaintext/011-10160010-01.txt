This document outlines information for Service Officers about how to
navigate the AIR system. Includes vaccine codes, brand names, action
codes, assessment results and payment reason codes.

Options available for navigating the AIR Mainframe

There are 2 options available for navigating the AIR Mainframe:

-   from the Immunisation Main menu (YIMM) screen
-   using screen identifier codes (accessing screens directly)

Note: each AIR screen also shows a menu of function keys (e.g. [PF9])
that navigate to other screens or perform a particular function, such as
requesting an immunisation history statement (IHS). Please view PF in
Definitions for more information on using these functions.

The Resources page contains information about screen identifier codes
and screen names, AIR vaccine codes, assessment results and payment
reason codes.
