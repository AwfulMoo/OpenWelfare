|                                   | The MLA is calculated based on    |
|                                   | the value of a customer’s real    |
|                                   | assets and their age component.   |
|                                   | The age component for the Scheme  |
|                                   | is determined as follows:         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   if the customer is single,    |
|                                   |     the age component is the      |
|                                   |     customer’s age                |
|                                   | -   if the customer is partnered, |
|                                   |     the age component is the age  |
|                                   |     of the younger member of the  |
|                                   |     couple                        |

|                                   | each year when their age          |
|                                   | component increases. The age      |
|                                   | component increases on the        |
|                                   | customer’s birthday, or if they   |
|                                   | have a younger partner, on their  |
|                                   | partner’s birthday. The MLA       |
|                                   | recalculation occurs at the end   |

|                                   | which the applicable birthday     |
