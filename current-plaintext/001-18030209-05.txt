| 1                                 | Zinnia has committed multiple     |
|                                   | mutual obligation failures in one |
|                                   | instalment period + Read more ... |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A first and a second penalty in   |
|                                   | the penalty count may be applied  |
|                                   | in the same instalment period,    |
|                                   | however a third penalty cannot be |
|                                   | applied.                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   The first mutual obligation   |
|                                   |     failure is a payment          |
|                                   |     reduction for 50%, so Zinnia  |
|                                   |     would still have compulsory   |
|                                   |     requirements                  |
|                                   | -   A second mutual obligation    |
|                                   |     failure is a payment          |
|                                   |     reduction of 100%, so Zinnia  |
|                                   |     would no longer have          |
|                                   |     compulsory requirements and   |
|                                   |     will not receive a            |
|                                   |     participation payment for     |
|                                   |     this period                   |
|                                   | -   A third mutual obligation     |
|                                   |     failure cannot be applied for |
|                                   |     the same instalment period as |
|                                   |     Zinnia is not compelled to    |
|                                   |     comply with further           |
|                                   |     compulsory requirements for   |
|                                   |     this period once a 100%       |
|                                   |     payment reduction has been    |
|                                   |     applied                       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The system will automatically     |
|                                   | remove subsequent mutual          |
|                                   | obligation failures with an event |
|                                   | date in an instalment period that |
|                                   | a second penalty has been         |
|                                   | applied.                          |

| 2                                 | Alyce's third penalty for a       |
|                                   | mutual obligation failure is      |
|                                   | revoked + Read more ...           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Alyce has committed 3 mutual      |
|                                   | obligation failures. Alyce's      |
|                                   | first, second and third penalty   |
|                                   | form a failure group. Alyce's     |
|                                   | payment was cancelled when the    |
|                                   | third penalty was applied.        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Alyce applied for a formal review |
|                                   | of decision of the third          |
|                                   | financial penalty within 13       |
|                                   | weeks. This decision was set      |
|                                   | aside by the Authorised Review    |
|                                   | Officer (ARO). The failure is     |
|                                   | revoked, Alyce's payment is       |
|                                   | restored from the date of effect  |
|                                   | of non-compliance cancellation.   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The system will, however,         |
|                                   | continue to maintain the 3        |
|                                   | penalties as a failure group.     |
|                                   | This means that if another        |
|                                   | subsequent financial penalty is   |
|                                   | applied this will form a new      |
|                                   | failure group.                    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The grouping of penalties ensures |
|                                   | that where an outcome of a        |
|                                   | decision being reviewed is        |
|                                   | favourable, job seekers will not  |
|                                   | be adversely affected by rippling |
|                                   | changes to penalties triggering   |
|                                   | retrospective payment             |
|                                   | cancellation.                     |
