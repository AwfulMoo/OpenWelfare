This document outlines information about the amendment of a Contracted
Service Provider (CSP) Officer's record in Healthcare Identifier (HI)
Service.

Requirements to amend a CSP officer record

The CSP Officer is the only individual who can request to update their
own record, and cannot amend another CSP Officer's record.

CSP Officer details can only be amended by a Service Officer once a
completed Healthcare Identifiers Service - Application to amend a
Contracted Service Provider Officer's personal details form (HW047) has
been submitted by the CSP Officer.

CSP Officer retired or unlinked from a CSP organisation

If CSP Officer record is:

-   retired from a CSP organisation, links to all associated CSP
    Organisations will be end-dated and the CSP Officer will not have
    access to the HI Service
-   unlinked or removed from a CSP organisation, the link will be
    end-dated and the CSP Officer will not have access to the HI Service

For every transaction request in the eHealth Program (EHP) application
via a Service Officer, details of the person making the request must be
entered. In addition to the Service Officer ID details, the details of
the requestor are also recorded.

The Resources page contains a link to the Healthcare Identifiers
Service - Application to amend a Contracted Service Provider Officer's
personal details form (HW047) form.
