This document outlines information about the help available for Service
Officers within the Earnings and Reporting Workflow, including help
specifically relating to salary sacrifice, allowance income, and the
difference between 'self-employed' and 'employee'.

Provision of help

Help is provided through:

-   a generic icon function to access Operational Blueprint
-   specific help and hover text for particular prompts in the workflow,
    and
-   field help for each entry field

However, there are specific areas of complexity that a customer may
raise in the earnings recording interaction that a Service Officer will
need to investigate further. These topics are not dealt with in any
question flow as they are events that would be notified during the
interaction about the employment situation. To support Service Officers,
this special help facility is provided for the following topics:

-   salary sacrifice
-   allowance income
-   self-employed or employee?

This special help is designed to indicate specific areas of complexity
that may arise, to provide some background to help a Service Officer
decide whether further research is required, and to refer the Service
Officer to the appropriate Operational Blueprint section when
appropriate.
