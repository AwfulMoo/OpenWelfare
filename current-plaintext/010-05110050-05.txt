|                                   | Students will not always maintain |
|                                   | a steady workload for the         |
|                                   | duration of a long course. A      |
|                                   | full-time student may choose to   |
|                                   | do some of the course on a        |
|                                   | part-time basis and vice versa.   |
|                                   | If possible, look at each section |
|                                   | of the course separately.         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Most courses are divided into     |
|                                   | academic periods. The standard    |
|                                   | divisions are:                    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   whole years                   |
|                                   | -   semesters (2 periods per      |
|                                   |     year), or                     |
|                                   | -   trimesters (3 periods per     |
|                                   |     year)                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Note: some courses (particularly  |
|                                   | those offered by private          |
|                                   | providers) do not have any        |
|                                   | divisions. These types of courses |
|                                   | often have a rolling start date   |
|                                   | (for example, the course starts   |
|                                   | any Monday) and will finish a set |
|                                   | number of weeks later. In these   |
|                                   | cases, look at the course as a    |
|                                   | whole.                            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Where study loads for study       |
|                                   | periods are added together to     |
|                                   | satisfy full-time study load      |
|                                   | requirements, count these periods |
|                                   | as full-time when assessing       |
|                                   | satisfactory progress.            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | For example, a student is         |
|                                   | part-time (0.250 EFTSL) in        |
|                                   | semester one and full-time (0.500 |
|                                   | EFTSL) in semester 2. Aggregation |
|                                   | assessment is completed and the   |
|                                   | customer is paid as a full-time   |
|                                   | student for both semesters. This  |
|                                   | equals 0.750 EFSTL, allowing the  |
|                                   | customer to meet the satisfactory |
|                                   | progress rules as they have been  |
|                                   | undertaking an aggregated full    |
|                                   | time study load over the year.    |

|                                   | The general rule for PES is that  |
|                                   | a student can continue to be paid |
|                                   | up to the point at which they     |
|                                   | exceed the allowable time for the |
|                                   | course.                           |

|                                   | For example, a student in a 3     |
|                                   | year bachelor degree who has      |
|                                   | already completed 4 years of      |
|                                   | study at that level would be      |
|                                   | expected to have completed the    |
|                                   | course. The delay in completing   |
|                                   | the course is not always the      |
|                                   | fault of the student, however.    |
|                                   | For this reason, allowance is     |
|                                   | made to disregard some, or all,   |

|                                   | over 4.5 years full-time. There   |
|                                   | was no particular reason for this |
|                                   | or extenuating circumstances and  |
|                                   | none of the study can be          |
|                                   | disregarded. If David applies for |
|                                   | another course at the Bachelor    |
|                                   | level, count the BA as 3 years of |
|                                   | previous study, as it is the      |
|                                   | lesser of minimum time and actual |
|                                   | time spent.                       |

|                                   | Example 2: Wendy is a highly      |
|                                   | motivated student who completed a |
|                                   | BA in 2.5 years by undertaking    |
|                                   | more than the normal study load   |
|                                   | each semester. If Wendy applies   |
|                                   | for another course at the         |
|                                   | Bachelor level, count the BA as   |

|                                   | full-time student for payment     |

|                                   | for previous study calculations.  |
|                                   | For example, a study load of 4 of |
|                                   | the normal 5 subjects in a        |
|                                   | semester is counted as 50% of the |
|                                   | year's study load (not 40%).      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | To calculate the total amount of  |
|                                   | study for multiple academic       |
|                                   | periods, measure each period as a |

|                                   | year. Therefore, a semester's     |
|                                   | full-time study load would equal  |
|                                   | 50% of a year, a trimester's      |
|                                   | 33.3% and so on.                  |

|                                   |     example, a student            |
|                                   |     undertaking 2 subjects out of |
|                                   |     the usual 4 in a semester,    |
|                                   |     would equal 25% of a full     |
|                                   |     year's study                  |
|                                   | -   as 25% concessional study     |
|                                   |     load, treat the previous      |
|                                   |     study as equal to the minimum |
|                                   |     amount of time that a         |
|                                   |     full-time student would have  |
|                                   |     taken to complete the         |
|                                   |     previous study. For example,  |
|                                   |     4 years of 25% study load     |
|                                   |     equals one year of full-time  |
|                                   |     study                         |

|                                   | Example: A student completed 4    |
|                                   | years as a 25% concessional       |

|                                   | full-time student. Count their    |
|                                   | previous study as one year        |
|                                   | because this is how long a        |
|                                   | full-time student would have      |
|                                   | taken to complete the same study. |

|                                   | Note: if a customer overloads in  |
|                                   | a semester or year, it is counted |
|                                   | as 50% (0.5) or 100% (1.0)        |
|                                   | respectively, and not the         |
|                                   | overloaded figure. For example,   |
|                                   | if a customer undertook 125% of   |
|                                   | the normal full-time workload in  |
|                                   | a year, count it as 100% (1.0) of |

|                                   | studied. If the current course is |
|                                   | 3 years full-time, PES is payable |
|                                   | for 6 years. Subtract any time    |

|                                   | relevant whether the previous     |
|                                   | study was full-time or 25%        |

|                                   | paid. .A student will continue to |
|                                   | qualify for PES until they have   |
|                                   | exceeded their allowable time.    |

|                                   | year course had previously        |
|                                   | undertaken 3 years study at the   |
|                                   | same level, some as a 25%         |
|                                   | concessional study-load student,  |
|                                   | some as a full-time student. PES  |
|                                   | was paid only for one year. Count |
|                                   | the 3 past years study as 3 years |
|                                   | so the student can be paid PES    |
|                                   | for another 3 years if they       |
|                                   | continue as a 25% concessional    |
|                                   | study-load student. They will     |
|                                   | continue to qualify for PES until |
|                                   | they exceed their allowable time. |
|                                   | They can therefore be paid for an |
|                                   | additional study period after     |
|                                   | their allowable time has been     |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Satisfactory progress is          |
|                                   | determined at the relevant date.  |
|                                   | This means that a student who has |
|                                   | any allowable time remaining      |
|                                   | (however little) may be paid      |
|                                   | until the end of that study       |
|                                   | period. If there would still be   |
|                                   | allowable time remaining at that  |
|                                   | point, payment could continue.    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Example: Akiko is starting a 2    |
|                                   | year TAFE course, which would     |
|                                   | have allowable time of 2.5 years  |
|                                   | (minimum time plus 6 months). The |
|                                   | course is divided into            |
|                                   | trimesters. Akiko has undertaken  |
|                                   | previous study at this level      |
|                                   | (Level C) which has been assessed |
|                                   | as 1.5 years. At enrolment day of |
|                                   | the first year, the time already  |
|                                   | spent in study at the same level  |
|                                   | is under allowable time and so    |
|                                   | Akiko is eligible for payment for |
|                                   | the first year of study. After a  |
|                                   | full year's study, the time spent |
|                                   | in study at this level would have |
|                                   | reached 2.5 years. At this point  |
|                                   | Akiko has reached but not         |
|                                   | exceeded the allowable time so    |
|                                   | can be paid to the start of the   |
|                                   | next study period when the        |
|                                   | allowable time is exceeded.       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Centrelink can inform Akiko when  |
|                                   | initially applying that the       |
|                                   | payments would not continue to    |
|                                   | the end of the course.            |
