|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Students will not always maintain |
|                                   | a steady workload for the         |
|                                   | duration of a long course. A      |
|                                   | full-time student may choose to   |
|                                   | do some of the course on a        |
|                                   | part-time basis and vice versa.   |
|                                   | If possible, each section of the  |
|                                   | course should be looked at        |
|                                   | separately.                       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Most courses are divided into     |
|                                   | academic periods. The standard    |
|                                   | divisions are:                    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   whole years                   |
|                                   | -   semesters (two periods per    |
|                                   |     year), or                     |
|                                   | -   trimesters (three periods per |
|                                   |     year)                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | It is easy to look at each period |
|                                   | separately in these cases but     |
|                                   | some courses, particularly those  |
|                                   | offered by private providers, do  |
|                                   | not have any divisions. These     |
|                                   | types of courses often have a     |
|                                   | rolling start date (for example,  |
|                                   | the course starts any Monday) and |
|                                   | will finish a set number of weeks |
|                                   | later. In these cases, the course |
|                                   | is looked at as a whole.          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Where study loads for study       |
|                                   | periods are added together for    |
|                                   | the purpose of satisfying         |
|                                   | full-time study load              |
|                                   | requirements, these periods are   |
|                                   | counted as full-time when         |
|                                   | assessing satisfactory progress.  |
|                                   | For example, a student is         |
|                                   | part-time (0.250 EFTSL) in        |
|                                   | semester one and full-time (0.500 |
|                                   | EFTSL) in semester two.           |
|                                   | Aggregation assessment is         |
|                                   | completed and the customer is     |
|                                   | paid as a full-time student for   |
|                                   | both semesters. This equals 0.750 |
|                                   | EFSTL, allowing the customer to   |
|                                   | meet the satisfactory progress    |
|                                   | rules as they have been           |
|                                   | undertaking an aggregated full    |
|                                   | time study load over the year.    |

|                                   | The general rule for Pensioner    |
|                                   | Education Supplement (PES) is     |
|                                   | that a student can continue to be |
|                                   | paid up to the point at which     |
|                                   | they exceed the allowable time    |
|                                   | for the course. For example, a    |
|                                   | student in a three year bachelor  |
|                                   | degree who has already completed  |
|                                   | four years of study at that level |
|                                   | would be expected to have         |
|                                   | completed the course. The delay   |
|                                   | in completing the course is not   |
|                                   | always the fault of the student,  |
|                                   | however. For this reason,         |
|                                   | allowance is made to disregard    |
|                                   | some, or all, earlier study in    |
|                                   | certain circumstances.            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The following periods of study    |
|                                   | can be disregarded:               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   a failed year (or part of a   |
|                                   |     year) if failure was due to   |
|                                   |     illness or other              |

|                                   | -   time spent studying in a      |
|                                   |     course that has been          |
|                                   |     completed but which, because  |
|                                   |     of illness, the customer      |
|                                   |     cannot use in any of the      |

|                                   | For example, a study load of four |

|                                   | semester is counted as 50% of the |

|                                   | would equal 50% of a year, a      |

|                                   |     concessional study load, then |
|                                   |     the previous study is treated |
|                                   |     as equal to the minimum       |
|                                   |     amount of time that a         |
|                                   |     full-time student would have  |
|                                   |     taken to complete the         |
|                                   |     previous study. For example,  |
|                                   |     four years of 25% study load  |
|                                   |     equals one year of full-time  |

|                                   | previous study is counted as one  |
|                                   | year because this is how long a   |
|                                   | full-time student would have      |
|                                   | taken to complete the same study. |

|                                   | Note: if a customer overloads in  |
|                                   | a semester or year, it is counted |
|                                   | as 50% (0.5) or 100% (1.0)        |
|                                   | respectively, and not the         |
|                                   | overloaded figure. For example,   |
|                                   | if a customer undertook 125% of   |
|                                   | the normal full-time workload in  |
|                                   | a year, it is counted as 100%     |

|                                   | studied. So, if the current       |
|                                   | course is 3 years full-time, then |
|                                   | PES is payable for 6 years. Any   |

|                                   | full-time or 25% concessional or  |
|                                   | whether PES was paid.             |

|                                   | Example: A 25% concessional       |

|                                   | 3-year course had previously      |

|                                   | same level, some as a 25%         |
|                                   | concessional study-load student,  |
|                                   | some as a full-time student. PES  |
|                                   | was paid only for one year. Those |
|                                   | 3 past years study are counted as |
|                                   | 3 years so the student can be     |
|                                   | paid PES for a further 3 years if |
|                                   | she continues as a 25%            |

|                                   | The result of the calculation of  |
|                                   | satisfactory progress can be used |
|                                   | to determine when allowable time  |
|                                   | would be expected to end and      |
|                                   | entitlement cease.                |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Satisfactory progress is          |
|                                   | determined at the relevant date.  |
|                                   | This means that a student who has |
|                                   | any allowable time remaining      |
|                                   | (however little) may be paid up   |
|                                   | to the end of that study period.  |
|                                   | If there would still be allowable |
|                                   | time remaining at that point,     |
|                                   | then payment could continue after |
|                                   | that. A student can therefore be  |
|                                   | told that they may be eligible    |
|                                   | for two years but after that,     |
|                                   | further payment could not be made |
|                                   | at the current level of study.    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Example: Akiko is starting a two  |
|                                   | year TAFE course, which would     |
|                                   | have allowable time of 2.5 years  |
|                                   | (minimum time plus 6 months). The |
|                                   | course is divided into            |
|                                   | trimesters. Akiko has undertaken  |
|                                   | previous study at this level      |
|                                   | (Level C) which has been assessed |
|                                   | as 1.5 years. At enrolment day of |
|                                   | her first year, the time already  |
|                                   | spent in study at the same level  |
|                                   | is under allowable time and so    |
|                                   | Akiko is eligible for payment for |
|                                   | her first year of study. After a  |
|                                   | full year's study, the time spent |
|                                   | in study at this level would have |
|                                   | reached 2.5 years. At this point  |
|                                   | Akiko has reached but not         |
|                                   | exceeded the allowable time so    |
|                                   | can be paid to the start of the   |
|                                   | next study period when the        |
|                                   | allowable time is exceeded.       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Centrelink would be able to       |
|                                   | inform Akiko when initially       |
|                                   | applying that the payments would  |
|                                   | not continue to the end of the    |
|                                   | course.                           |
