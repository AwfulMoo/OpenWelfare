|                                   | This recommendation can only be   |
|                                   | made if the customers’ income,    |
|                                   | property or financial resources   |
|                                   | are not fairly reflected in the   |

|                                   | customer’s financial resources    |
|                                   | are higher than what is reflected |
|                                   | in their adjusted taxable income, |
|                                   | this will usually lead to a       |
|                                   | recommendation to set their       |
|                                   | adjusted taxable income (that is, |
|                                   | not the annual rate) at an        |
|                                   | appropriate amount. When making   |
|                                   | this recommendation, carefully    |
|                                   | weigh the evidence to determine   |
|                                   | the customer’s true financial     |
|                                   | resources.                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the customer has high          |

|                                   | Investigators may also consider   |
|                                   | recommending setting an annual    |
|                                   | rate, however, this is rarely     |
|                                   | appropriate. For example, if the  |
|                                   | customers have made a child       |
|                                   | support agreement in principle    |
|                                   | but have not been able to         |
|                                   | formalise it, then it may be      |
|                                   | appropriate to recommend setting  |
|                                   | the annual rate at the ‘agreed’   |
|                                   | rate.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Financial Investigators must also |
|                                   | consider whether the child        |
|                                   | support assessment is ‘unfair’    |
|                                   | because the customer’s financial  |
|                                   | resources are not reflected in    |
|                                   | the child support assessment. For |
|                                   | example, if the customer’s        |
|                                   | financial resources are high, but |
|                                   | setting the customer’s adjusted   |
|                                   | taxable income would not lead to  |
|                                   | a significant change to the       |
|                                   | annual rate, the assessment would |
|                                   | not be considered ‘unfair’. This  |
|                                   | would generally lead to a ‘no     |
|                                   | further action’ recommendation.   |
