This document outlines how a change of course of study will affect an
ABSTUDY student's payment and how to process the necessary changes.

Study requirements

An ABSTUDY or ABSTUDY Pensioner Education Supplement (PES) student needs
to be studying a full-time or concessional study load, with the
exception of students who qualify for the Part-time Award, in an
approved course to qualify for their payment. An ABSTUDY PES student
must also be receiving one of the qualifying payments for Pensioner
Education Supplement (PES) and ABSTUDY PES.

Change of course

If a student tells Services Australia they are changing courses, find
out if:

-   the new course and institution are approved,
-   they are still within their reasonable time and
-   they have not exceeded limits of assistance

If the student is changing to an unapproved course or institution, they
will only be eligible for the agency's administered payments for
students if they are undertaking an approved Indigenous special course.

Note: if an ABSTUDY student or Australian Apprentice discontinues and
then subsequently starts to receive living allowance again, in either
the same course/apprenticeship or a different course/apprenticeship,
they remain entitled to ABSTUDY Living Allowance if the period between
is no greater than 28 days.

If:

-   an ABSTUDY student completes a course, then starts another course,
    code new study details
-   a student was approved to live away from home and course needs to be
    ended, see Cessation of the ABSTUDY away from home rate for more
    coding that may be needed
-   a student starts a new course and is approved to live away from
    home, see Coding away from home rate for ABSTUDY for more coding
    requirements

Online accounts

[] Students registered online can view their personal information
including study details by selecting My Details > Personal and contact
details > Manage study details menu option on their Centrelink online
account or on their mobile device using the Express Plus applications.

Students may notify the change to their study details by updating their
details online if the student provides a change to their study details,
the record may generate a DOC with details of the change for follow up
action to be undertaken by a Service Officer.

Grandfathered ABSTUDY PES

Students who receive ABSTUDY PES and transferred to JobSeeker Payment
(JSP) or Youth Allowance (YA), will stop being eligible for ABSTUDY PES
if they defer or withdraw before the end of their course if they:

-   are in the Disability Support Pension (DSP) transition group and
    assessed as having a partial capacity to work, or
-   stopped receiving Parenting Payment Single (PPS) due to their
    youngest child turning 8 years of age

If they subsequently resume the same course, they are still not eligible
for ABSTUDY PES except for ABSTUDY PES students who resume the same
course within 28 days.

date on the following screens can also affect entitlement for Relocation
