This document outlines the criteria which identifies a customer for
Income Management under the Long Term Welfare Payment Recipient (LTWPR)
and Disengaged Youth (DEY) measures.

On this Page:

Customer automatically identified for LTWPR or DEY Income Management

A customer will be identified automatically for Income Management under
the LTWPR or DEY measure if they meet all the following criteria:

The customer's usual place of residence is in the Northern Territory

The customer is in receipt of a category E welfare payment

The customer has been in receipt of a category E welfare payment for at
least

-   52 weeks during the past 104 week period for LTWPR; or
-   13 weeks during the past 26 week period for DEY
-   This period does not have to be continuous and can be any
    combination of Category E payments (that is, does not have to be the
    one payment for 52 or 13 weeks). Periods of current zero rate and
    periods where payment is suspended count towards the 52 or 13 weeks.
    Periods where the payment is assessed (such as serving a Liquid
    Assets Waiting Period) do not count towards the total

The customer is at least 25 years old and has not reached Age Pension
age for LTWPR, or is at least 15 years old and has not reached 25 years
of age for DEY

The customer is not already income managed under a measure which is
above this Compulsory Income Management (CIM) measure on the hierarchy
of Income Management measures

The customer does not have an excluded payment nominee for Income
Management purposes

DEY customer turns 25 years old

The customer may qualify for the Long Term Welfare Payment Recipients
(LTWPR) measure when they turn 25 years of age. In this case, they will
continue under that measure from their 25th birthday. If they do not
qualify for Income Management under the Long Term Welfare Payment
Recipients (LTWPR) measure they will automatically cease Income
Management on their 25th birthday.

Percentage of payments for IM

Under LTWPR and DEY measures of IM, 50% of a customer's regular payments
are income managed, and 100% of lump sum payments income managed.

Exemptions from Income Management

Customers may qualify for an exemption from Income Management under both
LTWPR and DEY measures. Different exemption criteria apply depending on
whether the customer has dependent children or not.

Exiting from Income Management

Customers cease to be income managed under these measures if:

-   it has been more than 13 weeks since they moved out of the Northern
    Territory on a permanent or indefinite basis
-   they qualify for a measure higher in the hierarchy of measures (in
    which case Income Management would continue under that measure)
-   their category E welfare payment is cancelled
-   they are granted an exemption from Income Management
-   they have an excluded payment nominee
-   the customer has passed away

Reviews and Appeals

Customers can request a review of decisions to apply Income Management
to their payments under the LTWPR and DEY measures at any time. Normal
review processes apply.
