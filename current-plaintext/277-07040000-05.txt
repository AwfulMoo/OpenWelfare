+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Question: When an application for |
|                                   | assessment is made with us and    |
|                                   | the initial contact with the      |
|                                   | liable parent is made later, can  |
|                                   | that parent's estimate be         |
|                                   | backdated to the date of          |
|                                   | lodgement of the application?     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: No, an estimate can only  |
|                                   | commence on the day that the      |
|                                   | person makes the election or the  |
|                                   | start of a new financial year or  |
|                                   | a new child support period,       |
|                                   | whichever is the later. Where the |
|                                   | estimate is lodged after 1 April  |
|                                   | an estimate for the next          |
|                                   | financial year may also be        |
|                                   | lodged. The estimate cannot be    |
|                                   | backdated to the date of          |
|                                   | lodgement of the initial          |
|                                   | application for assessment. If    |
|                                   | there are special circumstances   |
|                                   | in the case and the parent has    |
|                                   | been significantly disadvantaged, |
|                                   | it may be appropriate to suggest  |
|                                   | a Change of Assessment.           |

| 2                                 | Question: If an estimate is in    |
|                                   | place and the non-estimating      |
|                                   | customer advises that the         |
|                                   | estimating parents income         |
|                                   | circumstances have changed, can   |
|                                   | we do anything?                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: Yes. The estimating       |
|                                   | parent should be contacted to     |
|                                   | discuss their circumstances and   |
|                                   | lodging a subsequent estimate, if |
|                                   | required. The estimate can be     |
|                                   | reviewed if the estimating parent |
|                                   | doesn’t agree to lodge a          |
|                                   | subsequent estimate Refer to      |
|                                   | Child support estimates review    |
|                                   | (post 1 July 2010) for more       |
|                                   | information.                      |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 3                                 | Question: If the customer lodges  |
|                                   | another estimate within 2 months  |
|                                   | of the previous estimate can we   |
|                                   | accept it?                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: Yes, a customer can lodge |
|                                   | a subsequent estimate at any time |
|                                   | during the financial year.        |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 4                                 | Question: Can the customer ask    |
|                                   | that the estimate take effect     |
|                                   | from a future date?               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: Yes. Customers will be    |
|                                   | able to lodge a new estimate for  |
|                                   | the new financial year with an    |
|                                   | effective date of 1 July from 1   |
|                                   | April or with an effective date   |
|                                   | of the first day of a new child   |
|                                   | support period.                   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 5                                 | Question: What should I do if a   |
|                                   | customer wishes to provide an     |
|                                   | estimate of zero income?          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: A zero estimate can be    |
|                                   | accepted if the customer’s income |
|                                   | for the financial year, or for    |
|                                   | the remaining period is nil. If a |
|                                   | customer indicates they wish to   |
|                                   | lodge a zero estimate use         |
|                                   | questioning to ascertain that     |
|                                   | there is no source of income at   |
|                                   | all for the remainder of the      |
|                                   | financial year. An estimate can   |
|                                   | only be refused if you think the  |
|                                   | actual income is likely to be     |
|                                   | higher than the estimated income  |
|                                   | provided by the customer. If      |
|                                   | there are sufficient grounds to   |
|                                   | believe that the actual income    |
|                                   | will be higher than the estimated |
|                                   | income you must refuse the        |
|                                   | estimate.                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Even if a customer's income is    |
|                                   | zero at the time they make an     |
|                                   | estimate election this is not     |
|                                   | sufficient reason to accept a nil |
|                                   | estimate. Further questioning is  |
|                                   | necessary to establish whether    |
|                                   | the customer expects to earn any  |
|                                   | income before the end of the      |
|                                   | financial year. For example, if a |
|                                   | customer is no longer working but |
|                                   | expects to receive a payment for  |
|                                   | the termination of their          |
|                                   | employment from their employer or |
|                                   | a payment from their              |
|                                   | superannuation fund before the    |
|                                   | end of the financial year a nil   |
|                                   | estimate would not be accurate.   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | It is important to pay particular |
|                                   | attention to customers who work   |
|                                   | on a contract basis for less than |
|                                   | 12 months a year. For example, a  |
|                                   | contract teacher may have a       |
|                                   | contract ceasing in November but  |
|                                   | re-negotiates their contract in   |
|                                   | February the following year.      |
|                                   | During the intervening period,    |
|                                   | that person may state that they   |
|                                   | have no income however in the     |
|                                   | remainder of the financial year   |
|                                   | they will generally earn income.  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | An example of where an estimate   |
|                                   | of zero may be reasonable is      |
|                                   | where a customer is being fully   |
|                                   | supported by their spouse and     |
|                                   | expects this arrangement to       |
|                                   | continue until the end of the     |
|                                   | financial year. In this situation |
|                                   | if it can be established that the |
|                                   | customer will have no other       |
|                                   | source of taxable income, the     |
|                                   | estimate should be accepted.      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | We can accept a zero estimate if  |
|                                   | a customer becomes unemployed but |
|                                   | is unsure if they will be         |
|                                   | eligible for unemployment         |
|                                   | benefits. Pend the estimate to    |
|                                   | allow the customer time to        |

|                                   | Answer: There is no provision for |
|                                   | estimates to be backdated in the  |
|                                   | legislation. New estimates are    |

|                                   | both the estimating customer and  |
|                                   | the non estimating customer that  |
|                                   | correctly describe the real       |
|                                   | estimate amount made by the       |
|                                   | customer of $63,614 for the       |
|                                   | estimate period 1/7/17 – 30/6/18. |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This method only requires a       |
|                                   | Manual rate for the 1st day of    |
|                                   | the estimate period, and the      |
|                                   | customer can go on to lodge       |
|                                   | further subsequent estimates in   |
|                                   | the future if required (if their  |
|                                   | circumstances change).            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | However, the existence of the 1   |
|                                   | day Manual period will prevent    |
|                                   | any eventual automatic estimate   |
|                                   | reconciliation, so after the      |
|                                   | financial year is finished, the   |
|                                   | case will eventually need to be   |
|                                   | manually checked as to whether an |
|                                   | estimate reconciliation is or is  |
|                                   | not needed.                       |
