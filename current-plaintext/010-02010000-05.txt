Examples - when an ABSTUDY claim is or is not required

Table 1: This table describes examples of when a customer contacts after
previously receiving ABSTUDY or after their ABSTUDY claim was rejected
or withdrawn. The examples indicate whether the customer needs to make a
new claim for ABSTUDY, including ABSTUDY PES.

These examples do not affect the rules for closing dates and backdating
provisions. See Calculating the start date for ABSTUDY.

If ABSTUDY boarding instalments are paid, the 13-week period is
calculated from the term entitlement end date.
