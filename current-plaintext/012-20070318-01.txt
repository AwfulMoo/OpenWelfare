This document outlines details about the Ahpra Information window.

Ahpra records

Services Australia Medicare receives daily data feeds that contain
information for Ahpra health professional records which have been
created or updated.

The data feed notifications are then:

-   matched to an existing Medicare provider record in the Provider
    Directory System (PDS), or
-   saved as an Individual Medicare shell record

A Unique Identifier will show on matched records in PDS. Selecting the
Unique Identifier will bring up the Ahpra Information window. The Ahpra
window will show information received in the data feed for the PDS
record.
