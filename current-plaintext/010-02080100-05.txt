+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Ling completed a 4 year Bachelor  |
|                                   | of Business degree (with honours) |
|                                   | in 2013. In 2015 Ling started     |
|                                   | (and later completed) a 3 year    |
|                                   | Bachelor of Arts but was          |
|                                   | ineligible for Austudy due to his |
|                                   | previous study. In 2022, Ling     |
|                                   | wants to undertake a 4 year       |
|                                   | Bachelor of Engineering.          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   Ling has previously completed |
|                                   |     a 4 year degree and a 3 year  |
|                                   |     degree at the same level      |
|                                   | -   The Bachelor of Arts is       |
|                                   |     disregarded because Ling was  |
|                                   |     not eligible for Austudy for  |
|                                   |     that course due to academic   |
|                                   |     progress rules                |
|                                   | -   The Bachelor of Business      |
|                                   |     degree must still be counted  |
|                                   |     because (it was completed     |
|                                   |     within the last 10 years) and |
|                                   |     academic progress rules did   |
|                                   |     not prevent Ling from         |
|                                   |     receiving Austudy for that    |
|                                   |     course                        |
|                                   | -   At the end of the first study |
|                                   |     period in 2022, Ling will     |
|                                   |     have reached, but not         |
|                                   |     exceeded the allowable time   |
|                                   |     based on the allowable time   |
|                                   |     for a course of study for     |
|                                   |     Austudy                       |
|                                   | -   At the end of the second      |
|                                   |     study period in 2022, Ling    |
|                                   |     will have exceeded the        |
|                                   |     allowable time based on the   |
|                                   |     allowable time for a course   |
|                                   |     of study for Austudy and will |
|                                   |     no longer be eligible to be   |
|                                   |     paid Austudy for the Bachelor |

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | In 2019, Graham completed a 1     |
|                                   | year VET course at TGD level, and |
|                                   | in 2020 he completed another 1    |
|                                   | year VET course at the same       |
|                                   | level. Graham has not undertaken  |
|                                   | any prior study at this level. In |
|                                   | 2021, Graham enrolled in another  |
|                                   | 1 year VET course and applied for |
|                                   | Austudy.                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   Because his study at TGD      |
|                                   |     level has only ever been in 1 |
|                                   |     year VET courses, previous    |
|                                   |     study has been disregarded.   |
|                                   |     This means Graham has not     |
|                                   |     exceeded Allowable Time at    |
|                                   |     this level                    |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 2                                 | In 2019, Amy enrols in a 2 year   |
|                                   | VET course at TGD level and       |
|                                   | completes the course in 2021. In  |
|                                   | 2022, Amy enrols in a 1 year VET  |
|                                   | course at the same level which is |
|                                   | semester based.                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   As Amy's previous course was  |
|                                   |     a 2 year course, this study   |
|                                   |     is not disregarded.           |
|                                   |     Therefore, Amy has exceeded   |
|                                   |     her Allowable Time at this    |
|                                   |     level                         |

|                                   | -   As Marcus previous course was |
|                                   |     a 3 year course, this study   |
|                                   |     is not disregarded. Marcus's  |
|                                   |     previous study will be taken  |
|                                   |     into account when calculating |
|                                   |     allowable time for the        |
|                                   |     current course at the same    |

| 2                                 | Paul is studying dentistry. The   |
|                                   | second year of this program       |
|                                   | involves anatomy. Paul found this |
|                                   | subject distressing and           |
|                                   | consequently failed.              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   Paul's failure was not due to |
|                                   |     circumstances beyond Paul's   |
|                                   |     control. Paul was aware that  |
|                                   |     anatomy was a required part   |
|                                   |     of the program and should     |
|                                   |     have prepared for it. No      |
|                                   |     concession could be made by   |

| 3                                 | Yasmin was studying a 2 year      |
|                                   | Diploma level program in marine   |
|                                   | studies at the In Deep Waters     |
|                                   | Institute. Just over a year after |
|                                   | Yasmin started the program the    |
|                                   | Institute was declared bankrupt   |
|                                   | and closed its doors. Yasmin has  |
|                                   | now enrolled in a Diploma of      |
|                                   | Oceanography at a TAFE college    |
|                                   | but is unable to have any of the  |
|                                   | previous studies credited towards |
|                                   | the new program. Yasmin has       |
|                                   | applied for Austudy.              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Yasmin's earlier study will be    |
|                                   | disregarded. The financial        |
|                                   | mismanagement of the first place  |
|                                   | of study was not something over   |
|                                   | which Yasmin had any control.     |

| 4                                 | Simon has not worked hard in a    |
|                                   | Bachelor of Architecture degree   |
|                                   | and, following several failures,  |
|                                   | Simon has been excluded from it   |
|                                   | by the university. Simon's appeal |
|                                   | against this decision has been    |
|                                   | unsuccessful. Simon has now       |
|                                   | enrolled in a Bachelor of Fine    |
|                                   | Arts.                             |

|                                   | Simon's previous study cannot be  |
|                                   | disregarded. Although the         |
|                                   | discontinuation of the first      |
|                                   | program was forced by the         |
|                                   | university, it was ultimately the |
|                                   | result of Simon's own poor        |
|                                   | academic performance. Failure by  |
|                                   | itself is not a circumstance      |
|                                   | beyond the student's control.     |

|                                   | degree when he was diagnosed with |

|                                   | discontinued studies. After a 2   |
|                                   | year break, Kahn enrolled in a 4  |

|                                   | disregarded when calculating      |
|                                   | allowable time as the customer    |
|                                   | discontinued their study due to   |
|                                   | an illness.                       |

| 2                                 | In 2015, Sidney enrolled in a     |
|                                   | Master of Public Health through   |
|                                   | Macquarie University. This course |
|                                   | was not approved for Austudy at   |
|                                   | the time. After struggling with   |
|                                   | the course commitments, Sidney    |
|                                   | exited the course early, and in   |
|                                   | doing so received a Graduate      |
|                                   | Diploma in Public Health. Sidney  |
|                                   | has now applied for Austudy to    |
|                                   | complete a Graduate Diploma in    |

|                                   | Sidney provides proof that the    |

|                                   | was undertaken as part of an      |

|                                   | Sidney's previous study will      |
|                                   | therefore be disregarded.         |
