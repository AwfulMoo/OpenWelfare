This document outlines how to access archived Online Document Recording
(ODR) data using the Archiving and Culling Engine (ACE) application.

Archival information

All DOCs from the Historical Document List (HDL) and Historical Document
Display (HDOC) screens were archived to ACE in August 2004 and the
screens were decommissioned.

The archival frequency of DOCs on the Document List (DL) and Document
(DOC) screens is dependent on the archiving requirements as determined
by the ODR stakeholders.

ODR documents are normally archived twice a year.

The Benefit field will display the code of ODR if DOCs have been
archived for a customer record. The Archival Date field shows when the
archiving occurred. This is useful to know when defining search criteria
in ACE, as the receipt dates for the DOCs archived will be at least 24
months prior to the Archive Date. The Activity Management Receipt (AMR)
field provides the specific activity number for the archive activity.

Note: the Document List (DL) function will only display the latest 150
DOCs. Where more DOCs are available but do not display, the user needs
to enter a date range to display these.

The Resources page contains a link to the Archiving and Culling Engine
(ACE).
