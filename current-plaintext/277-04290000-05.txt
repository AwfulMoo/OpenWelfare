|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Payer has child support arrears   |
|                                   | of $15,000 and LPP of $5,000. The |
|                                   | payer lodges tax returns and the  |
|                                   | assessment is recalculated        |
|                                   | causing a variation on the case   |
|                                   | for the period                    |
|                                   | 01/06/2010-30/04/2011. This       |
|                                   | variation reduces the arrears by  |
|                                   | $2,000 on 26/08/2011.             |

|                                   | due and payable. A proportion of  |
|                                   | the LPP which accrued during and  |
|                                   | after the period of variation     |
|                                   | should be cancelled in line with  |
|                                   | the arrears as these are no       |
|                                   | longer due and payable.           |
