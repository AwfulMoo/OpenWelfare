View Child Care Attendance

Customers can access the View Child Care Attendance service via the View
Child Care Details and Payments page. The service provides weekly
details of:

-   the number of hours charged for child care
-   the amount of CCB the child care service was paid on behalf of the
    customer
-   the amount of Child Care Rebate (CCR) paid to the child care service
    (if applicable)
-   the number of days the child did not attend care, but CCB was paid
-   the amount of Jobs, Education and Training Child Care fee assistance
    (JETCCFA) the child care service was paid on behalf of the customer,
    if the customer is eligible

The child care attendance will be balanced after the end of the
financial year to ensure the correct amount of CCB has been paid to the
customer.
