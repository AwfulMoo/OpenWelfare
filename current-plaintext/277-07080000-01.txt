This document outlines the process to follow where a parent elects to
have their assessment based on an estimate of income.

Estimates review

Where a parent's income varies significantly from that used in the child
support assessment the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 allows the
parent to elect to have their assessment based on an estimate of income
in some circumstances. Parents are required to keep their estimates of
income accurate. If the estimate is no longer accurate it may be
necessary to review it. An estimate review updates the income used in
the child support assessment to more accurately reflect the actual
income of the parent.

This document applies:

-   to WA ex nuptial customers whose first estimate of the child support
    period was lodged before 3 March 2011
-   to any child support period which has an estimate lodged before 1
    July 2010

For all other customers, see Child support estimates review (post 1 July
2010).
