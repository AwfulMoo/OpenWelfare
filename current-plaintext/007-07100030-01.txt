Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A

A customer's FTB Part A may need to be limited to the base rate only.
This procedure outlines when this is appropriate and how it is recorded.

Reasons for limiting FTB Part A to the base rate:

-   the customer or partner receive a service pension or income support
    from the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA), that include a
    payment for children - that is, the Dependent Child Add On (DCAO)
    payment
-   any other reason (for example a customer has ceased income support
    payments and has not provided a new income estimate)

The FTAA screen is used to record the forced reason for assessing a
customer's entitlement to payment at the base rate of FTB Part A.
