|                                   |     The legal guardian of the     |
|                                   |     child lodges a secondary      |
|                                   |     victim claim for both         |
|                                   |     parents. However, the maximum |
|                                   |     payment that can be made to   |
|                                   |     any one secondary victim in   |
|                                   |     relation to a single          |
|                                   |     terrorist act is $75,000.     |
|                                   |     In this example, the child of |
|                                   |     the deceased parents can only |
|                                   |     receive a maximum of $75,000  |
|                                   |     and as such will receive      |
|                                   |     $37,500 from each claim. As   |
|                                   |     there is still a proportion   |
|                                   |     of the $75,000 unpaid for     |
|                                   |     both of the child's parent,   |
|                                   |     the parents of the            |
|                                   |     partners/spouses (the child's |
|                                   |     grandparents) may qualify for |
|                                   |     a payment according to the    |
