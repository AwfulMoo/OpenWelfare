|                                   | Initially, each care receiver is  |
|                                   | assessed, and a result displayed  |
|                                   | on the Care Receiver Assessment   |
|                                   | Results (CJAR) screen. This       |
|                                   | result then is used in the        |
|                                   | assessment of the carer and the   |
|                                   | final result for each claim shown |
|                                   | on the Benefit Action (BA)        |
|                                   | screen.                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A carer's claim can be cancelled  |
|                                   | or rejected for qualification for |
|                                   | one care receiver, which would    |
|                                   | display as Cancelled (CAN) or     |
|                                   | Rejected (REJ) on CJAR, but still |
|                                   | be current for another care       |
|                                   | receiver. The carer receives a    |
|                                   | payment of CA for each care       |
|                                   | receiver, so where one care       |
|                                   | receiver is cancelled, the        |
|                                   | payment ceases for that care      |
|                                   | receiver, but will continue for   |
|                                   | each current care receiver.       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The carer's benefit status line   |
|                                   | will still show as Current (CUR). |
|                                   | Where all care receivers lose     |
|                                   | qualification, the carer is       |
|                                   | automatically cancelled. The      |
|                                   | benefit status line will show     |
|                                   | CAN/NDE which expands to literal  |
|                                   | 'No Dependants Eligible', but in  |
|                                   | fact means 'No Qualifying Care    |
|                                   | Receiver'. The care receiver's    |
|                                   | assessment reason is not shown in |
|                                   | the benefit status line of the    |
|                                   | carer because it does not relate  |
|                                   | to them.                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Where a carer loses               |
|                                   | qualification, the appropriate    |
|                                   | details should be coded on the    |
|                                   | carer's record and the            |
|                                   | appropriate result will display   |
|                                   | or be coded on the BA screen. The |
|                                   | carer's benefit status line will  |
|                                   | reflect a cancellation with the   |
|                                   | appropriate code.                 |

|                                   | rejection reason. It is displayed |
|                                   | on the customer's status line and |
|                                   | is used if able to code manually. |
|                                   | In the Carer Cancellation and     |
|                                   | Suspension workflow, Service      |
|                                   | Officers can enter the 3 letter   |
|                                   | code or select the reason from a  |
