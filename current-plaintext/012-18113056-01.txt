Nurse Practitioners

A Nurse Practitioner is an advanced practice Registered Nurse (RN)
experienced in their clinical specialty, educated at Masters level, and
qualified to provide patient care in an advanced and extended clinical
role. They:

-   perform advanced health assessments
-   initiate and interpret diagnostic investigations such as pathology
    and diagnostic imaging
-   diagnose health problems
-   design, implement and monitor therapeutic regimens in collaboration
    with patients, families/careers and other health professionals
-   initiate and receive appropriate referrals to and from other health
    professionals

Nurse Practitioners are not the same as nurses, practice nurses or
mental health nurses. Only nurses who have been assessed by the Nursing
and Midwifery Board of Australia as being eligible to use the title
Nurse Practitioner are eligible to participate in the Medicare program.

Medicare eligibility and registration

A Nurse Practitioner applicant must have:

-   current registration to practise with the Nursing and Midwifery
    Board of Australia which is supported by the Australian Health
    Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra), and
-   the registration record must state in Endorsements section Nurse
    Practitioner

Failure to renew or meet registration requirements

-   Nurse Practitioners are required to renew their registration
    annually on 31 May
-   Medicare benefits cannot be paid for services provided or requested
    when they are not registered with Ahpra
-   Gaps in registration result in gaps in eligibility to access
    Medicare

Medicare Benefit Schedule (MBS) information

To access Medicare benefits Nurse Practitioners must:

have a 'collaborative arrangement' with a medical practitioner, and

-   Services Australia does not need to sight evidence of the
    arrangement. More information about collaborative arrangements can
    be found on the Department of Health and Aged Care’s website via a
    link on the Resources page

be working in a private practice (which means they cannot provide
Medicare services as an employee of a public hospital or other
government funded entity), or

be working in a public facility which has been granted an exemption
under Subsection 19(2) of the Health Insurance Act 1973, see Section 19
(2) Determination for more information, and

have professional indemnity insurance

-   Services Australia does not need to sight evidence of this

Nurse Practitioners working in public practice are eligible for a
provider number for the purpose of referring and requesting only. A
Service Rule is applied at public practice locations to prevent the
claiming of Medicare benefits.

Enquiry escalation

The Provider Registration enquiry line is used for all enquiries
relating to the processing of provider registrations.

Enquiries to this area are responded to by a Service Officer (SO). These
Service Officers escalate complex enquiries to a Programme Support
Officer (PSO) who will liaise with a Programme Officer (PO) if required.
Enquiries requiring further legislative or policy advice are escalated
to the Provider Eligibility and Accreditation team in National Office.

The Resources page contains a quick reference guide, useful contacts and
links to external websites.
