From 17 March 2021, Income Management (IM) customers based in the
Northern Territory (NT) can permanently transition to the Cashless Debit
Card (CDC) program. Customers on an income support payment who are
living in the NT and are not currently on IM, will be able to volunteer
for the Cashless Debit Card (CDC) from this date.
For more information on this process or to initiate an IM to CDC
transition, see Income Management (IM) to Cashless Debit Card (CDC)
Transition in the Northern Territory, which also contains staff
resources and links to the transition overview Intranet page for
additional information.

This document outlines priority needs for customers and the allocation
of income managed funds to meet these priority needs and any other
expenses.

Priority needs

When a customer’s payments are income managed, the funds in their Income
Management account are used to meet their and their family's priority
needs.

While a person and their family's circumstances will differ, Service
Officers will need to consider how the following basic items are to be
paid when assessing a person’s priority needs:

-   School Meals Program (if applicable)
-   food, basic personal hygiene and basic household items
-   housing, for example, rent or loan repayments
-   utilities, for example, electricity, gas, water, sewerage
-   clothing and footwear
-   medical needs

Who recommends priority needs?

Under Child Protection Income Management, a State or Territory Child
Protection Authority may recommend where a person’s income managed funds
should be directed.

Social workers who assess a customer as a Vulnerable Welfare Payment
Recipient and place them on Income Management can also recommend how a
customer’s income managed funds should be used.

Service Officers are not required to comply with the recommendation, but
should take it into consideration and document how these needs will be
met when conducting an assessment or reviewing a customer’s priority
needs.

Priority needs assessment

A customer’s priority needs can be reviewed throughout the period of
Income Management. Reviews identify if there have been any changes to
their priority needs so Income Management expenses can be updated
accordingly. An assessment of priority needs must be completed:

-   at the Initial Assessment interview
-   when there is a change in the customer’s circumstances, for example,
    change of address
-   when a Work Item is raised indicating priority needs must be checked
-   when the customer requests a review of their priority needs

Service Officers are to review the customer’s voluntary deductions (that
is, Centrepay and Rent Deduction Scheme payments) when conducting a
priority needs assessment. This review will identify whether any
deductions can be converted to an Income Management expense or if there
is any duplication of payments.

Priority needs assessments should be conducted by Service Officers
trained in Income Management. Staff not trained in Income Management can
conduct these assessments, and can seek assistance from a specialised
Service Officer (if available) or a Service Support Officer, or contact
the Access Support Centre (select 'Income Management' option) if
required.

Using income managed funds

Customers can use their income managed funds to pay for their expenses
by:

-   using the BasicsCard - a reusable PIN protected card which allows
    customers to use their income managed funds to purchase goods and
    services at approved BasicsCard merchants through the Electronic
    Funds Transfer at Point Of Sale (EFTPOS) network
-   making payments to third parties, including Third Party
    Organisations

If all current and reasonably foreseeable priority needs are being met,
any remaining income managed funds can be used for other non-prohibited
expenses.
