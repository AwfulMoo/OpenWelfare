This document outlines procedures on accepting and disclosing
information.

When accepting and disclosing customer information consideration needs
to be taken where a customer is separating from a relationship. There
are key tasks they should consider to keep their personal information
safe. The sequence of these key steps is important and all updates need
to be made separately for Centrelink, Medicare and Child Support. See
Separating Safely - Protecting personal details.
