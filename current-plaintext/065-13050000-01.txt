(ACAT).

Aged Care Assessment Teams (ACAT) process and information

Aged Care Assessment Teams (ACATs) assessors are funded by the
Department of Health and Aged Care and administered by My Aged Care.

My Aged Care is the government’s starting point to help people and/or
their carers on the aged care journey. ACAT assessors conduct
comprehensive assessments of the care recipient’s care needs and help
them access the most suitable types of care and services, including
approval for government-funded aged care. They are assessed for
eligibility for care under the Aged Care Act 1997, with approval subject
to a decision by an ACAT delegate.

After the assessment, ACAT assessors will complete a National Screening
Assessment Form (NSAF). Services Australia receives care approval
details on the NSAF transmitted via the My Aged Care gateway. This will
outline the level of care the care recipient is eligible for, see
National Screening Assessment Form (NSAF) for more information.

An ACAT assessment can be requested at Services Australia by an Aged
Care Specialist Officer (ACSO) or by registering for My Aged Care via
either:

-   Online
-   Telephone

The assessment can be requested by a family member, friend or carer of
the care recipient.

Aged Care's website.
