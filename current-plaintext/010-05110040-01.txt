This document outlines how to assess if a customer is making
satisfactory progress in their secondary studies to qualify for
Pensioner Education Supplement (PES).

Study progress measures

Progress is measured against the minimum amount of time it would
normally take a student to complete a course (either full-time or
part-time, plus an additional period). This is called allowable time.

Study in courses at the same level is measured against the time already
spent in study at that level. The only progress rule for secondary
students is students attempting the following for a third time do not
qualify for PES unless previous attempts can be disregarded:

-   Year 12, or
-   a preparatory course that is specifically designed for entry to
    University that is at Year 12 level

 

Previous Year 12 attempts

PES students who have had 2 previous attempts to complete Year 12
studies may not usually be considered a full-time secondary student
while attempting Year 12 for a third time. A Preparatory Course that is
specifically designed for entry to University that is at Year 12 level
also comes under progress rules for secondary study.

Previous attempts by a PES student to complete Year 12, or a preparatory
course at the same level as Year 12, can be disregarded for any of the
following reasons, if the student:

-   failed because English is not their first language
-   studied part-time
-   completed or discontinued studies in that year within six months of
    the start of the academic year
-   failed because of an illness that had not been diagnosed when the
    student started study in that calendar year, or for other
    circumstances beyond the student’s control that were not evident
    before the student started study in that year
-   undertook the previous course more than ten years ago

A student may also be making satisfactory progress while studying a
reduced study load if they are undertaking at least 25% of the normal
amount of full-time study and qualify for a study load concession.

Note: a student who is not making satisfactory progress for Year 12 or a
Preparatory Course may be eligible for assistance for a different level
of study.

See Determining allowable time/reasonable time for a course of study for
progress rules for Year 12 students in Determining allowable
time/reasonable time for a course of study.
