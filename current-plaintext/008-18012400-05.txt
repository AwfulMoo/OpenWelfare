| 1                                 | What happens if a secondary       |
|                                   | activity needs to be cancelled? + |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | There may be times where a        |
|                                   | secondary activity cannot be      |
|                                   | completed and needs to be         |
|                                   | cancelled.                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This can occur for example when   |
|                                   | an unresolvable Assessment        |
|                                   | Warning and Errors (AWE) edit is  |
|                                   | encountered. If cancelled, all    |
|                                   | data within that secondary        |
|                                   | activity will be lost and will    |
|                                   | need to be re-keyed in the        |
|                                   | primary activity (the new claim   |
|                                   | activity).                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | It is not possible to use a       |
|                                   | secondary activity as a primary   |
|                                   | activity and transfer the task    |
|                                   | back to the original primary      |
|                                   | activity.                         |

| 2                                 | Do all secondary activities need  |
|                                   | to be completed before completing |
|                                   | the primary activity? + Read more |
|                                   | ...                               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Yes. When a secondary activity is |
|                                   | created, data is removed from the |
|                                   | primary activity and transferred  |
|                                   | to the secondary activity.        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the primary activity is        |
|                                   | completed before the secondary    |
|                                   | activity, the data in the         |
|                                   | secondary activity will not be    |
|                                   | assessed.                         |

| 3                                 | What do I need to consider when   |

|                                   | The system displays edits and     |
|                                   | warnings on the Assessment        |
|                                   | Warning and Error (AWE) screen to |
|                                   | stop data from being applied      |
|                                   | incorrectly. The system however   |
|                                   | cannot make all of the decisions. |
|                                   | Service Officers must carefully   |
|                                   | consider decisions to apply       |
|                                   | provisional data as transferring  |
|                                   | tasks may result in an incorrect  |
|                                   | assessment and incorrect result.  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | For example, do not apply data    |
|                                   | immediately:                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   if data is incomplete. For    |
|                                   |     instance, all assets are not  |
|                                   |     coded                         |
|                                   | -   until necessary verification  |
|                                   |     is received. For instance,    |
|                                   |     where more information is     |
|                                   |     required before coding assets |
