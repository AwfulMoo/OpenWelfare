This document outlines how a customer is considered to be satisfying the
YA activity test while intending to study.

Continuing/intending students

Continuing/intending students are considered to be satisfying the
activity test for full-time students. This means, in some circumstances,
they are considered to be a full-time student during study breaks, such
as semester/trimester holidays.

If a customer is not considered a continuing/intending student, they
will not meet the student activity test until they commence their
course.

Non-intending students

Students not considered to be 'intending students' are those who:

-   did not study in or complete the last available semester or study
    period immediately prior to claiming
-   deferred their course for a period of time and are now planning to
    continue the course, or
-   transferred to payment as a job seeker at the end of their previous
    study and now plan to return to study

These customers will not be considered to be a full-time student until
they start their course. Until they qualify for YA (student) they may
need to test their eligibility for another payment, for example,
JobSeeker Payment or YA (job seeker) if they require assistance before
the course commences.

Transfer from job seeking payment

Customers transferring from JobSeeker Payment (JSP) or YA (job seeker)
continue to receive this payment until they start study, as long as they
continue to meet the mutual obligation requirements. While the customer
would normally be expected to look for all suitable work, for the
interim period they may satisfy the mutual obligation requirements by
looking for suitable work that would not prevent them from starting
study (for example, part-time or casual work).

Notification of cessation of studies

If a YA (student) ceases full-time study, they must notify Services
Australia and register as a job seeker within 14 days. Failure to notify
cessation of study within 14 days will result in cancellation of YA from
the study end date plus 1 day. In these circumstances, payment of YA as
a job seeker may only commence from the date the customer contacts the
agency and lodges a new claim. A debt may be generated for students who
fail to notify cessation of studies. There is no change to policy or
process for customers advising an intention to study.

Unfavourable decision

When making an unfavourable decision, speak to the customer:

-   explain the decision
-   give them a chance to provide more information, and
-   advise their review and appeal rights
