Centre.

This document outlines the different categories and fields used by
Services Australia social workers in the Child Support Smart Centre to
record Child Support referrals in the Social Work Information System

Child safe framework

Services Australia has a zero tolerance approach to child abuse.

A staff member must act when they see or hear behaviour which raises
concern about a child or young person’s safety. Follow the agency's Risk
Identification and Reporting model when identifying and responding to
child safety concerns. See Risk identification and management of threats
to the safety or welfare of a child.

Social work priority customers

Social workers in the Child Support Smart Centre are focused on
providing support to customers with highly complex needs, particularly
those customers presenting at risk of suicide, self-harm or harm to
others, including risks of harm to children.

The Resources page contains links to the Threat to self-harm and/or to
harm others and the Secutiry incident reporting on the intranet.
