Policy (IEP). The trial operated until 13 May 2005.

    funding, for non-wage costs in establishing their own small business

-   providing business advice and support

ISEP participants

Many ISEP participants were receiving either JobSeeker Payment (JSP) or
Youth Allowance (YA). These ISEP participants had their involvement in
the trial acknowledged as an approved activity in their Activity
Agreement which satisfied their job search requirements under JSP or YA.

Participation in ISEP was voluntary and could be undertaken concurrently
with some complementary programs such as voluntary work.

Hours of participation did not need to be verified as participation in
the programme was considered to be sufficient to satisfy the Activity
Test.
