|                                   | Carol's separated partner, Ron,   |
|                                   | pays $150 per calendar month      |
|                                   | repayment off a loan to provide   |
|                                   | child support for their 3         |
|                                   | children, now in Carol's care.    |

|                                   | The loan is in both names and is  |
|                                   | for an entertainment centre that  |
|                                   | is in Carol's home.               |

|                                   | Assessable child support = $75    |
|                                   | per calendar month ($900 pa)      |

|                                   | Only half the amount paid is      |
|                                   | assessed because the other half   |
|                                   | is paying off Ron's debt.         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | As Carol has not yet applied for  |
|                                   | a Child Support assessment after  |
|                                   | separating, this child support    |
|                                   | should be recorded as voluntary   |
|                                   | child support.                    |

|                                   | is available for Carol and her    |
|                                   | children to use.                  |

|                                   | Although Carol has full use of    |
|                                   | the entertainment centre, the     |
|                                   | full amount paid is going toward  |
|                                   | paying off Ron's debt and         |
|                                   | increasing the value of Ron's     |

|                                   | If the loan was in Carol's name   |
|                                   | only, the full $150 would be      |
|                                   | assessed as child support.        |

|                                   | separated. They have a joint      |
|                                   | credit card on which they owe     |
|                                   | $870. Ron has agreed to pay $100  |

|                                   | that Carol will be able to use    |

|                                   | treated as child support because  |

|                                   | the credit.                       |
