This document outlines the process for Services Australia staff to
follow when a Job Capacity Assessment (JCA) report is found to have
inconsistencies submitted by the Assessor.

Purpose of escalation protocols

The agency requires a single professional view of a customer's
functional impairment and work capacity. This may include between
Assessment Services Assessors, Health Professionals Advisory Unit (HPAU)
Advisors, staff such as Disability processing team Service Officers,
Authorised Review Officers (ARO), International Services processing, and
legal representatives of Litigation Branch (LB).

Staff are required to make sound decisions about DSP medical eligibility
informed by expert opinion. There are escalation procedures in place if
differing or unclear expert opinion relevant to a JCA report is
identified. This ensures one agency professional view is available to
support good decision-making.

The JCA report contains the Assessor's recommendations about a
customer's impairment rating, work capacity, appropriate interventions,
recommended referrals to employment assistance programs, risk of
non-compliance ratings and vulnerability indicator categories.

Principles of escalation protocols

At the new claim stage, the escalation protocols:

-   aim to ensure a complete assessment of medical information
-   support one agency view with regards to input into a JCA, meaning
    assessment services and HPAU advisors determine a shared view before
    submitting a JCA report

There are escalation protocols for:

-   Disability Support Pension (DSP) new claims process
-   Explanation of decision process
-   Authorised Review Officers (ARO)
-   International Services (CIS) Subject Matter Expert (SME) officers
-   Litigation Branch (LB) advocates
-   Assessment Services Assessors and HPAU advisors

Assessment Services internal escalation process

The Assessment Services internal escalation process:

-   provides a mechanism to capture and manage issues as required within
    the agency's quality framework including reporting to support
    process improvement
-   provides a mechanism for Assessors to reconsider and adjust work
    capacity, in line with requirements within the Social Security Guide
-   helps in clarifying alignment of medical evidence to assessed
    impairment and work capacity
-   supports collaboration between Assessors, HPAU advisors and agency
    staff to achieve timely advice and consideration of a customer's
    functional impairment and work capacity when additional or new
    information becomes available during the review and appeal process
-   provides staff with avenues to discuss additional information
    provided during the review and appeal process where reassessment is
    not warranted (for example, evidence of mental health diagnosis by a
    clinical psychologist or psychiatrist)
-   helps International Services staff in determining complex matters
    regarding impairment and work capacity for foreign pension and
    Agreement claim matters
