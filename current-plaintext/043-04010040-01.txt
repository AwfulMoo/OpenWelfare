This document outlines how to assess and code the MOD PC.

Purpose of MOD PC

A MOD PC is used where a customer has indicated that they are or were,
in the last 5 years before claiming income support or Low Income Card
(LIC), involved in a private company. The information collected in
conjunction with the MOD PC enables Services Australia to assess income
and assets from a private company.

Complex Assessment Officer (CAO) role

Customers involved in a private trust, including a Special Disability
Trust, or private company must have their involvement assessed and coded
by a Complex Assessment Officer (CAO). Any updates to a private trust or
private company must be forwarded to the CAO.

Identifying and making suitable referrals to the CAO includes other
cases which can be referred for CAO assessment. Updates where there are
simple changes to a customer’s income and assets, not including updates
to a private trust or private company, can usually be assessed and coded
by Service Officers.

CAOs create an entity record for each private trust and company. They
record all the trust and company financial details and the attribution
decision on this record. The record is linked to customer's record with
the income and asset information flows through to them to ensure they
receive the correct entitlement.
