This document outlines the process for Service Updates contacts for
Principal Carers Large Family Eldest Child Reviews. The purpose of the
Service Update contact is to review ongoing eligibility to the large
family exemption from mutual obligation requirements (referred to in the
remainder of this document as exemption), and to inform the customer of
changing mutual obligation requirements, if the exemption cannot be
extended.

Automatic exemption for 12 months at a time

An automatic exemption for the principal carer of a large family may be
granted for up to 12 months at a time if the customer has provided
verification and is:

the principal carer of 4 or more dependent children:

-   aged under 16, or
-   aged 16-18 years inclusive and a secondary pupil child

caring for a child when they are:

-   a relative (other than a parent), and
-   directed by a Parenting or Protection Order made under the Family
    Law Act, for example. in a Children's Court or Family Court

a family or community member (not the parent) caring for a child under:

-   a Parenting Plan, or
-   another document that has the support of the relevant
    state/territory authority.
    Note: The definition of child in this case relates to the child
    definition in each state or territory and may include children over
    the age of 16 years

Service Update contacts for Principal Carers Large Family Eldest Child Reviews

From 1 July 2021, the Service Profiling appointment for the Principal
Carer Large Family Exemption Review were replaced by work items for job
seekers. These changes do not affect Remote Customers who will continue
to be serviced via booked appointments.

Contact is made with principal carers who have a large family exemption
in place, if they have a qualifying child turning 16 years, and they
will no longer have at least 4 other qualifying children aged under 16.
A Service Update will be automatically generated when the child is 15
years and 9 months.

This is applicable to new claimant Parenting Payment (PP) recipients,
and principal carers in receipt of JobSeeker Payment (JSP), Youth
Allowance (YA) or Special Benefit (SpB) NVH (Nominated Visa Holder).

This is a compulsory contact and is to be conducted within 2 months of
either side of the child turning 15 years and 9 months.

Profiling/Parenting circs activity

Do not complete via the Profiling/Parenting circs activity on the
Activity List (AL) screen as this closes the work item without updating
the required service profiling coding. The info link under the help
column explains that this activity and corresponding work item will
close if actioned correctly under the Service Strategy (PQSS) screen.

Note: during a transition period, appointments booked on or after the 1
July 2021 by service profiling will still need to be conducted (this
includes rescheduling if required).

The briefing contact

The briefing contact is to cover the following information:

Discuss whether the child meets the secondary pupil child definition
after turning 16 years old and therefore allows the customer to have the
large family exemption extended. Note: the customer must have at least 1
qualifying child under 16 years of age to allow the exemption to be
extended

Discuss whether the child will remain in secondary school and be living
at home after turning 16 years old

If necessary get evidence from customer that the child is enrolled in
school after turning 16 years old

Inform customer of changes to their mutual obligation requirements when
eldest child turns 16 years old, if the exemption cannot be extended

Part-time mutual obligation requirements to look for work of at least 15
hours per week or undertaking other approved activities

Change in base rate when the exemption is removed if the principal carer
is single and in receipt of JSP, YA (other) or SpB

-   A combination of some or all of the above activities

and/or study, the customer must be registered and participate with an

customer may choose to volunteer with an Employment Services Provider
