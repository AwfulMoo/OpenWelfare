|                                   | associated with and if these      |
|                                   | businesses have derived a net     |

|                                   | the profit of the business varies |
|                                   | from year to year, consider using |
|                                   | one of the following approaches:  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   Averaging the net profit –    |
|                                   |     average the profit out over 3 |
|                                   |     years where there is no       |
|                                   |     identifiable or predictable   |
|                                   |     trend in the net profit       |
|                                   |     declared by the business. For |
|                                   |     example, a business has       |
|                                   |     declared net profits of,      |
|                                   |     $95,000 in 2011, $65,000 in   |
|                                   |     2012 and $125,000 in 2013     |
|                                   |     average the profit out over 3 |
|                                   |     years                         |
|                                   | -   Averaging net profit with an  |
|                                   |     isolated unusual result       |
|                                   |     removed – when there is an    |
|                                   |     unusual net profit result in  |
|                                   |     the past 3 years and these    |
|                                   |     changes have occurred due to  |
|                                   |     circumstances which are       |
|                                   |     unlikely to be repeated,      |
|                                   |     average the profit out, but   |
|                                   |     exclude the unusual year. For |
|                                   |     example a business has        |
|                                   |     received income for a unique  |
|                                   |     event such as the sale of an  |
|                                   |     asset or the business did not |
|                                   |     trade for a period of time in |
|                                   |     1 year because the owner was  |
|                                   |     unable to work for health     |
|                                   |     reasons                       |
|                                   | -   Trending – if the evidence    |
|                                   |     shows that a business’ net    |
|                                   |     profit has been trending up   |
|                                   |     or down, consider the net     |
|                                   |     profit amount or likely net   |
|                                   |     profit amount for the current |
|                                   |     and future child support      |
|                                   |     periods. For example, a       |
|                                   |     business has net profits of   |
|                                   |     $95,000 in 2010, $100,000 in  |
|                                   |     2011, $102,000 in 2012 and    |
|                                   |     $105,000 in 2013. As the      |
|                                   |     average annual increase of    |
|                                   |     the business’ net profit has  |
|                                   |     been $3,333 over the 3 years  |
|                                   |     consideration can be given to |
|                                   |     allowing for net profit       |
|                                   |     growth in the current and     |
|                                   |     future years                  |
|                                   | -   Use the most recent year –    |
|                                   |     use the most recent year of   |
|                                   |     reported net profit if it     |
|                                   |     provides the best             |
|                                   |     representation of the         |
|                                   |     business’ current performance |
|                                   |     and expected net profit for   |
|                                   |     the business now and into the |
|                                   |     future                        |
|                                   | -   Use the year most similar to  |
|                                   |     current circumstances - use   |
|                                   |     the net profit from the year  |
|                                   |     that most closely represents  |
|                                   |     the current circumstances.    |
|                                   |     For example, if the BAS and   |
|                                   |     the bank statements for the   |
|                                   |     business reveal total sales   |
|                                   |     similar to the amount earned  |
|                                   |     two years ago, it may be      |
|                                   |     appropriate to determine the  |
|                                   |     net profit of the business    |
|                                   |     based on the profit generated |
|                                   |     two years ago.                |

|                                   |     of the customer. For example, |

|                                   |     net profit can be 100%        |
|                                   |     attributed to the customer if |

|                                   |     work, 100% of the net profit  |
|                                   |     could be attributed to that   |

|                                   | Depreciation is the process of a  |

|                                   | has a life span of more than 12   |
|                                   | months. The depreciation expense  |
|                                   | is a ‘paper based’ or ‘non-cash’  |
|                                   | expense. It has the effect of     |

|                                   | asset and increasing the expenses |
