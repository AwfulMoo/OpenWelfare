|                                   | Hema is studying a Bachelor of    |
|                                   | Applied Science (Optometry). Last |
|                                   | year Hema failed a physics        |
|                                   | subject that is a prerequisite    |
|                                   | for several subjects in semester  |
|                                   | 1 this year. Hema is repeating    |
|                                   | this subject but cannot enrol in  |
|                                   | all of the normal second year     |
|                                   | subjects. As a result, Hema is    |
|                                   | only undertaking 71% of the       |
|                                   | normal full-time study load.      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Hema is eligible for the 66%      |
|                                   | study load concession in semester |
|                                   | one and so satisfies the activity |
|                                   | test for Austudy. The subjects    |
|                                   | Hema couldn't undertake in        |
|                                   | semester one are prerequisites    |
|                                   | for subjects in semester two. As  |
|                                   | a result Hema can only undertake  |
|                                   | 74% of a normal full-time study   |
|                                   | load in semester two. Hema is     |
|                                   | again eligible for the 66%        |
|                                   | concession in semester 2.         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | John is studying a Bachelor of    |
|                                   | Arts majoring in Government and   |
|                                   | English Literature. John failed   |
|                                   | GT100, a core first year          |
|                                   | Government subject, last year and |
|                                   | cannot enrol in second year       |
|                                   | Government subjects until it is   |
|                                   | passed. John proposes to retake   |
|                                   | GT100 this semester but as no     |
|                                   | other Government subjects can be  |
|                                   | done the study load will be 70%   |
|                                   | of the normal amount of full-time |
|                                   | study.                            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | John is not eligible for the 66%  |
|                                   | load concession. Although the     |
|                                   | failure in GT100 stops any        |
|                                   | Government subjects being done    |
|                                   | there is nothing stopping other   |
|                                   | Arts subjects be undertaken.      |
