|                                   | Helen was caring for a relative,  |
|                                   | Jacob (aged 10) and received      |

|                                   | The bereavement lump sum is       |
|                                   | calculated as follows:            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   Work out the rate at which    |
|                                   |     DOP was payable immediately   |
|                                   |     before the first available    |

|                                   |     payday. The result is called  |
|                                   |     the continued rate            |
|                                   | -   Work out the number of        |

|                                   | -   Multiply the daily rate by    |

|                                   |     in Step 2. The result is the  |
