|                                   | reasonable explanation must be    |
|                                   | provided by the person,           |
|                                   | supporting the fact that          |

|                                   | if the payment of arrears was not |

|                                   | overpayment, they elect to        |
|                                   | receive the base rate of FTB Part |
|                                   | A and wait until the end of the   |
|                                   | financial year to receive any     |
|                                   | additional FTB Part A they may be |

|                                   | choice, as the risk of an         |
|                                   | overpayment is now minimal.       |

|                                   | currently have a nil rate FTB     |
|                                   | choice in place. They claim FTB   |
|                                   | on 1 April 2014 for their 2nd     |
|                                   | child born on 4 March 2014. In    |
|                                   | this claim they have requested to |

|                                   | all FTB payments fortnightly.     |

|                                   | In order for NBU to be paid, the  |
|                                   | payment choice would need to be   |
|                                   | revoked from the date of birth    |
|                                   | (DOB) of the 2nd child (4 March   |
|                                   | 2014).                            |

|                                   | If the choice is not revoked, the |
|                                   | change would only take effect     |
|                                   | from the date paid to (DPT) + 1,  |
|                                   | therefore resulting in NBS paying |
|                                   | for the remaining period, but NBU |
|                                   | would not be paid due to the      |
|                                   | change not including the first    |
|                                   | day of NBS eligibility (for       |
