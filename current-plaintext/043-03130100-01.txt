This document outlines the assessment of income for a customer who
operates a business either as a sole trader, in a partnership or through
a trust or company, and who advises that their regular seasonal business
activity has ceased. This seasonal event is part of the normal cycle of
activity of the business.

Reassessment of income

In this case, the rate of income earned from the business should be
reassessed:

-   During the period of business inactivity - nil income should be
    maintained from the business
-   During the period in which the business operates - the current rate
    of income maintained should be based upon the profit earned by the
    business during that period in which business activities are
    undertaken, that is, the period that business operations have ceased
    is ignored when calculating the current rate of assessable income

A reassessment of the income of a business can be undertaken at the
request of a customer at any time during the year. This will require
provision of full financial details including profit and loss statement,
balance sheet and evidence of the circumstances that require a review.

The Resources page contains an example of a calculation of income to be
assessed from the business during the period in which the business
activities are undertaken.
