Enquires on CCB and/or CCR reconciliation

When a customer enquires about Child Care Benefit (CCB) and/or Child
Care Rebate (CCR) reconciliation:

-   check the customer's record to view the status of the CCB and/or CCR
    reconciliation/lump sum claim for the relevant financial year
-   If CCB reconciliation has not occurred or the lump sum claim has not
    been finalised, explain what information is still required or why
    reconciliation is delayed
-   If the customer's details have changed for the relevant financial
    year (for example they may need to update their income estimate,
    child commencing school details, amendments to their Work, Training
    and Study Test or advise they or their partner are not required to
    lodge a tax return for that financial year), update the details on
    the customer's record. This may trigger CCB reconciliation or
    re-reconciliation

If the customer has confirmed that the service has lodged child care
attendance and they still have not been paid or there are other issues
with their child's attendance, see Customer queries Child Care
Management System (CCMS) information.

If CCB reconciliation has occurred or the lump sum claim is finalised,
explain the outcome to the customer, including details of any top-up
payment or overpayments calculated, and any amounts used to offset any
CCB/CCR debts.
