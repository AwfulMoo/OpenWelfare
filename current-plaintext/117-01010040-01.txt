This document outlines information that helps with the completion of a
Module C Compensation and damages Form (Mod C). Customers get a Mod C
when they (or their partner) receive, or are entitled to receive
compensation payments or damages for a personal injury.

Personal injury compensation

Personal injury compensation can be paid for:

-   a work related injury or illness
-   injuries from a car accident, or
-   any other reason due to the negligence or the fault of another
    person

Income protection policies attached to superannuation policies are not
treated as compensation. See The effect of compensation on Social
Security payments.

When a customer has an injury, they (or their partner) must pursue and
obtain the compensation they are eligible to get.

Points to note when completing a Mod C verbally for current customers only

When taking details verbally, use the New Compensation and Damages
Notification (Mod C) to ask questions.

If the customer does not know all the information, or have supporting
documents:

-   send them the Mod C
-   tell them they have 14 days to complete it and supply the supporting
    documents

Points to note when the customer returns the Mod C:

-   all questions must be complete
-   it must be signed by the compensation claimant

The customer must provide documents for:

-   lump sum settlements (where available)
-   income replacement policy
-   sickness and accident policy
-   sporting injuries

If the Mod C is not complete, do not run the New Compensation and
Damages Notification (Mod C) Workflow.

The customer will need to complete a separate Mod C for each compensable
injury or claim

The Resources page has a link to the Online Forms site for the Mod C.
