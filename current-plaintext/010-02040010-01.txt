This document outlines how to determine if a student or Australian
Apprentice can be considered independent for ABSTUDY on the grounds they
are currently or previously married, in a de-facto relationship of at
least 6 months, or in a registered relationship.

Independence criteria

Students and Australian Apprentices applying for ABSTUDY are considered
independent if they are currently or previously married, in a de-facto
relationship of at least 6 months, or in a registered relationship.

This category of independence is permanent. Once granted, the student or
Australian Apprentice remains eligible for independent status for this
claim and any other claims for ABSTUDY.

Before 14 July 2023, independence for ABSTUDY customers in a de facto
relationship of at least 6 months was reviewable. This means the student
or Australian Apprentice may have no longer been considered independent
if their circumstances changed and they ceased being in a de facto
relationship.
