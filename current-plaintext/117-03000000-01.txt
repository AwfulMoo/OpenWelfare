This document outlines how payments of periodic compensation are
treated, the recording of these payments and the actions required when
customers receive a lump sum payment for arrears of periodic
compensation.

Assessment of compensation payments

Treat these payments as either:

-   a direct deduction (that is, dollar for dollar) or
-   as ordinary income

Treat the excess over the customer's maximum basic rate as ordinary
income for the partner.

Arrears of compensation paid

When an arrears payment of periodic compensation is made any
compensation affected payment (CAP) that have been paid will need to be
repaid.

A recovery notice will be sent to:

-   the compensation payer, or
-   letters of debt to the customer and/or their partner
