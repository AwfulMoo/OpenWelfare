This document explains the process for investigating No Show, No Pay
failures generated for failing to attend or inappropriate behaviour at a
job interview. Participation Solutions Team (PST)-skilled Service
Officers are responsible for all No Show, No Pay investigations and
determinations.

No Show, No Pay policy

A No Show, No Pay failure may be generated for a CDP job seeker when:

-   they do not attend a job interview (including arriving late or
    leaving early); or
-   during a job interview they deliberately behave in a manner that
    results in a job offer not being made

When non-compliance occurs within the CDP job seeker's control the
intention is that a No Show, No Pay failure should be applied.

No Show No Pay failures do not apply for non-attendance or misconduct at
voluntary activities such as Work for the Dole.

Responsibilities of PST-skilled Service Officers

Once contact with the CDP job seeker is established, PST-skilled Service
Officers are responsible for:

-   assessing the impacts of any identified personal factors or
    circumstances impacting the CDP job seeker's capacity to comply with
    their requirements.
    Note: a PST skilled Service Officer must consult with a PST-skilled
    social worker where the job seeker presents with family and domestic
    violence or has a current Family relationships/Domestic violence
    circumstance recorded. See Accessing a PST-skilled social worker
-   ensuring the CDP job seeker clearly understands expectations as well
    as the consequences of non-compliance
-   giving the CDP job seeker the opportunity to explain their reasons
    for the failure and recording their explanation in the Compliance
    Investigation workflow
-   gathering relevant evidence to establish the facts
-   assessing whether the work was suitable for the CDP job seeker
-   assessing whether the CDP job seeker had a reasonable excuse for
    non-compliance
-   making the decision to apply or reject the No Show, No Pay
-   recording the investigation, and evidence considered, appropriately
    in the Compliance Investigation workflow
-   explaining the CDP job seeker's rights of review and appeal when a
    failure is applied
-   generating a Comprehensive Compliance Assessment (CCA) if
    appropriate

Assessing reasonable excuse

The PST-skilled Service Officers considers the CDP job seeker's reasons
for non-compliance, including if the reasons and/or circumstances:

-   were foreseeable or within the job seekers control
-   directly affected their ability to comply
-   are acceptable under the reasonable excuse provisions

Reasonable excuse is not assessed when misconduct at a job interview has
been established. The focus of these incidents must be if the behaviour
was in the CDP job seeker's control.

An assessment of prior contact for non-attendance at a job interview is
not required by legislation for a determination to be made, however, it
may add weight to establishing the CDP job seeker's intent to comply.
