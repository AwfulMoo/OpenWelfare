This document outlines the TFES and how to claim TFES assistance.

Assistance for shippers

TFES was introduced on 1 July 1976 to address the sea freight cost
disadvantage experienced by Tasmanian industries. The Scheme assists
shippers who transport eligible goods by sea between Tasmania and the
Australian mainland. Shippers can make claims for TFES assistance
directly to Services Australia, after paying the freight costs.

Delivering government services

Services Australia administers TFES on behalf of the Department of
Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications. The
Scheme operates under a set of Ministerial Directions approved by the
Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and
Communications.

Service Officers in Service Centres who receives TFES forms must date,
