Integrated Care

Integrated Care manages care changes for customers across the Child
Support and Centrelink Programs.

For the Child Support Program, Integrated Care manages:

-   Child Support referrals for disagreed care (where there is no
    pending registration)
-   Child Support referrals for disputed care where the date of event
    occurred prior to 23 May 2018 (old legislation)

For the Centrelink Program, Integrated Care manages:

-   Centrelink referrals for disagreed care (exception of new baby
    claims which are out of scope)
-   Centrelink referrals for disputed care where the date of event
    occurred prior to 23 May 2018 (old legislation)
-   Left care without consent

Integrated Care Service Officers provide customers with a case-managed
approach for care change notifications. Integrated Care Service Officers
assess the impacts of the care change on Family Assistance, Child Care,
Child Support, Income Support and Medicare Basics and ensure care is
accurately reflected in both the Child Support and Centrelink systems.
Customers are provided with the information and connections they need to
access services from relevant community support organisations and
government departments.

To assist with actioning a change in care notification, see Integrated
care - Notification and recording of change in care to access
care-related resources and tools.

relating to care.

Roles and responsibilities

Integrated Care Service Officer

The roles and responsibilities for the Integrated Care Service Officers
(case managers) are:

record the change in care details to apply to the customer's relevant
assessment(s)

correct data exchange errors

conduct investigations

manage disagreed care

make and give effect to a care determination

address impacts resulting from the change in care determination such as:

-   automated restart of child support case
-   restarting a case, when a customer has applied during the care
    change process and the case is ending because of a late notified
    care
-   reversal of customer roles for child support
-   adding a relevant dependent child to a related child support
    assessment if there has been a change in care (for multi-case
    customers)
-   referring the customer to the Agreements and Court order team if a
    child support agreement applies and the payee ceases to be an
    eligible carer
-   adding an FTB eligible child to a current FTB assessment (excluding
    newborns)
-   process a FTB new claim or advise of the requirement to lodge a new
    claim for a child (excluding newborns)
-   inform customers of Income Support Payment outcomes and effects
-   identify eligibility for additional family assistance options for
    customers with a Regular Care Child

Customer Management in Integrated Care

Integrated Care Service Officers undertake work in both the Centrelink
and Child Support programmes, therefore their customer management
process includes:

-   the Child Support Customer Management Approach (CMA), where staff
    undertake Minimum Collection Activity and common activities until
    the care decision is made. See Common and specialised activities for
    Child Support staff
-   Completing Centrelink Business Imperatives within scope. The
    Resources page contains a link to the Business Imperatives homepage.

While on the phone with a customer, Service Officers will undertake the
above activities and any other items within scope. This would generally
not include Family Tax Benefit (FTB) new claims unless the customer is
experiencing financial hardship.

After Call Work can be used to finalise documentation, care decision
coding, and create intrays/activities for any post decision follow-up
required.

Authorisations and delegations

APS 3 or above

An APS 3 or above is authorised to:

-   determine a care percentage where a parent has had, or is likely to
    have, no pattern of care for a child (0% care) (s49)
-   determine a care percentage where a parent has had or is likely to
    have a pattern of care for a child (more than 0% care) (s50)
-   revoke an existing care percentage determination where a new care
    percentage determination under s49 or s50 would affect the cost
    percentage (s54F)
-   revoke an existing percentage care determination where a new care
    percentage determination under s49 or s50 does not affect the cost
    percentage but would affect the care percentage (s54H)

except where:

-   the care percentage is to be determined for a period where 1 parent
    unexpectedly gains 100% care of the child for a specific period
    (one-off block of 100% care)
-   determine a care percentage where the care percentage is worked out
    other than on the basis of the number of nights a child is in the
    care of a person during a care period (hours in care)

APS 4 or above

An APS 4 or above is authorised to:

-   make any of the decisions authorised at the APS 3 level
-   determine a care percentage for a period where a parent unexpectedly
    gains 100% care of the child for a specific period (one-off block of
    100% care)
-   make a decision that the care that is actually occurring for a child
    does not comply with an existing care arrangement that is in force
    for that child and the person who has reduced care of the child has
    taken reasonable action to ensure that the care arrangement is
    complied with (s51)
-   revoke an existing care determination where a person was previously
    determined under s50 to have at least regular care of a child and,
    despite the child being made available, the person has had no care
    or a pattern of care that is less than regular care (s54G)

Note: most revocation decisions where care falls below regular care will
actually be made under section s54F.

except where:

-   the care that is actually occurring for a child does not comply with
    an existing care arrangement that is in force for that child, and
    the parent who has reduced care of the child is seeking a new care
    arrangement that provides more care than the person is actually
    having but less than the care provided by the existing care
    arrangement, and special circumstances exist (s52)
-   determine a care percentage where the care percentage is worked out
    other than on the basis of the number of nights a child is in the
    care of a person during a care period (daytime care)

APS 5 or above

An APS 5 or above is authorised to:

-   make any of the decisions authorised at the APS 3 and APS 4 levels
-   make a decision that the care that is actually occurring for a child
    does not comply with an existing care arrangement that is in force
    for that child, and the person who has reduced care of the child is
    seeking a new care arrangement that provides more care than the
    person is actually having but less than the care provided by the
    existing care arrangement and special circumstances exist (s52)
-   determine an interim care period where the care period is between 14
    and 26 weeks (i.e. special circumstances apply) (s54C(4))
-   make a decision that a section 51 or 52 determination can be made
    despite the change of care day occurring more than 14 weeks ago, due
    to special circumstances. (i.e. extend the notification period up to
    26 weeks in special circumstances)
-   determine a care percentage where the care percentage is worked out
    other than on the basis of the number of nights a child is in the
    care of a person during a care period (hours in daytime care)

Note: sections 54F, 54G, and 54H apply only where a new determination of
a responsible person's care percentage has been made under sections 49
and 50. The decision maker must be authorised under sections 49 and 50
to make a new care determination even where the authorisation to revoke
the existing care determination is at a lower level.

An officer at a lower level may still carry out the preliminary steps in
making care decisions with the support of their team leader, as long as
an officer with the appropriate level of authority makes the final
decision.

Support Services, Delegations and Authorisations.
