This document outlines the process for AIC Smart Centre staff to assess
and process EOY reviews for AIC.

Review forms issued

EOY reviews for AIC are tailored to the student's circumstances.

To determine their eligibility for continuing payments, applicants
confirm the student's circumstances for the following year including:

-   isolation conditions
-   education details, and
-   living arrangements

Reviews can be returned:

-   over the phone
-   by post
-   in person
-   by uploading to the applicant's myGov account

Lodgement of EOY reviews

There are 3 groups of EOY reviews:

Group 15:

-   update education (NYR) details only
-   there are no expected changes or supporting documents needed

Group 16:

-   complex (CMX) assessment required due to expected changes
-   supporting documents may be needed or child may be moving from
    primary to secondary

Group 17:

-   where the applicant is no longer entitled to benefits, or
-   parental income may be needed for Additional Boarding Allowance to
    be paid

Failure to return review

31 December

Payments automatically cancel from 1 January if an applicant does not
return the review form by 31 December of the year the review was sent.

Payments can be restored and backdated if the review is received by 1
March in the year after the applicant is reclaiming. Services Australia
cannot accept the review if it is not received by this date, unless
intent to claim provisions are applied.
