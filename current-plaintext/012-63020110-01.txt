This document outlines the guidelines for accepting an authority
prescription for approval where it is determined as being 'too soon'.

Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) 'too soon' rule

‘Too soon’ is defined as a time when another authority prescription for
the same item has previously been approved, and adequate supplies should
still exist.

If the system shows more than two months' supply (filled or unfilled),
it is considered as too soon, except in the case of Dangerous Drugs
(DDs) and certain exceptions specified on the National Drug Reference
Database (NDRD) where more than one month’s supply is considered as too
soon.

Acceptable ‘too soon’ situations

The listed situations are acceptable to approve without Pharmaceutical
Adviser (PA) referral only where:

-   all other approval requirements for the item are met
-   necessary approval and supply history checks are undertaken

Note: ensure you add authority comments to record the reason.

The acceptable situations for ‘too soon’ approval are:

'Once off' lost, stolen or destroyed scripts/medication

Quantity/repeats dispensed (RPQN) is less than approved

Dose adjustment (increase or decrease)

Additional strength (different PBS item code) of the same medication is
required

Incorrect dose/quantity/repeats keyed into system

Discharge prescription from PBS reformed public hospitals (up to one
month)

Unable to access previous scripts due to moving to/from residential care
or private hospitals

Previous authority not completely dispensed has expired due to
state/territory legislation:

-   Travelling (approve for duration of travel only). Note: opioid rules
    still apply
-   Patient has changed pharmacy and requirement for previous pharmacy
    to retain repeats
-   Expired prescription

Specialist scripts (the patient may only see the specialist infrequently
due to accessibility)

-   Except for opioids, stimulants and alprazolam

Section 49 (previously Regulation 24)

-   Except for opioids, stimulants

Note: any situations outside these acceptable situations must be
referred to the Pharmaceutical Adviser for a decision. For example,
split family.
