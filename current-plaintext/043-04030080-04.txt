Commonwealth Department of Social Services (DSS) advice on relinquishing
control of a trust/company and associated partnership

In the past it has been said that a person must resign from all related
businesses when they relinquish control of a trust or company. This is
particularly relevant for farmers. However, this can be a problem for
those farmers who are awaiting final payments for the likes of cereal
crops. DSS have now agreed that those people may stay in their
partnerships under the following conditions only:

-   The partnership has otherwise ceased to trade
-   The partnership is wound up when the final payments are made and
    those income tax returns provided

It would only be accepted that the partnership had ceased to trade if it
has been demonstrated that another partnership has taken over the assets
and is running the enterprise.
