This document outlines information on assessing Employment Services
Assessment (ESAt)/Job Capacity Assessment (JCA) recommendations relating
to a job seeker's capacity for work, participation and referrals for
assistance.

Referral recommendations

ESAt/JCA reports make recommendations for referral to suitable
employment services and other interventions such as:

-   Workforce Australia
-   Community Development Program (CDP)
-   Disability Employment Services (DES)

Services Australia facilitates referrals to suitable programmes as
recommended in the ESAt/JCA report.

If a new referral is recommended, the agency may be required to:

-   liaise with the customer's current provider to arrange an exit from
    the current program
-   code a new referral, and
-   arrange for the customer to sign a Job Plan, unless the plan is
    negotiated by the Employment Services Provider

When an ESAt/JCA report recommends a referral to DES but currently the
customer's temporary reduced work capacity (TRWC) is 0-7 hours per week,
therefore the referral would be deferred until after the expiry of this
period. See Deferred referral to Employment Services Providers.

Submitted ESAt/JCA reports

Service Officers review the submitted reports. They then makes the
decision to either accept or return the report. Information is
automatically populated into relevant fields on the system once the
report is accepted.

Once an ESAt/JCA report has been submitted and accepted, the Service
Officer uses the report to:

-   make an informed decision regarding partial capacity to work (PCW)
    or temporary reduced work capacity (TRWC), including temporary
    exemption from their mutual obligation requirements and the number
    of hours these customers are able to work, as identified in the
    report
-   negotiate suitable activities in a Job Plan if the job seeker is not
    exempt and if the job seeker has not been referred to an Employment
    Services Provider. Note: this does not occur where a job seeker has
    been referred to an Employment Services Provider who can update Job
    Plans as part of engaging the job seeker in voluntary activities
    that address barriers to participation and moving the job seeker
    along pathways to independence
-   make decisions regarding eligibility for income support payments

Queries about the ESAt/JCA report

The Service Officer may contact the Assessor to clarify any aspects of
the reports to clarify any inconsistencies. For example, if the referral
recommendation is for a program that the customer is ineligible for the
Service Officer may invite the Assessor to review their recommendation.
If appropriate, the Assessor can review their recommendation and make a
new referral while the report is still 'submitted'.
