Pre 1 July 2012 reconnection failure penalties

Prior to 1 July 2012, a calendar day calculation was used to calculate
reconnection failure penalties which generally resulted in a daily
penalty equal to one fourteenth of a Community Development Program (CDP)
participant's fortnightly payment.

Note: penalties for reconnection failure periods that commenced before 1
July 2012 are assessed under the old 'calendar day' rules, even if
assessed or reviewed after 1 July 2012.

Where a reconnection failure in the same failure sequence occurred after
1 July 2012, but within a pre-1 July 2012 reconnection failure period,
the penalty is calculated under the old 'calendar day' rules. However,
if earlier reconnection failures in the same failure sequence are
revoked so that the reconnection failure period start date is after 1
July 2012, the penalty will be recalculated using the 'business day'
calculation.
