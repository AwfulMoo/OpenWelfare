This document outlines how to assess and code a transfer to Austudy or
Youth Allowance (YA) student from another income support payment.

Requirement for a claim

A claim must be lodged for Youth Allowance or Austudy if the customer
wants to transfer to these payments.

Transfer date

The transfer date for a Youth Allowance (YA) or Austudy claim depends on
the payment the customer is transferring from. It is usually the date
the customer loses eligibility for their current or most recent income
support payment, if they satisfy the student activity test for YA or
Austudy on this day. See:

-   Calculating the start day for a transferee
-   Satisfying the activity test for Youth Allowance (YA) by undertaking
    full-time study
-   Activity Test for Austudy

Sometimes, a customer may qualify for YA or Austudy as a student and
another income support payment at the same time.

Pensioner Education Supplement

In some cases, customers receiving qualifying payments for Pensioner
Education Supplement (PES) may apply for YAL or Austudy by mistake,
instead of Pensioner Education Supplement. It may be more beneficial to
remain on the existing payment. See Identifying the most beneficial
payment for students or Australian Apprentices.

Payment delivery day

When a transfer without a break from another payment to YAL or Austudy
occurs, the same fortnight end-date is maintained, but the day the
payment is received may change.

Concession entitlements

Eligible customers may receive payments or concession cards from the
date they submit a complete claim, unless they are identified as
vulnerable. See Intent to claim and vulnerable customers.

YA and Austudy customers are automatically entitled to a Health Care
Card (HCC). When transferring from a current payment with a HCC, the
system automatically determines which concession card is the most
beneficial to the customer.

If a customer currently holds a Low Income Health Care Card (LIC) or
another type of concession card, the customer can continue to use the
card until the expiry date or until they receive a HCC.

Customers transferring from YA (job seeker) keep their current HCC and
receive a new card when it expires.

COVID-19 impacts for customers transferring to a student payment from a payment with mutual obligations

During different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, mutual obligations
were suspended for some customers.

Customers completing study and getting a mutual obligation payment such
as JobSeeker Payment may not have study included in a Job Plan during
these times. To identify if a JobSeeker Payment customer has reduced or
suspended mutual obligation requirements, see Altered processes and
mutual obligation requirements for job seekers due to coronavirus
(COVID-19) response.

site and forms.
