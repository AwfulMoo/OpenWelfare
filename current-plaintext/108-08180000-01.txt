This document outlines information for Service Officers when making a
manual rate of payment to a customer.

Recording a manual payment

A manual rate of payment is occasionally input into a customer's record.

This can be due to (but not restricted to):

-   one off payments where the customer is not the recipient of any
    allowance or benefit
-   system deficiencies or errors

There are 3 ways of manual coding (on the NSS system, ABSTUDY system and
on other systems) which use different screens to make manual adjustments
to a customer's rate of payment.
