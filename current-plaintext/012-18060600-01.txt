This document outlines information about eligibility and registration
requirements for social workers.

Social workers

Social workers have a dual focus on both assisting with and improving
human wellbeing and identifying and addressing any external issues that
may impact on or may create inequality, injustice and discrimination.

Common issues addressed by social workers include:

-   mental health and physical issues
-   gambling and substance abuse
-   poverty
-   unemployment and homelessness
-   family violence
-   trauma
-   offending behaviour

For Medicare purposes, social workers are categorised into 3 types
according to qualifications and credentialing. These types determine
which Medicare services they can provide:

-   Accredited Mental Health Social Workers (AMHSW) qualified to provide
    focussed psychological strategies (FPS) services under Medicare only
-   An AMHSW qualified to provide both FPS and non-directive pregnancy
    support counselling (PSC) services under Medicare only
-   Accredited Social Workers (ASW) qualified to provide PSC services
    under Medicare only

Disputes about removing a registration

Direct any disputes about registration to the Australian Association of
Social Workers (AASW). The Resources page has the contact details.

Focussed psychological strategies (FPS)

Accredited Mental Health Social Workers (AMHSWs) have advanced training
that qualifies them to use a range of focussed psychological strategies
including:

-   cognitive behavioural therapy
-   relaxation strategies
-   skills training (including parenting skills)
-   problem solving
-   anger management
-   stress management
-   social skills

See Focussed psychological strategies (FPS) - Allied Health

Non-directive pregnancy support counselling (PSC)

This is a form of counselling based on the idea that some individuals
can resolve their own problems without being provided with a solution by
the counsellor.

The service involves the counsellor undertaking a safe, confidential
process that helps the patient explore concerns they have about a
pregnancy.

Additional information about the PSC initiative is available on the
Department of Health and Aged Care’s website. See the Resources page for
a link, as well as a fact sheet about the program.

Both Accredited Mental Health Social Workers (AMHSW) and Accredited
Social Workers (ASW) can undertake PSC training through either:

-   Australian Psychological Society (APS), or
-   Australian College of Mental Health Nurses (ACMHN)

A certificate is issued upon completion of the course, and provides
access to Medicare benefits specific to this type of counselling.

Enquiry escalation

The Provider Registration enquiry line and email inbox, managed by
Medicare Provider Services (MPS), are used as the front door for all
enquiries relating to the processing of provider registrations.

Enquiries to this area are responded to by a Service Officer trained in
all aspects of provider registration. These Service Officers escalate
complex enquiries to a Programme Support Officer (PSO) who will liaise
with the Provider Eligibility team in National Office for assistance if
required.

The Resources page contains a quick reference guide, useful contact
information and links to external websites.
