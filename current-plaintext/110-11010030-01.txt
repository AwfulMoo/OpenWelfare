For Intelligence and Investigations Branch only.

This document outlines how the Critical Case Report (CCR) is a tool that
enables the Intelligence and Investigations Branch executive to be
briefed on sensitive investigations that represent a greater risk to the
organisation. It ensures the executive has a greater awareness of cases
that have, or may have, media or ministerial interest.

Criteria to be met

A CCR is required when an analyst or investigator identifies a case that
meets one or more of the critical case report criteria.

If the need for a CCR is identified:

-   by tactical intelligence staff, it should be prepared following the
    completion of the intelligence product, and before the selection is
    released for intervention as an evaluation or investigation
-   by the investigator before starting the administrative or criminal
    investigation, it should be prepared at the same time as the
    administrative or criminal Investigation Plan
-   by the investigator during the administrative or criminal
    investigation it should be prepared before any further enquiries are
    conducted. Once the CCR is completed, enquiries can continue unless
    there is a specific reason or directive to suspend enquiries

Tactical intelligence submitted CCR

If a CCR has been submitted by tactical intelligence, there is no need
for the investigator to submit a CCR.

If the case has been referred to the Commonwealth Director of Public
Prosecutions, a CCR is not required as a Prosecution Case Summary would
be prepared instead.

The CCR is to be stored on the intelligence and/or investigation case
management systems.

The Resources page contains contact details for Intelligence and
Investigations Branch.
