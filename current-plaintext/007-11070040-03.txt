|                                   | When this happens, a work item is |

|                                   |     because one item is dependent |
|                                   |     on the other, for example,    |

|                                   | screen:                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   SEP - separated. SEP is used  |
|                                   |     when a customer advises they  |
|                                   |     separated from their partner  |
|                                   |     after 30 June 2001            |
|                                   | -   DEA - deceased. DEA is used   |
|                                   |     when their partner, as per    |
|                                   |     the ATO claim, has died       |
|                                   | -   NLS - no longer separated.    |
|                                   |     NLS is used where the         |
|                                   |     customer had an ATO partner   |
|                                   |     as at 30 June 2001, and       |
|                                   |     advised after 1 July 2001     |
|                                   |     that they have separated. The |
|                                   |     customer then subsequently    |
|                                   |     advises that they have        |
|                                   |     reconciled, therefore NLS is  |
|                                   |     to be coded on the ATONLPE    |
|                                   |     screen                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the ATONLPE screen has already |
|                                   | been updated:                     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   go to the ATOCLM screen       |
|                                   | -   select the relevant financial |
|                                   |     year line                     |
|                                   | -   code the source and date of   |
|                                   |     receipt fields                |
|                                   | -   the ATOTS screen will display |
|                                   | -   select the ATONLPE screen     |
|                                   | -   code the appropriate reason   |
|                                   |     (SEP, DEA or NLS)             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Some customers may have an        |
|                                   | extension to lodge their Income   |
|                                   | Tax Return with the ATO. Advise   |
|                                   | these customers that if they do   |
|                                   | not lodge their Income Tax Return |
|                                   | with the ATO by the 30 June they  |
|                                   | will not receive a top-up (if     |
|                                   | applicable) and they will receive |
|                                   | a non-lodger debt for FTB.        |
