Online Claims

The ECLIPSE Online Claiming facility allows providers of hospital
services to send messages that contain claims for payment to private
health Funds.

It passes signed encrypted messages in XML format via the Internet
between the providers, the ECLIPSE workflow engine (the Hub) and the
Private Health Funds.

The IHC DVA Online Hospital claiming system utilizes the ECLIPSE
framework. Claims can be submitted 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

The Claim ID is generated by the ECLIPSE Hub and transmitted back to the
provider once the claim has been successfully received by the mainframe.
In order to retrieve the claim ID, the client must retrieve the status
report.

The claims submitted by a Hospital provider to DVA through the ECLIPSE
system are transmitted in segments. There are 19 types of segments
permitted in the IHC. Each segment is distinguished by a three letter
abbreviated segment title.

Online Hospital claims are to be accessed using the State Online Source
Office Code.

The state online source office codes to be used to request claims from
the other States e.g. CVZY, EVZY, KVZY, IVZY, GVZY.

The only field that cannot be edited for online hospital claims
processing is the charge. All other fields may be altered to effect
processing of the claim.

Additional lines cannot be inserted into online claims. All lines
(excluding Cert lines) cannot be deleted.

No claims submitted online should be paid manually.
