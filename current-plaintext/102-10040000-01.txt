This document outlines information on restoring a cancelled or suspended
payment when a customer's qualification for payment has been
re-established.

Reasons for restoring a payment

The need to restore a payment usually occurs as a result of:

-   changes in the customer's circumstances
-   a review of a Services Australia decision
-   changes to specified events that have temporarily made them
    ineligible for payment
-   the customer providing more information about their circumstances
-   the customer providing their or their partner's Tax File Number
    (TFN)

Note:

Payments which were incorrectly cancelled may be restored once the error
has been corrected.

If a customer has unused working credits or Income Bank, they may be
eligible to restore these credits within 12 months.

For customers who have been released from prison, before restoring a
customer's payment the Service Officer must re-establish ongoing
eligibility and confirm the date the customer was released from prison
with the appropriate state authority. Contacts for confirming release
are included in the Resources page in Confirming prison admission and
release dates.

Restoration of a suspended payment

Where restoration occurs on a suspended payment within 13 weeks of the
date the customer was notified of the suspension, any add on payments
the customer was receiving will be restored where the customer has
maintained eligibility. For example, a customer was receiving Rent
Assistance (RA) prior to the suspension and on restoration their
accommodation circumstances have not changed.

A customer on weekly payments who has their income support payment
suspended or cancelled and then subsequently restored (to date paid plus
one), will automatically resume on a weekly payment regime. Note: this
does not apply when a Disability Support Payment (DSP) customer has had
their payment suspended due to returning to work, who will revert to a
payment frequency of fortnightly.

Payment instructions

If the customer had any payment instructions such as Centrepay and Tax
deductions, the instruction will remain current on the customer's record
until the instruction is terminated or the payment is cancelled. If the
payment has been suspended and then restored:

-   Centrepay instruction will be reinstated from the next available
    payment
-   Tax Deduction instructions will be reinstated with any arrears
    payment, and will continue until a request is received to have them
    ceased
