This document outlines details of PBS-subsidised biological agents for

Treatment specifics

A break in treatment cycles is measured:

-   from the date of last approval for PBS-subsidised biological
    medicine treatment in the most recent cycle
-   to the date of the first application for initial treatment with a
    biological medicine under the new treatment cycle

There is no limit to the number of treatment cycles.

See Treatment breaks and failures for full details.

Acute severe ulcerative colitis in hospital

-   Infliximab i.v. can be prescribed for patients suffering from an
    acute severe episode as a 3 dose course in hospital (first dose is
    provided by the hospital)
-   This is an Authority Required (Streamlined) listing for public and
    private hospital patients
-   The requirements for this authority are not the same as for the
    moderate to severe program

Prescribers:

-   may want their patients to continue treatment under the moderate to
    severe restriction as there is no continuing available for acute
    severe ulcerative colitis
-   can complete an initial application form for patients who have
    received PBS-subsidised acute severe treatment in the last 4 months
    (providing they can demonstrate that the patient is currently
    responding to treatment)

Patient baselines

When a patient qualifies for treatment they will have a measured and
defined level of disease activity:

patients qualify on either a Mayo or partial Mayo score as adults, or

Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) if they are
paediatric patients

this score:

-   becomes the patient’s baseline
-   is used to demonstrate an initial response to treatment that must be
    sustained to qualify for continuing treatment
