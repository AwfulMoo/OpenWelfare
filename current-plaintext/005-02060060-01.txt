This document outlines information about settlement issues, challenges
and barriers that refugees, humanitarian entrants and protection visa
holders may face when arriving in Australia.

Settling in Australia

Settlement refers to the period of adjustment that occurs following a
migrant or refugee's arrival in a new country, as they become
established and independent in their new society.

Migrants and refugees are not a homogenous group. The issues and
challenges faced by people settling in Australia will vary greatly
depending on whether they are a migrant, a refugee or humanitarian
entrant, settling in rural or metropolitan areas, or young or aged.

The Resources page contains a table that outlines the differences
between longer established and new and emerging communities.
