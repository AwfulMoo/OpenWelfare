This document outlines ECS Medical Indemnity (MI) information about
eligibility, applications and payments.

Purpose of ECS

The ECS is a fully funded scheme of the Australian Government to cover
practitioners for 100% of the cost of claims that exceed the limit of
their MI contracts of insurance, providing the contract limit satisfies
the threshold, so that practitioners are not personally liable for these
claims. It covers incidents that are notified on or after 1 January
2003.

A claim can be for a single incident or for a series of related
incidents and can be made up of both paid and unpaid liabilities under
the claim.

The ECS is detailed in Part 2 Division 2A and section 37A of the Medical
Indemnity Act 2002 (the Act).

Difference to the High Cost Claim Indemnity Scheme (HCCS)

The main differences between ECS and HCCS are that:

-   the ECS allows for payments directly to practitioners, whereas the
    HCCS assists Medical Indemnity Insurers (MII) and Medical Defence
    Organisations (MDO) with the cost of claims they manage
-   for ECS there are requirements for the defence of the claim to be
    conducted prudently and for a legal practitioner to assess the
    reasonableness of a settlement amount
