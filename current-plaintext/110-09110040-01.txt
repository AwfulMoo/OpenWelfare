This document outlines the identification and processing of reports of
suspected fraud or corruption using the Report Suspected Fraud and
Corruption system.

Management of reports of suspected fraud and corruption

Staff or members of the public report an allegation and/or information
of a person/organisation they believe to be:

-   dishonestly obtaining a benefit, or
-   causing a loss by deception or other means

Note: all reports of suspected fraud are sent to Tip-off Operations for
analysis.

Role of Tip-off Operations

Tip-off Operations completes an initial assessment and triage of
reported fraud allegations, then refers to:

-   Compliance Risk Branch
-   Intelligence and Investigations Branch, and/or
-   external agencies, for example the Australian Taxation Office (ATO)

The Resources page contains links to the Report Suspected Fraud and
Corruption system, Report a Suspected Fraud application (formerly known
as TORS) and Privacy and Secrecy intranet page. It also has an A to Z
table of the main risk categories.
