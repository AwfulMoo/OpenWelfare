This document outlines how a decision is made during a fraud
investigation whether or not to refer the case to the Commonwealth
Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP) for prosecution consideration.
Procedures cover the consideration for referral, preparation of a brief
of evidence, and subsequent action following acceptance or rejection of
the referral by the CDPP.

Fraud Control Policy

The prosecution of individual cases of fraud against the Australian
Government is an integral part of the Commonwealth Fraud Control Policy.
The prosecution of serious offences is important in the deterrence of
future instances of fraud and to educating the public generally about
the seriousness of fraud.

Intelligence and Investigations Branch

The Intelligence and Investigations Branch is responsible for the
investigation of possible criminal offences relating to Centrelink,
Child Support and Medicare programs.

Under the Prosecution Policy of the Commonwealth, there is a two-stage
test that must be satisfied for the CDPP to prosecute a case:

-   there must be sufficient evidence to prosecute the case, and
-   it must be evident from the facts of the case, and all the
    surrounding circumstances, that the prosecution would be in the
    public interest
