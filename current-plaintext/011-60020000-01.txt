This document outlines how to make an enquiry on a Pharmaceutical
Benefits Scheme (PBS) patient refund claim.

Patient refund enquiries in the PBS Patient Refund system

Within the PBS Patient Refund system, you can make enquiries relating to
all patient refund claims.

You can enter specific search criteria to perform the following
searches:

-   list all claims that satisfy the nominated search criteria
-   display details of the receipts within the claim
-   display details of an individual receipt
-   display a processing status history for a claim
-   identify the bank account details that a payment was made to

Note: when a patient refund claim is processed using both a Medicare
number and an entitlement identification (ID), the claim is stored
against the entitlement ID which is considered as the patient's highest
level of entitlement. In this instance, an enquiry on this claim can
only be performed using the entitlement ID and not the Medicare number
which was used to process the claim.

Statements are not produced for PBS patient refunds. Payments are made
directly into the nominated bank account with a reference number
identifying the payment as a PBS patient refund. Should the claimant
contact Services Australia seeking a receipt or more detailed
information, Service Officers can perform a claim enquiry and provide a
copy of the PBS Patient Refund Enquiry Claim List Screen (RPRJ) screen
to the claimant.
