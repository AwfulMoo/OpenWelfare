This document outlines the process of assessing and coding the Private
Trust details from the MOD PT.

Purpose of MOD PT

A MOD PT is used where a customer has indicated they are or were within
the last 5 years prior to claiming income support or Low Income Health
Care Card (LIC), involved in a private trust. The information collected
in conjunction with the MOD PT enables Services Australia to assess
income and assets from a private trust.

Complex Assessment Officer (CAO) role

Customers involved in a private trust, including a Special Disability
Trust, or private company must have their involvement assessed and coded
by a Complex Assessment Officer (CAO). Any updates to a private trust or
private company must be forwarded to the CAO.

CAOs create an entity record for each private trust and company. They
record all the trust and company financial details and the attribution
decision on this record. The record is linked to customer's record with
the income and asset information flows through to them to ensure they
receive the correct entitlement.
