This document outlines how Compensation Recovery Teams make adjustments
when recovery involves supplementary compensation affected payments
(CAP).

Supplementary payments included in compensation recovery charges

Supplementary payments which are included in CAP rate calculators
recovered as part of the compensation charge. For example:

-   Rent Assistance
-   Fortnightly Pharmaceutical Allowance
-   Remote Area Allowance

The COVID-19 Supplement is a recoverable payment:

-   when the primary payment it is paid with is a compensation affected
    payment (CAP), COVID-19 Supplement can be recovered as part of the
    compensation charge

Economic Supplement payments are:

-   not a compensation affected payment (CAP), and
-   not included or recovered as part of the charge

Include add-on supplementary payments in compensation recovery charges
when compensation reduces the underlying compensation affected payment
(CAP) to nil
