This document outlines how to access and use the Customer First training
environment.

Description

The Customer First training environment is an online training workspace
that allows staff to improve their skills in the workplace by letting
them explore consequences through trial and error in a safe environment.

It includes practice versions of tools commonly used by customer service
staff, but excludes some scripts and transactions that require:

-   links to external organisations and websites
-   online claims and workflows
-   accessing scanned images and printing
-   Front of House
-   Workload Management (WLM)

Records and customer circumstances in the Customer First training
environment may appear real. The data does not contain any information
related to Services Australia customers. New records created by staff in
the training environment are over-written about every 3 months to
refresh the data in the training environment. When this occurs, staff
may lose records they have added themselves.

Access

Staff in the Customer Service Delivery Group with access to Customer
First, Process Direct or Work Optimiser have automatic access to the
Customer First training environment.:

Other staff will need to request TRAINING-CUSTOMER FIRST CSO access in
ESSentials.

The Resources page contains a link to mySupport for help with problems
accessing the Customer First Training Environment application. It also
has a list of 'magic numbers' that can be used to create and code
transactions the training environment will accept.
