|                                   | Optical surveillance evidence may |
|                                   | assist in confirming the true     |
|                                   | identity of an individual.        |

|                                   | Identity fraud is where a         |

|                                   | multiple payments by utilising    |

|                                   | manipulated identities. The       |
|                                   | customer may also utilise false   |
|                                   | identities to conceal employment  |

|                                   | Optical surveillance can provide  |
|                                   | evidence in relation to the       |
|                                   | criteria outlined in section 4 of |
|                                   | the Social Security Act 1991 and  |
|                                   | go towards disproving assertions  |
|                                   | previously made by the customer.  |

|                                   | will usually be to establish the  |

|                                   | the customer. The surveillance    |
|                                   | should usually look to obtain a   |
|                                   | range of activities of the        |
|                                   | alleged partner that would assist |
|                                   | proving or disproving the         |
|                                   | undeclared MOC relationship.      |

|                                   | -   engaging in activities that   |

|                                   | disclosed medical condition then  |

|                                   | will be required to enable a Job  |
|                                   | Capacity Assessor to determine an |
|                                   | impairment rating and capacity to |
|                                   | work rating. This assessment will |
|                                   | enable a determination in         |
