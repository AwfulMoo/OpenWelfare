This document outlines the types of non-compliance events that are
managed under the Targeted Compliance Framework and Job Seeker
Compliance Model.

Background

Participation payments are intended to support those who are actively
seeking and prepared to move into suitable paid work as this becomes
available.

For job seekers claiming a participation payment there is an expectation
that a customer has not deliberately contributed to their inability to
support themselves. While for those receiving a participation payment
this is conditional on the job seeker demonstrating a genuine
willingness to actively seek and move into suitable paid work.

Both the Targeted Compliance Framework and the Job Seeker Compliance
Model include policy provisions that underpin these expectations. In
other words, they prevent customers from immediately accessing
participation payments following voluntary unemployment or dismissal due
to misconduct. Equally both job seeker compliance systems also provide
strong deterrents to ensure those receiving a participation payment are
accountable for their willingness to remain in, and demonstrate
appropriate work like behaviours while engaged in suitable work.

Although ParentsNext participants are in receipt of a Participation
Payment they are not required to seek or accept paid work. The intention
of the ParentsNext programme is to assist parents with children under 6
to plan and prepare for future study or work.

Types of non-compliance events

A non-compliance event occurs where a job seeker who is claiming or
receiving a participation payment fails to comply with a compulsory
requirement.

Non-compliance events can include:

-   voluntarily leaving suitable work without a valid reason (does not
    apply to ParentsNext participants)
-   being dismissed from suitable work due to misconduct (does not apply
    to ParentsNext participants)
-   refusing or failing to accept an offer of suitable work (does not
    apply to ParentsNext participants)
-   failing to enter into a Job Plan/Participation Plan when notified of
    a requirement to do so
-   failing to attend a job interview or intentionally acting in a
    manner that could result in an offer of employment not being made
-   failing to act on a job opportunity when requested to do so by a
    provider
-   failing to undertake and provide evidence of adequate job search
    efforts
-   failing to meet monthly points target (applies to job seekers in the
    trial New Employment Services Model (NESM) regions and does not
    apply to ParentsNext participants)
-   failing to attend, or be punctual for, an appointment the job seeker
    is required to attend
-   failing to attend, or be punctual for, a compulsory activity in a
    Job/Participation Plan
-   acting in an inappropriate manner during a compulsory appointment or
    activity
-   failing to meet other compulsory requirements included in a current
    Job/Participation Plan

For declared programme participants, such as Community Development
Program (CDP) job seekers a compliance event has also occurred where the
CDP job seeker is persistently non-compliant.

The way that a non-compliance event is managed, will depend on the job
seeker compliance system that applies to the job seeker or CDP job
seeker at the time the compliance event occurred.
