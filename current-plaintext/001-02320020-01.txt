This document outlines what a Service Officer does when an Employment
Services Assessment (ESAt) report is submitted by the Assessor.

Submitted reports

ESAt reports are created in the Department of Employment and Workplace
Relations system and are submitted to Services Australia electronically
via a link for validation and acceptance. Information in the ESAt report
(depending on the referral reason) is used to determine eligibility for
income support and appropriate mutual obligation requirements for job
seekers receiving a payment.

The ESAt report (depending on the referral reason) will contain the
Assessor's recommendations about a job seeker's work capacity,
appropriate interventions, recommended referrals to employment
assistance programs, risks of non-compliance ratings and circumstances
impacting compliance if required.

Where the report:

-   does pass validation, the Services Australia system identifies if
    ESAt follow up actions are required. Where no other actions are
    required, the report will automatically complete and populate the
    relevant information on the customer's record
-   does not pass validation, the report is flagged for manual checking.
    The report is checked and any issues or disagreements with the
    recommendations made by the Assessor are resolved

An automatic activity is generated if the report is not submitted by the
assessor within 14 days of the ESAt appointment. This acts as a prompt
to follow up with the Assessor to discuss any possible delay, if the
reasons for the delay are not already evident from available information
on the job seeker's record.

Accepted reports (status remains submitted)

Once an ESAt report has been accepted by Services Australia, it will be
automatically attached to the customer's Electronic Medical Information
File Envelope (e-MIFE).

A Display on Access (DOA) DOC titled ESAt Outcome will display on the
Document List (DL) screen.

The Medical condition (MC) and Work capacity (WC) screens will be coded
as part of the acceptance with the information from the ESAt report
scanned to Document Tools.

The status of the ESAt in the Employment Services or Job Capacity
Assessment referral information workflow will remain as submitted until
the finalisation process runs. The status of the report will not display
as accepted in this workflow.

Manually checking the report

The manual check requires the Service Officer to check the report to
ensure it is complete, consistent and correct, considering the
following:

-   There is sufficient information for participation in mutual
    obligation requirements or to determine appropriate assistance
-   The verified medical conditions are all listed as detailed on the
    medical evidence and the assessment of a condition as Temporary or
    Permanent
-   The report includes recommended referral to employment assistance
    services, or a valid reason why no referrals are recommended
-   The Assessor has actioned recommended referrals where appropriate,
    or stated a valid reason why the referral is not actioned
-   Inappropriate or prejudicial information is not included in the
    report
-   There are no references to payment type recommendations

ESAt reports for customers aged under 22 need to be manually accepted:

-   to assess eligibility for independence due to Partial Capacity to
    Work
-   to assess eligibility for Youth Disability Supplement (YDS)
-   for the work capacity to be applied to the job seeker's record
-   for medical conditions to be recorded on the claimant's record
-   to pay Pharmaceutical Allowance (PhA)
-   before another ESAt can be booked

Note: if the ESAt report is for a customer who meets medical and other
eligibility requirements for Disability Support Pension (DSP) (upgraded
ESAt) and currently does not have a claim for DSP, the report will also
need to be manually accepted and the person invited to claim DSP.

Submitted ESAt reports that have not been actioned (accepted)

Where an ESAt report has not been accepted within 14 days (remains as
submitted), and:

-   an NSS/JCA activity is outstanding on the Activity List (AL) screen,
    escalate via email to the Workload Management team for the work to
    be allocated and processed
-   there is no NSS/JCA activity outstanding on the AL screen, escalate
    to Level 2 Disability Helpdesk via their SharePoint site. See
    Resources for a link to the Level 2 Disability Helpdesk

Returning the report after it has been accepted

If the Service Officer initially accepts an ESAt report but later
decides that it should not have been accepted due to an error and the
report status is still 'submitted', return the report to the Assessor
for amendment. This action should only be done if the change to
Impairment Ratings or work capacity is likely to have an impact on their
mutual obligation or Participation requirements or payment eligibility.

If the Service Officer initially accepts a report but later decides that
it should not have been accepted due to an error, the report status is
'finalised' and it may affect determinations of hours of work capacity
and referral to a program of support, the job seeker will need to be
re-referred for an ESAt, possibly as a file assessment.

The Resources page contains an example of when an Employment Service
Assessment (ESAt) is upgraded, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), the
ESAt Report Acceptance Guide and contact details for Assessment
Services. It also contains a link to a new Level 2 Helpdesk enquiry
form.
