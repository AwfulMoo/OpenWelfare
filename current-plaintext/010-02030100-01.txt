-   travel away from their normal place of residence to attend an
    activity to determine their suitability for the Indigenous Youth
    Mobility Programme (IYMP), or
-   attend a selection test or interview to determine acceptance into an
    approved tertiary course where a test/interview is a normal
    requirement for admission to the course

    requirement prior to being admitted or accepted

A student must also:

test/interview under Away from Base assistance.
