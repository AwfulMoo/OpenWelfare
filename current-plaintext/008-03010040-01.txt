This document outlines how to assess a customer’s eligibility to
transfer to DSP (Blind).

Transfer to DSP (Blind)

Customers who are not currently paid DSP must claim DSP (Blind) on the
basis of permanent blindness. They will be subject to normal eligibility
criteria, but without a continuing inability to work (CITW) requirement.

Customers currently paid DSP can be transferred to DSP (Blind) without
submitting a claim form when they meet the Social Security definition of
permanent blindness. The customer should provide a report from their
treating ophthalmologist so an assessment can be made. The Request for
Ophthalmologist/Optometrist Report (SA013) form is preferred, but any
report which provides the information requested by the SA013 is
acceptable.

Customers transferring to DSP (Blind) who have an existing Identity
Confirmation Indicator (ICI) of 'Confirmed' should not be asked to
provide identity documents again. If the ICI is 'Not Confirmed', the
customer may be required to provide further documents to confirm their
identity.

Customers in receipt of DSP (Blind) can choose to receive their letters
from Centrelink in an alternative format.

Only APS4 and above should make a determination on permanent blindness.

The Resources page contains a link to the SA013 form.
