Do not undertake any MALEP assessments. The Department of Social
Services (DSS) have paused all Moving to an Area of Lower Employment
Prospects (MALEP) assessments.

This document outlines customer payments that can continue when an
adverse decision is under review. This is called Payment Pending Review
(PPR).

MALEP exclusion period

PPR should be considered and offered to the customer:

-   as part of an application for a review of a decision by an
    Authorised Review Officer (ARO) or the Administrative Appeals
    Tribunal (AAT) (first review)
-   for any cases where customers have incurred a Moving to an Area of
    Lower Employment Prospects (MALEP) exclusion period

This exclusion period results in a non-payment period of 26 weeks. In
these cases, a customer can request PPR at any time in which they are
serving the penalty (that is, 26 weeks) and have applied for a review of
the decision by an ARO or AAT (first review).

A customer's payment may be restored pending the review process in
certain circumstances. If the outcome of the review is unsuccessful, the
net non-payment period must be actioned immediately and reapplied from
the start of the customer's next entitlement period. The payments
received between the original decision and the reconfirmation of the
decision upon review cannot be recovered as a debt.
