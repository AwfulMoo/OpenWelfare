| Item                              | Example                           |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | A and B have a limited child      |
|                                   | support agreement with an         |
|                                   | unemployment clause. The annual   |
|                                   | rate of child support payable     |
|                                   | under the agreement by A to B     |
|                                   | will reduce in the event that A   |
|                                   | becomes unemployed.               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A becomes unemployment, the       |
|                                   | clause is activated. The new      |
|                                   | agreement rate has reduced by     |
|                                   | more than 15% from the previous   |
|                                   | agreement rate.                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A provisional notional assessment |
|                                   | will be automatically generated.  |
