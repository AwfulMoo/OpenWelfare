Child leaves payee's care

It is not a terminating event when a child leaves a payee's care in a
Stage 1 case (a court order or court-registered agreement). If the case
is collect Child Support must still collect the liability even though
the child has left the payee’s care. However, the payer and payee can
make a joint election for Child Support to suspend collection of the
liability for the child (similar to an optout). A payer or payee can
elect for Child Support to restart collection if the child returns to
the payee’s care.

Some specific terms apply in a Stage 1 change in care:

-   an overall non-care period is any period in which the payee is not
    the main provider of the ongoing daily care for a child
-   a non-care non-enforcement period means that both customers have
    elected that Child Support suspend collection in a period when a
    child is not in the payee’s care

Child Support can still collect any arrears owing during a non-care
non-enforcement period – it is only the collection of an ongoing
liability that is suspended.
