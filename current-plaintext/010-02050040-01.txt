This document outlines the purpose of, eligibility for, and costs
covered by Relocation Allowance for ABSTUDY Masters and Doctorate study.

Relocation Allowance

Relocation Allowance is for full-time students who need to move to
another town or city to take up Masters or Doctorate studies. This
allowance is paid as an alternative to fares allowance. Once relocated,
there is no further travel entitlement to return to the former home
location. See Resources for a link to the Services Australia website for
information and rates for Relocation Allowance.

Eligibility for Relocation Allowance

To be eligible, students must be receiving ABSTUDY Living Allowance,
either at the maximum or at a reduced rate or ABSTUDY Pensioner
Education Supplement (PES) payment for Masters or Doctorate Studies. An
ABSTUDY or PES student who is approved for a concessional study load
will also qualify for Relocation Allowance.

Costs covered by Relocation Allowance

Relocation Allowance pays for removal costs to cover transportation of
belongings through a removalist or hire truck and fares to the study
location for the student, the student's partner and dependent
child(ren).

Relocation Allowance does not cover the cost of establishing a new home.

Relocation Scholarship

An ABSTUDY Masters and Doctorate student may also be eligible for the
Relocation Scholarship (RS). The student must meet the qualification
criteria for the RS. The payment of the Relocation Allowance does not
prevent a student being eligible for the RS

The Resources page contains a link to the Services Australia website for
information on Relocation Allowance.
