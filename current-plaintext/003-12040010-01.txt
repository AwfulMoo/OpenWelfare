For Services Australia social workers only.

If a child is in immediate danger or risk of harm you must act, and a
delegate must call 000.

This document explains the role of the Services Australia social workers
have in assessing the family situation of the children when a non-parent
carer makes an application to Child Support for child support payment
action, and there is no consent for the non-parent carer arrangement.

Child safe framework

Services Australia has a zero tolerance approach to child abuse.

A staff member must act when they see or hear behaviour, which raises
concern about a child or young person’s safety. Follow the agency's Risk
Identification and Reporting model when identifying and responding to
child safety concerns. See Risk identification and management of threats
to the safety or welfare of a child.

Eligibility of non-parent carers

A non-parent carer can apply for an assessment of child support, payable
by the parent(s)/legal guardian(s) of the child, if they have at least
35% shared care of the child.

However, they will not be considered an eligible carer for Child Support
purposes if they are:

-   not a legal guardian of a child and,
-   at least one of the child's parent(s) or legal guardian(s) has said
    that they do not consent to the person caring for the child and,
-   it is not unreasonable for the parent or legal guardian to care for
    the child/ren themselves (Child Support (Assessment) Act section
    7B(2))

To determine if it is unreasonable for a parent or guardian to care for
the child:

-   the Child Support Registrar must be satisfied there has been extreme
    family breakdown, or
-   there is a serious risk to the child's physical or mental wellbeing
    in the home of the parent or legal guardian concerned (Child Support
    (Assessment) Act section 7B(3))

If a parent or legal guardian advises the Registrar that they do not
consent to the applicant providing care for the child:

Services Australia social workers will:

-   Assess the family/care situation further to establish whether the
    applicant satisfies the requirements for an eligible carer
-   Provide a professional recommendation to Child Support on whether
    the child/ren can reasonably live with a parent. Child Support
    Objections procedures apply for any party dissatisfied with the
    decision made by the Child Support Registrar

Referrals for social work assessment

Child Support Agency staff will request a social work assessment:

-   to determine if it is unreasonable for a parent or legal guardian to
    provide care for their child/ren
-   using a single referral point, see Application for assessment -
    non-parent carer

Assessment requests are actioned by social workers undertaking
Unreasonable to Live at Home (UTLAH) assessments for income support
payments.

Social workers will provide a professional recommendation to Child
Support on the ability of the child/ren to reasonably live with a parent
or legal guardian through assessment of:

-   extreme family breakdown of the parent/child relationship, or
-   the presence of a serious risk to the child's physical or mental
    well-being in the home of the parent/legal guardian

The Resources page has links to the Child Support website for
information about child support options for parents and the formula for
calculating child support, the referral form received from Child Support
and the report to be sent back after the social worker assessment has
been completed.
