[This image provides a summary of the process of receiving, assessing
and making a decision on Child Support objections. The objection is
received in writing (or by phone in the case of care objections. The
objection is reviewed to make sure it meets the criteria for a valid
objection and a decision can be made. If the extension is not lodged on
time, staff can request the customer lodge an extension of time
application. If the extension is on time and meets all the criteria, the
objections officer gathers evidence from both parties and third parties
if necessary. This evidence is exchanged between both parties if it is
appropriate to do so. The objections officer then makes a decision and
finalises the objection.] 
