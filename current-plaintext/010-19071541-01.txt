This document outlines how to provide advice on the progress of an
ABSTUDY claim.

Progress of ABSTUDY claims

Customer claim enquires include:

-   confirmation of submitted claim
-   confirmation of acceptance of supporting documentation
-   advice of further information required for claim assessment
-   claim progress
-   cancellation or withdrawal of claim
-   financial hardship
-   a change in their circumstances since the claim was submitted

As ABSTUDY claims are processed in Customer First and Process Direct,
the claiming process between payments and the process for checking the
progress of the claim varies.

The Resources page contains links to the Services Australia website
