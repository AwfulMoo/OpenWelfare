DRA and ex-gratia DRA average weekly income - income cut-off points

Based on the Rate Calculator Determination 2020.

Average weekly income is based on the Average Weekly Ordinary Time
Earnings (AWOTE) for a full-time adult according to the Australian
Bureau of Statistics. This figure is updated in May each year for use
from 1 January of the next year, for the duration of that calendar year:

-   From 1 January 2019 the figure is: $1,586.20 or $3,172.40 per
    fortnight
-   From 1 January 2020 the figure is: $1,633.80 or $3,267.60 per
    fortnight

Note: initial eligibility for DRA or ex-gratia DRA will be subject to
the customer having disaster affected income that is less than the
fortnightly equivalent of the AWOTE.

To annualise the AWOTE, multiple the weekly amount by 52:

-   From 1 January 2019 the annualised figure is: $82,482.40
-   From 1 January 2020 the annualised figure is: $84.957.60
