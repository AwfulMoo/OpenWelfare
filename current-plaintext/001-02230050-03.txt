|                                   | that the job seeker understands   |
|                                   | the potential benefit of          |

|                                   | likely it is that the job seeker  |
|                                   | will be referred to appropriate   |
|                                   | assistance.                       |

|                                   | should not delay the decision     |
|                                   | about a temporary incapacity      |
|                                   | exemption. The Service Officer    |
|                                   | should make the decision based on |
|                                   | whatever existing evidence is     |
|                                   | available to them.                |
