Private court action

Legislative amendments, effective from 1 January 2007 (1 November 2007
for WA Ex-nuptial cases), allow payees to initiate private court action
to enforce the registered child support debt without opting their cases
out of collection by Child Support.

Legislative amendments, effective from 1 July 2018 (except for WA
Ex-nuptial cases) allow payers to initiate private court action to
enforce the collection of overpayments of child support.

If a customer wishes to pursue their own enforcement action, or is not
satisfied with the collection actions of Services Australia, they can
apply directly to a court under section 113A of the Child Support
(Registration and Collection) Act 1988 to commence court enforcement
proceedings in relation to the liability owed to them.

Note: enquiries about customer enforcement from legal representatives or
the courts should be referred to the Child Support Solicitor’s line.

legal professionals’ webpage for the Child Support Solicitor’s line.
