This document outlines how to locate and action a compensation recovery
activity on a customer's record that has been outstanding for 35 days.

Payment of refund

Unrecovered charge (CMM/UNR) activities are produced when a charge has
been outstanding for 35 days. A letter of demand will be sent on day 42
if the charge remains unpaid.

Refund not received

If the liable compensation payer has not sent the refund

-   find out why refund has not been sent, and
-   if the compensation payment has been released or not

Advise the compensation payer further legal action may be considered if
the refund is not paid.

CMM/UNR activities must not be deleted without any action being taken to
recover the charge. When the full amount has been recovered, any
recovery activities will automatically cancel.
