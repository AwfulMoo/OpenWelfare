access employment assistance through Workforce Australia.

Tailored services and programmes for job seekers

Workforce Australia provides tailored services and programmes to help
job seekers in their transition to employment based on their needs. This
could include:

-   help with looking for work, writing a resume and preparing for
    interviews
-   referrals to jobs in their local area
-   training that is suited to the skills that local employers need
-   case management so they are ready to take up and keep a job
-   helping job seekers into work, education, apprenticeships and
    traineeships
-   support to complete Work for the Dole or other eligible tasks and
    activities to provide them with work-like experiences, to help them
    learn new skills and improve their chances of finding a job

All job seekers can access self service terminals in most Services
Australia Service Centres and some Medicare Service Centres, Agents and
Access Points. The terminals have been provided to enable customers to
access self services.

Workforce Australia provides a range of services to job seekers,
according to their circumstances and needs. A job seeker registering for
services may be referred to Workforce Australia Online Employment
Services or a Workforce Australia Employment Service Provider.

Job seekers can be registered as job seekers by the agency. There are 3
types of job seeker registration available to customers, according to
their circumstances and needs.

Fully Eligible Participants (FEPs)

FEP job seekers are able to access the full services as assessed by a
Job Seeker Snapshot or, if required, an Employment Services Assessment
(ESAt). Job seekers receiving payments with mutual obligation
requirements are normally registered by the agency as FEP.

Non-protected SCV holders granted JobSeeker Payment (JSP) or YA under
the New Zealand 10 year residence exemption are eligible to be
registered as FEP job seekers while receiving JSP or YA. These customers
will be eligible for services from a Workforce Australia Employment
Service Provider, but are not eligible for referral to Disability
Employment Services (DES), New Enterprise Incentive Scheme
(NEIS)/Self-Employment Assistance or Adult Migrant Education Programme
(AMEP).

Volunteer job seekers

Job seekers who do not have mutual obligation requirements or who are
not receiving income support may be eligible to be registered as a
volunteer job seeker. Volunteer job seekers are referred to Workforce
Australia Online Employment Services.

All job seekers with mutual obligation requirements who are not eligible
for registration as a Job Seeker Registration Only (JSRO) job seeker
must be registered as Fully Eligible Participants (FEP).

All volunteer job seekers are referred to Workforce Australia Online
Services.

Job Seeker Registration Only (JSRO)

Some customers are required to be registered as job seekers in order to
access other assistance, but do not require a referral to Workforce
Australia. Customers eligible for JSRO registration include:

-   customers who need a Department of Employment and Workplace
    Relations record in order to be referred for a Job Capacity
    Assessment (JCA). For example, Disability Support Pension (DSP) new
    claim customers or DSP customers requiring a Medical Review JCA to
    be booked
-   full-time students applying for a supplementary allowance
    determination
-   principal carers with long term exemptions from their mutual
    obligation requirements (longer than 16 weeks) who do not choose to
    volunteer for employment services
-   customers requiring a Job Plan as a condition of their payment,
    including:
-   principal carers fully meeting their mutual obligation requirements
    who do not choose to volunteer for employment services
-   people with a Partial Capacity to Work who are fully meeting their
    mutual obligation requirements and do not choose to volunteer for
    employment services
-   full-time students transferring to a job seeker payment within 4
    weeks of their student end date
-   customers receiving an income support payment with no mutual
    obligation requirements and who want to apply for Additional Child
    Care Subsidy (ACCS) (Transition to Work)
-   New Enterprise Incentive Scheme (NEIS)/Self-Employment Assistance
    participants presenting to Services Australia after 39 weeks of
    participation in the scheme to claim income support

If job seekers do not meet the criteria for JSRO registration at any
time, such as no longer fully meeting their mutual obligation
requirements, the JSRO flag must be removed and the customer referred to
a provider, if suitable.

Assessment as a Vulnerable Youth (VY) job seeker

To be assessed as a VY job seeker, a young person must meet all of the
following conditions:

-   be aged 15 to 21 years
-   not working 15 hours or more per week, not studying full-time and
    not currently receiving an income support payment
-   present with at least one serious non-vocational barrier
-   have legal rights to work in Australia

Assessment as a VY (student)

In order to be assessed as a VY (student), a young person must meet all
of the following conditions:

-   be aged 15 to 21 years
-   be a full-time student
-   present with at least one serious non-vocational barrier
-   be in crisis, which is defined as circumstances that require
    immediate intervention to stabilise their situation
-   have legal rights to work in Australia

VY (youth and VY (students) can be registered either by Services
Australia or directly by a Workforce Australia provider. If they are
directly registered, they will be referred to the agency within 4 weeks
to test their eligibility for an income support payment, and the agency
may complete the Job Seeker Snapshot and refer them to an Employment
Services Assessment (ESAt) if required.

Newly arrived refugees

Most newly arrived refugees remain Centrelink managed until 60 or 12
months after their arrival in Australia. There are a number of factors
that determine when a newly arrived refugee needs to be referred to
Workforce Australia and the level of servicing they will receive. See
Refugee and humanitarian entrant service offer for more information.

Voluntary referral to Workforce Australia

Job seekers may be voluntarily referred to Workforce Australia if they
meet the eligibility criteria for registration as a volunteer.

Services Australia can register volunteer job seekers under the
registration type of 'Volunteer'. All volunteer job seekers are referred
to Workforce Australia Online services. Access to online services as a
volunteer is not time limited.

Community Development Program (CDP)

When a job seeker lives in a Department of Employment and Workplace
Relations designated remote area, they are referred to a CDP provider.
The CDP provider will provide services similar to a Workforce Australia
Employment Service Provider.

The Resources page contains tables of job seeker eligibility for
accessing Workforce Australia services based on the customer's
circumstances.
