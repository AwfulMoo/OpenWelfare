About Authority approvals in PBS

Some pharmaceutical benefits are listed for specific therapeutic uses
and require prior approval from Services Australia or the Department of
Veterans’ Affairs (DVA). These items are noted as Authority required
items in the Schedule.

Increased quantities and/or repeats may be approved for these items
based on dosage, pack size and treatment period provided the patient
meets the restriction criteria.

Applying for an Authority approval in PBS

Approved prescribers can apply for an Authority approval from Services
Australia by:

-   accessing online PBS Authorities system, see Authority approval
    processing for Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS)
-   contacting the Authority Approvals Team by telephone, see Process
    telephone Authority approval application
-   uploading the written authority application via HPOS (Health
    Professional Online Services), see Processing written authority
    approval requests
-   writing via mail, see Processing written authority approval requests

Authority required (STREAMLINED) items do not require prior authority
approval from Services Australia to prescribe these medicines for listed
quantities and repeats. A 4 digit code obtained from the PBS website or
the Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits needs to be included by the
approved prescriber on the authority prescription form.

About the online PBS Authorities system

Approved prescribers can apply for the majority of PBS items, including
increased quantity and repeats where allowed via online PBS Authorities.
This will remove the need for approved prescribers to telephone Services
Australia for most authority approvals. Exclusions are Complex Authority
items, Hepatitis C and Alzheimer’s items.

Approved prescribers can request PBS Authority approvals online by
using:

-   upgraded clinical or prescribing software, or
-   Health Professional Online Services (HPOS)

The Resources page contains links to the Authority Prescription
Applications Team's contact information and Form 4046 PBS Authority to
prescribe.
