ACCS payments where deemed refusals can apply

Deemed refusal decisions can be applied to Additional Child Care Subsidy
(ACCS) (Temporary Financial Hardship) applications lodged by the
customer.

When a deemed refusal is applied

The system will apply a deemed refusal if an eligibility determination
has not been made within 28 days of lodgement of the ACCS
application/request for determination.

Applicants are not notified when a deemed refusal is applied, but will
be notified of the outcome of their application/determination once it
has been processed.

Processing deemed refusal applications

When an application/determination is deemed refused, it is automatically
assigned for assessment/review to appropriately skilled Service Officers
as a high priority in Workload Manager.

Until a decision is made to reject or grant the ACCS application, CCS
payments will continue (where eligible).

When processing the application/determination, the start date will be
determined using the original date of lodgement. The Resources page has
examples of deemed refusals and start dates following processing.

An application cannot be made ‘not effective’ once it has been deemed
refused.

The Resources page has examples of when a deemed refusal is applied, and
the start dates determined once the application is processed.
