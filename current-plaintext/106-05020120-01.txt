This document outlines information about whether some waiting and
preclusion periods can be served at the same time (concurrently) or if
they are to be served separately.

Waiting periods

Where a customer has more than one waiting and/or preclusion period,
payment cannot be paid until all waiting periods have been served. Where
the waiting periods can be served concurrently the payment will be made
after the end date of the longest period.

The IMP is imposed from the date the leave payment(s) were paid by the
employer. If a customer is serving a Liquid Assets Waiting Period (LAWP)
and an IMP is also to be served, the start date should be from the same
date as the LAWP, rather that the date the IMP payment was paid.

The Resources page contains a table to assist with determining what
waiting periods are served concurrently and what effect each period will
have on the customer.
