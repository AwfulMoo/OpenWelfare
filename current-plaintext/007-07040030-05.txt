ACO Spreadsheet

Once an organisation has been granted ACO status, the ACO Smart Centre
Processing team will email the organisation the 'ACO admission, transfer
or discharge spreadsheet'. This spreadsheet is used to claim Family Tax
Benefit (FTB) for children entering care and/or leaving care. The
spreadsheet is emailed to the ACO Smart Centre Processing team to assess
FTB, or action changes in care.
