This document outlines information relating to the Healthcare Providers
and the requirement for their organisation to register to participate in
the My Health Record system in order to view patient My Health Records.

Government intent

The Government intent for Digital Health is for individuals in Australia
to have a My Health Record. The individual has a degree of control as to
what goes into their My Health Record and who is allowed to access it. A
My Health Record allows doctors, hospitals and other healthcare
providers to view and share individual's health information to provide
the individual with the best possible care.

National expansion (Opt out)

Currently, My Health Record participation is voluntary for providers.

If providers enquire about the national expansion, Service Officers are
to direct the providers to the My Health Record website.

If providers enquire about the national expansion on behalf of their
patients, service officers should advise the providers to direct their
patients to the My Health Record website as well.

The Resources page contains links to the Australian Digital Health
Agency website for My Health Record glossary terms and the My Health
Record website.
