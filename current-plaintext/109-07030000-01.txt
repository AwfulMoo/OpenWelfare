Major functions of the AHRC

The major functions of AHRC are outlined in the various laws for which
it has responsibility. The AHRC is responsible for handling complaints
under the:

-   Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986
-   Racial Discrimination Act 1975
-   Sex Discrimination Act 1984
-   Disability Discrimination Act 1992

The AHRC also has responsibility for certain functions under the Native
Title Act 1993.

The AHRC investigates alleged infringements under the laws above and
attempts to resolve these matters through conciliation. Where
conciliation is unsuccessful or inappropriate, matters are terminated
and the complainant may then apply to the Federal Court or Federal
Circuit Court to have the complaint determined.

Other powers

Amongst other powers, the AHRC has the power to investigate and attempt
to conciliate individual complaints alleging a breach of the laws above,
and to require individuals to produce information or documents relevant
to the complaint.
