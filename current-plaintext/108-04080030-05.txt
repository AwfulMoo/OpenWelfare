| 1                                 | Funeral investments for members   |
|                                   | of a couple                       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   Each member of a couple may   |
|                                   |     invest up to the Indexed      |
|                                   |     Funeral Bond Allowable Limit  |
|                                   |     (IFBAL) in a funeral          |
|                                   |     investment. This means that   |
|                                   |     if each member of a couple    |
|                                   |     has an individual investment  |
|                                   |     costing the IFBAL amount,     |
|                                   |     then both are exempt assets   |
|                                   |     for the couple                |
|                                   | -   If a couple invest in a joint |
|                                   |     funeral bond, the total       |
|                                   |     amount invested must be no    |
|                                   |     more than the IFBAL for the   |
|                                   |     funeral bond to qualify as an |
|                                   |     exempt funeral investment     |

| 2                                 | Where a funeral bond and pre-paid |
|                                   | funeral plan purchased            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Where a person purchases a        |
|                                   | funeral bond and pre-pays their   |
|                                   | contractually arranged funeral    |
|                                   | expenses, all funeral bonds are   |
|                                   | assessable.                       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This is because the provisions of |
|                                   | subsection 23(1) of the Social    |
|                                   | Security Act defines an exempt    |
|                                   | funeral bond as one that does not |
|                                   | relate to a funeral for which     |
|                                   | another bond or a pre-paid        |
|                                   | funeral plan has been purchased.  |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 3                                 | Amount invested is more than the  |
|                                   | IFBAL                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the amount invested by the     |
|                                   | customer exceeds the IFBAL, the   |
|                                   | whole amount of that bond is      |
|                                   | assessed as an asset and deemed.  |
|                                   | However, any increase in the      |
|                                   | value of an exempt funeral bond   |
|                                   | due to investment earnings only   |
|                                   | is disregarded.                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Note: if Services Australia is    |
|                                   | advised the investment has        |
|                                   | increased due to interest paid    |
|                                   | and is now over the IFBAL, the    |
|                                   | investment value is not changed.  |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 4                                 | More than one funeral bond is     |
|                                   | purchased                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Where a person purchases more     |
|                                   | than one funeral bond investment  |
|                                   | to cover expenses of their        |
|                                   | funeral, but they cannot all be   |
|                                   | exempt (because there are more    |
|                                   | than two or cost more than the    |
|                                   | IFBAL), then the customer can     |
|                                   | choose to exempt whichever one or |
|                                   | two eligible bonds they wish. Any |
|                                   | others are assessed as financial  |
|                                   | investments.                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | For example, Betty has:           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   an individually owned bond    |
|                                   |     that cost 110% of the IFBAL   |
|                                   |     and is now worth 120% of the  |
|                                   |     IFBAL                         |
|                                   | -   an individually owned bond    |
|                                   |     that cost 80% of the IFBAL    |
|                                   |     and is now worth 85% of the   |
|                                   |     IFBAL, and                    |
|                                   | -   a jointly owned bond that     |
|                                   |     cost a total of 60% of the    |
|                                   |     IFBAL and which is now worth  |
|                                   |     90% of the IFBAL              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Bond one cost more than the       |
|                                   | Funeral Bond Allowable Limit so   |
|                                   | cannot be exempt.                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Bonds two and three each cost     |
|                                   | less than the IFBAL but together  |
|                                   | cost 40% more than this. The full |
|                                   | cost of the jointly held share is |
|                                   | used for this comparison, not     |
|                                   | Betty's 50% share. Only bond two  |
|                                   | or three can therefore be exempt  |
|                                   | from the Assets Test and the      |
|                                   | other two bonds will be counted   |
|                                   | as assets and the deemed income   |
|                                   | applies.                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Betty should exempt the eligible  |
|                                   | bond that would otherwise affect  |
|                                   | the assessable assets the most.   |
|                                   | In the above example, Betty's     |
|                                   | share of the two bonds that can   |
|                                   | be exempt would be assessed as    |
|                                   | 85% of the IFBAL or 45% of the    |
|                                   | IFBAL (half of total bond three   |
|                                   | value) respectively so Betty      |
|                                   | should choose to have bond two    |
|                                   | exempt.                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Note: the fact that Betty only    |
|                                   | has a 50% share of bond three is  |
|                                   | taken into consideration at this  |
|                                   | stage.                            |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 5                                 | Customer can change the exempt    |
|                                   | bonds                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The customer can choose to change |
|                                   | the exempt bonds at any time      |
|                                   | provided they are eligible for    |
|                                   | the measure. This may happen when |
|                                   | the IFBAL increases and allows a  |
|                                   | more advantageous combination of  |
|                                   | bonds.                            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | For example, in the case above:   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | When the IFBAL reaches the amount |
|                                   | Betty paid for bond one, then     |
|                                   | Betty would be better to select   |
|                                   | this as it exempts 120% of the    |
|                                   | IFBAL. When the IFBAL is at least |
|                                   | the sum of the amounts paid for   |
|                                   | bonds two and three, it may be    |
|                                   | better to exempt these.           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Note: customers may also wish to  |
|                                   | change exempt bonds if assessable |
|                                   | values change due to earned       |
|                                   | interest.                         |
