This document outlines the eligibility criteria for Distance Education
Allowance (DED) under the Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) Scheme.

Course eligibility

The applicant must meet AIC Scheme eligibility criteria to be eligible
for DED and the student:

-   must be studying at home through an approved distance education
    provider, or
-   in another acceptable study location or arrangement

DED is also for when a student undertakes study by distance education
methods and needs to periodically attend:

-   a residential school, or
-   a short 'mini' school as part of their course

Homeland Learning Centres

Homeland Learning Centres (HLC) outstation schools:

are acceptable study locations for payment of DED

are annexes of Northern Territory (NT) Government remote community
schools (also known as 'hub' schools or Community Education Centres
'CECs')

are in areas around remote communities, and

with the support of the remote community school:

-   provides education to students of Indigenous families living outside
    the main community in traditional homelands
-   may not provide the same range of grades for primary and/or
    secondary level study

Students are eligible for AIC because their local government schools and
remote community schools or 'hub' schools, are:

-   all classified as limited program schools by the NT Government, and
-   not 'appropriate state schools' under AIC policy

Students are geographically isolated, regardless of the:

-   proximity (or distance) of the homeland, or outstation location to
    the remote community school, or
-   availability of transport to the school

DED is payable if:

-   the student attends a HLC, and
-   the student and the AIC applicant live on the homeland or outstation
    location

An applicant can choose the school to get the DED. The payment should go
to an HLC account set up by the administering remote community school.

DED is not payable for a student:

-   attending the main remote community (hub/CEC) school
-   where the student and/or their parent/guardian/carer(s) live in the
    main remote community
-   who travels to the main community to attend the remote community
    school from the HLC (for example because the HLC does not provide
    their level of study or grade), or
-   living in the main community who travels to the homeland location to
    attend a HLC

Part-time distance education study

DED may be payable on a pro-rata basis when the student:

is doing both face-to-face and distance education, and

has a special need that means they need to study from home, and

is not enrolled at a distance education school on a full-time basis
(even taking into account any disability), and

is doing less than 4 school days a week undertaking:

-   home schooling/education, or
-   work set by the school to do at home

These arrangements are usually:

-   for socialisation reasons, or
-   under a plan for a gradual return to full-time school attendance

State / Territory Department of Education approval

The relevant education authorities (through the distance education
school or home education/schooling authority) must:

-   be aware of the arrangements
-   agree with, or have no objection to, the student also attending the
    school

See the State/Territory Department of Education approval table on the
Resources page for details.

Income Management

AIC applicants who get DED payments may be subject to Income Management.
AIC Smart Centres have no role in the administration of Income
Management.

Other student assistance options

DED is for students living in a homeland, outstation location or in a
remote Indigenous community. There are other student help options for
other methods of study:

-   Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) Scheme Boarding Allowance
    (BA/ABA)
-   ABSTUDY School Term allowance
-   ABSTUDY School Fees Allowance (SFA) at home rate (Group 1)
-   ABSTUDY School Fees Allowance (SFA) (Group 2)
