This document outlines how to reissue a group payment to a customer who
has vacated an organisation (for example, aged care facility, disability
enterprise, Protective Office), if their payment has been paid to the
organisation in error or the customer has died. Services Australia can
organise to pay the customer and recover the amount from the
organisation.

Adjustments

An adjustment is to be recorded against an organisation where a
pensioner has:

-   died and an instalment of pension has been paid to the organisation
    after death, or
-   been underpaid as a result of a payment being incorrectly paid to an
    organisation

Adjustments can be recorded for either of these reasons and at any time
during the pension fortnight. The adjustments will be amalgamated and
deducted from the money due to the organisation at the next group
payment bulk strip (Entitlement period end date code B). Most commonly,
adjustments would need to be recorded against an organisation when:

-   a customer leaves an organisation before the pension payday but the
    customer's pension was still paid to the organisation
-   a customer dies and the money is still paid to the organisation
    after death
-   where a pension is paid to a group payment organisation in error

Note: some organisations may prefer to manually return the payments by
Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT), rather than having their group payments
adjusted.
