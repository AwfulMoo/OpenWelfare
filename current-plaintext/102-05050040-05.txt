| 1                                 | Child is missing                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Mary contacts to advise Mary's    |
|                                   | child, Brian, aged 15, has been   |
|                                   | missing for almost a week. Mary   |
|                                   | has notified the police and tried |
|                                   | to find Brian through friends.    |
|                                   | Mary is upset and wants to know   |
|                                   | if there is anything that         |
|                                   | Services Australia can do to help |
|                                   | find Brian - perhaps someone else |
|                                   | has claimed payments, or perhaps  |
|                                   | Brian has claimed Youth Allowance |
|                                   | (YA)?                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The Service Officer finds out     |
|                                   | what they can about the situation |
|                                   | and records the information on    |
|                                   | Mary's record. The officer        |
|                                   | assures Mary that they will       |
|                                   | record the information provided   |
|                                   | and advises that Family Tax       |
|                                   | Benefit (FTB) for Brian can       |
|                                   | continue for the moment. Mary is  |
|                                   | also advised that if another      |
|                                   | person claims for Brian or if     |
|                                   | Brian claims Youth Allowance      |
|                                   | (YA), the agency would contact    |
|                                   | Mary to confirm the change in     |
|                                   | care. The Service Officer         |
|                                   | explains that information about   |
|                                   | other customers can only be       |
|                                   | released in special               |

|                                   | Mary is advised of the option to  |
|                                   | speak with a social worker, and   |
|                                   | Mary agrees. As no social worker  |
|                                   | is available at that time, the    |
|                                   | Service Officer runs the Refer to |
|                                   | Social Work guided procedure so   |
|                                   | that a social worker can contact  |
|                                   | Mary as soon as possible.         |
