This document outlines the steps debt recovery staff must take to
investigate and action a broken or non-compliant garnishee recovery
arrangement.

Non-compliance with a garnishee notice

Employer/third parties must implement garnishees. Failure to do so is an
offence. Transfer of the debt to the employer/third party can occur if
they do not comply.

Employer/third party liability is restricted to the lesser of:

-   the portion of the garnishee amount they are able to pay, or
-   the balance of the debt when the notice was sent

Employer/third party in receivership

A receiver can be appointed to a company that is experiencing financial
difficulty.

-   Garnishee funds deducted before receivership, but not received by
    Services Australia. Contact the administrator to check if any of the
    deducted money will be sent to the agency. Special circumstances
    waiver may apply
-   Garnishee funds deducted after receivership. Follow up with the
    administrator. Any money garnisheed after receivership should be
    forwarded to the agency by the administrator

Identifying activities

Broken garnishees result in an activity generating on the customer's
record. This changes the arrangement status from current (CUR) to broken
(BKN).

Allocation of broken garnishee arrangements occurs via WLM according to
debt staff's skill tags.
