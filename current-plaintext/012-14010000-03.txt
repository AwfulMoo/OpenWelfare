|                                   | not just against their employer:  |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   |     practitioner themselves (not  |
|                                   |     just their employer)          |
|                                   | -   A claim against the employer  |
|                                   |     because of the practitioner’s |
|                                   |     actions (where it is held     |
|                                   |     vicariously responsible for   |
|                                   |     the actions of its employee)  |

|                                   |     they are not named in the     |
|                                   |     legal proceedings) is not     |
|                                   |     enough                        |
|                                   | -   The practitioner must be      |
