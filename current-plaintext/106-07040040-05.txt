| 4                                 | Identity Review Period appears to |
|                                   | be a safer option to Alternative  |
|                                   | Identity, and less open to        |
|                                   | Identity Fraud. Why is there a    |
|                                   | move to encourage the use of      |
|                                   | Alternative Identity because some |
|                                   | customers do not return with      |
|                                   | their documents within 28 days?   |

|                                   | Identity Review Period is not     |
|                                   | safer or less prone to Identity   |
|                                   | Fraud.                            |

|                                   |     cancels a customer after 28   |
|                                   |     or 56 days, depending on the  |

|                                   | -   Alternative Identity (if      |
|                                   |     properly reviewed) can also   |
|                                   |     be cancelled if a customer    |
|                                   |     fails to provide the          |

|                                   | Alternative Identity requires     |
|                                   | more checks and provides greater  |
|                                   | assurance as to the customer's    |
|                                   | identity.                         |

|                                   | Identity Review Period is not an  |
|                                   | appropriate review if the         |
|                                   | customer cannot supply the        |
|                                   | documents in the review period.   |

|                                   | No. The Identity Review Period is |
|                                   | different to the two pay review.  |
|                                   | The Identity Review Period lasts  |
|                                   | for 28 days from the date of      |
