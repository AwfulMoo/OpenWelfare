Reasons for Nominee Arrangement to be coded

A voluntary (VOL) nominee arrangement is one where the customer has
requested the appointment of a person or organisation to be their
nominee.

An involuntary (INV) nominee arrangement is one where a court,
guardianship board, administrative tribunal or Attorney-General's office
has appointed a nominee to manage the care recipient's affairs. An
involuntary arrangement may also be created through a Power of Attorney
approved by a court when the customer has lost the capacity to manage
their own affairs.

Each code is predetermined to be either a voluntary (VOL) or involuntary
(INV) arrangement. The voluntary/involuntary requirement has a
subsequent impact on whether advices are sent to both the care recipient
and the nominee or just the nominee.

A nominee under an involuntary arrangement must specifically request
letters are not sent to the care recipient.

Note: see Power of Attorney, Guardianship, Administrative Orders and
Authorised Representative for Medicare for extra coding information.
