|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | (Retrospective Care assessment    |
|                                   | received) MFU on their record for |
|                                   | an FTB child. MFU details show    |
|                                   | DOV 1 October 2020 86% care and   |
|                                   | the greater than 100% care (>100) |
|                                   | indicator is N.                   |

|                                   | Checking the CHC and FSC screens  |
|                                   | show In Customer Care with 100%   |

|                                   | Checked if the DOV of 1 October   |
|                                   | 2020 from the MFU matched the     |

|                                   | To action this MFU, code the      |
|                                   | child as 86% in the customer's    |
|                                   | care from 1 October 2020 inside   |
