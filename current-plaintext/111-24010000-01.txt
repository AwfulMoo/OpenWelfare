This document outlines the process for Centrelink, Child Support and
Medicare staff to record feedback in the Staff Feedback Tool.

Privacy for customers and staff

Do not include information that may identify an individual who has
enquired about, applied for, or received, a Centrelink, Medicare or
Child Support payment or service from the agency in a free text field of
the Staff Feedback Tool unless it is reasonably necessary to improve the
agency's service delivery through either or both of the following:

-   providing useful feedback
-   allowing appropriate follow-up action to the feedback

Examples of identifying information include name, address, phone number
and date of birth.

Only staff with Manager access can view a feedback record submitted by
another staff member in the Staff Feedback Tool. See Management of the
Staff Feedback Tool. Staff without Manager access can only view the
feedback they have submitted.

Completing the Your Office and Receiving Office fields

It is critical that staff recording feedback in the Staff Feedback Tool
accurately complete the Your Office and Receiving Office fields. This
ensures feedback is correctly allocated and reported. For more
information, see the Recording feedback table on the Process page.

The Resources page contains links to the Staff Feedback Tool, the Staff
Feedback Tool Services Australia Intranet page, Office Locator and a SFT
Org Unit Lookup Tool.
