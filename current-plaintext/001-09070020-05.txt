|                                   | participation with the provider   |
|                                   | or they commence a placement with |

| 3                                 | Question: If a JSP job seeker has |
|                                   | a full-time short course          |
|                                   | approved, do they have any        |
|                                   | additional mutual obligation      |
|                                   | requirements?                     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: Yes. If a full-time short |
|                                   | course is approved by their       |
|                                   | provider, the job seeker is still |
|                                   | required to look for and accept   |
|                                   | work, but not where it conflicts  |
|                                   | with the time of the course or if |
|                                   | it would prevent them from        |
|                                   | completing the course. However,   |
|                                   | job seekers are required to       |
|                                   | accept any suitable work that     |
|                                   | does not conflict with the course |
|                                   | and they are not permitted to     |
|                                   | limit their job search only to    |
|                                   | areas relating to the course.     |

| 1                                 | Question: Can a job seeker        |
|                                   | undertake part-time study if it   |
|                                   | is not approved under the short   |
|                                   | course policy?                    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: Any type of part-time     |
|                                   | study which cannot be approved    |
|                                   | under short course policy can be  |
|                                   | undertaken, as long as the job    |
|                                   | seeker continues to meet all of   |
|                                   | their mutual obligation           |
|                                   | requirements. The job seeker must |
|                                   | demonstrate genuine job search    |
|                                   | efforts, including looking for    |
|                                   | work, attending appointments and  |

|                                   | undertake full-time study if it   |
|                                   | is not approved under the short   |

|                                   | Answer: No. In general, social    |
|                                   | security law precludes full-time  |
|                                   | students from receiving JSP if    |
|                                   | they are eligible for Austudy or  |
|                                   | YA as a full-time student. JSP is |
|                                   | a payment for people who are      |
|                                   | unemployed and looking for work.  |
|                                   | It is not a payment for full-time |
|                                   | students. Unless short course     |
|                                   | policy allows Services Australia  |
|                                   | to approve full-time study, or    |
|                                   | exceptional circumstances allows  |
|                                   | a provider to approve full-time   |
|                                   | study, the job seeker would not   |
|                                   | remain qualified for JSP and      |
|                                   | would need to test their          |
|                                   | eligibility for a student         |

|                                   | However, JSP should not be        |
|                                   | cancelled or rejected on the      |
|                                   | basis of the job seeker's         |

|                                   |     that their full-time study    |
|                                   |     will not meet their mutual    |
|                                   |     obligation requirements, and  |
|                                   | -   the job seeker is not willing |
|                                   |     to meet other mutual          |

|                                   | provider to negotiate appropriate |

|                                   | either include the study in the   |
|                                   | Job Plan or not, and to instigate |

|                                   | for failure to meet compulsory    |

| 3                                 | Question: Can a Parenting Payment |
|                                   | (PP) job seeker studying          |
|                                   | part-time or full-time transfer   |
|                                   | to JSP, continue their full-time  |

|                                   | eligibility for JSP?              |

|                                   | Answer: PP recipients             |
|                                   | transferring to JSP               |

|                                   | -   If a PP job seeker transfers  |
|                                   |     to JSP, they can continue to  |
|                                   |     complete their current course |
|                                   |     of study without the need for |
|                                   |     further approval, even if the |
|                                   |     remainder of the course is    |
|                                   |     longer than 12 months in      |
|                                   |     duration. The job seeker will |
|                                   |     be taken as fully meeting     |
|                                   |     their mutual obligation       |
|                                   |     requirements as long as they  |
|                                   |     continue to study for at      |

|                                   |     30 hours per fortnight (no    |
|                                   |     minimum contact hours), in    |

|                                   | -   If the job seeker ceases      |
|                                   |     study or wants to change      |
|                                   |     their course, they would need |
|                                   |     to be re-assessed under the   |
|                                   |     study guidelines for JSP. The |
|                                   |     job seeker would need to talk |
|                                   |     to a provider (if in a        |
|                                   |     program) about approval of    |
|                                   |     the new course and single JSP |
|                                   |     principal carers would lose   |
|                                   |     eligibility for PES           |
|                                   | -   If a PP recipient who         |
|                                   |     transfers to JSP is           |
|                                   |     continuing the same course of |
|                                   |     study but at less than 15     |
|                                   |     hours per week (or 30 hours   |
|                                   |     per fortnight), they will     |
|                                   |     have additional               |
|                                   |     requirements - at minimum a   |

| 5                                 | Question: When a job seeker       |
|                                   | wishes to undertake a full-time   |
|                                   | short course of less than 12      |
|                                   | months and could potentially      |
|                                   | qualify for either a student      |
|                                   | payment or a job seeker payment,  |
|                                   | which payment should the job      |
|                                   | seeker be receiving?              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If a job seeker, except for a PP  |
|                                   | job seeker or a principal carer   |
|                                   | on JSP, contacts the agency and   |
|                                   | advises they intend to study      |
|                                   | full-time, in the first instance  |
|                                   | the job seeker should test their  |
|                                   | eligibility for a student         |
|                                   | payment. If the job seeker is     |
|                                   | eligible for a student payment,   |
|                                   | then a job seeker payment is not  |
|                                   | payable and the job seeker must   |
|                                   | claim the student payment.        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | However, JSP job seekers will not |
|                                   | be required to test their         |
|                                   | eligibility for a student payment |
|                                   | if their provider has approved    |
|                                   | the course and all of the         |
|                                   | following are met:                |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   the course is a short course, |
|                                   |     that is, less than 12 months  |
|                                   |     in duration, or the job       |
|                                   |     seeker has a remainder of a   |
|                                   |     course of less than 12        |
|                                   |     months, and                   |
|                                   | -   the job seeker is receiving   |
|                                   |     JSP                           |
|                                   | -   the course is approved        |
|                                   | -   it is more financially        |
|                                   |     beneficial for the job seeker |
|                                   |     to remain on JSP              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the job seeker is eligible for |
|                                   | a student payment and it is more  |
|                                   | financially beneficial for them,  |
|                                   | then they should be advised to    |
|                                   | claim the student payment.        |
