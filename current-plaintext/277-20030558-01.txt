Referring overseas maintenance and paternity matters to the Attorney-General’s Department (AGD)

Child Support may receive the following overseas maintenance related
matters that cannot, in the first instance, be managed administratively
but may be addressed through a court process:

-   Establishment of paternity where the payer is a resident of
    Australia and the payee is a resident of the United States of
    America (USA)
-   Establishment of a maintenance liability where an assessment cannot
    be made (an application for spousal maintenance or adult (over 18)
    child maintenance under the United Nations Convention on the
    Recovery Abroad of Maintenance (UNCRAM). See the Resources page for
    a link to the United Nations Treaty Collection website
-   Confirmation of an overseas provisional order in an Australian court
-   Enforcement of a non-registrable maintenance liability (periodic de
    facto maintenance, non-periodic amounts including lump sum
    maintenance, school fees, medical expenses etc.) that has been
    entered into the child support Register under section 25A of the
    Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988. See the
    References page for a link to the act

When a matter of this type is received by Child Support it is documented
in Cuba and, if appropriate, referred to AGD via the Child Support
Program Advice Team. AGD will consider and action the matter in
accordance with Australian law and the relevant international
maintenance arrangement under which the application was made.
