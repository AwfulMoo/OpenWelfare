This document outlines assessing a customer's eligibility for the Long
Term Income Support (LTIS) rate of Youth Allowance (YA).

Eligibility requirements for LTIS

Each time a student starts a new course or returns to a course following
a break in study, they must satisfy the eligibility criteria to be
considered a long-term income support student.

The LTIS rate of YA may be paid to YA customers aged 22 years or over
who:

does not have a dependent child, and

commenced:

-   full-time study after turning 22 years of age in an approved course,
    that has a duration of at least 12 months, or
-   an Australian Apprenticeship after turning 22 years of age, and

has, when starting their course of study, been getting 1 or more of the
following for at least 26 out of the preceding 39 weeks:

-   JobSeeker Payment (JSP)
-   Youth Allowance (as a Jobseeker only)
-   Parenting Payment Single (PPS)
-   Parenting Payment Partnered (PPP)
-   Disability Support Pension (DSP)
-   Carer Payment (CP)
-   Special Benefit (SpB), or
-   Bereavement Allowance (BVA)

The LTIS rate may also be paid to YA customers aged 22 years or over
who:

-   do not have a dependent child
-   does not have English as a first language, and
-   are undertaking an English language course which they commence or
    recommence after turning 22 years of age

For these customers, the time on income support is not relevant.

Note: nil rate periods are not considered as receiving payment for the
purposes of the Youth Allowance LTIS rate.

Grandfathering provisions

Under grandfathering provisions, customers aged 21 and over who received
the LTIS rate of Youth Allowance prior to 1 July 2012 will continue to
receive the LTIS rate whilst they qualify for YA in relation to the same
course (including an English language course) or Australian
Apprenticeship.

Intent of the LTIS rate of Youth Allowance

The basic rates of payment for customers aged 22 in receipt of YA are
normally lower than the rates payable to customers of the same age on
other income support payments such as JobSeeker Payment (JSP). Despite
the higher income free area, the lower YA basic payment rate may be a
disincentive for customers considering a course of study or undertaking
an Australian Apprenticeship. This is particularly the case for
customers who have been in receipt of a benefit such as JSP for a
significant period.

The LTIS rate of YA is intended to ease the transition for customers who
have been in receipt of relevant income support payments for some time
and who decide to commence or recommence either study or an Australian
Apprenticeship after they turn 22.

Australian Apprenticeship or approved course qualifications

Customers undertaking an approved course or Australian Apprenticeship
can only qualify for the LTIS rate of Youth Allowance if they have been
in receipt of one or more of the relevant income support payments (YA
rules) for at least 26 weeks during the 39 weeks immediately prior to
commencing or recommencing the approved course or Australian
Apprenticeship.

The 39 weeks is counted back from the day immediately before the day
they commenced or recommenced the approved course or Australian
Apprenticeship.

Determining income support received for 26 out of 39 weeks

When assessing a customer's eligibility for the LTIS rate of YA,
supporting information can be found in the Resources page.

The customer is not required to have been continuously on income support
for the whole period. However, the total time on income support must add
up to at least 26 weeks (182 days) in the 39 weeks immediately before
starting the course or apprenticeship.

Periods when the customer is on an employment income nil rate period do
not count towards time on income support.
