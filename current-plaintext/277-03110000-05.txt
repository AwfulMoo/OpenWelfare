|                                   | July 2008 but have since          |
|                                   | re-separated                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Payee and payer have had an       |
|                                   | active case since 1 September     |
|                                   | 2006. On 31 May 2020, payee       |
|                                   | advises that they and the payer   |
|                                   | were reconciled from 15 April     |
|                                   | 2008 - 30 June 2009, but have     |
|                                   | remained separated since. As the  |
|                                   | reconciliation occurred prior to  |
|                                   | 1 July 2008, a suspension period  |
|                                   | is not applicable and the         |
|                                   | reconciliation does not cause a   |
|                                   | terminating event. No action is   |
|                                   | required.                         |
