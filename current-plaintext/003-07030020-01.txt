This document outlines how to help a customer claim Crisis Payment (CrP)
in Other Extreme Circumstances (EXO) and how to process the claim.

Claiming options

CrP can be claimed:

online via myGov by accessing Centrelink services and selecting:

-   Make a Claim
-   Crisis Payments
-   Apply for Extreme Circumstances

by running Assisted Customer Claim (ACC)

Note: from 1 August 2021, the paper Claim for Crisis Payment - Other
Extreme Circumstances form (SU718) is obsolete.

From 19 June 2021, evidence requirements for this claim were changed.
Some evidence is now required before the claim can be lodged.

Determination for Crisis Payment

The role of the Service Officer is to determine if:

-   the customer has left home as a result of the extreme circumstance
    and has established, or intends to establish, a new home, and
-   other qualifying criteria are met

Customers need to provide proof of the extreme circumstance that led to
the need for a new home. For example a fire, police, or doctor’s report.

Other assistance and payments

If a person who has claimed CrP is not eligible, offer any other
assistance or specialist service that may be available to them.

The customer may request and be paid a hardship advance (new claimants)
or an urgent payment.

Note: ABSTUDY customers are not entitled to a hardship advance payment.

One claim per circumstance

Only one CrP can be paid for the same circumstance.

For example, if a customer is paid CrP under the Social Security Act
1991, then becomes an ABSTUDY customer, they cannot claim another CrP
under ABSTUDY policy for the same circumstances.

Customers should give proof of the Extreme Circumstance that led to the
need for a new home, e.g. fire, police, doctor’s report.

CrP claims must be assessed using Process Direct.

Social worker assessment not required

Social workers do not assess claims for 'Crisis Payment Other Extreme
Circumstances'.

Some customers may need extra support depending on their circumstances.
If the customer would like a referral, see Social work service referral.

Customers with a Managed Service Plan (MSP)

If a customer has an MSP in place, refer to Customer service delivered
through a One Main Contact (OMC) as part of MSP. Service Officers need
to follow the correct process when assessing Crisis Payment claims to
ensure consistent servicing for these customers.

Payment of CrP

Due to the urgent nature of CrP claims, New Payments Platform (NPP) or
Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) are the primary payment methods.
