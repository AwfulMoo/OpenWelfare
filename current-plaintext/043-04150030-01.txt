For Complex Assessment Officer (CAO) use only

This document outlines information for Complex Assessment Officers (CAO)
on the action taken to delete links relating to the assessment of the
income and assets from a private trust or private company.

Deleting the links

Deleting trust and company (TAC) links should rarely be done and must
only be done by CAOs. A link must only be deleted if it was created
incorrectly. Note: the link must not be end dated.

If a customer ceases to be involved in a trust or company, the correct
procedure is to record zero income amounts in the attribution and
distribution fields (and liabilities, if appropriate) on the
Trust/Company Attribution (TRA), Trust/Company Distribution (TRD) and
Trust/Company Liabilities (TRLD) screens.

Links cannot be deleted between organisations and customers if there is
any attribution or distribution data (including zeros) recorded on the
TRA, TRD or TRLD screens. If any data is present on these fields it has
historical relevance for a customer assessment and must be retained for
historical purposes, subject to standard archiving/culling procedures.
