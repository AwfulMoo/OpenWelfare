This document outlines how Service Officers use MultiCal to calculate
Centrelink entitlements, other than ABSTUDY and Family Tax Benefit
(FTB).

MultiCal

The MultiCal debt calculator will calculate:

-   Newstart System (NSS) and Pension (PEN) system rates from 1 January
    1993
-   Parenting (PGA) system rates from 1 July 1995. This is the
    legislative start date
-   Austudy and Youth Allowance (YA) debts from 1 July 1998. This is the
    legislative start date. Note: Changes to YA after March 2008 and
    income bank changes after July 2008 have not been updated in
    MultiCal

ABSTUDY debts cannot be calculated using MultiCal. It will calculate
pension and JobSeeker Payment (JSP) debts for customers without
dependent children from 1 July 1991. Dependent children components for
periods before 1 January 1993 cannot be calculated using MultiCal.

Check MultiCal calculations for Rent Assistance (RA) before 20 March
1993 to ensure they are correct.

MultiCal calculates the correct customer entitlement.

All incorrect payments will be investigated thoroughly before a decision
is made to raise a debt.

Note:

-   MultiCal currently does not support entitlement/debt calculation
    from March 2020 onward. Work is underway to update the application
    to support the COVID-19 related changes to the income and asset test
-   All debts that can be calculated via the Centrelink system and
    explained using ADEX should be calculated in that manner
-   Use MultiCal if the Centrelink system calculation is not possible
-   If needing to hand-write adjustments or other notes about the
    MultiCal calculation, it is a requirement for prosecution referrals
    not to write on calculation sheets. Write any notes on a separate
    piece of paper
-   Scan all MultiCal calculations to the customer's record
