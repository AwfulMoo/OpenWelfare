Assessing and Benefits

Privacy note

Privacy Note

-   'The bank account details you provide are collected for Medicare
    payment purposes. The collection of this information is authorised
    under the Health Insurance Act 1973.
-   The information you provide will be used for the administration of
    Medicare payments and may be disclosed to relevant financial
    institutions for Medicare payment purposes, or where it is required
    or authorised by law.
-   For more information, you can visit the agency's privacy policy at
    servicesaustralia.gov.au/privacy.'

Claimant Declaration

'Do you declare that you have incurred the expenses for the services for
which you are claiming and that they are not for the purposes of
superannuation or provident account schemes, admission to a friendly
society, life insurance, mass immunisation, or health screening and are
not connected with the patient's employment?

To the best of your knowledge and belief, is all the information
disclosed true and correct?

Do you authorise Medicare to contact the referring practitioner or the
provider for assessment purposes?'

Bank Account Declaration

-   Repeat the BSB number back to the customer. Ask the customer to
    confirm these details are correct.
-   Repeat the account number back to the customer. Ask the customer to
    confirm these details are correct.
-   Record the confirmation of both BSB and account number in the
    Consumer Directory Maintenance System (CDMS).
-   Ask the customer 'Do you understand that giving false or misleading
    information is an offence?'

When updating the bank account details in CDMS, also include a comment
that the privacy note was read to the customer and they accepted the
declaration and that the customer confirmed the bank details.

If the customer does not accept either the privacy note or declaration,
advise the customer that their claim cannot be processed and paid until
this is accepted.
