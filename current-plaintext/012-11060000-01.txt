This document outlines the process for the QCS.

Quarterly Confirmation Statement process

Practices approved for WIP - Practice stream will receive their QCS
through Health Professional Online Services (HPOS) or via mail by the
15th day of the point-in-time month. The QCS will show all information
on the practice profile.

A practice must confirm their practice details to continue receiving
payments.

A practice can receive and confirm their QCS:

-   through Health Professional Online Services (HPOS) using the HPOS
    message. The practice’s online subscriptions must be set to 'Access
    Online'
-   by mail if the practice’s online subscriptions is set to ‘receive
    printed copy via mail’

The practice must:

check that the practice details on the QCS are correct

confirm the actual average weekly hours for the eligible health
professional type for the relevant payment reference period. The hours
must:

-   be clear and legible, and
-   contain a decimal point (for example, 47.5) or colon (for example
    47:30)

submit the QCS via HPOS or sign the declaration page and return by fax
or email

Only the practice weekly hours and declaration pages need to be
submitted.

The practice payments will be automatically put on hold if a practice
does not confirm their QCS by the relevant point-in-time date. Once the
QCS has been confirmed, the practice payments will be released in a
fortnightly payment run.

Health professional weekly hours contains more information about payment
calculations, practice requirements when employing an enrolled nurse but
