This document outlines information about Carer Payment.

CP is an income support payment paid to carers who, because of the
demands of their caring role, are unable to support themselves through
substantial paid employment.

It is a fortnightly payment that includes entitlement to a Pensioner
Concession Card (PCC) or Health Care Card (HCC). To be eligible for CP a
carer must be providing constant care for an adult or child and meet the
pension income and assets tests.
