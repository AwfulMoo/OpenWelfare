Finalising Section 24 reviews

Undertaking a Section 24 review

Table 1

When Services Australia becomes aware of the partner's visa being
cancelled due to security reasons, if the customer already receives a
payment under Section 24 provisions, this can continue pending further
investigation of the customer’s circumstances.
Escalate any confirmed cases where the partner's visa is cancelled due
to security reasons via the Level 2 Policy Helpdesk. The Helpdesk will
consider this situation and provide advice on the customer's continued
entitlement under Section 24 determinations.
