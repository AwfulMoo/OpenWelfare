This document outlines the process used by Service Officers in the
Payment Services team to perform a manual cash reconciliation.

Cash reconciliation overview

Cash reconciliation is the process of determining whether the total
value of payments loaded on to Cuba is consistent with the total value
of payments banked on behalf of Child Support.

Cuba will automatically reconcile these payments if the total value of
the payments loaded onto Cuba is equal to the value of the payments
banked on behalf of Child Support. When these amounts do not match, a
manual reconciliation needs to be performed. In most cases the
discrepancy will be due to a payment that has been dishonoured or
adjusted.

Payments made to Child Support are receipted and transferred by the
Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) each day. All payments transferred must
be reconciled daily against Cuba.
