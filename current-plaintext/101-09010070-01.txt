This document outlines the process when completing a bulk transfer of
customer deductions from one business to another business, or service
reason to service reason within the same business.

Bulk transfers

Bulk Transfers can be the result of:

-   a business has changed ownership
-   a business has ceased trading and a new Business has taken over the
    running of the business
-   there has been a change in entity, for example, a sole trader enters
    into a partnership
-   an incorrect service reason has been used or a more appropriate
    service reason is available
-   the consolidation of service reason
-   changes in business account reference numbers, or
-   advice received from the programme area which may be following
    consultation with policy departments

Users must have the required access (PYIUPD ISP resource) to perform
bulk transfers.

If an enquiry about a possible bulk transfer is received from a business
in person, via email or over the phone, the enquiry should be
immediately directed to the appropriate Account Manager.
