This document outlines the Community Development Program (CDP). CDP
provides an integrated and flexible approach to participation and
employment services for people living in 60 Department of Employment and
Workplace Relations designated remote servicing regions in Australia.

Aim of Community Development Program (CDP)

The CDP is the Government's remote employment and community development
service. CDP supports participants in remote Australia to build skills,
address barriers to employment and contribute to their communities
through a range of flexible activities.

For eligible participants living in one of 60 remote servicing regions,
CDP is the only Employment Services Provider type available. These
participants cannot be referred to:

-   Workforce Australia
-   Transition to Work (TTW)
-   Disability Employment Services (DES)

Key elements of the CDP

The key elements of the CDP are:

-   CDP providers deliver a range of services based on the needs of both
    the community and the individuals in that community
-   Each CDP region will generally have only 1 or 2 CDP service
    providers
-   Community development to support economic and employment
    development - Indigenous and community organisations in partnership
    with local leaders will have a say in the design and implementation
    of community projects and voluntary activities
-   'Jobs first' employment services - participants will be provided
    with personalised support and case management, including access to
    job opportunities, skills development and training

Eligibility for participation in CDP

There are two types of eligibility for CDP participants:

-   Remote Fully Eligible job seekers
-   Remote Community Volunteers

The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations will determine the
participant's CDP employment services eligibility and therefore job
seeker registration type:

-   Remote Fully Eligible (RFE)
-   Remote Community Volunteer (RCV)
-   No Remote Referral Required (NRRR)

Remote Fully Eligible job seekers

Remote Fully Eligible job seekers are those who live in a designated CDP
remote region and meet one of the following 4 criteria.

1: Customers with mutual obligation requirements

Customers who have mutual obligations requirements and receive or claim
any of the following:

-   JobSeeker Payment (JSP)
-   Youth Allowance (other)
-   Parenting Payment (PP)
-   Disability Support Pension (DSP - under 35 years of age)
-   Special Benefit (SpB)

This also applies to customers who are fully meeting their mutual
obligation requirements through approved activities and volunteer for
CDP provider servicing, such as:

-   Principal Carer parents and CDP participants with a Partial Capacity
    to Work who are fully meeting their requirements through part-time
    paid employment or study
-   Mature Age (age 55 years and over) CDP participants who are fully
    meeting their requirements through part-time paid employment,
    self-employment, voluntary work, study or a combination of these
    activities

2: Volunteering for CDP during a mutual obligation exemption

These are customers where both of the following apply:

-   they have an exemption from their mutual obligation requirements
-   they volunteer for CDP provider services during their exemption

3. Young people not receiving an income support payment, and vulnerable
young people

Young people aged 15-21 years who are either of the following:

-   not on an income support payment and are not employed for more than
    15 hours per week or in full-time education
-   vulnerable young people who are full-time students

4. Pre-released prisoners

Pre-released prisoners who:

-   are not receiving income support
-   are on approved day or partial day release
-   are referred by their correctional institution to engage in paid
    work through a work-release program

Remote Community Volunteers

Remote Community Volunteers are customers who live in a designated CDP
remote region, volunteer for CDP services, and meet one of the following
2 criteria.

Customers with no mutual obligation requirements

Customers who receive or claim an income support payment with no mutual
obligation requirements, such as:

-   Parenting Payment customers (with a youngest child under 6 years of
    age)
-   Youth Allowance (student) and ABSTUDY recipients who do not meet the
    Vulnerable Youth criteria
-   customers who receive a non-activity-tested income support payment
    such as Carer Payment, Age Pension, Disability Support Pension (aged
    over 35 years)

People who are not eligible for CDP services as they do not receive an
income support payment

CDP providers register Remote Community Volunteers directly. Services
Australia cannot refer them.

CDP Approved Program of Work Supplement (APWS)

CDP participants may be eligible to receive the APWS if they are
participating in Work for the Dole, which is an approved activity.

Mutual obligation requirements

CDP providers are responsible for managing mutual obligation
requirements for provider managed participants in remote servicing
regions.

From 12 May 2021, CDP activities which were previously compulsory
requirements are now voluntary. This includes:

-   Work for the Dole
-   training
-   work experience

CDP participants are not penalised if they fail to attend these
activities. If they cease Work for the Dole, and the CDP provider
notifies Services Australia that the participant has exited the
activity, their Approved Program of Work Supplement (APWS) of $20.80 per
fortnight will stop.

CDP participants still need to meet other compulsory mutual obligation
requirements such as:

-   agreeing to a Job Plan
-   attending provider and third party appointments when notified
-   attending job interviews
-   meeting job search requirements if appropriate
-   accepting suitable paid work

Job Plans in CDP

Participants who are provider managed will have a Job Plan negotiated
with their CDP provider.

In negotiating Job Plans with CDP participants, providers consider each
participant's assessed capacity and individual circumstances.

For 'assessed capacity', see Job seekers with a partial capacity to work
or a temporary reduced work capacity.

There are no specific requirements for CDP participants according to
their age group or participant category, e.g. for principal carer
parents or participants aged over 55.

Minimum hourly requirements do not apply for CDP participants. If a CDP
participant elects to participate in an activity such as Work for the
Dole, the provider records in the Job Plan the number of hours the
participant has volunteered to undertake. If the participant does not
participate in the activity for the elected number of hours, penalties
will not apply, as their participation is voluntary.

If a participant does not elect to participate in an activity, the
hourly requirements in their Job Plan are zero.

CDP participants who are Centrelink managed will have a Job Plan
negotiated by Services Australia. The type of plan to be negotiated will
be determined automatically by the system, based on information sent by
the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations IT system, and will
depend on whether a CDP provider referral is in place or not.

Work for the Dole (WFD) in CDP

The key aim of Work for the Dole in CDP regions is providing real
pathways to long-term employment. Eligible participants will also have
access to support services and activities such as basic literacy and
numeracy training, driver's license training, and other training that is
linked directly to a job.

Work for the Dole (WFD) activities in CDP

Under the CDP, WFD activities:

-   can provide a combination of work-like experiences and
    vocational/non-vocational training linked to a job
-   can be individual or group based
-   can be delivered by the CDP provider or through the providers
    arranging a third party host organisation to undertake them
-   are not added as a compulsory activity within a Job Plan
-   are voluntary for any CDP participants who elect to undertake Work
    for the Dole
-   will not be subject to the Job Seeker Compliance Framework

Note: CDP providers may approve flexible participation hours for some
CDP participants, which may include activities outside of standard
business hours, or variation in the number of days per week. CDP
participants can discuss this in more detail with their CDP provider.

Payments, supplement and services during Work for the Dole in CDP

CDP participants remain entitled to their income support payment (that
is, JobSeeker Payment (JSP), Special Benefit (SpB), Youth Allowance
(YA), Disability Support Pension (DSP) or Parenting Payment (PP)) and a
supplement of $20.80 per fortnight, to assist with the costs of their
placement. CDP participants cannot get the WFD supplement and the
Pensioner Education Supplement (PES) at the same time.

Additional Child Care Subsidy (ACCS) (Transition to Work) may also be
available to CDP participants.

Community Participation Activities

Community Participation Activities aim to support and increase CDP
participants' participation while supporting community advancement. CDP
providers are expected to work with the communities in their region/s to
identify community activities, community development opportunities, and
employment opportunities that that will contribute to the communities'
well-being and development towards sustainability. The Community
Participation Activities will be linked to the Community Action Plan.

Breakdown in relationship between a participant and their CDP provider

CDP participants who approach Services Australia about a breakdown in
their relationship with their CDP provider organisation should be
advised to discuss their situation with their provider in the first
instance. In situations when a CDP participant feels they can't talk to
their provider, or are not happy with the provider's response to their
issue, participants should be advised to contact the Department of
Employment and Workplace Relations.

Changing provider after change of address

If the CDP participant has moved to a new region, but remains linked to
the provider in their previous region, advise the participant to contact
their provider or to call the Department of Employment and Workplace
Relations Customer Service Line. For further information see Job seeker
change of address.
