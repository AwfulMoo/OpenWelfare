This document outlines the process for when a practice changes
authorised contact person/s.

Authorised contact person(s)

The practice owners must nominate one primary authorised contact person
to act on behalf of the practice and all additional practice branches.
The primary authorised contact person will:

-   receive all communications about the Incentive Programs
-   tell Services Australia of practice changes, and
-   update practice details, including changes to the practice bank
    account details

The practice owners can nominate up to four secondary authorised contact
persons to act on behalf of the practice. The secondary authorised
contact persons will:

-   tell the agency of practice changes, and
-   update practice details, including changes to the practice bank
    account details

Only the owner(s) can update a:

-   change of practice ownership
-   practice relocation
-   practice amalgamation

The agency will take all documents submitted by an authorised contact
person to be on behalf of the practice and the practice owner(s).

Updating authorised contact person(s)

The practice owners are the only ones that can update the authorised
contact persons.

Practice owners can update the authorised contact person(s) through:

-   Health Professional Online Services (HPOS)
-   The Practice Incentives Change of practice details (IP005) form

An authorised contact person must tell the agency if their family name
changes. They must submit correspondence including their:

-   former name
-   new name, and
-   signature

Multiple IP005 form changes

A practice can use the IP005 form to notify of multiple changes to
practice details. An authorised contact person change may be notified
with:

-   a relocation
-   an amalgamation
-   updating practice bank account details
-   ceasing a general practitioner (GP) or nurse practitioner

The Process page has more information about processing authorised
contact person changes including other changes.

The Resources page contains links to forms and letters.
