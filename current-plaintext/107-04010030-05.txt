This is because you did not maintain a full-time study load. You were no longer eligible for this payment. You will need to pay back the money you received from (date) to (date).
  Full time employment                                                                                     You commenced full time employment with (employer) on (date). As you failed to advise Services Australia when you commenced full time employment, you have received more than you were entitled to.                                                                                               This is because you commenced full time employment with (employer) on (date).

This means you have been overpaid. We are, therefore, required to recover this amount.                                                                                          This is because an incorrect value of your assets was used to work out the payments made to you.
  Income and Assets                                                                                        N/A                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               This is because an incorrect amount of income and assets was used to work out the payments made to you.
  Earnings                                                                                                 The correct earnings for you and your partner were not taken into account in the payments made to you from (date) to (date). This means you have been overpaid. We are, therefore, required to recover this amount.                                                                               This is because an incorrect amount of employment income from (employer) was used to work out the payments made to you.

  Earnings (multiple employers - where listing all employers exceeds word limit in field)                  N/A                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               This is because an incorrect amount of employment income was used to work out the payments made to you.
  Rent Assistance - ceased paying rent/not verified                                                        You were paid Rent Assistance that you were not entitled to receive for the period (insert period).
