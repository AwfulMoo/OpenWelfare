Taxable payments and components

The payments listed in the below table are not an exhaustive list of
each payment delivered by the agency but only those which are taxable or
non-taxable but reported to the ATO and which appear on the Centrelink
payment summary.

The component amount will be included with the main payment in the
'Taxable' amount column on the Centrelink payment summary - unless
specified.

Payments not listed within the table below are omitted as they are not
reportable to the ATO, regardless of their taxability status.

Reportable non-taxable payments and components

The non-taxable payments and components in the table below are included
on the payment summary and are reportable to the ATO. The component
amount will be included with the main payment in the 'Tax Exempt' amount
column on the payment summary.

From the 2012/2013 financial year onwards, the ATO requested only these
non-taxable payments subject to the ATO's Reform to Income Tests (RIT)
be reported. While RITs payments do not affect a customer's taxable
income, they do affect the income tests for a range of government
benefits and obligations.

Bereavement payments are not included with the BASIC component where the
primary payment is non-taxable.

Bereavement payments

The bereavement support options available to customers may be required
to be displayed on the Centrelink payment summary and reported to the
ATO depending on their taxability. See below for further information
about each bereavement support option.

Bereavement payment (BRV) is a non-taxable non-reportable component,
payable to the surviving partner or the caregiver for up to 14 weeks
after the death of the partner or care receiver. It is not included on
the Centrelink payment summary or reported to the ATO.

Bereavement allowance (BVA)

Bereavement Allowance is a taxable income support payment, payable in
instalments for up to 14 weeks after the death of a person's partner.
Bereavement allowance was closed to new entrants from 20 March 2020.

BVA will automatically display on a Centrelink payment summary and is
reportable to the ATO.

Lump Sum Bereavement payment (BRVLS)

Lump sum bereavement payment is a component, payable to:

-   Surviving partner or the surviving caregiver - non-taxable up to the
    tax-exempt amount. Any amount above the tax-exempt amount is taxable
-   Non-partner (except the carer) - entire lump sum is non-taxable

BRVLS is a non-taxable non-reportable component with the exception of
amounts over the tax free amount deemed to be taxable. These amounts are
reported to the ATO where the primary payment is taxable.

Ordinary Payments

Concessional tax treatment to an ordinary payment is applied to a
customer that is not entitled to a bereavement payment during the 14
week bereavement period.

A manual tax adjustment may need to be made to the survivor's tax record
where the survivor's new single rate is higher and no Lump Sum payment
is payable. The tax free amount is the difference between the previous
combined rate and the new single rate during the bereavement period.
This tax free amount then needs to be deducted from the customer's tax
record.

Any bereavement amount to be deducted from a taxable ordinary payment
will reduce the taxable information provided to the ATO.

Partner Bereavement Payment (PBV)

One-off Partner Bereavement Payment is a component, payable to eligible
customers on JobSeeker Payment (JSP) and Youth Allowance (YA). It is
non-taxable up to the tax free amount. Any amount above the tax free
amount is taxable.

PBV is a non-taxable non-reportable component with the exception of
amounts over the tax free amount deemed to be taxable. These amounts are
reportable to the ATO where the primary payment is taxable.

Tax Adjustments for payment summaries - Bereavement Payments

Service Officers manually calculate and determine tax adjustment for the
bereavement amount using the Bereavement Payment Taxation Job Aid.

Adjustments on the Tax Details Adjustment (TXAJ) screen for bereavement
payments are only made where the primary payment is taxable for the
relevant period.

The bereavement amount to be adjusted is applied via the TXAJ screen
under the survivor's current payment using component code of 'BASIC'.
Adjustments made by the SO with TXAJ access, will be automatically
included in the customers Centrelink payment summary for the relevant
financial year. See Adjusting tax details for Bereavement Payments for
more information.

Disaster payment taxability

Tax Free payments

Disaster Recovery Allowance (DRA) and ex-gratia DRA for bushfire events
that commenced in the 2019/20 financial year are tax free and not
reportable to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). Customers who need
to lodge a tax return or who are advising they are not required to lodge
a tax return to Services Australia, should not include these non-taxable
payments. See DRA and NZ DRA for further details.

Note: ex-gratia DRA was a term used for emergency events before October
2020. Ex-gratia DRA is now called Disaster Recovery Allowance for New
Zealand Special Category (subclass 444) visa holders (NZ DRA)

Taxable payments

Except for the events noted above, DRA is taxable and reportable to the
ATO for any other event (e.g. flood, storm, cyclone). DRA is also
taxable and reportable to the ATO for bushfire events that commenced
prior to or after the 2019-20 financial year. These payments will
display on the Centrelink payment summary as taxable. Customers that
need to lodge a tax return must include these taxable payments.

How disaster payments display on the Tax Payment Summary Details (TXGD)
screen

For NZ DRA (and ex-gratia DRA for emergency events before 2020), the
Benefit Type for the TXGD screen is FSP. Payments of NZ DRA made after
this date will not display on the TXGD screen.

For DRA the Benefit Type for the TXGD screen is DRA.

From the 2014/15 financial year, the corresponding Benefit Qualifier /
Event code also displays on the TXGD screen for reportable disaster
payments. Event codes can be found in the Minimum Activity Standards for
each event. See the Resources page of event specific operational
blueprints for a copy of the relevant Minimum Activity Standards.
