|                                   | imposed by the Court (with the    |

|                                   | example, community service can be |
|                                   | done in lieu of paying a fine.    |

|                                   | at approved organisations and are |

|                                   | service. These customers are not  |
|                                   | considered to be in gaol. A       |
|                                   | Community Services Order is a     |
|                                   | type of Community Based Order     |
|                                   | that can be imposed by a Court.   |
