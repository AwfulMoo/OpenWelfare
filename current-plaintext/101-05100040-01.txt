This document outlines the functions of the Multilingual Phone Service
(MPS). The MPS provides the full range of services offered by Smart
Centres. Customers can call the MPS directly on 13 1202 to receive
information and assistance about Centrelink payments and services in
their preferred language.

Available languages

MPS offers customer's direct contact in over 30 languages. MPS is not an
interpreter service.

When a Service Officer receives a call, but is not accredited in the
customers’ preferred language, they are to engage with an on-demand
interpreter (Interpreter Connect).

Language Services available through service centres

For Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) customers who attend a
service centre, Service Officers should engage an interpreter via
Language Services when necessary. See  Booking an interpreter for an
appointment.

Promote the MPS to customers from Culturally and Linguistically Diverse
(CALD) backgrounds by giving them the  13 1202  phone number. CALD
customers can use the  Multilingual Phone Service (MPS)  to conduct
their business with the agency.

The Resources page has contact details for Language Services and
