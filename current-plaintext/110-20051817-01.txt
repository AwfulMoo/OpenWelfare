For staff conducting JobKeeper compliance interventions

This document outlines the process for initiating JobKeeper compliance
interventions and customer contact, including action to take if the
customer fails to respond.

JobKeeper Program

The Australian Government's JobKeeper Program supports businesses
significantly affected by COVID-19 to help keep more Australians in
jobs.

The JobKeeper Program provides a wage subsidy, paid in arrears to
eligible employers for eligible employees, sole traders and other
entities between May 2020 and March 2021. Before 28 September 2020, the
amount of JobKeeper Payment was $1,500 per fortnight.

On 21 July 2020, the Government announced proposed changes to JobKeeper
including an extension from 28 September to 28 March 2021. There are 2
separate extension periods. The rate of the JobKeeper payment will
change for each extension period and will depend on the number of hours:

-   an eligible employee works, or
-   an eligible business participant is actively engaged in the business

It will be split into 2 rates. Employers will determine which payment
rate applies to eligible employees and notify the ATO.

The extension periods are:

Extension 1: from 28 September 2020 to 3 January 2021

The rates of the JobKeeper payment in this extension period are:

-   Tier 1: $1,200 per fortnight
-   Tier 2: $750 per fortnight

Extension 2: from 4 January 2021 to 28 March 2021

The rates of the JobKeeper payment in this extension period are:

-   Tier 1: $1,000 per fortnight
-   Tier 2: $650 per fortnight

JobKeeper compliance interventions

Customers getting an income tested social security payment are required
to report their income to Services Australia. JobKeeper Payment is
regarded as 'ordinary income' under social security law and will affect
certain income-dependent social security payments. This includes, but is
not limited to, Jobseeker Payment (JSP).

The purpose of JobKeeper compliance interventions is to:

-   create early, effective and high quality engagement with customers
-   educate customers receiving JobKeeper Payment about their Centrelink
    reporting obligations to stop and/or minimise customers incurring
    debts

This will be done by:

-   giving an education message to the customer about reporting their
    JobKeeper Payment
-   seeking JobKeeper information to update the customer record
-   assessing the customer's entitlement
-   explaining the outcome to the customer

Identified customers may be streamed to the following treatments if
appropriate:

-   SMS nudge message reminding customers of their obligations to report
    income
-   Low risk/ soft touch letter reminding customers of their obligations
    to report their circumstances; or
-   Outbound Dialler/Request to Contact Letter to remind customers of
    their obligations to report their circumstances and correct past
    declarations as required

Initiation

Interventions are loaded to the Integrated Review System (IRS). They are
initiated by:

-   Compliance Officers after successful contact with the customer
    through the Outbound Dialler (OBD), or
-   Payment and Integrity Operations Strategy by sending the Request for
    information (IRSRFI) letter

Interventions loaded from April 2021 will have a keyword of Tier 1 or
Tier 2 added to the IRS review to help the Compliance Officer identify
which Tier the data match relates to.

Employer Electronic Reporting (EER)

If the customer is employed with an Australian Disability Enterprise
(ADE) employer and their employment income is reported through the EER
process, refer the intervention to the CADO Service Desk.

Attribution of results

Before coding any payment affecting updates on the customer's record,
the Compliance Officer must make sure they have selected the IRS review.
For example earnings updates or suspension action.

This is also known as accessing the Review Image. This will make sure
that any results from those updates attribute to the review. For
example, debt outcomes.

The Resources page contains the education message for customers, DOC and
letter templates, user guides and links to ABN Lookup, myGov and the
Service Desk referral form.
