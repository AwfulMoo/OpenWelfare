This document outlines the various rates of ABSTUDY payments available.

Rates of payment

Student or Australian Apprentice

ABSTUDY payment rates depend on factors including whether a student or
Australian Apprentice is:

-   dependent or independent
-   living at or away from home
-   in state care
-   in lawful custody
-   a pensioner student
-   subject to the personal, partner or parental income and assets tests

Students

Payment rates for students are impacted by the:

-   type of course studied
-   student status, either full or part-time

Note: customers receiving ABSTUDY who were 21 years of age before 1 July
2012, are subject to grandfathered provisions. Therefore, they continue
to receive the existing rate of payment providing they qualify for
ABSTUDY in relation to their approved course or apprenticeship.

See Rates and Thresholds for current and historical rates of payment.
