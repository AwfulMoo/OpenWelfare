Infringement notice consideration

Table 3: this table describes the compliance action taken when an
employer fails to comply with accepting the employer determination
following the assisted dispute resolution for Parental Leave Pay (PPL).

Following a review of an employer determination, certain letters and
timeframes must be strictly adhered to by Services Australia. Different
processes apply when an employer does not comply with a non-compliance
(Q840) notice.
