This document outlines how to search for existing records and add new
records to the Income Security Integrated System (ISIS).

Selection of correct customer record

Locating and selecting the right customer record is vital when
processing any claim or making any updates.

If a claim or update has been processed on the wrong customer record, do
not attempt to correct the record. Deleting activities or attempting
workarounds will not delete or correct all information. These cases must
be referred to the Data Quality Unit Intertwined Team for corrective
action. A link to the Intertwined Referral Form can be found on the
Resources page.

The Resources page contains a link to mySupport and the Intertwined
Referral Form.
