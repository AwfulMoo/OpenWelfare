This document outlines the payment strip times for Centrelink payments.

Payment delivery

Centrelink delivers a variety of payments on behalf of various
government agencies. Centrelink delivers these payments to customers on
either a weekly or fortnightly basis.

In order for the payments to be generated, Service Officers must have
the processing to generate a payment finalised (and if selected for QOL,
approved) by the relevant payment strip time.

Processing that has not been finalised in time, or coded on a weekend,
will not take effect until the following working day's strip time.

It is important to note that payments can only be delivered on a working
day. Therefore payments cannot be delivered on a Saturday or Sunday.

It is important to remember that only Income Support Payments paid via
the NSS system are issued the next working day, all other payments,
including Pension, Family Tax Benefit (FTB), Parenting Payment (PP),
ABSTUDY and Mobility Allowance (MOB) are generally delivered to the
customer's account in 2 working days.

The Resources page lists the payment delivery strip times by system and
also when payment will be delivered to the customer.
