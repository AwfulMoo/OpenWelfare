This document outlines information to assist Service Officers in
terminating a Rent Deduction Scheme (RDS) deduction.

Terminating RDS deductions

Services Australia customers can volunteer to participate in the Rent
Deduction Scheme (RDS) to pay Government Housing payments. They can
withdraw from the scheme at any time without a reason. No authority form
is needed to stop the deductions.

This is done by:

-   the relevant Housing Authority (HA), or
-   contacting the agency in person or over the phone

All Service Officers can end the deduction instructions when asked by
the customer.

Where the HA requires help with ending a current RDS deduction, they
will contact the National Business Gateway – Confirmation Services
helpdesk.

Following termination of RDS deductions, customers are required to
discuss alternative rent payment options or sign a new Deduction
Authority to start a deduction with the relevant HA.

The HA may stop a deduction on behalf of a customer where they identify
the customer should no longer be paying rent.

Housing Transitions

Customers may also contact the agency regarding terminations related to
housing transitions.

Some State Housing Authorities (HA) have transferred the tenancy
management of properties to a (non-government) Community Housing
Provider.

This means that customers will no longer pay their HA rent liability via
the RDS. Their rent obligation will transfer to the Community Housing
Provider and be paid through Centrepay. These customers may also be
eligible for Rent Assistance.

Where a transition occurs, Services Australia works with State Housing
Authorities and Community Housing Providers to end existing RDS
deductions, and commence new Centrepay deductions and Rent Assistance on
behalf of affected customers.

Allowing Community Housing Providers to commence Centrepay and Rent
Assistance on their behalf is voluntary, and some customers may choose
to contact the agency to apply for Rent Assistance or set up a Centrepay
deduction.

Customers who are being transitioned will receive an RDS cancellation
letter, and Centrepay/Rent Assistance commencement letters through the
transition period. If a customer contacts in relation to the transition,
refer them to their Community Housing Provider to discuss. This includes
changes to their deduction arrangements or management of their tenancy
from a Housing Authority to a Community Housing Provider in their state.

Overpayments

Occasionally, overpayments are made to HAs. Customers should be advised
that it may take up to 8 days for their Government Housing deductions to
cease, although legally they cease from the day the customer withdraws
their authority. This will result in the HA receiving extra payments
from the customer, and any such overpayment is refundable to the
customer by the HA.

Note: RDS refunds are not to be made by Centrelink. Advise customers to
contact their HA.

Grace period when payment ceases

When an income support payment ceases, a grace period applies to
deduction instructions for 13 weeks. If the payment is restored during
the grace period the deduction instruction remains valid.

Income Management for customers with RDS deductions

When a customer has an existing RDS deduction in place, and is placed
onto Income Management, the rent amount is deducted from the customer's
discretionary funds by default, not their income managed funds. The
agency needs to ensure that customers are engaged where possible to
determine whether they want to pay their rent from their:

-   discretionary funds
-   available income managed funds, or
-   a portion from both available funds

Termination of the existing RDS deduction may be required if the
customer chooses to pay their rent payment from their available Income
Management funds.

RDS deductions are voluntary for all customers including those who are
income managed. All customers are able to terminate their RDS deductions
at any time without giving reasons. Under no circumstances should a
service officer refuse to terminate an RDS deduction. For further
information, see Updating an existing Rent Deduction Scheme (RDS)
deduction for a customer who has commenced Income Management.
