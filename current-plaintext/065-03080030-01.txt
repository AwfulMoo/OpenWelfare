This document outlines how to restore a customer's Age Pension when
qualification has been re-established after cancellation or suspension
of payment.

Re-establishing qualification or payability

Restoration of Age Pension may be possible when a customer's
qualification or payability for payment has been re-established after
the payment has been cancelled or suspended, and Age Pension
qualification and payability have continued since the date of
suspension/cancellation. When restoring payments it is important to
establish continuing qualification for payment. If there have been any
changes in the customer's circumstances, these must be recorded before
restoring payment to avoid incorrect arrears being generated.

Customers released from prison

Before restoring payment for a customer released from prison, the
Service Officer must first confirm the date of release with the
appropriate state authority. Contacts for confirming release are
included in the Resources tab of Confirming prison admission and release
dates.

Cancellation or suspension reason Whereabouts Unknown (WUK)

As long as the customer has continued to be qualified and payable during
the entire period of suspension/cancellation (or eligible for an
employment income nil rate), their payment may be restored with full
arrears.

This can occur when the customer contacts more than 13 weeks after the
suspension/ cancellation decision. The customer would not have received
advice of the decision to suspend or cancel, if they were not at their
known address and/or advice of the decision was returned to Services
Australia.

Some Age Pension customers admitted to residential aged care are unable
to advise their change of address. Customers living in residential aged
care will have a current RCA benefit status. The name of the aged care
home will display on the RCA Institution Summary (RIS) screen. Take care
to check these details when reviewing suspended WUK cases.

Restoring payment

The date of effect is the date of the original suspend/cancel decision
when a customer has a favourable determination (restoration) resulting
from a review of the decision. This includes when payment cancels after
it has been suspended for 13 weeks, because the cancellation date of
effect is the same as the suspension date of effect. See the References
page.

If the customer contacts within 13 weeks of the decision to suspend or
cancel, check their circumstances to determine if full arrears are
payable. Payment can be restored from the date of effect of suspension
or cancellation if they:

-   retained qualification from the date of effect of the decision, and
-   they were payable or eligible for an employment income nil rate
    period

If they contact more than 13 weeks after the later of the decision to
suspend or cancel, check if it is possible they may not have received
advice of the decision to suspend/cancel. If so, payment can be restored
from the date of effect of the suspension or cancellation, providing the
customer retained qualification and they were payable or eligible for an
employment income nil rate period.

If the customer's payment was cancelled incorrectly, it can be restored
when the error has been corrected. For example, CAN-NSR due to
incomplete or wrongly recorded residence details.

A customer is required to reclaim if their payment cannot be restored
from the date of effect of the suspension or cancellation. For the
reclaim process, see Initial contact to claim Age Pension.
