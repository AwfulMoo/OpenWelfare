Birth certificate jurisdictional variations - information required

+ For TAS, VIC and WA birth certificates with a change of name
registered, the new name is the name that will be validated against. The
original name recorded in the body of the certificate will not validate.

# QLD birth certificates issued before 1 July 1974 do not show the
child’s family name. Users need to enter the father’s family name, or if
not recorded, the mother’s family name. If there is a marginal/record
history notation on the certificate to the affect that the child has
assumed another family name, that family name must be entered.

## A hyphen or an empty name field will be accepted for NSW birth
certificates.

### For QLD birth certificates submit numerical data only for
registration numbers.

* Date of registration may be different to the date of birth.

Matches required for change of name by state

Marriage certificate jurisdictional variations - information required

+ For WA marriage certificates issued between 1979 and 1983, the
district number on the certificate should be ignored and the WA district
list should be referred to ensure the correct registration number is
entered for validation.

# For QLD marriage certificates, coverage is based on the date of
registration, not the date of marriage.

## A hyphen or an empty name field will be accepted for NSW birth
certificates.

* Date of registration may be different to the date of marriage
