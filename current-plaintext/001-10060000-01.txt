This document outlines the policy and procedures that apply when a job
seeker voluntarily ceases suitable employment without reasonable excuse
or becomes unemployed due to misconduct as a worker.

Policy context

Australia's welfare system is designed to provide a strong safety net
for those who are unable to support themselves.

For people of working age who have the capacity to work, these payments
are intended to support those who are actively seeking and prepared to
move into suitable paid work as this becomes available.

The job seeker compliance system helps to reinforce these expectations.
Penalties may apply if a job seeker has contributed to their
unemployment, through voluntary unemployment or dismissal for
misconduct.

Consequence of voluntary unemployment or dismissal due to misconduct

If unemployment due to a voluntary act or misconduct occurs, Services
Australia staff are required to apply legislation and policy in a firm
but fair manner to ensure that the serious nature of this behaviour is
appropriately reinforced.

If a customer or job seeker leaves suitable work voluntarily (without a
reasonable excuse), or is dismissed from suitable work due to
misconduct, the consequence depends on which compliance system applies.

Under the:

Targeted Compliance Framework, an unemployment failure has been
committed:

-   customers incur a 4 week unemployment preclusion period or 6 weeks
    if they received relocation assistance
-   job seekers receiving a participation payment will have this payment
    cancelled. A post cancellation non-payment period prevents them from
    receiving payment for the preclusion period if they reapply

Job Seeker Compliance Model, an 8 week Unemployment Non-payment Period
(UNPP) applies, or 12 weeks if they received relocation assistance

Note: ParentsNext participants are not subject to compliance action if
they are unemployed due to a voluntary act or due to misconduct.

Voluntary unemployment

Voluntary unemployment refers to a situation where a job seeker becomes
unemployed as a result of a voluntary act. Compliance action is required
where the job seeker has left suitable employment and their reason for
leaving is not considered reasonable.

Voluntary unemployment does not include leaving work as a result of:

-   an employment contract ending
-   no further work available (for example, factory closures or a
    voluntary redundancy is accepted), or
-   being within 6 weeks of the date of confinement but not having
    access to Maternity Leave

Dismissal due to misconduct

Unemployment due to misconduct refers to situations where a job seeker
has contributed to their unemployment, either due to having been
dismissed or being given the option of resigning from suitable work, as
a result of inappropriate actions as an employee.

The reason for termination must be a result of misconduct as an employee
and not because of their general behaviour. The incident must have
either occurred in their place of work or be directly related to their
work.

Examples of unemployment due to misconduct include:

-   deliberate failure to produce or deliver a reasonable amount of work
-   unauthorised absences from duty without good reason
-   inappropriate behaviour or practices such as theft, assault or
    harassment of other employees or customers, inappropriate use of
    company credit cards, cars or information technology, or
    confidentiality breaches
-   actions that cause serious risk to the health or safety of other
    employees or customers
-   actions that threaten the reputation, viability or profitability of
    the business

Identifying unemployment due to voluntary act or misconduct

All Service Officers have an important role in the identification of
potential non-compliance where the job seeker became unemployed
voluntarily or as a result of misconduct.

If an Employment Separation Certificate (SU1) has been provided
(including collected verbally by the Service Officer) and the employer
has indicated the reason for separation as employee ceasing work
voluntarily, misconduct as an employee, unsatisfactory work performance,
or other, the Service Officer must consider whether compliance action
should be generated for further investigation. Where compliance action
is generated, the job seeker must be advised that their reason for
unemployment will be further investigated and a penalty may be applied.

If a non-compliance event is generated when a person is commencing or
lodging a claim, the compliance investigation and decision must occur
before the claim can be finalised. This decision may have a direct
impact on the job seeker's income support payment start date.

An Employment Services Provider may submit a report to Services
Australia if they identify that while receiving a participation payment
a job seeker:

-   voluntarily ceases suitable employment
-   becomes unemployed due to misconduct

The provider must have considered the suitability of work and reasons
for leaving before submitting the report. The Participation Solutions
Team (PST) is responsible for undertaking these compliance
investigations.

Although ParentsNext participants receive a participation payment they
are not required to look for work and are therefore not subject to
unemployment failures.

Evidence to be collected before generating compliance action

If a Service Officer identifies unemployment due to a voluntary act or
misconduct may have occurred, they should gather sufficient evidence
before generating any compliance action. For example:

-   Employment Separation Certificate (SU1)
-   job seeker statement or
-   additional employer statement

Compliance action does not need to be generated where:

-   an employee was genuinely unable to produce a satisfactory standard
    of work
-   had a good reason for unauthorised absences (although not advising
    absences may constitute misconduct on its own)
-   the employer is unable or unwilling to substantiate their
    allegations
-   there is evidence that the job seeker was acting in self-defence
    rather than being the instigator
-   any potential non-payment period has been self-served by the job
    seeker
-   any potential non-payment period is entirely overlapped by another
    waiting period (e.g. Income Maintenance Period)
-   end of contract

If a decision is made not to generate compliance action, this must be
clearly documented. For example, the Service Officer assessing the new
claim can note in the Progress of claim DOC that a potential
non-compliance event has already been considered and further
investigation is not required as the potential non-payment period has
been self served.

If the information contained in the Employment Separation Certificate
(SU1) is obtained verbally from the employer and there is an indication
that further investigation will be required, the employer should be
advised another Service Officer may make contact to obtain more details
about the reason for the voluntary unemployment or dismissal due to
misconduct. Contact details of the most relevant person to speak with
should be recorded when generating compliance action.

Generating compliance action

Compliance action must be generated once there is sufficient evidence to
identify that a non-compliance event is likely to have occurred.

For current job seekers, Special Benefit (SpB) and Parenting Payment
(PP) claimants, the Service Officer must generate the compliance action
using the Participation Compliance workflow in Customer First.

Compliance action for JobSeeker Payment (JSP) and Youth Allowance (YA)
new claims must be generated in Process Direct using the More Options
UNPP workflow. This includes documenting the evidence gathered.

The workflow will identify the job seeker compliance system the job
seeker is managed under. If at the time the compliance action is
generated the job seeker is:

-   not a declared programme participant they are managed under Targeted
    Compliance Framework and an unemployment failure will be generated
-   a declared programme participant they are managed under the Job
    Seeker Compliance Model and an Unemployment Non-Payment Period will
    be generated

Once the compliance action is generated, the compliance investigation is
undertaken by an appropriately skilled Service Officer.

If the compliance action is generated:

-   before the job seeker's claim for a participation payment is
    finalised, a Service Officer with a UNPP IT security resource is
    responsible for undertaking the compliance investigation (except
    where the job seeker received relocation assistance)
-   and the job seeker is receiving a participation payment or where it
    is identified that they may have received relocation assistance for
    the position, the Participation Solutions Team is responsible for
    undertaking the compliance investigation

Investigating unemployment due to voluntary act or misconduct

Service Officers with a UNPP IT security resource and Participation
Solutions Team (PST)-skilled Service Officers are responsible for
undertaking the compliance investigation and making a decision to apply
or reject the compliance action. The investigation will focus on the
matters that are relevant to making an evidence-based decision that is
in line with the legislative framework and policy intent.

These matters are:

-   the circumstances that led the job seeker becoming unemployed
-   whether the employment was suitable work, and
-   whether there were any factors that made it reasonable for the job
    seeker to leave employment voluntarily, or
-   whether an incident of misconduct that led to dismissal actually
    occurred

Service Officers with a UNPP IT security resource and PST-skilled
Service Officers have responsibility for:

-   investigating unemployment due to a voluntary act or dismissal due
    to misconduct
-   delivering strong messages that reinforce the expectation that job
    seekers remain in suitable work
-   gathering sufficient evidence required to support their decision
-   determining whether an unemployment failure has been committed or an
    UNPP is applied
-   explaining this decision to the job seeker, including their review
    and appeal rights
-   where a UNPP (Community Development Program (CDP) job seekers) is
    applied, assessing eligibility for payment under hardship provisions

Consultation with a PST Service Support Officer (SSO), PST-skilled
social worker or other specialist officer may be required to assist with
assessing the impact of job seeker circumstances on the suitability of
work, their reason for leaving or behaviour at the time of dismissal. A
PST skilled Service Officer must consult with a social worker where the
job seeker presents with family and domestic violence or has a current
Family relationships/Domestic violence circumstance recorded. See
Accessing a PST-skilled social worker.

PST-skilled Service Officers with the WNPPD IT security resource are
responsible for explaining the decision to the job seeker. They will
also record the job seeker's application for a formal review by an
Authorised Review Officer (ARO) if required. See Reviews and Appeals.
