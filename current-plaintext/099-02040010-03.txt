|                                   | because the system calculates the |
|                                   | 14 week bereavement period from   |
|                                   | the beginning of the entitlement  |
|                                   | period in which the child died    |
|                                   | instead of from the child’s date  |
|                                   | of death. This means the customer |
|                                   | may not receive PPP for the full  |
