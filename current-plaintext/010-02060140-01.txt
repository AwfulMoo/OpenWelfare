This document outlines when an ABSTUDY student may be eligible for a
higher rate of assistance due to racial discrimination at the local
government schools.

ABSTUDY away from home eligibility

Dependent ABSTUDY students are normally expected to live at home while
studying. Under certain circumstances, however, they may have to live
away from home and so become eligible for a higher rate of assistance.
One of these circumstances is where there is evidence that the student
has been subjected to racial discrimination of a serious and continuing
nature at the local government schools.

Study by distance education or correspondence

Dependent schooling students studying by distance education or
correspondence are not eligible for the away from home rate under the
racial discrimination provision.

Required resolution attempts

Approval on the basis of racial discrimination would only be given if
and when all possible attempts to resolve the problem at the local level
have proved to be unsuccessful. These attempts should be conducted with
the help of school authorities, local Aboriginal Education Consultative
Group (AECG) members, and/or local Parental and Community Engagement
Program (PaCE) committee members.

A student seeking approval for away from home allowance due to being
subjected to racial discrimination at their local government school will
also need to establish that they cannot access any other government
school with an appropriate year of study within reasonable travelling
time, prior to approval of away from home rate.

How to claim

Away from Home rate can be claimed:

-   for new customers, via the ABSTUDY Claim (SY019), or
-   for existing customers, via a statement (verbal or written)
    indicating the criteria under which they are seeking approval

Note: a student's eligibility on the basis of racial discrimination
cannot be clearly established from the claim form without supporting
documentation from another source.

Unfavourable decisions

When making an unfavourable decision, speak to the customer:

-   explain the decision
-   give them a chance to provide more information, and
-   advise their review and appeal rights
