This document explains how to assess, code and review weekly payments
for a customer.

Staff roles

Only Service Officers who have completed the training can assess and
process weekly payments. Each service centre should have at least one
staff member trained.

All Service Officers:

-   answer general enquiries about weekly payments and eligibility
    criteria
-   identify customers who may benefit from weekly payments
-   transfer calls to the relevant Urgent Payment queue if the customer
    asks about starting, stopping or reviewing weekly payments

To start, stop or review payment arrangements, Service Officers must be
SO3 or above and have completed the training module. Transfer phone
requests for weekly payments to staff who have completed the training.

Staff do not need to request the WKLUPD - Weekly Payments resources by
the ICT Security Portal (ISP). Access to approve weekly payments is
provided to all staff at the SO3/4 level.

Service Officers may receive a reminder email from ICT ISP informing
them their access is expiring. This message should be ignored, as no
resource request is needed.

Weekly Payment Reviews

Customers on weekly payments will have their arrangement reviewed during
the following changes in circumstances contacts such as:

-   a change in employment status
-   at the request of the customer
-   new claim lodgement or assessment
-   when a vulnerability or homelessness indicator is reviewed

Customers receiving the following payments will have a manual review
created every 11 months:

-   ABSTUDY, except for customers paid ABSTUDY components on a term
    basis
-   Austudy, excluding Australian Apprentices
-   Carer Payment (CP)
-   JobSeeker Payment (JSP)

Weekly Payment Reviews for AGE and DSP

From 29 June 2022, annual reviews are no longer required for customers
receiving Age Pension and Disability Support Pension.

Removal of this requirement does not replace the option for a manual
review to be completed at any time. These reviews may be undertaken:

-   due to a change in employment status
-   at the request of the customer
-   at new claim lodgement or assessment
-   when a vulnerability or homelessness indicator is reviewed
-   where circumstances indicate there may be a need for additional
    support e.g. a claim for Immediate Payment is received
