This page contains the process to deactivate a Healthcare Provider
Identifier - Organisation (HPI-O) organisation in the Healthcare
Identifiers (HI) Service.

Deactivate HPI–O

If the Service Officer is acting on behalf of another person known to
the HI Service, for example, a Responsible Officer (RO) or Organisation
Maintenance Officer (OMO), they must first search for the individual in
eHealth Program (EHP) before searching for the organisation.

For the purpose of this procedure, Service Officers are not acting on
behalf of another individual and will search directly for the
organisation.

This process can only be undertaken when the policy conditions are met.
