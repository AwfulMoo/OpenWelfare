This document outlines the procedures relating to special arrangement
extensions for Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) Authorities COVID-19
response. The special arrangements apply for prescribing and supply of
Pharmaceutical Benefits, and other PBS programs (as applicable). This
information supports staff in providing advice and processing requests
under COVID-19 arrangements as advised by The Department of Health and
Aged Care.

COVID-19 special arrangements

Imaged-based prescribing arrangements

Allows for image-based prescriptions and receipting signature waiving on
dispensed PBS prescriptions

Image-based prescribing in the community setting ceased 31 March 2022:

-   Prescriptions written after this date and treated as imaged-based
    prescribing in the community setting are no longer accepted. All
    paper prescriptions issued before 31 March 2022 under this
    arrangement can be supplied after this date

Image-based prescribing arrangements for hospitals only will be extended
until 31 March 2023

Patients are still not required to sign to acknowledge receipt of supply
if it is not practical for them to do so. The pharmacist may sign on
behalf of the patient unless it is not practical for them to do so.
Signature exemptions for safety net concession cards also continue to
apply. This interim arrangement will also continue until 31 March 2023
to help prevent the transmission of COVID-19

Care Prescriptions via Telehealth – State and Territory Rules

Continuing Therapy has ceased from 1 July 2022

The temporary measure, Volume 1 Schedule 10A and Volume 7 Schedule 6 of
the National Health (Listing of Pharmaceutical Benefits) Instrument 2012
(legislation.gov.au) that allowed continued access for patients affected
by COVID-19 pandemic by exempting some continuing treatment requirements
for certain medicines (mainly Complex drugs), has ceased from 1 July
2022

Any continuing treatment authority applications dated:

-   on or after 1 July 2022, without an assessment due to COVID-19 must
    be rejected
-   prior to 1 July 2022, without an assessment due to COVID-19 can be
    approved. Staff should continue to include A2020CV in the authority
    comment when approving these applications

Emergency Message (for when phone lines are down)

-   Allows prescribers to continue to prescribe authority required items
    for quantities and/or repeats the prescriber deems clinically
    required (and within PBS guidelines) when the PBS Authority Approval
    Telephone line is unavailable. The prescriber must ensure the
    prescription is annotated correctly

Posting written prescriptions to third parties (pharmacy) due to
COVID-19

-   Allows approved PBS prescriptions to be posted to a third party
    (e.g. pharmacy), where the prescriber has specifically requested
    this on the prescription and indicates that the reason is due to
    COVID-19

Simplified prescribing arrangements for chemotherapy patients during the
COVID-19 pandemic

-   Allows pharmacists to dispense directly from any
    prescriber-authorised medication chart (paper or electronic) during
    the COVID-19 pandemic without the need for a duplicate paper PBS
    prescription
-   Introduced due to concerns that prescribers will have limited
    capacity to see their patients and write separate paper
    prescriptions in a timely manner
-   There were also concerns that the physical handling of multiple
    paper prescriptions would pose a health risk for medical staff and
    health professionals with the transmissibility of COVID-19

Summary of COVID-19 special arrangements

The COVID-19 special arrangements allow:

prescribers in a hospital to create a paper prescription during a
telehealth consultation, and

create a clear copy of the entire prescription to send to the hospital
pharmacy via:

-   email
-   text message, or
-   fax

The copy can be a digital image such as a photo or PDF including the
barcode where applicable.

Patients and pharmacists are not required to sign to acknowledge receipt
of supply of a Pharmaceutical Benefit if it is not practical for them to
do so.

Key points:

-   Prescribers and pharmacists need to check their State and Territory
    requirements
-   There is no federal/commonwealth requirement for prescribers to send
    the legal paper copy of the prescription to the pharmacy
-   If the patient prefers to receive the legal paper prescription, it
    needs to be mailed to them
-   A pharmacy cannot dispense from a copy provided by the patient
-   Schedule 8 (Dangerous Drugs) and Schedule 4(D) medicines are not
    allowed under these arrangements
-   The prescriber must keep the legal prescription (or a copy of the
    legal prescription) for 2 years from the date of prescribing
-   The hospital pharmacy must keep the copy or digital image of the
    prescription for 2 years from the date of supply
