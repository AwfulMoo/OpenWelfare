This document outlines the AIC Scheme.

Government intent

The AIC Scheme helps families with the extra costs of educating children
when they do not have an appropriate state school close to them.

Assistance for families

Families can receive assistance if they have school-aged children in
primary, secondary or tertiary courses who cannot attend an appropriate
state school due to their geographical isolation, disability or special
needs. Children from as young as age three and a half and up to the age
of 21 may also be eligible in special circumstances.

A range of allowances is available for students who are:

-   boarding away from home
-   living in a second family home that provides daily access to the
    educational institution, or
-   undertaking approved distance education study

Taxation and means testing

AIC payments are not taxed. They are also free of means testing except
for the income tested Additional Boarding Allowance.
