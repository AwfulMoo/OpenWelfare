Accommodation supplement

Permanent residential care recipients will contribute to the cost of
their accommodation if they can afford it. The supplement is paid to
residential aged care services on behalf of care recipients to whom all
of the following apply:

-   They entered care on or after 20 March 2008
-   They cannot pay for some or all of their accommodation costs, and
-   They are eligible for assistance with accommodation costs based on
    an assessment of their financial circumstances

Eligibility

Services Australia assesses the care recipient’s financial circumstances
at the time they enter care. Services Australia do this through 1 of the
following methods:

-   An assets assessment for care recipients who entered care between 20
    March 2008 and 30 June 2014
-   A combined assets and income means assessment for care recipients
    who entered care on or after 1 July 2014

The accommodation supplement paid for an eligible care recipient may be
reduced if:

-   the care recipient entered care between 20 March 2008 and 30 June
    2014, and had net assets over the threshold amount on the day they
    entered care
-   the care recipient entered care from 1 July 2014 and have either net
    assets or income over the relevant threshold

See Aged Care means assessment for more information on these
assessments.

Aged care services are eligible for a higher accommodation supplement if
1 of the following applies:

-   The aged care service was newly built on or after 20 April 2012, or
-   The aged care service was significantly refurbished on or after 20
    April 2012
