|                                   | A customer with a psychiatric     |
|                                   | illness who, because of the       |
|                                   | illness, will not seek medical    |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This customer is also unable to   |
|                                   | meet the mutual obligations       |
|                                   | requirements for JobSeeker        |
|                                   | Payment (JSP) because their       |
|                                   | mental state makes it unlikely    |
|                                   | they will consistently meet the   |
|                                   | reporting requirements for JSP.   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Customers like this could be a    |
|                                   | danger to themselves and/or       |
|                                   | others in a work or training      |
|                                   | situation. Therefore, they are    |
|                                   | unable to work or participate in  |
|                                   | activities designed to improve    |
|                                   | their work prospects.             |
