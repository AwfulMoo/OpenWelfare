| 1                                 | Approval of away from home rate   |
|                                   | where a student must repeat the   |
|                                   | final year of primary school due  |
|                                   | to lack of necessary skills       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Kyeema comes from a remote        |
|                                   | community in South Australia.     |
|                                   | Kyeema completes primary school   |
|                                   | and is approved for the away from |
|                                   | home rate to board at St Brigid's |
|                                   | College to do first year of       |
|                                   | secondary school as there is no   |
|                                   | secondary school within           |
|                                   | reasonable travelling time of     |
|                                   | Kyeema's community.               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | St Brigid's College interviews    |
|                                   | students before starting and      |
|                                   | decide Kyeema lacks the skills to |
|                                   | do secondary level study. Kyeema  |
|                                   | must repeat the last year of      |
|                                   | primary school to progress to     |
|                                   | secondary school in the           |
|                                   | subsequent year.                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Kyeema is approved for the away   |
|                                   | from home rate to do primary      |
|                                   | level study because of the        |
|                                   | approval for away from home rate  |
|                                   | to do secondary school. St        |
|                                   | Brigid's College assessed Kyeema  |
|                                   | as needing to repeat the last     |
|                                   | year of primary school to         |
|                                   | successfully progress to          |
|                                   | secondary school in the next      |
|                                   | year, and St Brigid's College     |
|                                   | delivers primary level study.     |

|                                   | for repeating the final year of   |
|                                   | primary level study at another    |
|                                   | school due to home conditions     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Alkira lives in Wanaaring, New    |
|                                   | South Wales (NSW) and finished    |
|                                   | Year 6, which is the last year of |
|                                   | primary school in NSW. Alkira is  |
|                                   | approved for away from home to    |
|                                   | study secondary level as there is |
|                                   | no school within reasonable       |
|                                   | travelling time/distance of       |
|                                   | Wanaaring. Alkira has relatives   |
|                                   | in South Australia (SA) and the   |
|                                   | family's preference is for Alkira |
|                                   | to stay with them. Alkira enrols  |
|                                   | in Year 7 at a South Australian   |
|                                   | school, which is the last year of |
|                                   | primary school in SA.             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Alkira is repeating the last year |
|                                   | of primary school, but is not     |
|                                   | approved for away from home rate  |
|                                   | because secondary school is       |
|                                   | available in NSW, but the choice  |
|                                   | was to repeat a primary level     |
|                                   | again to access family support.   |
|                                   | Alkira was not required to repeat |
|                                   | primary level by the secondary    |
|                                   | school for which we would pay     |
|                                   | away from home rate to attend.    |

|                                   | under ABSTUDY Policy Chapter 35.  |
|                                   | Balun will do Year 7 at Scotch    |
|                                   | College in SA.                    |

|                                   | The Department of Social Services |
|                                   | has advised that for ABSTUDY      |
|                                   | purposes, Year 7 is considered    |
|                                   | secondary level study at Scotch   |
|                                   | College and St Peter's College in |
|                                   | SA. A student who has completed   |
|                                   | the final year of primary school  |
|                                   | in another state and has a        |
|                                   | scholarship at either Scotch      |
|                                   | College or St Peter's College for |
|                                   | Year 7 is eligible for ABSTUDY    |
|                                   | away from home rate.              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | However, Year 7 at all other      |
|                                   | schools in SA is primary level    |
|                                   | study and away from home rate is  |
|                                   | not approved. Even if a student   |
|                                   | has a qualifying scholarship and  |
|                                   | is doing the last year of primary |
|                                   | school again, the requirements    |
|                                   | for away from home rate are not   |
|                                   | met. This is because there has    |
|                                   | been no approval for away from    |
|                                   | home rate to do secondary study   |
|                                   | at the South Australian school,   |
|                                   | and the secondary school has not  |
|                                   | required the student to repeat    |
|                                   | the last year of primary school   |
|                                   | to access secondary school. The   |
|                                   | student is simply doing the       |
|                                   | age-appropriate school year in    |
|                                   | SA.                               |
