This document outlines the process for adding, changing or removing a
customer's email address from their Centrelink record.

Email addresses

To continue to improve service delivery it is vital that email addresses
for customers are obtained and maintained at every contact.

An email address can only start from the date it is recorded and cannot
be backdated.

[] Customers can update their email address online through their:

-   myGov account via the Update your details service, or
-   Centrelink online account. See Accessing and using Centrelink self
    service

Electronic Messaging (EM)

Customers can get messages via Electronic Messaging. They are
automatically subscribed to this service when they:

-   provide an email address, or
-   update a current email address

Customers may switch to SMS or withdraw from the service at any time.

myGov username, confirmation and recovery emails, and Inbox notifications

[] Tell customers that updating their details with Centrelink will not
update their myGov account. They must update their myGov account details
separately.

Transfer of customer information between programs

Tell customers that information used for their Centrelink, Child Support
and Medicare payments and services is not routinely transferred within
Services Australia. To update relevant information the customer:

-   may need to contact each of these programs separately, or
-   [] use the myGov Update your details service

The Resources page contains information about valid characters for an
email address, as well as the rules that apply to the format of an email
address.
