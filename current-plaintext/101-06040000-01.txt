This document outlines LIC eligibility criteria and concessions
available to LIC holders.

LIC entitlement

The LIC entitles the customer and their dependents (their partner and
any Family Tax Benefit (FTB) children or regular care children) to
Commonwealth health concessions such as cheaper pharmaceuticals. The LIC
is granted for a period of 12 months unless entitlement is lost.

Eligibility for a LIC

To qualify for a LIC the customer must be in Australia in order to lodge
a valid claim and satisfy the residence requirements and the Health Care
Card (HCC) income test. LIC is not subject to an assets test. Customers
currently entitled to other concession cards may also apply for a LIC.

Low Income Health Care Cards have no age specific requirements. Normally
children under 16 would be included on parents or guardians FTB
eligibility. The exception are foster children residing in an Approved
Care Organisation (ACO).

A child who is a foster child, ward of the state, refugee or orphan and
is in the care of an institution such as an ACO, is not in the care of
an individual who is an Australian resident.

Children in the care of organisations are able to qualify for a LIC in
their own right as long as no individual is being paid FTB for the care
of the child.

Dependants must meet certain age qualifications to be eligible on their
parent's LIC card claimants in receipt of a Prescribed Education Payment
are eligible to claim LIC regardless of their status as a dependent.
These payments are:

-   VCES
-   Postgraduate Awards Scheme

New Enterprise Incentive Scheme (NEIS) customers who do not receive an
income support payment may also be eligible for a LIC and should be
advised to claim a LIC. See New Enterprise Incentive Scheme (NEIS) for
further information.

Note: the Disaster Recovery Allowance (DRA) does not automatically issue
the customer a Health Care Card (HCC). For this reason staff should be
inviting customers applying for, or who have been granted a Disaster
Income Recovery Subsidy (DIRS), to claim a LIC

Express Plus Centrelink mobile app

Customers can use the digital wallet in the app to display their current
LIC. Expired concession cards will remain in the digital wallet for 28
days after expiry and display with EXPIRED across the digital card. The
digital wallet will display all cards that the customer is eligible to
receive. Concession providers may use the digital concession card at
their discretion.

The Resources page contains links to forms, the LIC income test,
concessions available for LIC cardholders and A guide to concession
cards (CO153) brochure.
