This document outlines when to create and print aged care manual
letters.

Creating manual letters

See Aged care letters for information on letters types and systems.

Generate manual letters:

from ACMPS via manual letter generation

using approved templates on Centrelink - Aged care letter templates
including:

-   Requests for information for means assessments and financial
    hardship assessments
-   Letters advising outcomes for financial hardship assessments

Manual letters will also be issued by:

-   Aged Care Programme Branch, when requested
-   QR/DEA skilled staff when completing manual calculations
-   Aged care staff when instructed by ICT

Pre entry letters will not issue automatically for pre entry means
assessments completed by care recipients who:

-   are currently in care and looking at moving to a new provider
-   are grand parented and are considering opting in to the new scheme,
    or
-   have received a pre entry letter with the same resident status in
    the last 120 days and require an extension of the assessment

See the Resources page for aged care letter codes and descriptions table
for letter types, the system that issues them and the system to upload
them to.

Request for information (RFI) letters

Use the RFI letter to request specific information or documents for:

new aged care means assessments:

-   to verify circumstances and request evidence that cannot be obtained
    verbally, or
-   the care recipient has requested a letter

current means assessments:

-   to verify a change in circumstances

aged care financial hardship assessments:

-   to verify circumstances and request evidence

Financial hardship letters

When a care recipient applies for Aged Care Financial Hardship
(Hardship) assistance, issue letters to:

-   request further information
-   notify the outcome of a hardship assessment

The Resources page contains links to the aged care letter codes and
descriptions table, letter templates and a list of the documents to
