This file is for historical assessments/information only.

This document outlines the cancellation, suspension and rejection codes
for Sickness Allowance (SA). The Centrelink system uses codes to record
the reason for a decision to cancel or suspend a payment, or to reject a
claim. The code used will determine the appropriate advice issued to the
customer about the decision. The list of codes is not publicly
available.

Automatic and manual actions

Some of these actions occurred automatically due to an update being made
to the customer's circumstances (for example, return to full-time work
or expiration of a medical certificate). Others are coded manually.

Sickness Allowance (SA) decisions were recorded in the Newstart (NSS)
system.

The Process page contains a table with the cancellation, suspension and
rejection codes for SA.
