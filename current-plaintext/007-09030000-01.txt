Leave Payment (PPL) and rejecting PPL claims.

Payment processing

A change in circumstances may mean the customer is no longer eligible
for PPL.PPL can be cancelled automatically after details are updated on
the system. In some cases manual cancellation using the relevant PPL
cancellation code is required. In certain circumstances PPL can be
restored without the need to claim if eligibility can been
re-established. When the full entitlement of PPL is paid, the payment is
cancelled for the reason of End of payment (EOP) and this reason cannot
be restored.

information is provided. If a customer does not meet the eligibility
criteria, the claim is rejected. This is generally done automatically
when the claim is processed but in some cases a manual rejection may be
required using the relevant PPL rejection code.
