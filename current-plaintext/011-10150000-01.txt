This document outlines what forms are available for the AIR, where to
access them and how they are used.

AIR forms

The quickest and easiest way for vaccination providers to record
immunisation information on the AIR is online using the AIR site or
their Practice Management Software (PMS). Service Officers should
recommend that vaccination providers record immunisation information
using online options.

All AIR forms for vaccination providers are available on the Services
Australia website. The Resources page has a link.

AIR forms are in PDF format and can be downloaded and completed on a
device, or printed and completed by hand.

Links to AIR forms are on the Resources page.

Note: AIR stationery order forms are no longer available for vaccination
providers. AIR Service Officers should advise vaccination providers they
can obtain AIR forms online or record immunisation information using the
AIR site or their PMS.

The Resources page contains troubleshooting tips, standard comments,
escalation process tables and FAQs.
