This document outlines how to conduct a Parenting Payment Single (PPS)
compulsory participation interview. The interview is completed for PPS
customers who have compulsory mutual obligation requirements when their
youngest child turns 6 years of age.

Compulsory participation requirements

It becomes compulsory for PPS customers to agree to a Job Plan and
undertake activities to meet mutual obligation requirements when their
youngest child turns 6 years of age.

The system will automatically book an appropriate interview for
identified customers. The interview is conducted by phone.

If the customer does not attend the compulsory participation interview
and enter into a Job Plan, their Parenting Payment may be cancelled.

Information covered in interview

At the compulsory participation interview, the following information is
covered:

-   assess the customer's current circumstances, for example, is the
    customer currently working or studying at least 30 hours per
    fortnight

    requirements
