-   section 54C, Days to which the percentage of care applies if section

-   section 54D, Rounding of a percentage of care
-   section 54F, Determination must be revoked if there is a change to

The following sections of the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 (the
Act) revoke the previous care percentage:

-   section 54F, revokes existing care where the new care percentage
    will affect the cost percentage
-   section 54G, revokes existing care in Below Regular care decisions.
    Defines Below Regular care retrospective powers
-   section 54H, revokes existing care where the new care percentage
    will not affect the cost percentage

All new care decisions are then made under one of the following two
sections of the Act:

-   section 49, the person’s care percentage is 0%

or

-   section 50, the person’s care percentage is anything other than 0%
    (i.e. 1% - 100%)

Interim care decisions are made under the following sections of the Act:

section 51, the actual care differs from the care arrangement and the
person with reduced care is taking reasonable action to ensure the care
arrangement is complied with. Section 51 also applies to actual care in
special circumstances where a parent is withholding care due to a
substantial risk to the wellbeing of the child. Examples include:

-   withholding essential medical care from the child
-   substantially failing to comply with legal schooling requirement
-   neglecting the child’s basic needs

section 52, the actual care differs from the care arrangement and the
person with reduced care is taking reasonable action to seek a new care
arrangement which is more than actual care but less than the existing
care arrangement, and there are special circumstances. In this context,
special circumstances refer to situations where the parent could not
continue to have the previous level of care. Examples include:

-   serious medical problems relating to the child or parents
-   one parent has moved a substantial distance away from their previous
    home without making care arrangements with the other parent for the
    child

section 53, must also be considered when making an interim care decision
in that if special circumstances apply, the interim period can be
extended from 14 weeks up to a maximum of 26 weeks. Special
circumstances in this context include situations out of the ordinary
where the resolution of care issues are delayed. For example:

-   a parent may have travelled overseas with a child without the
    consent of the other parent
