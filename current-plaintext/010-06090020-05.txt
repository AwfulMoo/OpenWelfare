|                                   |     example, if Dominique advises |
|                                   |     that the absence from school  |
|                                   |     was because of bullying from  |
|                                   |     other students, it may be     |
|                                   |     appropriate to make a         |

|                                   |     approved by the school are    |
|                                   |     not counted as unapproved     |
|                                   |     absences. If it is believed   |
|                                   |     that the unapproved absences  |
|                                   |     should have been recorded by  |

|                                   |     should discuss this with the  |
|                                   |     school. If the school changes |

|                                   |     absences to approved          |
