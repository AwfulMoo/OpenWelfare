| Item                              | Example                           |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Inappropriate claim for JobSeeker |
|                                   | Payment (JSP)                     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Virginia is a single person who   |
|                                   | has a 6 year old child in their   |
|                                   | custody. Virginia attends a new   |
|                                   | claim appointment on 4 April with |
|                                   | a completed claim for JobSeeker   |
|                                   | Payment (JSP). The Service        |
|                                   | Officer realises that it is more  |
|                                   | beneficial for Virginia to claim  |
|                                   | Parenting Payment Single (PPS). A |
|                                   | PPS claim form is issued, and a   |
|                                   | new claim appointment is booked   |
|                                   | for Virginia early next week.     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | At the PPS new claim appointment, |
|                                   | the claim is accepted and the new |
|                                   | claim for PPS is deemed to have   |
|                                   | been made on 4 April.             |

| 2                                 | Inappropriate claim for Youth     |
|                                   | Allowance (YA)                    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Bob is 24 years of age and        |
|                                   | submits an online claim for Youth |
|                                   | Allowance (YA) on 24 January. Bob |
|                                   | is turning 25 years of age on 26  |
|                                   | January and will be commencing    |
|                                   | full time study on 2 February.    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | When the Service Officer assesses |
|                                   | the claim they realise that Bob   |
|                                   | should have lodged a claim for    |
|                                   | Austudy. They reject the YA       |
|                                   | claim, and code an Austudy new    |
|                                   | claim. There is no requirement    |
|                                   | for Bob to complete a new claim   |
|                                   | (either paper or online) as the   |
|                                   | information already supplied will |
|                                   | be sufficient for the Austudy     |
|                                   | claim. The Service Officer should |
|                                   | check what other information that |
|                                   | the Online Claim requested Bob to |
|                                   | provide as some of it may no      |
|                                   | longer be required, for example   |
|                                   | verification of independence.     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The Austudy claim would be        |
|                                   | granted from 2 February when Bob  |
|                                   | commences his full time study,    |
|                                   | which is the same eligibility     |
|                                   | date as YA.                       |
