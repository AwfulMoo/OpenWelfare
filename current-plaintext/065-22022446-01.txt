This document outlines resident status corrections, manual calculations
and letters after a resident status correction.

Correction to care recipient’s resident status

The care recipient’s resident status (for example, low means or not low
means) determines the fee structure including accommodation costs. It is
set based on the care recipient’s circumstances on the date they enter
permanent care. See Aged care means assessment.

When the resident status is determined and fees set in the System for
the Payment of Aged Residential Care (SPARC), initial fee letters are
issued to advise the aged care fees, including accommodation payment
arrangements.

See Aged care letter codes and descriptions for details of letters sent.

Correction to care recipient’s resident status – post 1 July 2014

If a reassessment of income and/or assets (from the date of entry into
permanent care), changes the care recipient’s resident status, SPARC:

-   adjusts the fees for a care recipient either from an ad hoc review
    or at the next quarterly review (QR)
-   calculates any refunds due at the next QR
-   adjusts subsidies and supplements paid to the provider in their
    monthly claim from the month the change updates in SPARC
-   does not automatically send new initial fee letters

Resident status change from low means to not low means

When the resident status changes to not low means (due to reassessment
of income and/or assets) the care recipient is not entitled to any
assistance with their accommodation costs:

If identified at QR:

-   a new initial fee letter is manually sent to advise the care
    recipient and providers of the corrected resident status
-   the care recipient is liable to negotiate their own accommodation
    costs

If identified outside of QR:

-   a request for a manual letter is escalated to ACPB for completion
-   an MTCF is not backdated
-   see the Resources page for a link to email template to send a
    request for a manual letter

Correction to care recipient’s resident status – pre 1 July 2014

If a new or reassessment of assets (effective on the date of entry into
permanent care), changes the care recipient’s resident status, SPARC:

-   requires a manual update of the changed assessed assets amount
-   adjusts any accommodation charge for a care recipient
-   adjusts subsidies and supplements paid to the provider in their
    monthly claim from the month the change updates in SPARC
-   may automatically send a letter advising of daily accommodation
    charge changes
