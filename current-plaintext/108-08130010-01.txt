This document outlines information on the commencement of payment
deductions to be made to a state or territory Housing Authority (HA).

Deductions from payments

Service Australia customers who receive payments from which Rent
Deduction Scheme (RDS) deductions can be made, can voluntarily agree to
have their government housing payments automatically deducted from their
Centrelink payment. These deductions can be for:

-   payment of rent
-   repayment of HA loans
-   payment of HA arrears
-   payment of other debts owing to a HA

Processing a new deduction

HAs are responsible for processing new deduction authorities and
variations to current deduction amounts. Customers requesting to start,
increase or decrease deductions should be directed to their HA.

HAs need to collect customer consent before commencing a new deduction.
The HA then electronically sends a new instruction transaction to the
agency.

If a HA experiences problems commencing a deduction for a customer, the
HA can contact the National Business Gateway - Confirmation Services
Helpdesk for assistance.

The Resources page contains a link to the contact details for National
Business Gateway.
