This document outlines how to help a person access non-personal
information or documents held by Services Australia. This is information
about the agency, payments and services it delivers.

Information Publication Scheme (IPS)

Under the IPS, the agency is required to publish a range of information
on its website, including:

-   IPS Plan
-   who we are - for example, organisation structure, statutory
    appointments
-   what we do - for example, payments and services we deliver, service
    commitments, priorities and key strategies, legislation
    administered, policy consultation, government initiatives
-   publications and resources - for example, annual reports, budget,
    finance, facts and figures, reports and responses to parliament
-   Freedom of Information (FOI) Disclosure Log (documents released
    under FOI since 2010)

Freedom of Information (FOI) requests

To request access to non-personal information not published under the
IPS, a request must be made in writing. These must be forwarded to the
FOI Team.

If a person makes an FOI request, the FOI Team must:

-   acknowledge the request within 14 days of receipt within the agency
-   notify the applicant of a decision on access to the documents within
    30 days. This can be extended in certain circumstances (the FOI Team
    will contact the applicant about any extension of time).

The Resources page contains links to relevant information on the
Services Australia website.
