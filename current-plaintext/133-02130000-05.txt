| 1                                 | Question: What is PRODA?          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | ‏Answer: Provider Digital Access   |
|                                   | (PRODA) is an online              |
|                                   | authentication system based on a  |
|                                   | username, password and            |
|                                   | verification code to log on. The  |
|                                   | system is designed to provide     |
|                                   | secure access to specific         |
|                                   | Government services using one log |
|                                   | on method. PRODA is digital,      |
|                                   | portable, and does not need       |
|                                   | additional hardware or software   |
|                                   | installed. Users can change and   |
|                                   | manage their account details      |
|                                   | online in PRODA including         |
|                                   | changing name or contact details. |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Specific government services will |
|                                   | gradually be added to PRODA, so   |
|                                   | access to these services will     |
|                                   | only require one authentication   |
|                                   | method.                           |

| 2                                 | Question: Is PRODA secure?        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: Yes. It is a unique       |
|                                   | username and password that uses a |
|                                   | verification code. The PRODA      |
|                                   | account allows access to services |
|                                   | that involve personal and         |
|                                   | financial information.            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | It is important the agency        |
|                                   | correctly verifies a user's       |
|                                   | identity and that they do not     |
|                                   | share their log on details with   |
|                                   | anyone else because their PRODA   |
|                                   | account may allow access to       |
|                                   | services that involve personal    |
|                                   | and financial information. It is  |
|                                   | important that users do not share |
|                                   | their username and password with  |
|                                   | anybody.                          |

| 3                                 | Question: Who can create a PRODA  |
|                                   | account?                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: Anyone can register for a |
|                                   | PRODA account. It is important    |
|                                   | that each person has their own    |
|                                   | account because their PRODA       |
|                                   | account may allow access to       |
|                                   | services that involve personal    |
|                                   | and financial information.        |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 4                                 | Question: Can a user have more    |
|                                   | than one PRODA account?           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: No. Once their identity   |
|                                   | has been verified the system will |
|                                   | not allow their identity          |
|                                   | documents to be used again.       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Note: email addresses and mobile  |
|                                   | phone numbers are also unique to  |
|                                   | an account. Once a user has       |
|                                   | verified an email address or      |
|                                   | mobile phone number, they will    |
|                                   | not be able to use them for       |
|                                   | another account.                  |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 5                                 | Question: Can I share my PRODA    |
|                                   | account logon details?            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | ‏Answer: No. It is important that  |
|                                   | each person must have their own   |
|                                   | account and not share their logon |
|                                   | details with anyone.              |

| 6                                 | Question: Why do I need to verify |
|                                   | my identity again?                |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | ‏Answer: The new solution          |
|                                   | requires a greater level of       |
|                                   | security. The agency needs to     |
|                                   | ensure a high level of certainty  |
|                                   | that the person performing the    |
|                                   | transaction is correct and the    |
|                                   | agency knows who they are.        |

|                                   | their PRODA account using a       |
|                                   | smartphone or tablet?             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: Yes. Although some        |
|                                   | services will not display         |
|                                   | correctly on a mobile device as   |
|                                   | they may not be optimised for use |
|                                   | on a smartphone and may be        |
|                                   | difficult to navigate.            |

| 8                                 | Question: Why does PRODA require  |
|                                   | verification codes?               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: In addition to a username |
|                                   | and password, verification codes  |
|                                   | provide an additional layer of    |
|                                   | security to the account.          |

|                                   | sent the user a verification      |
|                                   | code, but they have not received  |
|                                   | it, what can they do?             |

|                                   | later?                            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: They can link to their    |
|                                   | online services within PRODA at a |
|                                   | later date. They simply log on to |
|                                   | PRODA, go to the My communities   |
|                                   | screen, select the relevant tile  |
|                                   | and search for their registration |

|                                   | The user can delay linking until  |
|                                   | later, however this will restrict |
|                                   | the services the user can access. |

| Item                              | FAQ                               |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Question: How do users confirm    |
|                                   | their identity?                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: The new solution requires |
|                                   | a greater level of security. The  |
|                                   | agency needs to ensure a high     |
|                                   | level of certainty that the       |
|                                   | person performing the transaction |
|                                   | is correct and the agency knows   |
|                                   | who they are. As this is a new    |
|                                   | system, users are still required  |
|                                   | to complete the Your Identity     |
|                                   | process, even if they are known   |
|                                   | to the agency.                    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | When setting up an account there  |
|                                   | is a requirement that the agency  |
|                                   | verifies their identity through   |
|                                   | the Document Verification Service |
|                                   | (DVS).                            |

|                                   | want to use, can they still use   |
|                                   | it to verify their identity?      |

|                                   | their change of name online due   |
|                                   | to a lack of information held by  |

|                                   | to add their Medicare provider    |
|                                   | number so that they are given     |
|                                   | access in the system to clinical  |
|                                   | functions and patient data. Users |
|                                   | should refer to the drop down     |

|                                   | what type of numbers the agency   |
|                                   | is referring to. If they have a   |
|                                   | number that is not on this list,  |
|                                   | it means they do not need it.     |

| 5                                 | Question: The system says the     |
|                                   | user's number/identifier does not |
|                                   | match, what do they do?           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: It is possible that there |
|                                   | are some discrepancies in the     |
|                                   | data the agency holds about them  |
|                                   | in different areas of the agency. |
|                                   | For example, the personal         |
|                                   | information they have entered for |
|                                   | this account may be different to  |
|                                   | the data saved against their      |
|                                   | Medicare provider number          |
|                                   | registration due to a change in   |
|                                   | circumstances or timing.          |
|                                   | Therefore, they may not be able   |
|                                   | to link all numbers in every      |
|                                   | case.                             |

|                                   | If a match cannot be found for    |
|                                   | the number but they are sure they |
|                                   | entered the number correctly and  |
|                                   | it has been issued to them, they  |
|                                   | should select the checkbox to     |

|                                   | advising what kind of number it   |
|                                   | is or which area of the agency    |
|                                   | issued it (e.g. Medicare provider |
|                                   | number).                          |

|                                   | nominated for both authentication |
|                                   | methods, the delegate will need   |
|                                   | to provide both RA numbers to the |
|                                   | provider. The delegate will       |

|                                   | account until the registered      |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: Due to the large number   |

|                                   | This will ensure that every       |
|                                   | provider can access myplace when  |
|                                   | it comes online in July.          |

|                                   | PRODA account, do I need to       |
