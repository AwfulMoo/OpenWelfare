This document outlines the privacy laws and guidelines that staff must
adhere to while performing their duties, specifically when assessing a
customer's entitlement to Youth Allowance (YA).

Assessment of entitlement

Income of parents, guardians and/or siblings are used in determining
qualification and rate payable for YA. As a result, information supplied
for one customer may be used when assessing another customer's
entitlement. Under the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) as contained
in the Privacy Act 1988, customers are advised on forms that the
information they provide on the form will be used to decide correct
payments and suitability for services for themselves and, where
relevant, third parties.

Change in circumstance affecting other member of the family

Staff are also bound by the privacy laws and guidelines about disclosing
information. So, where information is obtained about a change in
circumstances for one member of the family and this affects the rate of
payment to another member of the family, care must be taken, when
advising the customer of the change, to release only the minimum
necessary details about the change in circumstances of the third party.
