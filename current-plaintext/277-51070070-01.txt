This document outlines how the Maintenance Action Test (MAT) can be
satisfied by Family Tax Benefit (FTB) customers when there is no
arrangement in place to receive child support for a Stage 1 child.

Stage 1 non private child support arrangement

The MAT can be satisfied by collecting any amount of child support for a
Stage 1 child if there is no court order or court registered agreement
for child support. Child support details should initially be verbally
provided by customers.

Customers may not be able to make a private arrangement because:

-   it is unknown where the parent is living
-   the customer does not wish to contact the parent
-   the parent cannot afford to pay child support
-   the parent refuses to pay child support
-   evidence of parentage cannot be obtained

To satisfy the MAT, customers must either:

-   seek a court order for child support
-   seek legal help to obtain proof of parentage
-   provide legal advice that a court order or evidence of parentage
    cannot be obtained
-   apply for and be granted an exemption from seeking child support
-   if a customer advises a change in child support details for a Stage
    1 child, both action taken to obtain child support and maintenance
    income should be checked
