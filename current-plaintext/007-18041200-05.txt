P24845 problem and workaround

The P24845 system issue may impact in the following scenarios:

-   A step parent is claiming Family Tax Benefit (FTB) that has been
    transferred to them from a biological parent, and the other
    biological parent also becomes entitled to receive FTB, for example
    their percentage of care increases to above 35%, and they make a
    claim
-   The biological parent transfers their FTB to a step parent and they
    later separate. Care details for the child will not be transferred
    correctly to Child Support if a past period care refresh is
    requested
-   The care may transfer to the step parent's child support record
    (with incorrect child relationship details) causing inaccurate child
    support assessments and impacting multiple parties

As a result, if FTB is transferred out to partner ('TOP' is coded on the
Child Override/Claim (CHOC) screen - from parent to step parent) and the
customer is a Centrelink and Child Support mutual customer, these
records are to be referred for investigation. See the Resources page of
Notification and assessment of shared care arrangements for Family Tax
Benefit (FTB) for further information, including details of the
workaround and recording of Display on Access (DOA) DOCs.

Determining the date of effect (DOE) for the transfer from PPS to PPP or cancellation of PPS

Notification reporter

Table 1: this table provides details on determining the DOE for a
notification reporter when transferring to PPP, or when the customer is
no longer qualified for PP due to the age of the child or residency
(where the lone parent criterion was applied to grant single rate of
PP).

Note: the date of event (DOV) = the date the customer became partnered.

PP online and assisted customer claim workflows and completion order

Table 4: this table describes the most common staff workflows that will
be presented in the Parenting Payment (PP) Social Application (claim
workflow) and the order in which they must be actioned.

Other workflows may display based on the customer's circumstances. For
example, 'Refer to Complex Assessment Officer' or 'Generate Compliance
Action'. Any additional workflows are a trigger that further action may
be required. Further processing must be completed in Workspace.
