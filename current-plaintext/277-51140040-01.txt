This document outlines information about the Child Support Statutory
Declaration forms (CS4649 and CS4648) and how they can be used by
customers to provide evidence of parentage for an application for child
support.

Completion of forms

The CS4649 form can be completed by a parent to declare that they are
the child's parent.

If a parent wishes to declare that they and the other person named in
their application are named as a parent of the child(ren) in the
register of births, the form CS4648 should be used.

The Resources page contains a link to the Statutory Declaration forms
(CS4649 and CS4648) on the Services Australia website.

Witness required

The person completing the form needs to sign and complete the
declaration in the presence of an authorised witness who must also sign
the form and provide their name, qualification to be a witness, and
address. A list of authorised witnesses is on the form.

A witness is not required to sight a birth certificate or another form
of evidence before signing the form.

A witness for a statutory declaration should:

-   check the identity of the person making the statutory declaration
-   check to the extent possible, that the person is competent to make
    the statutory declaration
-   remind the person that he or she will be claiming that the
    statements in the declaration (and any attachments) are true and
    that there are penalties for making false statements
-   check that the form does not contain any blanks

For more information about Commonwealth statutory declarations refer to
the Attorney-General website. The Resources page has a link.
