Income thresholds and CCS percentage

Table 1: this table shows the Child Care Subsidy (CCS) percentage a
family is entitled to receive based on their combined family income.

^ Income brackets are subject to CPI at the beginning of each financial
year.

These amounts may not be current. They are examples only. For current
payments, see Rates and thresholds.

Customers can still claim CCS even if their family income estimate is
equal to or above the higher income limit. If they actually earn less
than this, the subsidy they are entitled to receive will be paid at
reconciliation.

Note: the above percentages are Standard Rates. From 7 March 2022,
families with multiple children in care aged 5 or under may receive an
increased CCS rate up to 30% higher for eligible children, capped at
95%. This is known as Multiple Child Subsidy. For more information, see
Entitlement to Child Care Subsidy (CCS).

Scenarios - applying the annual subsidy cap for the 2020/2021 financial year

Table 2: this table provides examples of how and when the annual subsidy
cap was applied. The figures quoted below are correct for 2020/2021
financial year and are used for demonstration purposes.

^ Hourly rate caps, annual subsidy caps and income thresholds are
subject to CPI changes prior to the commencement of each new CCS year.

From 10 December 2021, the CCS annual cap for the 2021/22 financial year
(1 July 2021 - 30 June 2022) onwards was removed. Families who reached
the annual cap prior to 10 December 2021 were paid any CCS entitlement
owed to them in December 2021.

Note: families may still be subject to the annual cap for financial
years prior to the 2021/22 financial year

|                                   | $250,000 (Cara $190,000 and Jono  |
|                                   | $60,000), therefore they are      |
|                                   | subject to the annual subsidy     |
|                                   | cap. During the financial year,   |

|                                   | purposes of CCS and has been paid |
|                                   | $7,000 for each child at the time |
|                                   | of separation.                    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | When Cara notifies of their       |
|                                   | separation, CCS is reassessed     |
|                                   | based on Cara's individual        |
|                                   | circumstances. As Cara's income   |
|                                   | is above the salary cap           |
|                                   | threshold, Cara can be paid the   |
|                                   | remainder of the annual subsidy   |
|                                   | cap ($3,650^) per child. If Cara  |
|                                   | updates the income estimate and   |
|                                   | the new estimate falls below the  |
|                                   | annual cap threshold, there will  |
|                                   | be no cap on the amount of CCS    |
|                                   | Cara can be paid for the rest of  |
|                                   | the year.                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If Jono wishes to claim CCS, Jono |
|                                   | will need to make a separate      |
|                                   | claim and Jono's entitlement to   |
|                                   | CCS will be based on Jono's       |
|                                   | estimated income and activity     |
|                                   | test. If Jono’s income is above   |
|                                   | the annual salary cap threshold,  |
|                                   | Jono could receive up to $10,560^ |
|                                   | for the remainder of the CCS      |
|                                   | year. If the income is below the  |
|                                   | threshold, the annual cap will    |
|                                   | not apply. That is, previous      |
|                                   | amounts paid to Cara are not      |
|                                   | relevant to Jono’s entitlement.   |

|                                   | children. As IHC is provided at   |
|                                   | the family level the enrolment    |
|                                   | notice submitted by the IHC       |
|                                   | service will only be for one      |
|                                   | child, in this instance Zander.   |
|                                   | The session reports submitted to  |

|                                   | level will be linked to Zander’s  |
|                                   | record.                           |

|                                   | As Sam and David are subject to   |
|                                   | the annual subsidy cap, once this |
|                                   | is reached for Zander, the IHC    |
|                                   | service will lodge a new          |
|                                   | enrolment for Ryder. Sam will     |
|                                   | need to confirm the enrolment     |
|                                   | notice for Ryder before CCS can   |
|                                   | again be paid. The family         |
|                                   | attendance information will       |
|                                   | continue to be submitted and will |
|                                   | now be linked to Ryder’s record.  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The same process would apply for  |
|                                   | Holly once the annual subsidy cap |
|                                   | is reached for Ryder.             |
