| 1                                 | Veronica is receiving Austudy as  |

|                                   | ...                               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Veronica commences a 3 year       |
|                                   | degree at the beginning of 2015   |
|                                   | (subjects are semester based)     |
|                                   | which is expected to finish at    |
|                                   | the end of 2017. If no previous   |
|                                   | study at the same level impacts,  |
|                                   | the allowable time would be the   |
|                                   | minimum time for that course plus |
|                                   | half an academic year: 3.5 years. |
|                                   | However, at the 3.5 year point,   |
|                                   | allowable time has been reached   |
|                                   | but not exceeded. This means      |
|                                   | Veronica may be paid for another  |
|                                   | half academic year and up to the  |
|                                   | day before the next study period  |
|                                   | if she continues full time study  |
|                                   | past this point. In this example, |
|                                   | Veronica's allowable time will be |
|                                   | exceeded on the day before        |
|                                   | semester 1, 2019.                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If Veronica was receiving Youth   |
|                                   | Allowance, she would not be able  |
|                                   | to exceed her allowable time and  |
|                                   | would only be payable until the   |
|                                   | end of the semester where she     |
|                                   | meets the 3.5 year point: the end |
|                                   | of semester 1, 2018.              |

|                                   | In February 2018, Jerry commences |
|                                   | a tertiary course with a normal   |
|                                   | duration of one year. If there is |
|                                   | no impacting previous study, this |
|                                   | means his allowable time for the  |
|                                   | course is one year. Jerry is able |
|                                   | to exceed the allowable time for  |
|                                   | an entire study period, and be    |
|                                   | paid during this time.            |

|                                   | the study period for the second   |
|                                   | half of 2019 commences (e.g. 1    |
|                                   | July 2019).                       |

|                                   | a year, Jerry will be payable for |
|                                   | the duration of 2019, and will    |
|                                   | cease to be payable on the day    |

|                                   | studies for one semester to allow |
|                                   | her time to reassess her          |

|                                   | consider the length of the        |

|                                   | of Australia, an 84 week TGD      |
|                                   | level approved course. Dan        |
|                                   | previously completed the Diploma  |
|                                   | of Community Services with the    |
|                                   | same RTO, an approved full time   |
|                                   | TGD level course for 60 weeks in  |
|                                   | 2018. IKON Institute of Australia |
|                                   | does not have set study periods.  |
|                                   | As Dan's current course is 84     |
|                                   | weeks in length, the allowable    |
|                                   | time will be 84 weeks plus half   |
|                                   | an academic year, in this case 26 |
|                                   | weeks taking it through until 110 |
|                                   | weeks, at which point he will     |
|                                   | meet allowable time but not       |
|                                   | exceed.                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Dan's previous study has to be    |
|                                   | included when assessing his       |
|                                   | allowable time. As he has already |
|                                   | completed 60 weeks, once he       |
|                                   | completes half an academic year   |
|                                   | (26 weeks) he will have completed |
|                                   | 86 weeks at the same level. As    |
|                                   | this is less than 110 weeks, he   |
|                                   | can continue to be paid for the   |
|                                   | next 26 weeks. At this point he   |
|                                   | will have reached 112 weeks of    |
|                                   | study which will exceed the 110   |
|                                   | allowable time weeks. Thus, Dan   |
|                                   | could be paid for 52 weeks of the |
|                                   | 84 week course before he exceeds  |
|                                   | the allowable time.               |

Student Programme Resource Tool

The Student Programme Resource Tool contains useful reference
information and links. It includes:

-   Allowable Time Calculator
-   Distance Education & Private Provider Date Calculator
-   Long Term Income Support Calculator

The tool can only be used to assist with Allowable Time Assessments if
all study undertaken at the Institution is studied under the current
Term/Semester structure. If the student has studied at the same
institution under different structures the tool will not be able to
assist with the assessment for study within the previous structure. A
manual allowable time assessment is required.
