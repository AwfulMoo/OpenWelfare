| 1                                 | Veronica is receiving Austudy as  |

|                                   | ...                               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Veronica commences a 3 year       |
|                                   | degree at the beginning of 2015   |
|                                   | (subjects are semester based)     |
|                                   | which is expected to finish at    |
|                                   | the end of 2017. If no previous   |
|                                   | study at the same level impacts,  |
|                                   | the allowable time would be the   |
|                                   | minimum time for that course plus |
|                                   | half an academic year: 3.5 years. |
|                                   | However, at the 3.5 year point,   |
|                                   | allowable time has been reached   |
|                                   | but not exceeded. This means      |
|                                   | Veronica may be paid for another  |
|                                   | half academic year and up to the  |
|                                   | day before the next study period  |
|                                   | if she continues full time study  |
|                                   | past this point. In this example, |
|                                   | Veronica's allowable time will be |
|                                   | exceeded on the day before        |
|                                   | semester 1, 2019.                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If Veronica was receiving Youth   |
|                                   | Allowance, she would not be able  |
|                                   | to exceed her allowable time and  |
|                                   | would only be payable until the   |
|                                   | end of the semester where she     |
|                                   | meets the 3.5 year point: the end |
|                                   | of semester 1, 2018.              |

|                                   | In February 2018, Jerry commences |
|                                   | a tertiary course with a normal   |
|                                   | duration of one year. If there is |
|                                   | no impacting previous study, this |
|                                   | means his allowable time for the  |
|                                   | course is one year. Jerry is able |
|                                   | to exceed the allowable time for  |
|                                   | an entire study period, and be    |
|                                   | paid during this time.            |

|                                   | the study period for the second   |
|                                   | half of 2019 commences (e.g. 1    |

|                                   | studies for one semester to allow |
|                                   | her time to reassess her          |

|                                   | of Australia, an 84 week TGD      |
|                                   | level approved course. Dan        |
|                                   | previously completed the Diploma  |
|                                   | of Community Services with the    |
|                                   | same RTO, an approved full time   |
|                                   | TGD level course for 60 weeks in  |
|                                   | 2018. IKON Institute of Australia |
|                                   | does not have set study periods.  |
|                                   | As Dan's current course is 84     |
|                                   | weeks in length, the allowable    |
|                                   | time will be 84 weeks plus half   |
|                                   | an academic year, in this case 26 |
|                                   | weeks taking it through until 110 |
|                                   | weeks, at which point he will     |
|                                   | meet allowable time but not       |
|                                   | exceed.                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Dan's previous study has to be    |
|                                   | included when assessing his       |
|                                   | allowable time. As he has already |
|                                   | completed 60 weeks, once he       |
|                                   | completes half an academic year   |
|                                   | (26 weeks) he will have completed |
|                                   | 86 weeks at the same level. As    |
|                                   | this is less than 110 weeks, he   |
|                                   | can continue to be paid for the   |
|                                   | next 26 weeks. At this point he   |
|                                   | will have reached 112 weeks of    |
|                                   | study which will exceed the 110   |
|                                   | allowable time weeks. Thus, Dan   |
|                                   | could be paid for 52 weeks of the |
|                                   | 84 week course before he exceeds  |
|                                   | the allowable time.               |

|                                   | Therefore as at both 15 January   |
|                                   | 2023 and 20 February 2023,        |
|                                   | Anthony has not reached the       |
|                                   | allowable time for the course and |
|                                   | continues to satisfy the          |
|                                   | satisfactory progress rules for   |
|                                   | Austudy in Semester 1, 2023.      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The proof of enrolment lodged by  |
|                                   | Anthony confirms they are         |
|                                   | undertaking 0.375 EFTSL in        |
|                                   | Semester 1, 2023 and 0.375 EFTSL  |
|                                   | in Semester 2, 2023. As this      |
|                                   | study load is considered to be    |
|                                   | 75% of the normal amount of       |
|                                   | full-time study for each          |
|                                   | semester, the Assessing           |
|                                   | satisfactory progress for         |
|                                   | tertiary students for Austudy     |
|                                   | procedure states it is considered |
|                                   | to be 100% of the study load for  |
|                                   | each semester. That is 0.500      |
|                                   | EFTSL in each semester.           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | As Anthony has already enrolled   |
|                                   | for the whole year, the next      |
|                                   | satisfactory progress assessment  |
|                                   | point is the start of Semester 2, |
|                                   | 2023 on 10 July 2023. As of this  |
|                                   | date it is anticipated Anthony    |
|                                   | would have completed 4.750 EFTSL  |
|                                   | (4.250 + 0.500). Anthony is not   |
|                                   | enrolled in a year long subject,  |
|                                   | therefore the allowable time is   |
|                                   | 4.500 years. This means from the  |
|                                   | start date of Semester 2, 2023 he |
|                                   | will exceed allowable time and    |
|                                   | ceases to be eligible for         |
|                                   | Austudy. The allowable time end   |
|                                   | date recorded on his record will  |
|                                   | be the day before they exceed (9  |
|                                   | July 2023). This ensures that     |
|                                   | Anthony is assessed up to and     |
|                                   | including 9 July 2023 and his     |
|                                   | payment will stop from the start  |
|                                   | date of the semester, 10 July     |
|                                   | 2023.                             |

Student Programme Resource Tool

The Student Programme Resource Tool contains useful reference
information and links. It includes:

-   Allowable Time Calculator
-   Distance Education & Private Provider Date Calculator
-   Long Term Income Support Calculator

The tool can only be used to assist with Allowable Time Assessments if
all study undertaken at the Institution is studied under the current
Term/Semester structure. If the student has studied at the same
institution under different structures the tool will not be able to
assist with the assessment for study within the previous structure. A
manual allowable time assessment is required.
