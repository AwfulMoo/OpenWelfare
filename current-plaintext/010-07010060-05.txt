Definitions of full-time study for all TAFE courses

Table 1: This table describes the state based definition of full-time
study that is being used for all TAFE courses (the table refers to hours
per week).

Effects of the State based definitions on Allowable/Reasonable time

The application of the State based definitions does not change the
assessment of Allowable/Reasonable time. There is no change to the
normal duration of the course for satisfactory progress purposes for
example, Customer may need to attend more than the full-time hours
defined by the TAFE to complete the course in the allowable study time.

For all states and territories, the course duration specified by the
institution is considered to be the normal course duration.

Scenarios

Table 2: This table describes two examples of different situations
regarding study loads.
