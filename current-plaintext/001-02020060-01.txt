This document outlines the reasons why a job seeker may be exited or
suspended from receiving services from Workforce Australia or Community
Development Program (CDP) providers. Most of these processes are
automatic and are done by the Department of Employment and Workplace
Relations.

Fully Eligible Participant (FEP) exits from Workforce Australia

Job seekers are exited from Workforce Australia when they are no longer
eligible for services or no longer required to participate. Volunteer
job seekers who do not have mutual obligation requirements may request
an exit either from Workforce Australia or Services Australia.

FEP job seekers will be exited from Workforce Australia automatically
when the job seeker:

-   has stopped receiving an eligible income support payment
-   is fully meeting their mutual obligation requirements and no longer
    needs to remain connected to the provider
-   is commenced in Disability Employment Services or the Community
    Development Program (CDP), or
-   has become a New Enterprise Incentive Scheme (NEIS)/Self-Employment
    Assistance participant

There are some situations where an automatic exit would not occur but a
FEP may be eligible for a provider exit, which is processed manually by
the Workforce Australia organisation. These situations are where a FEP:

has a partial capacity to work (PCW):

-   of less than 15 hours per weeks, or
-   of 15 hours or more per week and is meeting their mutual obligation
    requirements through 30 hours or more per fortnight of paid work
    and/or study

is a principal carer parent:

-   and has a long-term exemption (end date longer than 16 weeks), or

is meeting their mutual obligation requirements through 30 hours or more
per fortnight of paid work and/or study or both

Volunteer job seeker exits from Workforce Australia Online

A volunteer job seeker may at any time advise either Services Australia
or Workforce Australia they no longer wish to be registered as a
volunteer.

Inactivate Workforce Australia Online job seeker registration

Service Officers may inactivate the job seeker registration for
volunteer job seekers who indicate they no longer wish to participate in
Workforce Australia.

Volunteer job seekers who request inactivation must be advised they can
re-register at any time via myGov or by contacting Services Australia.

Exits from CDP

When a job seeker lives in a Department of Education, Skills and
Employment designated remote area, they are referred to a Community
Development Program (CDP) provider.

Job seekers are exited from CDP when they have a change of circumstances
and are no longer eligible, or they are voluntary job seekers and no
longer wish to receive services.

Job seekers will be exited from CDP automatically in the following
circumstances:

-   By a Services Australia activity such as a cancellation of payment
-   When a job seeker transfers to a payment which is not eligible for
    employment services
-   When the job seeker commences training or study and they are
    required to claim a student payment
-   If they are a principal carer or have been assessed with a partial
    capacity to work and commence in a job which fully meets their
    mutual obligation requirements and achieve a full outcome after 13
    weeks in a job, and do not volunteer for further services
-   If they are in receipt of an income support payment with no
    requirements and commence in a job at the level required to achieve
    a full outcome, and achieve a full outcome after 13 weeks
-   If they commence in Small Business Coaching as part of
    Self-Employment Assistance (however while in Small Business
    Training, the job seeker will remain connected to their Provider)

Circumstances when CDP providers can exit the job seeker

Providers can also exit the job seeker in the following circumstances:

-   If they are in receipt of an income support payment with no mutual
    obligation requirements and no longer wish to volunteer
-   If they are a principal carer or have been assessed with a partial
    capacity to work (PCW 0-14) and are fully meeting their part-time
    participation requirements and do not wish to volunteer
-   Job seekers with a PCW of 0-14 hours per week who do not wish to
    volunteer
-   Principal carers with long-term exemptions (16 weeks or more) who do
    not wish to volunteer

Suspension from Workforce Australia or CDP

Job seekers who have mutual obligation requirements will be
automatically suspended from Workforce Australia or CDP in the following
circumstances:

-   When they have an exemption from their mutual obligation
    requirements
-   Principal carers or people assessed as having a partial capacity to
    work (PCW 0-14) who are fully meeting their requirements, for
    example, by undertaking suitable paid work/self-employment for at
    least 30 hours per fortnight, studying full-time or working their
    assessed capacity
-   Mature age 55+ are meeting their requirements by undertaking
    approved voluntary or suitable paid work for at least 30 hours per
    fortnight
-   When they have a temporary reduced work capacity of less than 15
    hours per week

Providers can also manually suspend services to a voluntary job seeker
if the provider assesses that the job seeker is unable to participate
for a certain period of time.

There is no minimum or maximum time for suspensions. However, job
seekers can volunteer for employment services during the period of
suspension.

Re-engagement with provider

Unless already booked by the provider, Services Australia should book
the re-engagement appointment for the job seeker with their Employment
Services Provider at the end of the suspension period, using the new
appointment reason of 'Exemption/Approved Activity completed'.

Once the job seeker has been either exited or suspended from Workforce
Australia or CDP, the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations
will send the notification to Services Australia. The status of exit or
suspend can be viewed via the Participation Summary screen.

Job seekers with mutual obligation requirements, who have been exited or
been suspended from CDP, will be Services Australia managed. The Managed
by field, which is located on the Participation Summary screen, should
be used by a Service Officer to determine whether the job seeker is
Services Australia or provider managed.

The Resources page contains a list of approved activities, which will
result in automatic suspension from Employment Provider Services by the
Department of Employment and Workplace Relations. The page also has an
attachment on the Workforce Australia/CDP exit codes/reasons.
