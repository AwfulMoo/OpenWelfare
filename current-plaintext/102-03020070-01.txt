This document outlines how to identify and refer an ICoA activity due to
a problem.

ICoA facility

The ICoA facility is a suite of programs and screens used to transfer
customer data.

This allows the user to:

-   start and schedule a transfer, and
-   monitor the status of the transfer

Post transfer of customer record

The customer's record will be in the new environment when the transfer
is complete. Staff will need to monitor transfers to make sure the
record transfers. This will also mean the customer's payments are
ongoing.
