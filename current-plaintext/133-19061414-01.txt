This document outlines how to help customers set up and access Medicare
online accounts and the Express Plus Medicare mobile app.

Online services

Customers access Medicare services online via their myGov account.

Staff can help customers by:

-   advising them how to create a myGov account and link Medicare
    services
-   issuing a linking code so they can link their myGov account to their
    Medicare services

To use the app, customers need an active Medicare online account.

Services Australia website

The website explains how customers can access and use self service.
Online guides and videos show them how.

There are links on the website for customers to sign into myGov to
access Medicare services.

Customers do not need a Medicare online account to use some services on
the website.

The Resources page contains links to Services Australia and myGov
websites and Internet links. It also contains history codes used in the
Consumer Directory Maintenance System (CDMS).
