Overpayments

In rare circumstances, overpayments may result if:

-   Child Support reviewed the payer’s estimate at some stage but used
    an adjusted taxable income amount that was higher than their actual
    income
-   the payer has been relatively up to date with their child support
    payments before and during the estimate period, or
-   the payee underestimated their actual income

If an overpayment occurs, see Child support overpayments and other payee
debt.

|                                   | Susan lodged an estimate on 27    |

|                                   | September 2009. Susan estimated   |

|                                   | from 1 September 2009.            |

|                                   | is 1 October 2009.                |

|                                   | from that same date. A new child  |

|                                   | commences on 1 March 2009.        |

|                                   | Although the child support period |

|                                   | September 2009. Therefore the     |
|                                   | earliest that can be reconciled   |

|                                   | occur if the customer's estimated |

|                                   | income. Compare the actual income |

|                                   | The reconciled income is based on |
|                                   | whether the estimated income was  |
|                                   | lower than the actual income, in  |
|                                   | which case, the actual income in  |
|                                   | that period will be used in the   |
|                                   | assessment. This reconciled       |
|                                   | income will only be applied to    |
|                                   | the periods still affected by the |
|                                   | estimate.                         |

|                                   | September 2009. Deborah estimated |
|                                   | earning $12,000 for the first 12  |
|                                   | months of the child support       |
|                                   | period. Deborah’s 2008/2009 tax   |

|                                   | customer provided. Reconcile the  |

Estimate Reconciliation Checklist

Estimate reconciliation calculator

The calculator in Cuba must be used to decide if an estimate
reconciliation is necessary based on preliminary information such as
income tax assessments. It helps to determine if the customer's actual
income is likely to be above or below the estimated income.

It helps to work out an indicative income for the estimate period that
can be a starting point for discussions with the customer to determine
their actual income for the estimate period.

When all the relevant information has been gathered from the customer
and third parties, the calculator must be used to determine the
reconciling income.
