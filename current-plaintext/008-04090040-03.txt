This file is for historical assessments/information only.

The tables below lists all the suspension, rejection and cancellation
codes for SA. The following table indicates which
suspension/cancellation reasons are restorable and any conditions for
restoration. The Document List (DL) screen should always be checked for
information regarding the suspension as in some cases it may not be
appropriate to restore at the first point of contact.
