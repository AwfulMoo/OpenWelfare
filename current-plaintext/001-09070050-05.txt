activity can fully meet a job seeker's mutual obligation requirements,
including during an overseas absence.

|                                   | over a normal year. For example,  |

|                                   | business income is $20,000. Brian |
|                                   | will need to be working a minimum |
|                                   | of 30 hours per fortnight to meet |
|                                   | the mutual obligation             |
