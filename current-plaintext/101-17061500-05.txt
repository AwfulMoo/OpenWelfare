+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Why are recipients of other       |
|                                   | payment types such as Parenting   |
|                                   | Payment Partnered, Newstart       |
|                                   | Allowance and Carers Payment not  |
|                                   | eligible for the 2017 EAP?        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   The Government recognised     |
|                                   |     that single parents need a    |
|                                   |     higher level of income        |
|                                   |     support to maintain at least  |
|                                   |     a basic standard of living,   |
|                                   |     therefore extra assistance    |
|                                   |     for these parents is provided |
|                                   |     where possible                |
|                                   | -   Couples have considerable     |
|                                   |     financial advantages from     |
|                                   |     living together and are able  |
|                                   |     to share the costs of living  |
|                                   |     and raising children. Single  |
|                                   |     parents on income support do  |
|                                   |     not have such advantages      |
|                                   | -   Newstart Allowance is a       |
|                                   |     payment provided to those who |
|                                   |     have the capacity to work. It |
|                                   |     is not intended that someone  |
|                                   |     be reliant on this payment    |
|                                   |     for long periods of time      |
|                                   | -   Recipients of Carer Payment   |
|                                   |     already receive additional    |
|                                   |     assistance through the Carer  |
|                                   |     Supplement (CS)               |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 2                                 | If the Energy Supplement is being |
|                                   | phased out, why is the government |
|                                   | making the EAP payment?           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The Energy Supplement was         |
|                                   | introduced to support people who  |
|                                   | may have been adversely affected  |
|                                   | by the Carbon Tax. The Carbon Tax |
|                                   | has been abolished and so it      |
|                                   | makes sense to get rid of its     |
|                                   | associated supplement             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The EAP is designed to help       |
|                                   | eligible pensioners and allowees  |
|                                   | to help pay for increasing energy |
|                                   | costs.                            |

| 3                                 | What happens if a recipient is    |
|                                   | eligible for the EAP from both    |
|                                   | Services Australia and the        |
|                                   | Department of Veterans' Affairs   |
|                                   | (DVA)?                            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   There is a limit of 1 payment |
|                                   |     of the EAP per eligible       |
|                                   |     person                        |
|                                   | -   The customer will receive the |
|                                   |     payment from DVA              |
|                                   | -   Subsequent payments will be   |
|                                   |     made after a check between    |
|                                   |     Services Australia and DVA to |
|                                   |     ensure the other hasn't       |
|                                   |     already paid the EAP          |
