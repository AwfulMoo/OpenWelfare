+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Self employed customer claiming   |
|                                   | payment                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A customer claims JobSeeker       |
|                                   | Payment (JSP) or Youth Allowance  |
|                                   | (YA). During the interview, the   |
|                                   | customer states they work in the  |
|                                   | building industry (bricklayer,    |
|                                   | builder, painter etc.) but they   |
|                                   | are not receiving any income due  |
|                                   | to a lack of work caused by a     |
|                                   | downturn in the industry, for     |
|                                   | example, due to a long period of  |
|                                   | wet weather. The customer also    |
|                                   | states they are still spending a  |
|                                   | significant amount of time        |
|                                   | quoting new jobs. They have no    |
|                                   | new work to start in the near     |
|                                   | future and limited or no current  |
|                                   | work.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | In this case, the customer may    |
|                                   | not be unemployed. It is          |
|                                   | irrelevant how much income the    |
|                                   | business is generating. To be     |
|                                   | considered unemployed, a customer |
|                                   | has to satisfy their mutual       |
|                                   | obligation requirements as being  |
|                                   | fit and available to undertake    |
|                                   | any suitable paid work and be     |
|                                   | able to undertake other           |
|                                   | activities requested by the       |
|                                   | Services Australia.               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A customer can have their own     |
|                                   | business and be eligible for      |
|                                   | payment, however, if they do not  |
|                                   | satisfy their mutual obligation   |
|                                   | requirements then they have not   |
|                                   | met the eligibility requirements  |
|                                   | for JSP/YA.                       |
