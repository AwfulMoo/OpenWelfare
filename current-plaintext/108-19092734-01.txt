This document outlines information on updating existing public company
shares and securities owned either by a customer, or an entity such as a
private trust or private company, the customer is involved in. This
includes updating the value of unlisted shares for 20 March or 20
September manual follow up reviews.

Asset share value

The asset value of the customer's shares is their net market value. The
market value is determined by the latest available End of Day sale price
of the shares multiplied by the number of shares held. This applies for
shares listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). The agency
holds the share process on the Securities and Investment (SIN) system,
also known as the Shares database.

As the system calculates the value of the customer's shares, customers
only have to advise the number of shares they hold in each company.

If a customer has a dividend reinvestment plan, the customer needs to
advise the agency of the additional number of shares or securities
acquired.

Share updates immediately prior to 20 March or 20 September

The value of shares and securities listed on the Australian Stock
Exchange (ASX) are automatically updated on 20 March and 20 September
each year. The updates are loaded onto the customer's record before 20
March and 20 September but don't take effect until those dates.

When the automatic update has been loaded, it will appear on the
customer's record with an Event Date in the future. For example, today's
date is 15 March and the Event Date will show as 20 March.

If the automatic update has already been loaded and an update is needed
before it takes effect, special coding will be needed. The instructions
in workaround for MIS/SIS updates immediately prior to 20 March or 20
September must be followed.

Manual follow up activities for revaluation of unlisted public shares/securities

Unlisted Australia and Overseas public shares and securities are not
automatically revalued. They are coded on the Unlisted Public Securities
(SIUS) screen.

On 20 March and 20 September, a Manual Follow-up (MFU) activity is
automatically created on all customer records that contain one or more
Australian unlisted securities. Overseas unlisted securities are not
included. The MFU will have the keyword PNSIUSRV. Service Officers will
need to manually reassess the value(s).

Deleting shares

Do not use the delete function unless the customer and/or their partner
never owned the shares listed on their record. Using delete removes the
investment from the customer’s record and assumes the customer never
owned the investment. This has serious implications, as the system may
undertake a reassessment, which could generate an arrears payment. The
correct procedure is to zero off the number of shares or the asset value
in the case of unlisted shares.

The Resources page contains information on the FINS Bulletin, the
unlisted shares FINS template and Online Query Form for the FINS
Helpdesk, margin loans, the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) and the
news.com.au websites.
