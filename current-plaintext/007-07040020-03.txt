|                                   | NBS and NBU can be affected by    |

|                                   | As NBS is an FTB Part A rate      |
|                                   | component add-on, it is added     |
|                                   | into a family's maximum and base  |
|                                   | rate of FTB Part A and is subject |
|                                   | to reconciliation.                |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Depending on the customer's       |
|                                   | circumstances (for example, rate  |
|                                   | of FTB Part A), the amount of NBS |
|                                   | payable may be reduced or         |
|                                   | increased due to income and       |
|                                   | maintenance income tests.         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The NBU is a one off payment and  |
|                                   | is not included in the FTB rate   |
|                                   | calculation.                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If a customer is found not to be  |
|                                   | entitled to FTB Part A, or        |
|                                   | entitled to a reduced base rate   |
|                                   | as a result of FTB                |
|                                   | reconciliation, an NBS and/or NBU |
|                                   | debt may arise. The NBU will be   |
|                                   | raised as a separate              |
|                                   | qualification debt where there is |
|                                   | no NBS entitlement due to nil     |
|                                   | entitlement to FTB Part A.        |

|                                   | For example:                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   If the customer's             |
|                                   |     reconciliation has resulted   |
|                                   |     in no entitlement to FTB Part |
|                                   |     A for a period where the NBU  |
|                                   |     and NBS were paid, there will |
|                                   |     be a resultant debt for both  |
|                                   |     NBU and NBS                   |
|                                   | -   If the customer's             |
|                                   |     reconciliation has resulted   |
|                                   |     in a lower FTB Part A base    |
|                                   |     rate for a period where NBS   |
|                                   |     was paid, there will be a     |
|                                   |     resultant debt of NBS         |

|                                   | A customer may be eligible for a  |
|                                   | top-up of NBS where they were     |
|                                   | previously receiving a tapered    |
|                                   | base rate of FTB Part A and       |
|                                   | reconciliation has resulted in an |
|                                   | increased entitlement.            |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | and NBS raised as a debt, if      |
