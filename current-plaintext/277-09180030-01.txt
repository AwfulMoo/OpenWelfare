This document outlines the process for preparing and despatching a file
to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) when a request for a review

Request for information from AAT

When a customer requests an AAT first review of a Child Support
decision, the AAT will email a 'Request for statement' to Child Support.

The 'Request for statement' requires documents that:

-   give reasons for Child Supports decision
-   sets out the findings of fact, and/or
-   refers to the evidence on which the findings were based

The final file containing this information must be sent to the AAT
within 28 days of the date of the request.
