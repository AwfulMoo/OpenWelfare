Customers able to self-manage

[] Austudy, Australian Apprentices (Youth Allowance (YA), Austudy, and
ABSTUDY), JobSeeker Payment, Parenting Payment Single, Parenting Payment
Partnered, YA (student) and Youth Allowance (job seeker) customers
contacting to report employment income (REI) are required to complete
the transaction via self service . All other customers contacting to
complete an REI transaction should be transitioned to complete this via
self service in the first instance.

Customers can complete their REI transaction via self-service using:

-   Centrelink online accounts - the procedure Reporting Employment
    Income via Centrelink online account contains more details
-   Express Plus Centrelink Mobile App
-   Phone self services for customers

See Access to Centrelink self service – set up, checking, locking and
resetting for more details.

Genuine attempts must be made to transition customers to report via
self-service options before assisted reporting is completed, unless an
Exception applies.

Components of the workflow

The Earnings and reporting workflow tool is launched via the Workspace
menu in Customer.

There are 4 pages each with a Workflow Manager Menu. The standard page
flow is:

-   Reporting to record the return of outstanding reporting statements.
    If the customer does not have a reporting requirement then the
    Reporting page will not display within the workflow
-   Employment Summary to view a list of all employers declared by the
    customer and/or their partner and details related to previous
    employment income. The summary allows multiple employment updates to
    be queued for processing, including the addition of new employers
-   Employment Income Update to add employment income or to change
    existing declared or actual income and to add/change employment
    income verification details
-   Outcomes provides a summary views of actioned work and expected
    results. Note: Assessment Result (AR) processing may be invoked
    after the workflow where certain changes to customer payments occur,
    for example, a debt or arrears payment is generated

Purpose of the Workflow Manager Menu

Workflow Manager Menu on the left of each of the above pages:

-   displays in order all the pages making up the workflow for the
    customer
-   highlights by a coloured band the page currently being processed
-   highlights by a tick all completed pages
-   allows users to return at any time to any previously completed, for
    example, to allow more updates if discussion with the customer
    indicates this is necessary, by simply selecting the relevant name
    in the menu
-   includes a link to the global Notepad function
-   includes the Optional Actions menu

Consequential processing

The workflow contains a number of warning and information prompts. It
also creates a range of Manual Follow-up (MFU) activities. These
activities map to appropriate staff for actioning. See the Resources
page for the full list of these MFUs and the required action.

The Resources page contains links to more information to help staff use
the workflow.
