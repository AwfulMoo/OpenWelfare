|                                   | rise to a terminating event. See  |

|                                   | dies this is a terminating event  |
|                                   | for that child. It is not a       |
|                                   | terminating event if a relevant   |
|                                   | dependent child dies, however     |
|                                   | this must be reflected in Cuba.   |
