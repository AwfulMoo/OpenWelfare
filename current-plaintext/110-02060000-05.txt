|                                   | not received one?                 |

|                                   | -   There is a new electronic     |

|                                   | -   In the majority of cases, the |
|                                   |     agency now collects the       |
|                                   |     details directly from the     |
|                                   |     provider and applies it to    |

| 2                                 | Why has my income stream not been |
|                                   | updated yet - my provider said    |
|                                   | they gave the details to          |

|                                   | -   The agency has been           |
|                                   |     undertaking manual checks to  |
|                                   |     make sure data from the       |
|                                   |     providers is correctly        |
|                                   |     applied.                      |
|                                   | -   The agency is aware that the  |
|                                   |     manual checking of records    |
|                                   |     has resulted in some delays,  |
|                                   |     but is vital for accuracy as  |
|                                   |     we move to a fully automated  |
|                                   |     process.                      |

| 3                                 | Will my payment change or will    |

|                                   | -   Any changes to payments will  |
|                                   |     continue to occur as they     |
|                                   |     have previously.              |
|                                   | -   Overpayments will only occur  |
|                                   |     if there is a difference      |
|                                   |     between the details reported  |
|                                   |     by your provider and the data |
|                                   |     on your record.               |
|                                   | -   If there is an overpayment,   |
|                                   |     you will be contacted by      |
|                                   |     phone and notified in         |
|                                   |     writing.                      |

|                                   | electronically, so why is it      |
|                                   | taking longer for my update to be |
|                                   | applied this time under the new   |
|                                   | electronic process?               |

|                                   | -   When providers start the new  |
|                                   |     electronic process,           |
|                                   |     additional checks are         |
|                                   |     undertaken.                   |
|                                   | -   Once the checks have been     |
|                                   |     completed, future updates     |
|                                   |     will be automated.            |

|                                   | of 5 years. This is because tax   |
