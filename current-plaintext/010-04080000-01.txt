This document outlines the requirements when there is a change of
circumstances for Austudy customers.

Notifiable event

A change in the customer's circumstances which affects their
qualification for payment is a notifiable event. In addition to the
common notifiable events, customers who are undertaking full-time study
or an Australian Apprenticeship must notify Services Australia within
the 14 day notification period if any of the following events occur, or
are likely to occur:

-   starting or discontinuing a full-time course of study
-   changing the course study load to part-time or concessional load
-   not enrolling in a course as a continuing student by the end of the
    enrolment period
-   not beginning in the course on the first day it is offered
-   changing enrolment in the course
-   commencing an Australian Apprenticeship, or
-   ceasing an Australian Apprenticeship

Customers may notify the change to their study details by [] updating
their details online if they are registered for Online Accounts and are
authenticated. If there is a change to the student's Participation
Status or Student End Date, the record will generate follow up action to
be undertaken by a Service Officer.

Customers eligible for Online Accounts with a level 2 access or higher
can view their personal information including study details through the
'My Profile' menu option in the Express Plus applications.
