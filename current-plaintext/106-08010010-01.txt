This document outlines how Services Australia is responsible for
assisting customers with the process of making a claim for a foreign
pension, including any non-customers who voluntarily seek assistance.

Customers seeking assistance

Customers who need assistance, or believe they would not qualify for a
foreign pension or wish to apply for an exemption from the requirement
to claim are advised to contact Centrelink International Services (CIS)

Note: the foreign pension age for some countries used in Foreign Pension
System (FPS) screening is no longer correct. Manual processes are in
place in some cases but staff need to be aware that customers who are
automatically issued Comparable Foreign Payment (CFP) notices may not
actually be eligible for payments from these countries.

Assistance provided by staff

-   All staff can manually issue a voluntary claim through the Foreign
    Pension System (FPS) if requested by a customer or non-customer
-   Access staff must assist customers with queries on claiming foreign
    pensions, including referring to International Services (CIS) or
    directing customers to service centres
-   Service centre staff must assist customers with lodging claim forms
    and other documents, including copying and certifying any necessary
    documents. The Process page contains details on claims that can be
    scanned
-   CIS staff are responsible for assisting customers and network staff
    with foreign pension queries, including decisions on compulsory
    claims and Comparable Foreign Payment (CFP) suspensions and
    preparing foreign pension claims or other forms and documents that
    have been lodged for sending to the other country. CIS are also
    responsible for processing all FPS reviews

Information on various countries

The requirement to claim a foreign pension only applies to agreement
countries and specific other high volume non-agreement countries. Known
information on qualification and requirements for foreign pensions from:

-   Agreement countries can be found in the individual country file
    within the International Social Security Agreements
-   Other significant non-agreement countries can be found in
    Eligibility and coding of foreign pensions from non-agreement
    countries. Note: as details are not available for all countries,
    staff may not be able to assist customers to claim a pension in all
    cases

The Resources page contains links to International Services and the
International Programme and contact details for Centrelink International
Services (CIS).
