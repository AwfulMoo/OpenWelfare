+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Status value                      | Description                       |

|                                   | failed to 'close' the claim after |
|                                   | entering all adjustment details.  |

|                                   | will be assessed shortly.         |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| ADJUST                            | The adjustment claim has passed   |

|                                   | control line. To finalise the     |
|                                   | adjustment process the claim must |

|                                   | messages. Any assessing errors    |
|                                   | must be resolved before the       |
|                                   | adjustment claim can be updated.  |
