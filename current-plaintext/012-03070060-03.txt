Table 1: This table describes how to create a link between a Contracted
Service Provider (CSP) Officer and a CSP organisation registered in the
Healthcare Identifier (HI) Service.

Note:

If acting on behalf of another person known to the HI Service, for

behalf of another individual and will search directly for the
organisation
