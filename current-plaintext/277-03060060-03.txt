|                                   | decisions (one genuine attempt)   |
|                                   | where evidence is incomplete, the |
|                                   | decision is unclear or an adverse |
|                                   | decision is being made (including |
|                                   | rejecting care). If further       |
|                                   | information is provided at this   |
|                                   | contact, it can be considered     |
|                                   | before the decision is finalised. |
|                                   | If the customer advises they have |
|                                   | additional evidence, discuss      |
|                                   | lodgement options. Provide        |
|                                   | additional time for evidence to   |
|                                   | be submitted.                     |

|                                   | If the customer contacts Services |

|                                   | be possible to reconsider the     |
|                                   | decision before it is finalised.  |
|                                   | This is because a decision        |
|                                   | generally only becomes final when |
|                                   | it is communicated in writing to  |
|                                   | the relevant parties. See         |
