|                                   | An advance payment is not a debt  |
|                                   | unless the customer's income      |
|                                   | support payment ceases. The       |
|                                   | balance owing then becomes a      |
|                                   | recoverable debt.                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The gross amounts paid are the    |
|                                   | 'payments received', not the net  |
|                                   | amount. This is because part of   |
|                                   | the advance has been repaid.      |
