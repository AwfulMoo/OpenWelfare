This document outlines the mandatory recording of business structure and
banking details where a health professional intends to claim a Medicare
benefit.

Collection of business structure and bank account details

The mandatory collection of business structure information and bank
account details for health professionals who want to claim Medicare
benefits began on 9 September 2018. This was due to changes resulting
from Health Legislation Amendment (Improved Medicare Compliance and
Other Measures) Act 2018 effective 1 July 2018.

This change aims to increase compliance and protect the integrity of
the:

-   Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS)
-   Child Dental Benefits Schedule (CDBS)
-   Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS)

Medicare provider number application forms and Health Professionals
Online Service (HPOS) allow for the collection of business structure and
bank details. This affects health professionals who apply:

-   for a new provider number
-   to backdate an existing location start date
-   to re-open a previously closed provider number
-   to open a second provider number at an existing location (with a
    different ABN)

The manual and online forms contain the below fields to capture business
details about practitioners’ employers or contracting organisations:

-   Australian Business Number (ABN)
-   Australian Company Number (ACN) (If applicable)
-   Registered business name
-   Business type
-   Premises type

Business Structure legislation effective 1 July 2018

Important changes resulting from the Health Legislation Amendment
(Improved Medicare Compliance and Other Measures) Act 2018 took effect 1
July 2018 and amends the Health Insurance Act 1973.

Shared Debt Recovery Scheme

The Health Legislation Amendment (Improved Medicare Compliance and Other
Measures) Act 2018 also introduced the Shared Debt Recovery Scheme
(SDRS) on 1 July 2019. The Scheme enables the Commonwealth to hold both
a practitioner (primary debtor) and another party (secondary debtor)
responsible for repayment of compliance debts, arising as a result of
incorrectly claiming Medicare benefits, through the making of a shared
debt determination. The Scheme was introduced because Medicare billing
is often delegated to non-practitioners, administered through
centralised billing areas and can be influenced by organisational
processes and policies. In some instances this has led to incorrect
billing practices.
