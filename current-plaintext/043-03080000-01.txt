This document outlines the actions to be taken when a new or existing
customer advises that they have become involved in a new or existing
business.

Customer's role in new business

It is important to establish whether the person is self-employed or an
employee in the business. If it is established that the customer is
self-employed, a determination is required on their business structure.
If a customer is a self-employed contractor, a sole trader, in a
partnership or conducting a business through a private company or
private trust, one the following Modules is needed from the customer:

-   a Module F - Business details (MOD F) for each sole trader business
    and/or partnership business or
-   a Module PT - Private Trust (MOD PT) for a private trust or
-   a Module PC - Private Company (MOD PC) for a private company. If the
    business name has a reference to a Pty Ltd and P/L it is a private
    company. A MOD PC is required even if the customer indicates they
    only have 2 x $1 shares

For all business types, a reasonable estimate of the current financial
(income and asset) position of the business is also needed.

Different rules apply to the assessment of income from a business where
the business activity is conducted through a company or trust structure.
Different rules applied to trusts and companies prior to 1 January 2002
when new legislation took effect.

The Resources page contains links to the Business details (MOD F),
Private Trust (MOD PT) and Private Company (MOD PC) forms.
