This document explains how to assess granny flat interests or rights.

Granny flat interest or right

Granny flat interests have special residence provisions applied. It is
the same for retirement villages and sale leaseback homes.

A granny flat interest is created when a customer pays for:

-   a life interest or
-   right to accommodation for life and
-   it is in a private residence, that will be their principal home

A rented property can be a granny flat right or interest for a person if
the lessee:

-   guarantees accommodation for life, and
-   provides a different property if the lease ends

A person cannot have a granny flat right or interest in a property in
which they have legal ownership.

Granny flat rights are usually family arrangements, rarely covered by a
written contract or agreement. Lack of a written agreement does not
matter for these rules.

If the lessee of the property provides the life interest in return for a
payment, proof must be sighted that states:

-   they guarantee the life interest, and
-   if the lease ends, the granny flat right will continue, even if it
    is at a new address

Note: customers should seek financial and legal advice before entering
into a granny flat interest. Services Australia recommends the customer
gets a legal document drawn up so there's proof of the agreement. This
can help prevent problems later if things change.

Capital gains

Customers should seek advice about capital gains issues. They can seek
advice from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), a lawyer or an
accountant.

Capital gains may apply when creating a granny flat right.

Creation of granny flat interests

A customer creates a granny flat interest if they do any of the
following:

-   transfers all legal title to their home to another party and keeps a
    right to live for life in that property, or in another property
    owned by the other party
-   pays to construct and fit out a home on another person's property
    and keeps a right to live in it for life
-   provides some or all of the purchase price of a property in another
    person's name and keeps a right to live in it for life

Deprivation and the reasonableness test

There is no deprivation when a customer creates a granny flat interest
in the situations above.

There may be deprivation if a customer transfers or gifts additional
assets.

A test, known as the Reasonableness test, is applied by a Complex
Assessment Officer (CAO) to see if there is deprivation. This test uses
a modified table of life expectancies. For more information, the
References page links to the Guide to Social Security Law, 4.6.4.60.

Additional assets may include:

-   land that is not an exempt asset under the home and curtilage rules
-   commercial properties
-   financial investments or
-   cash

A customer may give money to another person in exchange for a life
interest. A CAO is to conduct the reasonableness test in all cases when
a customer gives money in return for a granny flat interest.

A customer may wish to live with more than one family member. They will
have more than one granny flat interest. The 'Reasonableness Test' is
applied by a CAO when this occurs.

The entry contribution is the amount paid for the granny flat right. It
determines the customer's 'homeownership' status for the assets test and
Rent Assistance.

Home ownership

To determine home ownership status, compare:

the entry contribution and

the Extra Allowable Amount (EAA)

-   the EAA is the difference between the homeowner and non-homeowner
    assets limits at the time the granny flat interest is created

If the entry contribution is:

-   more than the EAA, the customer is a homeowner. Rent Assistance (RA)
    is not payable
-   not more than the EAA, the customer is a non-homeowner. RA is based
    on the amount of maintenance fees paid. The entry contribution is
    recorded as an asset of the customer but is not deemed

Sale of principal home to set up a granny flat right

Funds from the sale of the customer's principal home may be exempt from
the asset test.

If the amount they intend to use to set up the granny flat rights is:

more than the EAA,

-   the customer is a homeowner
-   the sale amount to be used to set up the granny flat right is exempt
    from the assets test for 12 months

not more than the EAA,

-   the customer is a non-homeowner from the sale date
-   there is no asset test exemption

Assessing a granny flat interest for the recipient of the property

Services Australia assesses the receiver of the property transfer as
having a remainder interest. If a customer creates a granny flat
interest by:

-   transferring the legal title of their home to another person, and
-   getting a right to live there for life

The remainder interest is not an asset whilst the granny flat interest
exists.

Vacating the granny flat interest

There may be deprivation if an income support customer stops living in a
granny flat interest:

-   less than 5 years after creating the interest and,
-   the reason they left would have been known at the time the interest
    was created

If both these criteria are met, deprivation is assessed from the date
the customer permanently vacates the home until the end of the 5 year
period from the date of transfer of the property.

For example, the customer gifts their home property on 1 July 2017
creating a granny flat interest. On 1 July 2018, they vacate the
property to move to a unit they have recently purchased. This was their
intention at the time they created the granny flat interest. The value
of their contribution was not returned when they moved to the unit.
Deprivation applies from 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2022.

If the customer is partnered and their partner still lives in the granny
flat interest, no deprivation has occurred.

There is no deprivation in these cases:

-   sudden onset of illness (including moving to Aged Care)
-   family relationship breakdown
-   elder abuse or
-   damage to the property, which makes it uninhabitable
