This document explains the responsibilities of employers for the
delivery of Parental Leave Pay (PPL).

PPL claims for children born/entering care on or after 1 July 2011

It is mandatory for employers to provide PPL to their eligible
employees.

Employers are required to provide the PPL period, plus any Flexible PPL
days that are connected to it.

If the customer is not an eligible employee, or if PPL cannot be
delivered by the employer, for example, if the employer is not required
to have an Australian Business Number (ABN) it will be delivered by
Services Australia.

PPL claims for children born/entering care on or after 1 October 2016

If the employee is receiving an income support payment (ISP) at the time
of the initial PPL claim determination (including where the ISP will
cancel due to PPL payments) Services Australia will be the default PPL
paymaster. No employer determination will be made.

Employees already in receipt of PPL who have had an employer
determination made (either the PPL payment has commenced or has been
scheduled to commence) and who are granted an ISP will have the
paymaster role automatically transferred from the employer to the
agency. The date of effect for the transfer will be the PPL date paid
to + 1 day to ensure there is no overpayment raised against the
employer.

Once the agency is appointed as the paymaster, future reassessments will
not change the paymaster role, unless:

-   the employee makes a subsequent request to change the paymaster
    role, and
-   the employee is no longer receiving an ISP

This automatic paymaster role transfer does not apply where:

-   an ISP is granted to the PPL customer's partner. It only applies if
    the PPL customer themselves are granted an ISP
-   PPL paid in respect of a child who was born or came into care before
    1 October 2016

PPL funds

Services Australia will provide PPL funds to the employer who will
provide PPL to the employee through their existing payroll cycle.

Flexible PPL days

For children that were born or entered care on or after 1 July 2020, PPL
will include up to 30 Flexible PPL days. Employers will only be
responsible for delivering any Flexible PPL day that is:

-   connected to the PPL period, and
-   scheduled on a day that is before the child’s first
    birthday/anniversary of entry into care

If there is a break in eligibility during the PPL period or connected
Flexible PPL days:

-   the employer role will cease, and
-   any remaining Flexible PPL days will be delivered by Services
    Australia

Employer responsibilities

The employer must undertake the following:

-   provide details to advance the employer PPL funding amounts
-   withhold tax from the PPL under the usual PAYG withholding
    arrangements and include PPL in the total amounts on the employee's
    annual or part-year payment summary (statements produced and given
    to the employee for tax purposes)
-   provide the employee with access to a record of their PPL by
    providing payslips
-   keep written financial records of the receipt of PPL funds received
    from the agency and the PPL provided to an employee
-   notify their employee and employer change in circumstances

The Resources page has a table of processes for revoking employer
determination or transferring the provider role to the agency, suggested
text for use in letters seeking additional information from employees,
contact details for the Paid Parental Leave Employer Processing Team
(PPLEPT), and a link to contact details for the New Parent Programmes
Team.
