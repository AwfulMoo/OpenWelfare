For Customer Compliance staff only.

This document outlines how Study Load Interventions are undertaken to
ensure customers in receipt of Centrelink payments remain qualified for
payment. Study Load Interventions use information received from
educational institutions and Department of Education, Skills and
Employment to address the potential risk of study related overpayments
to customers. This process aims to increase voluntary compliance to
ensure customers receive their correct entitlements and to reduce the
risk of overpayment.

Enrolment check frequency

The frequency of the enrolment check matching with education
institutions is as follows:

-   primary schools - once per year (term 1)
-   secondary schools and colleges - enrolment checking once per term
-   universities - enrolment and study load checking twice in Semester 1
    and once in Semester 2
-   colleges of Technical and Further Education (TAFEs) - enrolment and
    workload checking at least once per semester
-   private providers - enrolment and workload checking once per
    semester

Enrolment matching

Customers who indicated they are undertaking full-time study (and also
part-time study for Pensioner Education Supplement (PES) customers
only), and receive/received a Centrelink payment for students, are
selected for enrolment matching.

Unapproved Absences

Any unapproved absences of greater than 20 days are loaded as
'Withdrawn' from study reviews (WSE) and actioned as Study Load
Interventions.

Scholarship matching

Customers who have received a duplicate Commonwealth Scholarship and
Services Australia paid scholarship for the same period may have been
overpaid. If this occurs, the duplicate Centrelink payment requires
recovery.
