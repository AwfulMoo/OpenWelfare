This document outlines how to deal with cases of disputed responsibility
for ABSTUDY.

Investigating the most suitable applicant

Where more than one person has applied for ABSTUDY on behalf of a
student or there is doubt as to who is the parent/guardian,
investigations will be carried out to determine who the most suitable
person to apply is. The investigations will involve both parties, and/or
(with the applicants' knowledge), an independent authority such as a
school or welfare worker. Advice may also be sought from the student.

Determining the most suitable applicant

When determining whom the most suitable person to apply is, the
following points should be considered:

-   whether the student lives with the applicant and has done so in the
    last twelve months
-   whether the student lives with the applicant during vacations
-   who is responsible for the care of the student, for example,
    providing food and shelter
-   who contributes regularly and significantly to the student's living
    and education costs
-   who receives Family Tax Benefit (FTB) or other allowances in respect
    of the student
-   who has been awarded custody of the student

Making the final decision

Ultimately, the Service Officer needs to make a decision about who is
the most suitable person to be the ABSTUDY applicant. Where difficult
cases are presented, it may be beneficial to speak to an Indigenous
Service Officer (ISO) before making the final decision.
