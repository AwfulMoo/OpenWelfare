This document outlines how FileNet, a content management system, is used
to manage electronic documents and digital images for Centrelink,
Medicare and Child Support. FileNet is also known as IBM Content
Navigator system.

Access

Specific security roles are required to access FileNet. These roles must
be requested through the Internet Security Portal.

Documents and digital images stored in FileNet are able to be accessed
through:

-   FileNet directly, or
-   A source system for viewing and processing, such as PaNDA,
    Processing and National Demand Allocation, Customer First or Process
    Direct

Non-customer documents stored in FileNet

When digital images are created documents that do not have enough detail
to identify which customer they belong to may be classified as ‘Orphan’
or ‘Administrative’ documents.

-   Administrative documents cannot be attached to a record due to a
    business reason, for example, tip off but the documents still need
    processing. This is electronically forwarded to the appropriate team
    for action
-   Orphan documents contain Centrelink customer details where a
    customer cannot be identified. There has not been enough detail
    provided to create a customer record

Extensive searches (including online searches) must be done before
marking a document an Orphan or administrative document. These documents
are viewable via FileNet and not deleted. For more details about these
documents see Classifying Centrelink digital images via the National
Queue.

Deleting documents in FileNet

Documents can only be deleted from FileNet by trained staff with the
appropriate security access. This is the Procurement and Records
Management Branch.

The Resources page contains details about the ISP roles needed and links
to FileNet for each service delivery brand.
