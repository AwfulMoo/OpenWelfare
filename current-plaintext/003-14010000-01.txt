Current emergency management events

Emergency payments may become available after an emergency event (for
example, a major disaster, pandemic or overseas terrorist attack). This
is only after a determination by the relevant Minister (for a major
disaster), or the Prime Minister (for an overseas terrorist attack or
pandemic outbreak).

Once a determination has been made, a claiming period will open. An
emergency event will become ‘current’ and customers may then make a
claim for the relevant emergency payment. Allowable claiming periods may
differ, and depend on the event and the type of emergency payment that
is available.

Fraud

The agency is seeing an increase in fraudsters creating fabricated
identities or compromising other people’s identities to claim Emergency
Payments.

The following actions can be taken to prevent fraud:

-   Looking for warning signs of fraud
-   Confirming the customer’s identity
-   Verifying information or evidence
-   Checking for false images and addresses
-   Reporting suspected fraud and corruption

Fraud always needs intent. It is never an accident or a mistake.

For more details, see Emergency payments - preventing fraud.
