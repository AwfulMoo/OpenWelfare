|                                   | Since 1 July 2008, Customer A and |
|                                   | Customer B have their levels of   |
|                                   | care and income taken into        |
|                                   | account and there is only 1 child |
|                                   | support case. This means that 1   |
|                                   | customer is required to pay, and  |
|                                   | the other customer will receive   |
|                                   | child support.                    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If both parties have had their    |
|                                   | circumstances taken into account  |
|                                   | for a child support case, both    |
|                                   | parties are considered to have    |
|                                   | met the MAT for the relevant      |
|                                   | child/ren. However, there is      |
|                                   | currently no data electronically  |
|                                   | received from Child Support to    |
|                                   | indicate that the child/ren in    |
|                                   | the paying parent's care are      |
|                                   | meeting the MAT.                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Exception: if the customer has    |
|                                   | not taken reasonable action to    |
|                                   | change from being the payer under |
|                                   | a child support agreement to the  |
|                                   | payee following a significant     |
|                                   | change in care, they will fail    |
|                                   | the MAT. See Maintenance Action   |
|                                   | Test (MAT) for Family Tax Benefit |
|                                   | (FTB) customers for further       |
|                                   | details on reasonable MAT         |
|                                   | requirements for these cases.     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | In the customer's record, update  |
|                                   | the MAT code to NMA from the date |
|                                   | it is determined the customer is  |
|                                   | not taking reasonable action.     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Note: where the payer in a child  |
|                                   | support agreement increases their |
|                                   | level of care to more than 65%    |
|                                   | takes reasonable action to end a  |
|                                   | binding agreement and the payee   |
|                                   | refuses to end the agreement, the |
|                                   | payer satisfies MAT requirements. |
|                                   | As these cases will already have  |
|                                   | an MWP (Manual workaround pass)   |
|                                   | code applied as a result of the   |
|                                   | 'one case' scenario, the MWP      |
|                                   | should remain in place. See       |

|                                   | circumstances.                    |

|                                   | A consequential reassessment may  |
