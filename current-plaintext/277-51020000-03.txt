|                                   | The Child Support Scheme Reforms  |
|                                   | were implemented in 3 stages      |
|                                   | between July 2006 and July 2008.  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The new Child Support Scheme was  |
|                                   | created to meet the best          |
|                                   | interests of children, to better  |
|                                   | balance the interests of parents, |
|                                   | and to better reflect today's     |
|                                   | community. The new Child Support  |
|                                   | Scheme also takes into account    |
|                                   | the costs of raising children.    |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | -   child support payments are    |
|                                   |     calculated based on the       |
|                                   |     actual costs of raising       |
|                                   |     children                      |

|                                   |     parents is used to calculate  |
|                                   |     child support payments,       |
|                                   |     treating the incomes of both  |
|                                   |     parents in the same way       |
|                                   | -   recognition of the            |
|                                   |     contributions of both parents |
|                                   |     to the cost of their children |
|                                   |     through care and contact      |
|                                   | -   children of first and second  |
|                                   |     families are treated more     |
|                                   |     equally                       |
