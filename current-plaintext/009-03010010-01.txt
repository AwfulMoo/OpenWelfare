This document outlines information to assist with enquiries from carers
when completing a Claim for Carer Allowance (adult) following Carer
Payment Review (SA341).

Entitlement to Carer Allowance (adult)

When a carer lodges a medical review for Carer Payment (CP) (adult), the
assessing Service Officer makes a determination if their CP is to
continue. The Service Officer also establishes if the carer is entitled
to Carer Allowance (CA) (adult). If an entitlement to CA exists, an
SA341 will automatically issue and be sent for the carer to complete and
return.

The Claim for Carer Allowance following Carer Payment Review (SA341)
cannot be used as a new claim from the date of review. The date of
lodgement of the SA341 will be treated as the date of claim.

The Resources page contains links to the SA341 form and information
about Carer Allowance.
