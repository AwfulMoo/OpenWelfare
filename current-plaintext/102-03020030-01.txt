This document outlines how the Interstate Change of Address (ICoA)
facility is used to transfer the record of a child.

Child transfer

The Centrelink computer system divides Australia into a series of
geographically based environments. When a customer changes their address
from one environment to another, their computer file record must be
transferred.

A child transfer is required when:

-   there is a change of address/custody for a child in shared care, and
    the parents/carers are in different environments (the child is
    moving from one parent's environment to the other parent's
    environment), or
-   the parent(s) or carer(s) change environment, and the child has a
    record of their own, as can be the case for Carer Payment and/or
    Carer Allowance
