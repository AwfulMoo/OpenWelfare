This document outlines collecting child support payments through third
parties via sections 72A or 72AC and follow up on non-compliance.

Collection of child support through third parties

Child Support may enforce collection of child support through third
parties in certain circumstances. Child Support can issue a notice under
section 72A of the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988
(s72A). This notice requires a third party to forward funds to Child
Support that it otherwise owes to the customer. Collection through a
third party used appropriately, it is an effective method of
transferring child support between parents.

Collection through Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA)

DVA customers can receive their pensions and benefits through
income/disability support or military rehab/compensation payments.
Careful consideration must he applied to ensure the correct notice is
issued to the correct DVA organisation Child Support Reference Number
(CSRN).

See, Collection through Department of Veterans' Affair on the Resources
page for more information.
