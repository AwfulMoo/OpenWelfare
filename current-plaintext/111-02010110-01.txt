This document outlines how to access archived Mobility Allowance (MOB)
data using the Archiving and Culling Engine (ACE) application.

General rules

The general rules for archiving MOB records are:

-   The record must have been cancelled for 3 or more years
-   The record must not have a recent or unfinalised Debt, Appeal,
    Prosecution or Compensation activity

Service reasons to be archived

The only MOB service reason to be archived is MOB (Mobility Allowance).

Not all data for a 3 year old cancelled record is archived. Only
Assessment and Summary data relevant to MOB is archived. No Person data
or common Circumstance data is archived, and this data is retained in
the system for use by other mainframe Income Support Integrated System
(ISIS) Common Platform Systems.

After a record has been archived, the MOB data normally displayed on the
mainframe ISIS system will be displayed in a similar format in ACE.

The Resources page contains a link to the Archiving and Culling Engine
(ACE).
