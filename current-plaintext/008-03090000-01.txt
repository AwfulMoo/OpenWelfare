Participation requirements

From 1 July 2014, customers with participation requirements must
participate in a compulsory work-focused activity designed to help them
prepare for and find work. This is in addition to the requirement to
attend regular participation interviews and enter into a Participation
Plan. DSP payments may be suspended or cancelled if customers do not
comply with their requirements.

Participation interviews

To decide on activities the customer will do to improve economic
participation they must:

attend a DSP initial participation interview to receive information
about payments, programs and local services in line with the customer's
individual circumstances and capacity. Develop a Disability Support
Pension (DSP) Participation Plan. The plan will include:

-   at least one compulsory work focused activity that the customer has
    agreed to participate in (such as Disability Employment Services)
-   the customer may choose to include voluntary activities
-   the requirement to attend DSP participation interviews

attend DSP follow-up participation interviews, and

review the DSP plan at every participation interview

DSP participation interviews are conducted:

-   quarterly for the first 18 months (starting on the day of the first
    interview), and
-   every 6 months, except for customers who are working/reporting
    income who must attend annual participation interviews instead
-   customers may be granted a temporary exemption from DSP
    participation requirements depending on their circumstances
-   DSP customers not subject to DSP participation requirements can
    volunteer to participate. For these customers, attendance at
    participation interviews, entering into a Participation Plan and
    participation in activities are not compulsory

Employment or approved study

DSP customers engaged in employment in the open labour market are
required to attend an initial participation interview and agree to a DSP
Participation Plan. The customer must attend an annual follow-up
participation interview. If however, no income has been reported for 6
weeks or more the customer will re-enter the normal participation cycle.

For DSP customers who are studying, attendance at all interviews
(initial and follow-up) is compulsory. These customers will attend
interviews every three or six months depending on where they are in the
interview cycle.
