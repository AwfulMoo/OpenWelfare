|                                   | financial year. Bo was entitled   |
|                                   | to $6000 in child support for     |
|                                   | 2005-06, however only received    |

|                                   | The amount Bo received was less   |
|                                   | than the amount entitled to, and  |
|                                   | less than the Maintenance Income  |
|                                   | Free Area (MIFA) of $1182.60.     |

|                                   | For 2006-07, Bo is entitled to    |
|                                   | $2000 in child support, however   |
|                                   | receives $3000. As the amount Bo  |
|                                   | received is more than the amount  |
|                                   | entitled to, the excess of $1000  |
|                                   | is treated as arrears.            |

|                                   |     2006 is $682.60. This is      |

|                                   |     child support Bo is owed,     |
|                                   |     $5000, therefore accrues the  |
