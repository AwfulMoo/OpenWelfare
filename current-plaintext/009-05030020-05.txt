This page contains information to help determine whether a previous
Treating Health Professional (THP) medical report can be re-used for a
current claim.

On this Page:

Determining if a previous THP medical report can be re-used

If 1 carer is in receipt of Carer Allowance (CA) for a child care
receiver and a second carer claims under the shared care provisions, the
care receiver does not have to be tested a second time against the list
of recognised disabilities (LoRD) or Disability Care Load Assessment
Determination (DCLAD).

The second carer is not required to provide another THP medical report
for the same care receiver, but they will need to complete a CNA. The
Carers Online Claim and Assisted Customer Claim (ACC) cannot determine
if the care receiver is in shared care and a medical report may be
incorrectly issued.

If there is an existing medical report from a THP, signed more than 26
weeks ago, a new medical report may not be required. To determine if a
new medical report is required, consideration is given to the age of the
child at the time of the previous medical report and their age at the
time of claim.

The following table shows if a THP medical report is required or not.

Re-use rules for THP medical reports based on the age of the child care receiver
