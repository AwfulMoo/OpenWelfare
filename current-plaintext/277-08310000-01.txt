Residency overview

Determining the residency of a customer means making a decision that the
customer is a resident of:

-   Australia
-   a reciprocating jurisdiction, or
-   a non-reciprocating jurisdiction

A customer's place of residence is 1 of the factors that determines a
customers' eligibility about child support assessments. Information must
be gathered to make the decision. This includes if the travelling
customer intends to be overseas for more than 6 months or 12 months if
visiting friends and family.

When a residency decision is required

Child Support may become aware that a residency decision is required
when:

-   A customer leaves or may leave Australia, arrives in Australia or
    moves between other jurisdictions.
-   A customer makes an application for an assessment and advises that
    they or the other parent reside outside of Australia. For more
    information about referring customers to the International Team in
    this circumstance, see Applications for a child support Assessment
-   A customer who lives outside Australia provides an overseas
    maintenance liability. For more information about registering an
    overseas maintenance liability, see Registration of overseas
    maintenance liabilities (excluding New Zealand) (CS)

Note: New Customer Service Officers follow the Applications for a child
support Assessment when referring a customer to the Specialist Residency
Team.
