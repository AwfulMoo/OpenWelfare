About ECLIPSE

Electronic Claim Lodgement and Information Processing Service
Environment (ECLIPSE) is an extension of Medicare Online claiming. It
offers a secure connection between:

-   health care providers
-   health sector entities including medical practices
-   public and private hospitals and billing agents
-   private health insurers
-   the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA), and
-   Services Australia

Providers and health sector entities use ECLIPSE to:

-   perform online patient verification
-   perform online eligibility checks
-   lodge claims to Services Australia and private health insurers in 1
    transaction
-   ECLIPSE is used for paid and unpaid in-hospital claims. Both are
    lodged directly with Services Australia through practice management
    software.

Benefits of using ECLIPSE

ECLIPSE allows public and private hospitals, including day facilities,
to submit claims securely over the internet to private health insurers,
saving time and money. The range of benefits include:

-   the reduction in the use of paper
-   quicker processing times
-   the reduction in administration time, which results in reduced
    management costs
-   faster resolution of complex claims
-   better data quality with fewer errors and quicker resolutions
-   the production of ECLIPSE Remittance Advice from private health
    insurers and DVA allowing efficient reconciliation of patient
    accounts

ECLIPSE is a single system for all, together with the agency's other
online claiming services. It provides a one-stop shop for electronic
business - access to Medicare, DVA, Australian Immunisation Register
(AIR) and private health insurers in 1 product.

Accuracy of data

Services Australia cannot alter data transmission. This is Services
Australia policy:

-   This policy makes sure all data held by the agency is accurate
-   Even if an obvious change is needed, Service Officers cannot change
    information supplied to the agency without supporting documentation

Patient identification by date of birth

If more than 1 person with the same name is enrolled on a Medicare card
number, background checks automatically select the patient if an exact
match is made. That is, with data held on the Consumer Directory.

This removes the need for Service Officers to select the correct patient
if the first names are identical.

Referral or request details

If a referral or request line transmits from a billing agent or private
health insurer for items that are not subject to these requirements,
background checks:

-   ignore the data, and
-   does not pass it to the pend processing screen (FAPI) screen

This removes the need for Service Officers to enter reason codes on all
unnecessary referral or request lines during pend processing.

Patient demographics

Where a billing agent or private health insurer does not have a valid
Medicare card number, they have the option to transmit the patient
demographics which include:

-   surname
-   first name
-   second initial
-   date of birth
-   sex
-   locality
-   postcode

Where there is an exact match with a record on the Consumer Directory,
the Medicare card number is automatically inserted during background
assessing and included on the statement of benefit, which is then
forwarded to the billing agent and private health insurer.

Source office codes

Simplified Billing Service officers must logon to the ECLIPSE source
office code for the site. See the Resources page for more information.

Identify partially rejected ECLIPSE claims

If Medicare only rejects some service lines within the claim, the claim
details transmit to the private health insurer for assessment

If a private health insurer accepts a claim assessment, benefits are
paid to the health professional and rejected services are sent to the:

-   health professional, and
-   private health insurer

Identify these types of ECLIPSE claims on:

-   the patient's history, or
-   the claim history (FCEI) screen

Note: rejections relating to a patient's details (for example, rejection
with RSN 429 - patient cannot be identified from the information
supplied) or RSN 475, do not appear on a patient history.

ECLIPSE rejected claim enquiries

Health professionals that lodge in-hospital claims using the ECLIPSE
channel may contact Medicare when the ECLIPSE claim has been Medicare
rejected:

-   Do not tell these providers to contact the private health insurer in
    relation to the rejection
-   Medicare do not notify private health insurers when an in-hospital
    claim lodged by a health professional using the ECLIPSE channel, has
    been entirely rejected. For this reason, the private health insurer
    cannot help the provider with this type of rejection enquiry

When Medicare reject ECLIPSE claims, the rejected services do not
transmit to private health insurers if:

all services within a claim are rejected. Rejections do not appear on
the patient's history, Service Officers can identify ECLIPSE claims by
using:

-   the claim history (FCEI) control line, and
-   SAINT

some services within a claim are rejected, the rejected and paid
services appear on the patient's history

Access claims history data

Service Officers can access claims history data by referring to:

-   patient history (NHSI)
-   claim history (FCEI) and request duplicate statement (FPSI)
-   Search Analyse Investigate Network Tool (SAINT) data for ECLIPSE
    transmission and response messages

Service Officers must attempt to resolve enquiries from health
professionals or their practice staff that result from Medicare
rejecting an ECLIPSE claim with a 3 digit reason code. Where a rejection
involves a claim rejected with a 4-digit reason code, direct the health
professionals or the practice staff to the eBusiness Service Centre. The
Resources page has a link to Medicare return codes.
