This document outlines and explains what each of the important and most
common financial statements are and why each is needed by Services
Australia.

Financial statements

All business entities prepare some form of financial statements. The
Income Tax Assessment Act (ITAA), section 262A, requires that 'every
person carrying on a business shall keep sufficient records of his/her
income and expenditure to enable his/her assessable income and allowable
deductions to be readily ascertained'.

The records maintained by a business will depend on the nature of the
business activity undertaken (for example, sale of goods or provision of
services, or a combination of these) and the type of structure within
which the business enterprise is conducted (sole trader, partnership,
company or trust).

The most common financial statements, completed by most businesses,
include:

-   income tax returns
-   business activity statements (Quarterly for GST)
-   profit and loss statement
-   balance sheet
-   depreciation schedule
-   partners' capital accounts (partnerships)
-   livestock trading accounts (primary producers)
-   cash flow statement

Financial statements are used by the owners of the business for various
reasons, for example, to support an application for a loan from a
financial institution, or as a record of the performance of the
business. Also, while financial statements are no longer required to be
lodged with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) each year, they are
still required to be provided to the ATO upon request, for example, if
an audit is being conducted.

Reading and understanding business accounting records is important in
the correct assessment of the effect of the entity upon customer
entitlement under the income and assets tests.
