Qualification for EdEP

Customers in receipt of certain social security payments may qualify for
an EdEP if:

-   they enrol in an approved full time course, or

The qualification rules depend on the type of income support payment. An
EdEP may be paid each 12 months or each calendar year:

-   if the person is still studying, and
-   depending on the type of income support payment received

Raise a debt under Section 1224B of the Social Security Act 1991 (the
Act) when:

-   an EdEP is made to a person, and
-   the person does not pay the enrolment fees for the course in the
    calendar year which the EdEP was made

Raise a debt under Section 1223(1) of the Act when:

-   the person has received EdEP they were not entitled to, and
-   for reasons other than specified in Section 1224B of the Act
