|                                   | A postgraduate bachelor degree is |
|                                   | a course that requires the        |
|                                   | student to have already completed |
|                                   | an undergraduate qualification    |
|                                   | (bachelor degree) in order to     |
|                                   | gain entry to the course. These   |
|                                   | courses are usually referred to   |
|                                   | as graduate entry bachelor        |
|                                   | degrees.                          |

|                                   | undergraduate courses in their    |
|                                   | course handbooks or classify them |
|                                   | as undergraduate study. This does |
|                                   | not mean that the courses are not |
|                                   | postgraduate or bachelor degrees. |

|                                   | To determine if a postgraduate    |
|                                   | bachelor degree really is a       |
|                                   | Tertiary Level A course consider  |
|                                   | the following:                    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Does the bachelor's degree        |
|                                   | require a customer to have        |
|                                   | completed an undergraduate course |
|                                   | in order to gain entry? If this   |
|                                   | is the case the bachelor's degree |
|                                   | will be considered a postgraduate |
|                                   | bachelor's degree.                |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Is there an undergraduate course  |
|                                   | at the university with a similar  |
|                                   | name and the same outcome (that   |
|                                   | is, at the end of either course   |
|                                   | the student would have the same   |

|                                   | example, teacher, lawyer, etc.)?  |

|                                   | In limited situations, the same   |
|                                   | course can be considered a Level  |
|                                   | A course for one student, and     |
|                                   | Level B for another. This is      |
|                                   | because some universities offer   |
|                                   | courses which appear to be        |
|                                   | postgraduate to students who may  |
|                                   | have completed a Vocational       |
|                                   | Diploma or achieved a certain     |
|                                   | ATAR in secondary school. For     |
|                                   | example:                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A student has just finished year  |
|                                   | 12 and achieved an ATAR of 92 and |
|                                   | they intend to enrol in a         |
|                                   | Bachelor of Laws at the           |
|                                   | University of New England, which  |
|                                   | is available as a 3 or 4 year     |
|                                   | course. To be eligible to enrol   |
|                                   | in the 3 year course, a student   |
|                                   | must have completed another       |
|                                   | undergraduate degree, or achieved |
|                                   | an ATAR above 90. As this student |
|                                   | will be able to enrol in the 3    |
|                                   | year version of the course based  |
|                                   | on their ATAR, and because they   |
|                                   | have not completed another        |
|                                   | undergraduate degree, the course  |
|                                   | would be considered a Level B     |
|                                   | course.                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the student had enrolled in    |
|                                   | the course on the basis that they |
|                                   | have completed an undergraduate   |
|                                   | degree, the course would be       |
|                                   | considered postgraduate and       |
|                                   | therefore, a Level A course.      |

|                                   | More commonly, however, the       |

|                                   | significantly shorter. This would |
