This document explains how to assess a Tasmanian Freight Equalisation
Scheme (TFES) claim for brood mares.

TFES brood mare claims

A person or business may be eligible to claim assistance for shipping
brood mares from:

-   Tasmania to the mainland of Australia for servicing and their
    returned to Tasmania, or

    servicing and then returned to either King Island or the Furneaux
    Group

Mares that race while on the mainland of Australia or main island of
Tasmania are not eligible as a brood mare on a round trip. The claimant
may be eligible to claim a racehorse under the TFES Sportspersons and
professional entertainers special category.

Foals born from an eligible brood mare may be eligible on the return
journey if they:

and back are not eligible for northbound or southbound assistance.
