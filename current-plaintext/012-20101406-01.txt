Opioid prescriptions and approvals

From 1 June 2021:

New listings for opioids have been added to the palliative care schedule
for both short and long-term use. To assist prescribers in requesting
increased quantities and/or repeats, a new Palliative Care Schedule -
Opioid Authority Application Form (PB306) is available for use.
Palliative items are still available on the general schedule for
palliative patients; however, eligibility requirements are simplified
for palliative care patients via the palliative care schedule. There is
also a new version of the General (S85) Schedule - Opioid Authority
Application form (PB294).

What staff need to know regarding opioids listed on the palliative care
schedule:

Prescribers can obtain PLC opioids by

-   Phone
-   Self-Serve through Online PBS Authorities System (OPA) through HPOS
-   Written, either by post or HPOS Form Upload

To assist prescribers with written requests a Palliative Care Schedule -
Opioid Authority Application Form (PB306) is available.

Most opioids are dual listed in general (S85) schedule and palliative
schedule, staff need to assess these applications based on which form
(for written authorities) the prescriber submits or by asking the
prescriber on the phone which listing is required

Palliative care opioids have different restriction requirements

What staff need to know regarding the new PBS Opioid Authority
Application Form (PB294):

-   A revised General (S85) Schedule - Opioid Authority Application Form
    (PB294) is available to assist prescribers in submitting written
    opioid prescriptions
-   The revision of this form was in response to prescriber feedback to
    ensure an easy to use format and accurate assessment
-   Previous versions of General (S85) Schedule - Opioid Treatment
    Authority Application Form (PB294) are no longer valid as they will
    not address the Q+A’s in OPA, however there will be a 3 month grace
    period until 31 August 2021, where Services Australia will accept
    and process these forms to ensure that prescribers receive all the
    communications regarding these changes. These applications should be
    processed and returned to the prescriber with the revised ‘with
    compliments’ slip
-   Authority applications will still only be approved if the prescriber
    has provided enough information on the previous version of PB294

For opioids listed on the General (s85) Schedule, from 1 October 2020:

Prescribers are no longer required to give the details (that is, name
and date) of the annual pain management review

For palliative care patients only:

-   palliative care nurse practitioners can conduct the review
-   a review is not required if it is not possible due to their
    condition

Each drug will have 3 restrictions to choose from based on the patient’s
treatment phase and length of treatment:

-   Initial after 1 June 2020 where opioid treatment is less than 12
    months
-   Initial after 1 June 2020 where opioid treatment is greater than 12
    months
-   Continuing for this drug and form after 1 June 2020

Previous drug and form between 1 June and 30 September 2020

If patients have received authority approvals between these dates,
patients will qualify under the continuing restriction.

For written prescriptions, if the prescriber has not stated initial or
continuing, staff may approve under initial if all other information is
available.

With compliments slip for PBS written opioid prescriptions

To help prescribers understand the updated requirements, Service
Officers should send the following along with the relevant rejection
letter/approved prescriptions when returning authority applications to
prescribers:

-   a with compliments slip that has information about the changes to
    PBS requirements for opioids, and
-   the updated version of the General (S85) Schedule - Opioid Authority
    application form (PB294) (If the prescriber has used an outdated
    version), or
-   a copy of the Palliative Care Schedule - Opioid Authority
    Application Form (PB306) (if the prescriber has requested a PLC
    listing on the incorrect form)
