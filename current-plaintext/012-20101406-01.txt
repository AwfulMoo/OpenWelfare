approvals.

Opioid prescriptions and approvals

For opioids listed on the Palliative Care Schedule:

Prescribers can obtain PLC opioids by:

-   phone
-   self-serve through Online PBS Authorities (OPA) System through HPOS
-   written application, either by post or HPOS Form Upload

To assist prescribers with written requests a Palliative Care Schedule -
opioid treatment authority application form (PB306) is available.

Most opioids are dual listed on both the General (S85) Schedule and the
Palliative Care Schedule. Staff must assess applications:

-   based on which form (for written authorities) the prescriber
    submits, or
-   asking the prescriber on the phone which listing is required

Palliative care opioids have different restriction requirements

The General (S85) Schedule - opioid treatment authority application form
(PB294) is available to assist prescribers to submit written opioid
prescriptions for approval.

For opioids listed on the General (s85) Schedule:

Prescribers are not required to give the details (for example, name and
date) of the annual pain management review

For palliative care patients only:

-   palliative care nurse practitioners can conduct the review
-   a review is not required if it is not possible due to their
    condition

Each drug has 3 restrictions to choose from based on the patient’s
treatment phase and length of treatment:

-   Initial after 1 June 2020 where opioid treatment is less than 12
    months
-   Initial after 1 June 2020 where opioid treatment is greater than 12
    months
-   Continuing for this drug and form after 1 June 2020

To help prescribers understand the requirements, Service Officers should
send the following along with the relevant rejection letter/approved
prescriptions when returning authority applications to prescribers:

-   the General (S85) Schedule - opioid treatment authority application
    form (PB294), or
-   the Palliative Care Schedule - opioid treatment authority
    application form (PB306)
