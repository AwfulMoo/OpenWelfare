BasicsCard Balance on Receipt and EFTPOS Terminal

There are a group of national retailers that are BasicsCard Balance on
Receipt merchants. These merchants have the functionality to print
BasicsCard balances on EFTPOS receipts for customers.

BasicsCard balance enquiry line

The BasicsCard balance enquiry line is an automated Interactive Voice
Response (IVR) line for BasicsCard balances only. Customers will not be
able to be transferred to a Service Officer from this facility. Note:
exceptions apply, including remote and vulnerable customers. For more
information, see Conditions for transferring or referring calls.

A recorded message will advise customers that if they require any other
Income Management business they must call the Income Management Line.

Income Management Line

Customers contacting the Income Management Line will be presented with
the opportunity to authenticate using their Centrelink Access Number
(CAN) and self service PIN.

Customers who are unable to authenticate in the first instance will be
able to check their BasicsCard balance by:

-   selecting option 1 when requested
-   entering their 16 digit BasicsCard number (located on the front of
    their BasicsCard), and
-   then entering their 4 digit Personal Identification Number (PIN)

The customer will be transferred to a Service Officer if they input
their information incorrectly or if they choose to talk to a Service
Officer. Balance enquiries to this number are available 24 hours a day,
7 days a week.

Customers who are able to authenticate using the IVR will be presented
with the Services Australia phone self service menu, and they can check
their BasicsCard balance by:

selecting option 1 when requested

-   entering their Customer Access Number (CAN), and
-   then entering their a self service PIN, or

selecting option 2 when requested

-   entering their 16 digit BasicsCard number (located on the front of
    their BasicsCard), and
-   then entering their 4 digit Personal Identification Number (PIN)

Allocation Methods

All customers will have funds transferred into their BasicsCard account
in one of two models - the Residual Payment method or the Partial
Payment method.

Customers are able to change their BasicsCard allocation method by
contacting Services Australia.

[] Customers can also allocate funds to their BasicsCard through online
services or by contacting the agency. See Coding Income Management
Expenses for more information on allocating funds to the BasicsCard.

Daily spend limit and BasicsCard maximum balance

The BasicsCard daily spend limit is defaulted to $1,500, however, a
customer can request this amount to be varied between $20 and $1,500.

The BasicsCard maximum card balance is defaulted to $3,000, however, a
customer can request this amount to be varied between $100 and $3,000.

Transaction summary

BasicsCard transactions are able to be viewed and printed from the
Transaction Summary screen.

The Transaction History display can be refined to show successful and
declined transactions by 'Today's Transactions', 'Last 30 Days', or
'Transactions via a specified date range'.

BasicsCard Alternative Interface

The BasicsCard Alternative Interface is an external website maintained
by the Card Transaction Provider.

The BasicsCard Alternative Interface provides information relating to a
customer's BasicsCard balance, status, transaction history and status
updates. The BasicsCard Alternate Interface can be accessed by Service
Officers to suspend, reactivate and unblock BasicsCards, when the
BasicsCard Number is known. Generally, this is only used when the
Centrelink system and the National Index are not available. As it does
not contain any customer information, it cannot be used to locate a
customer's record or to verify a customer's identity.

The Resources page contains the Income Management Line and BasicsCard
Balance Enquiry Line phone numbers on the BasicsCard homepage, the
BasicsCard Alternative Interface, and the BasicsCard Contingency Support
System.
