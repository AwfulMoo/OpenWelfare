This document outlines the process to follow for Child Support customers
in financial hardship.

Financial hardship applications

Child Support customers can lodge a financial hardship application
where:

they have a debt, and

at the time collection action is being considered:

-   the customer is seeking to repay the debt via an ongoing payment
    arrangement, including Employer Withholding with Arrears (EWA)
    arrangements, or
-   Child Support are seeking to intercept funds (for example, tax
    refund intercept payments (TRIP) and s72A garnishee action)

A financial hardship application is a priority work item and must be
finalised within 48 hours.

For tax refund intercepts, consider collection action when the tax
refund is:

-   available to Child Support, or
-   expected to shortly become available to Child Support

Consider applying a special recovery condition if a tax return has not
been lodged at the time the customer wishes to make a hardship claim.

If a customer is seeking a concession to the amount being deducted from
their Income Support Payment.

Hardship applications will not be considered and refunds cannot occur
once the amount is applied to a customer’s debt and can be viewed on the
other party’s record, check the Payer Account Summary Window or the
Payee Account Summary window.

Financial hardship considerations and support

A customer is considered to be in financial hardship if they can show
that:

-   their necessary living expenses exceed their income, or
-   they have other necessary expenses to pay outside of these living
    expenses

Necessary expenses include, but are not limited to:

-   food
-   clothing
-   accommodation
-   utilities, and
-   education costs for children

Note: a person is not considered to be in financial hardship if paying
their debt merely limits social activities, entertainment, discretionary
spending or access to goods or services of a better nature or standard

Customers experiencing financial hardship may benefit from referral to:

-   a financial counselling service, or
-   information/tools to manage money on the Services Australia website
