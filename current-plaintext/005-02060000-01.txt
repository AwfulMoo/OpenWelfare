This document outlines information that covers some of the major issues
faced by refugees or holders of special humanitarian visas when first
arriving in Australia to settle.

Torture and/or trauma

Refugees coming from certain countries may have suffered torture,
witnessed the torture of someone close to them, experienced trauma by
being forced to flee their homes or countries, undergone victimisation
due to membership of political, ethnic or religious groups and
experienced war, political upheaval and fear for their lives.

The list below shows countries where inhabitants may have been subjected
to some form of torture and/or trauma:

-   Afghanistan
-   Bosnia – Herzegovina
-   Burma (Myanmar)
-   Burundi
-   Cambodia
-   Chile
-   Congo
-   Croatia
-   El Salvador
-   Eritrea
-   Ethiopia
-   Guatemala
-   Indonesia
-   Iran
-   Iraq
-   North Macedonia
-   Pakistan
-   Rwanda
-   Serbia
-   Slovenia
-   Somalia
-   Sri Lanka
-   Sudan
-   Turkey
-   Vietnam
-   Former Yugoslavia

For many refugees, the effects of torture and trauma are ongoing and
severely hamper their ability to communicate both verbally and in the
written sense, learn a new language, find suitable housing and to adjust
to the new ‘way of life’ within their host country.
