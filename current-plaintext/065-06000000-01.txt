This document outlines information relating to the benefits available to
a CSHC holder. The CSHC is issued for 12 months ending on 30 September
each year. All CSHC cards expire on the same day.

Government intent

The CSHC gives older Australians access to cheaper medicines, Australian
government medical services and other Government concessions.

Eligibility

To qualify for a CSHC the customer must:

-   have reached Age Pension age; and
-   not be receiving a Centrelink or Department of Veterans' Affairs
    payment; and
-   provide details of their tax file number (or be granted an exemption
    from doing so); and
-   meet residence requirements; and
-   meet the CSHC income test

Entitlements

The Commonwealth Government issues the CSHC. Some States and Territories
may offer further concessions to holders of both CSHCs and State Seniors
Cards.

CSHC holders may be entitled to:

-   pharmaceuticals listed under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme
    (PBS) at the concessional rate
-   bulk-billed General Practitioner (GP) appointments
-   a reduction in the cost of out-of-hospital medical expenses above a
    concessional threshold through the Medicare Safety Net

In some instances, extra health, household, transport, education and
recreation concessions may be offered by state or territory and local
governments and private providers.

Add on payments administered by Centrelink

Energy Supplement

The Energy supplement ceased for all new CSHC claimants from 20 March
2017. Only CSHC holders who are grandfathered for Energy Supplement will
get the payment from 20 March 2017 onwards. For detailed information,
see Energy Supplement for Commonwealth Seniors Health Card holders.

Economic Support Payment

CSHC holders are entitled to get the Economic Support Payment if they
were eligible during the target period(s). For further information, see
Economic Support Payment.

To get these payments, the customer must have a SHC payment destination
recorded on the Payment Destination Summary (PAS) screen.

[] Current CSHC Customers can add or update their payment destination
using their Centrelink self service.

Non-income tested concession card

Because of changes to the asset test, customers who had their pension
cancelled (CAN/ASS) with a 1 January 2017 date of effect, were
automatically issued non-income tested concession cards. If they were:

-   Age Pension age or over on 1 January 2017, a non-income tested Low
    Income Card (LIC) and a non-income tested CSHC were issued
-   under Age Pension age on 1 January 2017, a non-income tested LIC was
    issued. The customer can apply for the non-income tested CSHC when
    they reach Age Pension age

From 9 October 2017, a non-pensioner Pensioner Concession Card (PCC)
replaced the non-income tested LIC.

For more information, see Non-income tested (NOI) concession cards.

Customers paid under the Home Equity Access Scheme

Customers who get their entire payment as a loan via the Home Equity
Access Scheme (the Scheme) and do not receive any other components of
the qualifying social security pension, are not eligible for a Pensioner
Concession Card (PCC). These customers should be encouraged to claim a
CSHC.

The exception to this is for customers who had their pension cancelled
(CAN/ASS) on 1 January 2017 as a direct result of changes to the pension
assets test. The Home Equity Access Scheme only customers who are
grandfathered (GRF) for the grandfathering type 2017 Rebalance Assets
Cards (RAC), as per the Grandfathering Summary (GFS) screen, are
automatically eligible for a non-income tested CSHC from 1 January 2017
and a non-pensioner PCC from 9 October 2017. For more information, see
Non-income tested (NOI) concession cards.

Digital card

Customers can see a digital copy of their CSHC in the digital wallet via
their Express Plus Centrelink mobile app or the myGov app wallet. See
Resources page for a link.

It allows customers to use their concession card using their smart
device. It is at the discretion of the concession provider whether they
accept the digital card so it is important that customers have their
physical card with them.

The Resources page contains links to contact details for Pharmaceutical
Benefits Scheme (PBS), Medicare Safety Net information, digital wallet
and using the myGov app on the Services Australia website, and the Guide
to Centrelink Concession Cards publication.
