| 1                                 | Coercive information notice +     |
|                                   | Read more ...                     |

|                                   | Before issuing a coercive notice, |
|                                   | consider:                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   Alternatives. Whether the     |
|                                   |     information is available by   |
|                                   |     other means, for example a    |
|                                   |     voluntary request. The use of |
|                                   |     a notice might be the         |
|                                   |     preferred option, both for    |
|                                   |     the department and for notice |
|                                   |     recipients. Alternative ways  |
|                                   |     of obtaining information are  |
|                                   |     not always practical, for     |
|                                   |     example, if time is a crucial |
|                                   |     factor or the person is       |
|                                   |     unlikely to provide the       |
|                                   |     information voluntarily       |
|                                   | -   Compliance costs. Weigh up    |
|                                   |     the importance of the         |
|                                   |     information sought against    |
|                                   |     the probable cost to the      |
|                                   |     notice recipient of providing |
|                                   |     it                            |
|                                   | -   Scope. The use of a notice    |
|                                   |     must relate to administrative |
|                                   |     questions of establishing a   |
|                                   |     personâ€™s qualification,       |
|                                   |     payability and rate of        |
|                                   |     payment. The notice should    |
|                                   |     seek only the information     |
|                                   |     that is necessary for current |
|                                   |     information requirements      |
|                                   | -   Reasonable belief. There must |
|                                   |     be a reasonable belief        |
|                                   |     established that the notice   |
|                                   |     recipient is able to provide  |
|                                   |     the information or requested  |
|                                   |     documents                     |
