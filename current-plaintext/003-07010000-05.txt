|                                   | house due to having only $30 and  |

|                                   | the situation and decides         |
|                                   | returning home is not an option.  |
|                                   | Cindy contacts Services Australia |

|                                   | responsible for the incident has  |
|                                   | been removed                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Susan suffers family and domestic |
|                                   | violence by an abusive partner    |
|                                   | and takes up accommodation in a   |
|                                   | refuge. On the third day at the   |
|                                   | refuge, Susan lodges an AVO       |
|                                   | against the partner. The partner  |
|                                   | is removed from the home on the   |
|                                   | fourth day and Susan returns to   |
|                                   | the family home that same day.    |
|                                   | This is the point at which the    |
|                                   | claiming period begins. Susan has |
|                                   | 7 days to claim CrP from this     |
|                                   | day.                              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Susan only has $100 in a bank     |
|                                   | account and contacts Services     |
|                                   | Australia to claim for a CrP.     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | After being interviewed by the    |
|                                   | social worker at a local service  |
|                                   | centre, the CrP is granted. This  |
|                                   | is because Susan has contacted    |
|                                   | the agency 7 days after the       |
|                                   | responsible family member has     |
|                                   | been removed from the home and is |
|                                   | in severe financial hardship.     |

|                                   | Malika, who works part time. Over |
|                                   | the past few months, Malika has   |
|                                   | become more and more controlling  |
|                                   | of their finances and Jamal no    |
|                                   | longer has access to his money.   |
|                                   | Jamal lodges a claim for CrP-EXV, |
|                                   | but chooses to remain in the      |
|                                   | home.                             |

|                                   | Because Malika has not been       |

|                                   | established or does not intend to |
|                                   | establish a new home, the claim   |

|                                   | for a disaster relief payment     |
|                                   | such as an Australian Government  |
|                                   | Disaster Recovery Payment (AGDRP) |

|                                   | While Mary was out grocery        |
|                                   | shopping at the local shopping    |
|                                   | centre, someone broke into her    |
|                                   | home. Two weeks later, another    |
|                                   | incident occurred. Mary feels     |
|                                   | unsafe to remain in her property  |
|                                   | as the home invasion occurred     |
|                                   | twice in the past 2 weeks. Mary   |
|                                   | moved to a parent's house and     |
|                                   | terminated the lease. CrP is      |
|                                   | payable because Mary has left     |
|                                   | home and is intending to          |
|                                   | establish a new home because of   |
|                                   | an extreme circumstance.          |

|                                   | neighbour. Windows have been      |
|                                   | broken and property has been      |
|                                   | damaged.                          |

|                                   | Mitchel flees the house and fears |
|                                   | for his safety if he was to stay. |
|                                   | Mitchel finds shelter with a      |
|                                   | friend. Mitchel is severely       |
|                                   | traumatised and will not leave    |
|                                   | the safety of the friend's house. |
|                                   | After 8 days, Mitchel considers   |
|                                   | the situation and decides he      |
|                                   | cannot return home. Three days    |
|                                   | later Mitchel claims and is paid  |
|                                   | CrP, as the claim is made within  |
|                                   | the 7 days of the decision not to |

|                                   | Note: as the history of verbal    |
|                                   | abuse and violence is from        |

|                                   | Ashley's house is affected by an  |
|                                   | earthquake and has fallen off its |
|                                   | foundations, also destroying the  |
|                                   | plumbing. Ashley hopes to return  |
|                                   | home after the house has been     |
|                                   | repaired, but does not see this   |
|                                   | happening for several months. In  |
|                                   | the meantime, Ashley has          |
|                                   | established a new home elsewhere. |

|                                   | to establish a new home, as well  |

|                                   | new lease and a damage report,    |

|                                   | was recently given notice from    |

|                                   | is being sold and she needs to    |
|                                   | move out within 3 months. Neena   |

|                                   | online, providing the ‘for sale’  |
|                                   | ad as evidence that she has had   |
|                                   | to leave the home.                |

|                                   | Neena's claim was rejected, as    |

|                                   | foreseeable and avoidable due to  |
|                                   | the property owner giving her     |
|                                   | notice.                           |
