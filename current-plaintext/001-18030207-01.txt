This document outlines the Targeted Compliance Framework policy and
procedures that apply when a job seeker has refused, or failed to accept
or start suitable work.

Refusing, failing to accept or start suitable work

A work refusal failure has been committed if the job seeker refused,
failed to accept or failed to start suitable work without a reasonable
excuse.

Note: work refusal failures do not apply to ParentsNext participants.

If the job seeker does not have a reasonable excuse for a work refusal
failure, there are financial consequences. This includes payment
cancellation, and a post-cancellation non-payment period which affects
the start date for a participation payment if reclaimed within 4 weeks.

These financial consequences reinforce the expectation that
participation payments are only available to those who are genuine in
their efforts to move into paid work.

Work refusal failures identified by providers

When a provider becomes aware that a job seeker has refused, or failed
to accept or start work, contact with the job seeker is required to
determine if a work refusal will be reported to Services Australia.

-   Providers attempt contact with the job seeker on the day they become
    aware of the work refusal
-   If contact is unsuccessful, the provider submits a Work Refusal
    Report to Services Australia, automatically suspending participation
    payments until provider contact occurs. The provider also notifies
    the job seeker, usually via SMS, that their payment has stopped and
    they need to contact their provider to discuss a work refusal
    failure
-   When contact is established, the provider talks with the job seeker
    about the expectation that job seekers accept all offers of suitable
    paid work. The provider assesses if the work was suitable work for
    the job seeker, considering the position offered along with the job
    seeker's circumstances and assessed capacity. If work was suitable,
    the provider will also consider the job seeker's reason for refusing
    the work
-   If the provider decides that the work was not suitable, or accepts
    that the job seeker has a valid reason for refusing the work, the
    provider will end the Work Refusal Report and a compliance
    investigation is not generated
-   If the work was suitable, and a valid reason not provided, the
    provider will update the Work Refusal Report and advise the job
    seeker that they need to speak with Services Australia who will
    conduct a compliance investigation to determine whether a penalty
    will be applied

Work refusal failures reported by an employer

Employers who contact Services Australia to advise a job seeker has
refused work should be referred to the Employer Reporting Line run by
the Department of Education, Skills and Employment. The Resources page
contains a link to the website.

Decision maker responsibilities

Participation Solutions Team (PST)-skilled Service Officers who have a
WNPPD IT security resource investigate work refusal failures.

The PST-skilled Service Officer is responsible for:

-   delivering key messages about the expectation that job seekers
    actively seek to obtain and remain in suitable work
-   conducting a compliance investigation for the non-compliance event
    that has been reported, recording the relevant facts along with any
    supporting evidence in the Compliance investigation workflow
-   assessing whether the work was suitable where personal circumstances
    are identified that have not already been considered by the provider
-   assessing whether the job seeker had reasonable excuse for a work
    refusal failure
-   determining if a work refusal failure has been committed
-   explaining the consequences of a work refusal failure and review and
    appeal rights

Consultation with a PST-skilled Service Officer (SO5), PST-skilled
social worker or other specialist officer may be appropriate when
assessing the impact of job seeker circumstances on their capacity to
comply. See Accessing a PST-skilled social worker for information on
when consultation with a PST-skilled social worker may be required or
appropriate.

Non-compliance cancellation and post cancellation non-payment period

Where a work refusal failure has been committed, payment is cancelled
and a post cancellation non-payment period will affect the start date
for a participation payment if the job seeker reclaims within 4 weeks.

There are no waiver provisions for job seekers in financial hardship
during this post-cancellation non-payment period, however they will
maintain eligibility for a concession card and benefit rate Family Tax
Benefit (FTB).

At the end of, or during, the post cancellation non-payment period,
participation payments may be reclaimed, but payment will not start
until the post cancellation non-payment period has ended. RapidConnect
requirements apply and job seekers return to the zone they were in prior
to the non-compliance cancellation.

Job seekers transitioning between job seeker compliance systems

Job seekers will transition between job seeker compliance systems if
they change residential address and either start or cease to participate
in the Community Development Program (CDP).

Where job seeker transfers to a CDP provider:

-   an outstanding work refusal failures may still be investigated and
    applied
-   any non-compliance cancellation due to a work refusal failure or
    post-cancellation non-payment period will remain in place

refusal failures.
