This document outlines information about managing the expectations of
payers when they have overpaid child support.

Overpayment not enforced

If a payer asks Child Support not to enforce recovery of an overpayment,
remove the overpaid amount or balance from the Register.

Redirection of overpayment funds to other debts

If a payer has overdue child support, any money available from an
overpayment repayment will be used to pay the debt. Any residual amounts
will be refunded to the payer. The payer will receive written
notification of this action.

Refunds to payers

A payer can ask Child Support to recover the overpayment. Child Support
can only refund the payer after receiving funds from the payee repaying
the overpayment. Once this occurs payments are auto-paid to the payer if
Child Support has the payer’s bank account details.

The Resources page contains links to letters and examples of managing
overpayments.
