This document outlines details regarding restoration of Assistance for
Isolated Children (AIC) Scheme payments.

Return of Qualification

When it becomes clear that an applicant and student continues to be
entitled to AIC payments after a period of suspension or cancellation,
the payment will need to be restored.

Before restoring an applicant's payment, care should be taken to
establish that all the information required to establish eligibility has
been provided. If the decision to restore payment is made, an advice
must be sent to the applicant.
