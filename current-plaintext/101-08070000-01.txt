This document outlines information about the promotion of external
departments' and organisations' products and services via publicity
material.

Types of publicity material

From time to time Services Australia is asked to promote other
government and community initiatives by displaying products in our
service centres.

For example, the display of products from Workforce Australia providers
which have been contracted by the Department of Education, Skills and
Employment to provide employment services to registered job seekers.

However, service centre Managers and Service Leaders also have the
discretion to display publicity and advertising material for other
service providers, including employment agencies which are not Workforce
Australia providers.

Considerations

The following factors should be taken into consideration before deciding
to display promotional material for any service providers:

-   Promotional material displayed for an organisation not funded by the
    Australian Government should not adversely affect a funded
    organisation who is competing for a share in the same market, for
    example it may be appropriate to display material about assistance
    that is not offered by a local Workforce Australia or other funded
    organisation
-   Bias must be avoided where more than one organisation wishes to
    display its material
-   The promotional material should not be displayed in a way to give
    job seekers the impression that their attendance at such an
    employment agency will meet their mutual obligation requirements
-   Services Australia takes no responsibility for customers self
    selecting to attend such an agency and does not assess or connect
    them to that service
-   Posters should be no larger than A4-sized, not contain any negative
    references to other programs and emphasise that participation is
    voluntary. Handouts should be ready folded by the organisation to
    fit the standard display racks. Services Australia takes no
    responsibility for version control or removal of out of date
    leaflets for non funded providers
-   The agency is actively working to reduce the amount of printed
    products in its promotional and communication activity in favour of
    digital and other solutions. For more information, contact the
    Programs Information Branch
