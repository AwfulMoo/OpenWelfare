This document outlines how to monitor Inter-environment Change of
Address (ICoA) activities.

ICoA facility

The ICoA facility is a suite of programs and screens used to transfer
customer records between environments. The ICoA facility allows a user
to start and schedule an inter-environment transfer, and monitor the
status or progress of the transfer.

After a transfer has completed, the customer's record will be located in
the new environment. There is a need to monitor transfers to ensure all
required action is taken, and the record is transferred to allow ongoing
payments for the customer.

Situations which prevent a scheduled transfer from occurring are listed
on edit screens. Once the edits are fixed by the user, or cease to exist
(some edits cannot be actioned by the user, but finalise automatically),
then the customer's record is transferred.
