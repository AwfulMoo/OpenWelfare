This document outlines details about Defence Force Income Support
Allowance (DFISA) and the screens used by Services Australia staff.

DFISA

DFISA was an income support payment paid by the Department of Veterans’
Affairs (DVA) to customers (and their partners) whose social security
pension or benefit was reduced because of the inclusion of Adjusted
Disability Pension from DVA as assessable income.

From 1 January 2022, Adjusted Disability Pensions became exempt income
under the Social Security Act 1991 for income support payments. As such,
DFISA was no longer required.

Calculation of DFISA is still required for customers who are
retrospectively granted an Adjusted Disability Pension before 1 January
2022 or for reassessments of DFISA already paid to customers.

DFISA is automatically assessed and updated by the Services Australia
system for all customers who are paid an Adjusted Disability Pension
from DVA, and the amounts are subsequently transmitted to DVA for
payment.

DFISA screens

DFISA screens that display the rate of DFISA payable include:

-   DFISA Summary (DFS) screen (Process Direct and Customer First)
-   DFISA Calculation Details (DFD) screen (Customer First)
-   DFISA Lump Sum (DFLS) screen (Customer First)

These screens are viewable by all staff on a 'read only' basis.

DFISA screens can be only be updated by authorised staff from the DVA
Clearance Team if it is necessary to code manual rates of DFISA due to
system limitations.

A transmission containing the new DFISA details is sent to DVA whenever
a DFISA screen is updated (both manually and automatically).
