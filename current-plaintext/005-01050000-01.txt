This document outlines procedures that assist newly arrived migrants in
the three key areas of settlement, job search and English language
skills.

Available assistance for newly arrived migrants

The Department of Social Services (DSS), along with state and territory
governments provide funding to agencies and organisations that provide
assistance with the many issues surrounding migrant settlement, mental
and physical health and the support provided by small or emerging
communities. The Department of Social Services (DSS) also provides
Specialised and Intensive Services (SIS) to support refugees and
humanitarian entrants where pre-migration experiences, severe physical
and mental health conditions, or crisis events after arrival in
Australia present significant barriers to successful settlement.

Other departments, such as the Department of Education, Skills and
Employment provide funding and support to organisations that provide
assistance to job seekers from culturally and linguistically diverse
(CALD) backgrounds.

To assist job seekers from non-English speaking backgrounds to increase
their English language skills and to overcome any language barriers to
employment, English tuition programs are available and funded by the
Department of Education, Skills and Employment.
