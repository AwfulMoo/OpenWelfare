Important information
An Income statement is used by a business approved to use Centrelink
Confirmation eServices (CCeS). It shows the gross value (circumstances
data) of all income and asset types for a customer. It includes any that
are exempt under a Centrelink income and asset test. It allows a
business to assess the customer's financial circumstances and
eligibility for a service. Income statements do not show assessable
data.
A Centrelink statement is used if a customer needs to show the details
Services Australia use to assess eligibility, not an Income statement.

This page has the process to issue the Income statement and the Detailed
income and asset statement. Note: if the customer needs a statement with
assessable amounts a Centrelink statement can be requested instead of an
Income statement.

This table outlines how to action requests for an Income statement and
