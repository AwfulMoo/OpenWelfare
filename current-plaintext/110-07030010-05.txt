|                                   | Jacob receives Youth Allowance as |
|                                   | a full-time student and has an    |
|                                   | Equivalent Full Time Study load   |
|                                   | (EFTSL) of 0.375 for the first    |
|                                   | semester. On 23 February 2018,    |
|                                   | Jacob drops 1 unit of study and   |
|                                   | his study load changes to 0.250,  |
|                                   | triggering a PUE CART review.     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | When Jacob completes the CART     |
|                                   | review online, Jacob indicates    |
|                                   | full-time, and is asked to        |
|                                   | provide proof of enrolment. The   |
|                                   | evidence provided by Jacob        |
|                                   | indicates enrolment in an         |
|                                   | additional unit on the 2 March    |
|                                   | 2018, and EFTSL is 0.375 from     |
|                                   | that date.                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Because Jacob has increased his   |
|                                   | study load to full-time within 14 |
|                                   | days of dropping the first unit,  |
|                                   | it is considered to be satisfying |
|                                   | the student activity test, and is |
|                                   | payable for the brief period the  |
|                                   | EFTSL was 0.250                   |

|                                   | to return to full-time study in   |
|                                   | Semester 1, 2019.                 |

|                                   | new claim if he wishes to test    |
