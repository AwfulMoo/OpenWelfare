This document outlines information and processes on how to process a
daily resolution in the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR).

Daily resolution

The daily resolution system runs after the Medicare consumer update and
attempts to match new and existing Supplementary Identification Number
(SIN) records to Personal Identification Number (PIN) or other SIN
records stored on the AIR.

According to the pre-determined set of criteria, resolution may
automatically match records in AIR Mainframe or pass them to the YCRI -
Daily resolution-selection list screen for manual operator processing.

Search for an unmatched individual

There are instances where an individual has been added to the AIR with
an:

-   incorrect date of birth
-   incorrect name

In these instances, the details of the correct person may not be
displayed in daily resolution. Additional searches for a SIN record
should be performed and include an address search or enrolment history
enquiry (if Medicare number is present) in the Consumer Directory
Maintenance System (CDMS).
