This document outlines information on how to action Manual Follow-ups
(MFU) on aged care means assessments in Customer First.

Aged care manual follow-ups

A manual follow-up (MFU) can be created manually by a Service Officer or
generated automatically as a Transfer Action Generator (TAG) MFU when an
action or reassessment is undertaken on a Customer First record.

The data for MFUs is available through the Aged Care (RCA) system and
some MFUs may be referred to as aged care MFUs.

Aged care MFUs are created when a care recipient is in receipt of an
income support payment or in receipt of a Commonwealth Seniors Health
Care Card (CSHC) and can be divided into the following categories:

Entries:

-   when a care recipient has entered permanent residential care and the
    Accommodation Circumstances (AC) screen has been updated
-   when an entry event has created an RCA/NCL or RCA/HOM activity which
    has not yet been completed and an online or assisted claim is
    subsequently lodged

Discharges:

-   a care recipient has been coded as discharged (including when they
    are deceased) by a home care or residential care service provider

The Resources page contains contact details for the Aged Care Allied
Health Service Delivery Team (MPB) and the MPB email template -
notification of overlapping dates.
