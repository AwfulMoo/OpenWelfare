This document explains eligibility, payment rates and claiming options
for the COVID-19 Disaster Payment - New South Wales.

Due to changes in the relevant areas deemed a COVID-19 hotspot for
different parts of New South Wales since August 2021, staff must
carefully check the impact reason and relevant area a customer is
claiming under.

The claiming period for this event has ended. Staff will only assess
online claims for this event that were lodged before the claiming period
ended or phone claims where special circumstances apply.

For staff not trained in processing claims, complete a cold
(unannounced) transfer to 'COVID-19 Disaster Payment' in Services
Australia Workspace.

If a customer calls about the status of their claim or automatic
payment, see Status of claim - customer calls to enquire for what to
tell the customer.

All New South Wales online claims that do not meet eligibility
requirements can be rejected, except when the customer has a pending
Income Support Payment.

To receive a payment

To receive a payment a customer must:

-   be unable to attend work and therefore unable to earn their usual
    income because of a state public health order for restricted
    movement, and
-   meet the general eligibility criteria

The 'unable to attend work and therefore unable to earn their usual
income' criteria is different for:

-   relevant period 1 and 2 Sydney and Greater Sydney claims
-   relevant period 3 and onwards Sydney and Greater Sydney claims, and
    All Other Areas in NSW claim

General eligibility

For online claims for this payment, do not contact customers to confirm
online claim details unless advised to do so by the Level 2 Helpdesk.

Do not follow this procedure for any other event.

A customer qualifies if they meet all of the following on the same day
for at least 1 day in the relevant period:

an Australian resident (through legal permanent residence and residing
in Australia) or a holder of a visa class permitted to work in
Australia, (to check these, see Resources for visa subclasses), and in
Australia at the time of their claim

be at least 17 years old

impacted as they either:

-   live or work in a relevant area subject to a state public health
    order for restricted movement that is a deemed a COVID-19 hotspot by
    the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer, or
-   were present in a COVID-19 hotspot at the time the restricted
    movement was declared and are now subject to a second public health
    order that restricts their movement in the state or territory they
    are currently in, or
-   live or work in a state or territory that has an area subject to a
    state public health order for restricted movement by the
    Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer

for relevant period 1 Sydney and Greater Sydney claims only, declared
they have liquid assets of less than $10,000. If a customer has $10,000
in a joint bank account, their accessible asset is $5,000. (No liquid
asset criteria applies for relevant period 2 and onwards Sydney and
Greater Sydney claims or All Other Areas in NSW claims)

would have worked on or after the eighth day of a state public health
order for restricted movement in Sydney and Greater Sydney or would have
worked on or after the first day of a state public health order for
restricted movement in All Other Areas NSW

not received the COVID-19 Disaster Payment for the same relevant period,
or part thereof

has not received or will not receive an income support payment
(including a zero rate) for any day in the COVID-19 Disaster Payment
relevant period they are claiming for
Note: if a customer chooses to cancel an income support payment to
receive the COVID-19 Disaster Payment, this should be for a date before
the relevant period starts. 'Zero rate' does not include customers with
a pending, assessed (ASS) or suspended (SUS) status. See Income support
payment customers

has not received or will not receive any of the following payments, for
any day in the COVID-19 Disaster Payment relevant period they are
claiming for:

-   state pandemic payment
-   Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment
-   state small business payment
-   Dad and Partner Pay (DAP)
-   Parental Leave Pay (PPL),
    Note: staff must consider the period a payment was paid for not the
    date the customer received a payment

not receiving pandemic-related paid leave entitlements, or will use them
up during the same relevant period, and

for any day in the COVID-19 Disaster Payment relevant period they are
claiming for, their employer has not received or will not receive the
Retaining Domestic Airline Capability (RDAC) payment on their behalf.
Note: staff must consider the period the payment was paid for, not the
date the employer received the payment on the customer’s behalf

To receive a payment, customers must also be unable to attend work and
therefore unable to earn their usual income due to a state public health
order for restricted movement.

The 'unable to attend work and therefore unable to earn an income'
criteria is different for:

-   relevant period 1 and 2 Sydney and Greater Sydney claims
-   relevant period 3 and onwards Sydney and Greater Sydney claims and
    All Other Areas in NSW claims

To be eligible for the COVID-19 Disaster Payment after New South Wales
reaches

80% full vaccination of its population who are aged 16 years and older,
a customer must:

have received a COVID-19 Disaster Payment in:

-   Sydney – relevant period 16
-   Greater Sydney – relevant periods 16
-   All Other Areas in NSW – relevant periods 14, and

continue to meet the eligibility criteria

A customer who is in gaol or imprisoned is not eligible for the COVID-19
Disaster Payment.

Where a customer’s employer has not allowed them to attend work and earn
their usual income, as they are not vaccinated against COVID-19, the
customer may be eligible if they meet all eligibility criteria.

Self-employed customers can have the same work and home address

Customers involved in a trust or company

Customers who only derive their income from a trust or company
(distributions/dividends) are not eligible:

-   a customer must be working and due to the restricted movement be
    unable to work and therefore unable to earn an income
-   distributions/dividends will not count as employment as the
    restricted movement is not affecting their income

Loans made to a private trust or private company must not be considered
liquid assets:

-   if customers are involved in private trusts or private companies,
    the liquid assets of the entity must not be considered when
    assessing their eligibility for this payment
-   do not refer these claims to a Complex Assessment Officer (CAO)

Company directors

A customer who is a company director, even when they draw a wage from
the business, cannot receive the COVID-19 Disaster Payment if the
business has received a state small business payment.

The customer may be eligible to receive the COVID-19 Disaster Payment
if:

-   the business has not received a state small business payment,
-   the customer draws a wage from the business, and
-   all other eligibility criteria is met

For help assessing eligibility:

-   see the scenarios
-   contact Technical Peer Support

3 impact reasons

Due to changes in the relevant areas deemed a COVID-19 hotspot for
different parts of New South Wales since August 2021, staff must
carefully check which impact reason and relevant area a customer is
claiming under.

COVID-19 hotspot areas are:

-   decided by the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer, and
-   not the same as ‘stay at home orders’ which are decided by
    state/territory governments

Customers claiming the COVID-19 Disaster Payment can claim under 1 of 3
impact reasons.

Impact reason 1

Customers who live or work in a relevant area deemed a COVID-19 hotspot
can apply under the following reason if they are unable to work and earn
their usual income:

-   live or work in a relevant area subject to a state public health
    order for restricted movement that is a deemed a COVID-19 hotspot by
    the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer

Impact reason 2

Customers who were present in a relevant area deemed a COVID-19 hotspot
can apply under the following reason if they are unable to work and earn
their usual income:

-   were present in a COVID-19 hotspot at the time the restricted
    movement was declared and are now subject to a second public health
    order that restricts their movement in the state or territory they
    are currently in

Impact reason 3

In NSW, customers not living or working in a relevant area deemed
COVID-19 hotspot can apply under the following third reason if they are
unable to work and earn their usual income:

-   live or work in a state or territory that has an area subject to a
    state public health order for restricted movement by the
    Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer
    Note: for online claims, this shows as ‘I am impacted by a COVID-19
    restricted movement/lockdown, but do not live, work and was not
    present in a COVID-19 hotspot area’

See Relevant areas.

Unable to attend work and earn usual income - relevant period 1 and 2 Sydney and Greater Sydney claims

The following applies to:

Relevant areas in Sydney for:

-   Relevant period 1: 1-7 July 2021 inclusive
-   Relevant period 2: 8-14 July 2021 inclusive

Relevant areas in Greater Sydney for:

-   Relevant period 1: 4-10 July 2021 inclusive
-   Relevant period 2: 11-17 July 2021 inclusive

To receive a payment, customers must be ‘unable to attend work and
therefore unable to earn their usual income due to a state public health
order for restricted movement’.

This means the customer cannot earn their usual amount of income from
any employer (existing or new).

That is, if a customer has lost income from an employer, but is able to
regain the same lost income from a new employer, they:

-   can attend work and earn their usual income, and
-   are not eligible to receive a payment

A person may be unable to attend work and earn their usual income for a
number of reasons related to the restricted movement conditions. This
includes where customers are:

-   not permitted or unable to work from home, and
-   cannot attend work due to caring responsibilities

Unable to attend work and therefore unable to earn their usual income
means the customer must have lost at least 1 full day of work in the
relevant period.

If a customer was scheduled to work 10 hours and still worked 8 hours of
that shift, they do not meet this criteria, as they have not lost at
least 1 full day of work.

For payment rates, see Payment rates - relevant period 1 and 2 Sydney
and Greater Sydney claims.

The payment rate the customer receives is based on hours of work lost
during the relevant period, not hours the customer would have worked if
the restricted movement did not occur.

If a customer only works in a relevant area (does not live in a relevant
area)

Hours of work lost must only be included for employers in a Relevant
area in Sydney or Relevant area in Greater Sydney

-   Use the Geospatial tool to check this

This is because relevant period 1 and 2 Sydney and Greater Sydney were
activated before customers could claim for a relevant period and
relevant area in All Other Areas in NSW

Note: this criteria is different for:

-   relevant period 3 and onwards Sydney and Greater Sydney claims and
    All Other Areas in NSW claims
-   all other events - check the Operational Blueprint for the event

-   Relevant period 15: 24-30 October 2021 inclusive
-   Relevant period 16: 31 October to 6 November 2021 inclusive

To receive a payment, customers must be ‘unable to attend work and
therefore unable to earn their usual income due to a state public health
order for restricted movement’.

This means the customer cannot earn their usual amount of income from
any employer (existing or new).

That is, if a customer has lost income from an employer, but is able to
regain the same lost income from a new employer, they:

-   can attend work and earn their usual income, and
-   are not eligible to receive a payment

Reasons a person may be unable to attend work and earn their usual
income

A person may be unable to attend work and earn their usual income for a
number of reasons related to the restricted movement conditions. This
includes where customers:

-   are not permitted or unable to work from home
-   cannot attend work due to caring responsibilities
-   are not vaccinated against COVID-19
-   have an exemption from wearing a mask, however, cannot work because
    of a state public health order mandating mask wearing (this must be
    because of a state public health order and not because of a
    condition an employer has placed on a person’s employment)

Unable to attend work and therefore unable to earn their usual income
means the customer, in the relevant period, must have lost at least:

-   8 hours of work, or
-   1 full day of work

A full day of work does not need to be at least 8 hours.

For example:

A customer normally works a 3 hour shift during the relevant period and
cannot attend that shift because of the restricted movement. The
customer meets the 'unable to attend work and therefore unable to earn
their usual income' criteria as they have lost 1 full day of work in the
relevant period

If a customer does not lose 1 full day of work, they must lose at least
8 hours of work in the relevant period. For example:

-   A customer normally works 1 x 10 hour shift during the relevant
    period. They work 5 hours of that shift. The customer does not meet
    the 'unable to attend work and therefore unable to earn their usual
    income' criteria as they have not lost at least 8 hours of work or 1
    full day of work in the relevant period
-   A customer normally works 2 x 10 hours shifts during the relevant
    period. They work 5 hours each day of those 2 shifts. The customer
    does meet the 'unable to attend work and therefore unable to earn
    their usual income' criteria as they have lost 10 hours of work in
    the relevant period

The payment rate the customer receives is based on hours of work lost
during the relevant period, not hours the customer would have worked if
the restricted movement did not occur.

For payment rates, see Payment rates - relevant period 3 and onwards
Sydney and Greater Sydney claims and All Other Areas in NSW claims.

Relevant periods

Claims cannot be lodged until the claiming period for a relevant period

All Other Areas in NSW

There are 14 relevant periods for All Other Areas in NSW.

Due to changes in the relevant areas deemed a COVID-19 hotspot for
different parts of New South Wales since August 2021, staff must
carefully check which impact reason and relevant area a customer is
claiming under.

-   Relevant period 1: 18-24 July 2021 inclusive
-   Relevant period 2: 25-31 July 2021 inclusive
-   Relevant period 3: 1-7 August 2021 inclusive

a payment for all future relevant periods (they do not need to lodge a
new claim), unless:

-   they advise of a change in circumstances that changes the rate of
    payment

    period

Note: the length of the relevant period does not impact the rate of the
automatic payment.

Where automatic payments stop

When New South Wales reaches 70% full vaccination of its population who
are aged 16 years and older:

-   automatic payments will stop
-   customers must reapply for each relevant period

Customers in New South Wales receiving automatic payments will receive
their final automatic payment for:

-   Sydney - relevant period 15
-   Greater Sydney - relevant period 14
-   All Other Areas in NSW - relevant period 12

To continue receiving COVID-19 Disaster Payment from the next relevant
period, customers must reapply for each relevant period.

Note: automatic payments will continue to apply to all claims for
relevant periods before the final automatic payment, up to and including
the final automatic payment relevant periods above.

Customers who previously claimed:

-   online, should continue to use their myGov account to apply
-   over the phone, can now claim online. See Claiming options

An abridged claim process will apply in certain circumstances.

COVID-19 Disaster Payment ending

When New South Wales reaches 80% full vaccination of its population who
are aged 16 years and older:

the payment will reduce over 2 weeks before ending

-   if this happens part way through the relevant period, the customer
    will get paid the full weekly payment for that period

New South Wales reached the 80% full vaccination mark of its population
who are aged 16 years and older on 17 October 2021. This means the first
reduction in payment will apply to:

-   Sydney – Relevant period 17
-   Greater Sydney – Relevant period 17
-   All Other Areas in NSW – Relevant period 15

See Payment amount - relevant period 3 and onwards Sydney and Greater
Sydney claims and All Other Areas in NSW claims.

Customers requiring further financial assistance after the end of the
COVID-19 Disaster Payment should go to Payment and Service Finder to
find the most appropriate payment and/or service for them.

Relevant areas

There are 3 groups of 'relevant areas':

-   Sydney
-   Greater Sydney
-   All Other Areas in NSW

Due to changes in the relevant areas deemed a COVID-19 hotspot for
different parts of New South Wales since August 2021, staff must
carefully check which impact reason and relevant area a customer is
claiming under.

Staff must use the Geospatial tool to determine if a customer lives,
works or was present in an area deemed a COVID-19 hotspot.

If a customer is claiming under the impact reason 'live or work in a
state or territory that has an area subject to a state public health
order for restricted movement' the customer's residential and/or
employer address must be in New South Wales.

Present in

For the purposes of the COVID-19 Disaster Payment - New South Wales, the
eligibility criteria covers whether a customer lives, works or has been
present in (visited) a relevant area. The area must be:

-   'declared a COVID-19 hotspot' and
-   under period of restricted movement

A second public health order:

-   is a state or territory public health order that restricts a
    person's movement, due to them being in a COVID-19 hotspot that was
    also under a restricted movement order at the time they were there,
    even if they are now in another location
-   includes stay at home orders, self-quarantine or mandatory
    (supervised) quarantine
-   can differ depending on the home state or territory

Claims are assessed for the existing relevant periods for the Sydney and
Greater Sydney events.

The address the customer was present in within the COVID-19 hotspot area
will be checked using the Geospatial tool to make sure the relevant area
was 'declared a COVID-19 hotspot' and is under a period of restricted
movement.

Insufficient appropriate leave or pandemic related paid leave entitlements

To get the COVID-19 Disaster Payment, a customer must have 'insufficient
appropriate paid leave entitlements (including any special pandemic
leave) or pandemic related paid leave entitlements, or will use them up
during the same relevant period'.

Appropriate leave includes paid special pandemic leave.

Insufficient appropriate leave means the customer:

-   has no appropriate leave entitlements under a relevant industrial
    instrument or by agreement with their employer including any special
    pandemic leave
-   does not have enough days of appropriate leave to cover the relevant
    period, or
-   the employer is unable to pay appropriate leave entitlements because
    of financial hardship

Appropriate leave does not include:

-   annual leave
-   long service leave
-   unpaid leave
-   another leave type they are not entitled to access, such as paid
    sick and carer's leave or compassionate leave when they have been
    stood down without pay by their employer under the Fair Work Act

Customers do not need to take:

accrued leave entitlements such as:

-   annual leave
-   long service leave
-   unpaid leave

leave they are not entitled to access if they have been stood down
without pay by their employer under the Fair Work Act, for example:

-   paid sick leave
-   carer's leave
-   compassionate leave

However, if a customer is receiving any of the above leave types,
including pandemic related leave entitlements, during the entire
relevant period, they:

-   have not lost income, and
-   are not eligible to receive the COVID-19 Disaster Payment

For unpaid leave, while the customer may have lost income, they would
not meet the 'would have worked' criteria. That is, if a person is on
unpaid leave, they would not have worked even if the restricted movement
did not occur.

If appropriate leave or pandemic related paid leave entitlements do not
cover the entire relevant period, the customer meets this eligibility
requirement.

For example, if a customer has appropriate leave or pandemic related
paid leave entitlements that cover 3 days of the relevant period, they
meet this eligibility requirement. Note: the customer must meet all
eligibility requirements for at least 1 day in the remaining period.

A customer will not meet this eligibility requirement if appropriate
leave or pandemic related paid leave entitlements they have received or
will receive cover the full relevant period.

Payment amount - relevant period 1 and 2 Sydney and Greater Sydney claims

For relevant period 1 and 2 Sydney and Greater Sydney claims only, the
customer must have lost at least 1 full day of work.

If the customer meets all eligibility criteria, the payment amount is:

-   $325 if they have lost less than 20 hours of work in the relevant
    period
-   $500 if they have lost 20 hours or more or work in the relevant
    period

The payment cannot be paid pro rata. The customer must be paid the full
amount of $325 or $500.

Payment amount - relevant period 3 and onwards Sydney and Greater Sydney claims and All Other Areas in NSW claims

For relevant period 3 and onwards Sydney and Greater Sydney claims and
All Other Areas in NSW claims, the customer must have lost at least 8
hours of work or a full day of work.

Payment rates depend on the relevant period a customer is claiming for:

If the customer has lost:

-   at least 8 hours and less than 20 hours of work, or a full day of
    work in the relevant period, they will receive $375 or $450,
    depending on the relevant period
-   at least 20 hours or more of work in the relevant period, they will
    receive $600 or $750, depending on the relevant period

The payment cannot be paid pro rata. The customer must be paid the full
amount of $375/$450 or $600/$750.

For payment rates for each relevant period, see the Resources page.
