|                                   | place Geoff into financial        |

|                                   | this and invited to request a     |

|                                   | ($178.75), so Louise has room     |

| 1                                 | Question: What is the tax status  |
|                                   | of an advance payment?            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: For tax purposes, advance |
|                                   | payments are treated as a 'loan   |
|                                   | of money'. This applies           |
|                                   | irrespective of when the advance  |
|                                   | payment was paid during the       |
|                                   | financial year. Advance payments  |
|                                   | do not attract any additional tax |
|                                   | liability as they are not an      |
|                                   | extra payment but a lump sum      |
|                                   | payment of the customer's ongoing |
|                                   | entitlement.                      |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 2                                 | Question: If an advance has been  |
|                                   | processed in error, can this be   |
|                                   | undone?                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: If the advance has been   |
|                                   | processed due to fraudulent claim |
|                                   | or has been granted on an         |
|                                   | incorrect record, the advance can |
|                                   | be removed by ICT. See Deletion   |
|                                   | of advance granted on incorrect   |
|                                   | record or fraudulently claimed.   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 3                                 | Question: If a customer calls to  |
|                                   | request an advance payment (and   |
|                                   | it has been processed), can the   |
|                                   | customer contact the Department   |
|                                   | later the same day to advise they |
|                                   | no longer wish to receive the     |
|                                   | advance and request it be         |
|                                   | cancelled?                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: No. Once the advance has  |
|                                   | been processed, the decision has  |
|                                   | been made under legislation to    |
|                                   | meet the customer's request. The  |
|                                   | customer should be advised the    |
|                                   | advance has been processed and    |
|                                   | payment has been made.            |

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Question: Is a customer entitled  |
|                                   | to an advance payment if they     |
|                                   | have a temporarily written off    |
|                                   | overpayment?                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: A temporarily written off |
|                                   | overpayment is still a            |
|                                   | recoverable debt owing to the     |
|                                   | Commonwealth Government and       |
|                                   | therefore the customer is not     |
|                                   | entitled to an advance payment.   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The exception to this is for FTB  |
|                                   | advances, if the debt has been    |
|                                   | temporarily written off due to an |
|                                   | ex-partner non-lodged debt or     |
|                                   | bankruptcy debt, these debts will |
|                                   | not affect their eligibility for  |
|                                   | an advance payment.               |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 2                                 | Question: Is the customer         |
|                                   | entitled to an advance payment if |
|                                   | they have a permanently written   |
|                                   | off overpayment?                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: If the overpayment has    |
|                                   | been permanently written off,     |
|                                   | while the customer still owes the |
|                                   | amount to the Commonwealth        |
|                                   | Government, it is no longer       |
|                                   | recoverable by means of           |
|                                   | deductions. This means the        |
|                                   | customer is eligible for an       |
|                                   | advance payment.                  |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 3                                 | Question: Should a Service        |
|                                   | Officer grant a customer an       |
|                                   | advance when they apply with an   |
|                                   | outstanding debt balance of less  |
|                                   | than 5 cents?                     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: Yes. When a customer pays |
|                                   | an outstanding balance of a debt  |
|                                   | but a rounding amount remains     |
|                                   | outstanding, any advance payment  |
|                                   | application will automatically    |
|                                   | reject. Service Officers are      |
|                                   | allowed in these instances to     |
|                                   | override the rejection using the  |
|                                   | advance payment workflow where    |
|                                   | the customer has an outstanding   |
|                                   | debt balance of less than five    |
|                                   | cents. This is so the customer is |
|                                   | not disadvantaged by the          |
|                                   | administrative process which      |
|                                   | occurs as the remaining rounding  |
|                                   | amount will not clear until the   |
|                                   | customer's next pay day.          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Example: Customer has a debt for  |
|                                   | $234.67, they attend a Post       |
|                                   | Office to pay the full amount but |
|                                   | due to rounding, can only pay     |
|                                   | $234.65 (the customer cannot pay  |
|                                   | more than the amount due). The    |
|                                   | 0.02 cents outstanding will not   |
|                                   | clear until the customer's next   |
|                                   | payday. A Service Officer can     |
|                                   | manually override the application |
|                                   | rejection and process the next    |
|                                   | advance if the customer meets all |
|                                   | the other qualification criteria. |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 4                                 | Question: If the customer has a   |
|                                   | Compensation Insurer debt that    |
|                                   | has not been repaid, can they     |
|                                   | receive an advance payment?       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: This type of debt does    |
|                                   | not meet the qualification        |
|                                   | requirements and should not       |
|                                   | prevent the customer from         |
|                                   | receiving an advance. The debt is |
|                                   | owed to the Commonwealth by the   |
|                                   | insurer, not the customer.        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | As the system cannot identify     |
|                                   | this type of debt from other      |
|                                   | debts, the workflow will          |
|                                   | automatically reject the          |
|                                   | application. In these cases, the  |
|                                   | rejection should be overridden.   |

|                                   | Answer: The system will generate  |
|                                   | a repayment amount spread over    |
|                                   | the next 13 fortnight period.     |

|                                   | If the amount of repayment        |
|                                   | requested by the customer is      |
|                                   | equal to or greater than the      |
|                                   | system generated amount, this     |
|                                   | amount is accepted and updated on |
|                                   | the customer's record when the    |
|                                   | advance payment is being granted. |

|                                   | If the amount of repayment        |
|                                   | requested by the customer is less |
|                                   | than the system generated amount, |
|                                   | the customer's advance payment    |
|                                   | will be rejected as the customer  |

|                                   | Answer: Yes. Customers may        |
|                                   | request their rate of repayment   |
|                                   | to be increased.                  |

|                                   | Answer: Yes. [] Customers can     |
|                                   | request to increase their rate of |
|                                   | repayment. The preferred channel  |
|                                   | is to use Centrelink online       |
|                                   | account or the Express Plus       |
|                                   | mobile app. This request will be  |
|                                   | approved only if the customer     |
|                                   | will not suffer severe financial  |
|                                   | hardship.                         |

|                                   | The increased amount must be less |
|                                   | than or equal to twice the        |
|                                   | legislated repayment amount which |
|                                   | is determined by dividing the     |
|                                   | advance amount by 13. For         |
|                                   | example, a $500 advance equals    |
|                                   | repayments of $38.50 per          |
|                                   | fortnight, therefore the increase |
|                                   | should not exceed $77 per         |
|                                   | fortnight.                        |

|                                   | decreased amount is greater than  |
|                                   | or equal to the prior legislated  |
|                                   | repayment amount. This is         |
|                                   | determined by dividing the        |
|                                   | advance amount by 13. For         |
|                                   | example, a $500 advance equals    |
|                                   | repayments of $38.50 per          |
