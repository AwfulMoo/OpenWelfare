On this page:

Applying for the away from home rate

ABSTUDY claimants can apply for away from home rate in the initial claim
by:

-   using the ABSTUDY Claiming Tool (secondary students only)
-   online claim (tertiary students and Australian Apprentices only)
-   Assisted Customer Claim (ACC) (tertiary students and Australian
    Apprentices only), or
-   completing the Claim for ABSTUDY (SY019)

Customers can also apply for the away from home rate while in receipt of
ABSTUDY allowances by providing details of the home and/or study
circumstances in a statement (verbal or written).

Cessation of the away from home rate

Secondary students impacted by COVID-19

During the COVID-19 pandemic which occurred in Australia from March
2020, some boarding providers closed and others had reduced capacity due
to social distancing requirements within the board facility.
Additionally, some students may not be able to return to their private
board arrangements. Students who returned to the permanent home and did
not return to their boarding arrangements in Term 2, 3 or 4 in 2020 or
Terms 3 or 4 of 2021 may continue to be entitled to the away from home
rate.

Continuing students

Students remain entitled to the away from home rate in Term 2, 3 and 4
in 2020 or Term 3 and 4 of 2021 if:

-   they were approved for boarding entitlements in the term immediately
    prior
-   their board provider holds a boarding place for them
-   the student intends to return to board as soon as possible, and
-   the school/board provider continues to support the student study
    remotely using other methods, such as online

Continuing students who changed board providers

Entitlement to the away from home rate for continuing students who
commenced with a new board provider in Term 2 in 2020 or Term 3 of 2021
was dependant on their study mode and enrolment or acceptance date,
regardless of whether they qualified in Term 1 2020 or Term 2 2021. The
following students remained entitled:

-   students who attended in person, or
-   students studying remotely and who were accepted to board before the
    end of Term 1 in 2020 or Term 2 of 2021 to commence in Term 2 in
    2020 or Terms 3 of 2021, and
-   continue to meet an away from home criteria for Term 2 in 2020 or
    Term 3 of 2021

Students with a new boarding provider, who were accepted to board after
the start of Term 2 in 2020 or Term 3 of 2021 were not entitled to the
away from home rate for Term 2 in 2020 or Term 3 of 2021 where they did
not attend in person.

Continuing students who started with a new boarding provider in Term 3
or 4 in 2020 or Term 4 of 2021 were only entitled if they physically
attended the new boarding provider during the term they commenced.

New Claims

For ABSTUDY boarding claims granted from 1 April 2020, a student will be
entitled to the away from home rate in Term 2 if they were:

-   accepted to board before the end of Term 1 and will study either in
    person or online during Term 2, or
-   accepted to board after the start of Term 2 and will physically
    attend at the boarding provider during Term 2

For ABSTUDY boarding claims granted from 1 July 2021, a student will be
entitled to the away from home rate in Term 3 if they were:

-   accepted to board before the end of Term 2 and will study either in
    person or online during Term 3, or
-   accepted to board after the start of Term 3 and will physically
    attend at the boarding provider during Term 3

For ABSTUDY boarding claims granted from 1 July 2020 for Term 3 or 1
October 2020 or 2021 for Term 4, the student is entitled to the away
from home rate only where they physically attended the boarding provider
during the term they commenced.

Where students with new claims were entitled to the away from home rate,
claims should be assessed as per Assessing a claim for ABSTUDY Schooling
B Award, Tertiary Award and Masters and Doctorate Award. In Term 2, 3
and 4 of 2020 the Payment on Advice process did not occur, these claims
are granted from:

-   1 April 2020 for Term 2,
-   1 July 2020 for Term 3, or
-   1 October for Term 4

There was no change for students who continued to board and study in
person.

Tertiary students impacted by COVID-19

During the COVID-19 pandemic, which occurred in Australia from March
2020, some students were required to leave their on campus term
accommodation. Many students also transitioned to online study as
face-to-face teaching was unavailable.

Students who were receiving the away from home rate, and temporarily
transitioned to online learning as a result of COVID-19 remain eligible
for the away from home rate. Tertiary students must return to
face-to-face study as soon as it becomes available to continue to be
eligible for the away from home rate.

Where a student had to move out of education provider accommodation
(such as on campus) and are, or were temporarily staying with their
parents, they will remain eligible for the away from home rate providing
they:

-   remain enrolled in their course of study, and
-   intend to return to their campus accommodation as soon as the
    education provider allows them to return

This includes students who:

-   had their accommodation arrangement cancelled by the education
    provider and have moved their belongings out of that accommodation
-   were approved for Residential Cost Option (RCO)

Note: the away from home rate of ABSTUDY Living Allowance can be paid
for any period that the education provider does not charge a residential
fee, rather than the reduced rate of Living Allowance.

Coding requirements

The payment of away from home rate needs to be recorded on the
customer's Services Australia record including:

-   the criteria for away from home rate approval
-   the customer's living arrangements
-   the payee
-   any board and school fee charges

If all of these are correctly recorded on the customer's record, the
correct rate of payment and correct payee will result. The full
assessment and coding for ABSTUDY entitlements is covered separately.

Secondary, secondary non-schooling and tertiary students

The coding required for a secondary school student varies slightly in
respect of students boarding at hostels, boarding schools, or in an
approved ABSTUDY Homestay arrangement, and students boarding privately.
Some coding specific to tertiary, secondary non-schooling students and
Australian Apprentices is also different to secondary school students.
This reflects key entitlement differences between secondary, secondary
non-schooling and tertiary students, with additional allowances
available to secondary students.

Note: ABSTUDY secondary school students approved for the away from home
rate are entitled to receive the full package of away from home
allowances for the full period of eligibility for away from home rate.
This differs from ABSTUDY tertiary, secondary non-schooling students and
Australian Apprentices, and particular coding is needed to ensure full
entitlement is paid.

Claim lodged for the purpose of attending an interview

Orientation and Special Purpose Visit travel is available if:

-   a secondary school or boarding facility requires prospective
    students to attend interviews or other selection procedures prior to
    acceptance
-   the student is intending to study in an approved tertiary course of
    at least 1 year's duration at the study location, and has completed
    secondary studies in the previous year

In order to claim this type of travel, a full ABSTUDY assessment needs
to be made for the period the student is intending to study.

A secondary boarding facility may need to conduct an interview or
selection process in their own right and it may not be possible at the
time of claiming to confirm the school they are attending. The Process
page contains special coding instructions for these cases.

Relocation Scholarships

Dependent students living away from home studying an approved
scholarship course may also be qualified to receive Relocation
Scholarship, see Relocation Scholarship (RS) eligibility.

Note: ABSTUDY Students in state care (not receiving Foster Care
Allowance) are to be assessed the same way as ABSTUDY dependent students
who are living away from home for the purposes of Relocation
Scholarship.

The Resources page contains scenarios illustrating how the system
calculates whether a customer has an entitlement to receive a top-up
from the School Fees Allowance (SFA) (Group 2) towards boarding
expenses.
