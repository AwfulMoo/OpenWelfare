This page contains the process for assessing a customer's request for
urgent payment. The decision to approve or deny an urgent payment is
made by a Service Officer at the APS4 level or above, Service Delivery
Partner Service Officers or specific Smart Centre staff. These are staff
fully trained in urgent payment processing. This applies to Smart Centre
telephony, service centre and processing team staff.
