MED1,2,3,4 buckets and the Programs and Work Types

This table lists the different MED (Medicare) buckets of scanned work
that come from Decipha to be classified (named) in Kofax by Canberra DST
TPS staff.

Use CAPITAL letters when classifying all Primary and Secondary indexes.

If able to identify the Program Line and Work Type but unable to
classify (name) due to poor image quality or incomplete details on the
form, use:

-   Primary Index - UNABLETONAME
-   Secondary Index - Leave blank

This should be in capitals with no spaces and applies for all Program
and Work Types.
