This document outlines how to store documents for Healthcare Identifiers
(HI) Service. All documents and forms relating to the assignment and
maintenance of HI must be handled in a particular way. This applies
during and after processing, and differs slightly depending on whether
the application or documentation is received via email or as a hard
copy.

Secure storage of documents

Due to the personal information collected in HI documentation, it is a
requirement that forms and documents are stored securely. Health
Professionals (HP) Records Manager is the electronic storage system used
by Services Australia to securely store HI Service documentation.

The Resources page contains a table of naming conventions and storage
locations for HI Service application types, and a link to the HI Service
batch header for Medicare Service Centres.
