|                                   | identity of an employer based on  |

|                                   | is called authenticating the      |

|                                   | be established before disclosing  |

|                                   | by asking questions that          |

|                                   | would know the answers to. For    |
|                                   | example, questions about the      |
|                                   | organisation details that can be  |
|                                   | cross-checked with the            |
