+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Q. How do I prove my child went   |
|                                   | to school for 85% each term?      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A. Centrelink will ask the school |
|                                   | to provide attendance information |
|                                   | directly to Centrelink at the end |
|                                   | of each term.                     |

| 2                                 | Q. The school says my child       |
|                                   | attended school for 82% in term   |
|                                   | 3, but I know my child went to    |
|                                   | school for 85% of that term, can  |
|                                   | Centrelink talk to the school for |
|                                   | me?                               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A. You will need to talk to the   |
|                                   | school to resolve this issue.     |
|                                   | Centrelink will not get involved  |
|                                   | in attendance disputes between    |
|                                   | parents and schools. If the       |
|                                   | school changes the attendance     |
|                                   | information, they will give the   |
|                                   | parent new evidence to provide to |
|                                   | Centrelink.                       |

| 3                                 | Q. In term 1, my child went to    |
|                                   | school for 83% of the term. In    |
|                                   | term 2 they attended school for   |
|                                   | 88% of the term. Can these be     |
|                                   | averaged over 2 terms so I get 2  |
|                                   | payments?                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A. No, your child needs to        |
|                                   | achieve 85% in each term to       |
|                                   | receive payment for that term.    |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 4                                 | Q. If my child attended 80% for a |
|                                   | term, can I get a pro-rata        |
|                                   | amount?                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A. No, your child must attend at  |
|                                   | least 85% in that term to receive |
|                                   | the amount. If your child turns   |
|                                   | 16 during a particular term, you  |
|                                   | will receive a pro-rata amount    |
|                                   | based on the period your child    |
|                                   | was under 16.                     |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 5                                 | Q. My child didn’t attend 85% in  |
|                                   | term 1 2020, but our school was   |
|                                   | open during term 2 and my child   |
|                                   | did attend 85% for the term. Am I |
|                                   | eligible for the term 3 STA       |
|                                   | payment based on term 2           |
|                                   | attendance?                       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A. No. The attendance requirement |
|                                   | of 85% for qualification for Term |
|                                   | 3 STA is based on attendance in   |
|                                   | term 1 2020.                      |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 6                                 | Q. What do I need to do to        |
|                                   | receive my School Term Allowance? |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A. Evidence of attendance is      |
|                                   | required and Centrelink will      |
|                                   | receive this information directly |
|                                   | from the schools.                 |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 7                                 | Q. It is the start of the term    |
|                                   | and I have not been paid School   |
|                                   | Term Allowance yet. When will     |
|                                   | this be paid?                     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A. At the beginning of the year   |
|                                   | you will receive the payment for  |
|                                   | the first term automatically.     |
|                                   | From now on, we will need         |
|                                   | evidence to show that your        |
|                                   | child's attendance at school has  |
|                                   | been 85% or higher before we can  |
|                                   | make the following payments. Once |
|                                   | the information is received from  |
|                                   | schools directly, we will assess  |
|                                   | your child's attendance and make  |
|                                   | a payment if attendance has been  |
|                                   | satisfactory. It may take several |
|                                   | weeks for this information on     |
|                                   | attendance to be received and     |
|                                   | processed.                        |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 8                                 | Q. Does this new initiative take  |
|                                   | into consideration ‘approved’     |
|                                   | absences by the school i.e.       |
|                                   | medical certificates?             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A. The initiative only takes into |
|                                   | account unapproved absences, i.e, |
|                                   | truancy or wagging school.        |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 9                                 | Q. How are ‘approved’ and         |
|                                   | unapproved’ absences defined?     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A. Schools define an unapproved   |
|                                   | absence as an absence that was    |
|                                   | not covered by a note from a      |
|                                   | parent or guardian. So an         |
|                                   | approved absence is one which was |
|                                   | accompanied by a note.            |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 10                                | Q. How does part day attendance   |
|                                   | affect the overall attendance?    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A. They don't, unless they are    |
|                                   | unapproved. For example, a        |
|                                   | student is absent from school     |
|                                   | after lunch and a note is not     |
|                                   | produced explaining why.          |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 11                                | Q. Can the parents provide the    |
|                                   | evidence from the school if there |
|                                   | is a delay in processing the      |
|                                   | payment? If so, what evidence is  |
|                                   | accepted?                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A. They certainly can. A letter   |
|                                   | or note from the school - that    |
|                                   | is, on a school letterhead -      |
|                                   | signed by a teacher and stating   |
|                                   | that attendance percentage will   |
|                                   | suffice.                          |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 12                                | Q. Will an overpayment be raised  |
|                                   | for term 1 if my child does not   |
|                                   | attend 85% of the term?           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A. No. Overpayments cannot be     |
|                                   | raised as payments are made on    |
|                                   | advice. Payment one is automatic  |
|                                   | and has nothing to do with        |
|                                   | attendance. It's made to help     |
|                                   | parents with up-front costs in    |
|                                   | sending kids to school. The       |
|                                   | second payment will depend on     |
|                                   | satisfactory attendance during    |
|                                   | term one; the third payment       |
|                                   | depends on satisfactory           |
|                                   | attendance during term two; and   |
|                                   | the fourth payment will depend on |
|                                   | satisfactory attendance during    |
|                                   | term three.                       |

| 13                                | Q. Previously Centrelink has      |
|                                   | allowed up to 10 days absence for |
|                                   | children moving location, will    |
|                                   | this rule remain in place thus    |
|                                   | enabling customers to be eligible |
|                                   | for School Term Allowance even if |
|                                   | the 10 days absence will reduce   |
|                                   | the child’s attendance to less    |
|                                   | than 85%?                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A. Yes, the important thing is    |
|                                   | that the school record shows      |
|                                   | satisfactory attendance for this  |
|                                   | period of time.                   |

| 1                                 | Q. How does Centrelink find out   |
|                                   | about a student percentage?       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A. Centrelink will receive,       |
|                                   | directly from schools, details of |
|                                   | unapproved absences for each      |
|                                   | child currently on School Term    |
|                                   | Allowance. This information will  |
|                                   | either be received electronically |
|                                   | for participating schools or      |
|                                   | through a written Payment on      |
|                                   | Advice request.                   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 2                                 | Q. How long will it take for      |
|                                   | schools to provide information?   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A. It is expected that Centrelink |
|                                   | will receive the information      |
|                                   | needed and most eligible customer |
|                                   | should be paid within 5 weeks     |
|                                   | after the commencement of term.   |
|                                   | However, depending on how quickly |
|                                   | schools respond to Centrelink’s   |
|                                   | request, some customers may start |
|                                   | to be paid in week one of term.   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 3                                 | Q. How is the 85% calculated?     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A. As the number of days per term |
|                                   | varies between states and even    |
|                                   | schools within states, Centrelink |
|                                   | and DEST have decided to use the  |
|                                   | standard school days calendar to  |
|                                   | work out what constitutes         |
|                                   | satisfactory attendance.          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | In all States and Territories the |
|                                   | number of unapproved absences     |
|                                   | that constitutes 85% attendance   |
|                                   | is less than 7 days. If a student |
|                                   | had 7 days or less unapproved     |
|                                   | absences per term, they meet the  |
|                                   | 85% attendance requirements for   |
|                                   | School Term Allowance. If a       |
|                                   | student has 8 or more days of     |
|                                   | unapproved absences per term,     |
|                                   | they do not meet the 85%          |
|                                   | attendance requirement for School |
|                                   | Term Allowance.                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Payment on Advice                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Schools will be asked on the      |
|                                   | Payment on Advice report to       |
|                                   | indicate whether the student has  |
|                                   | a SAT or UNS result.              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Electronic Report                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A formula will be applied to the  |
|                                   | electronic data to convert the    |
|                                   | number of unapproved absences to  |
|                                   | a SAT or UNS result.              |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 4                                 | Q. How many unapproved absences   |
|                                   | has the school advised Centrelink |
|                                   | for last term?                    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A. Centrelink only records if the |
|                                   | attendance was satisfactory or    |
|                                   | unsatisfactory for the payment.   |
|                                   | This is on the Education Payments |
|                                   | School Attendance (EYSA) screen.  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Parents need to discuss with the  |
|                                   | school details of unapproved      |
|                                   | absences, and any disputes. If    |
|                                   | the school revises the number of  |
|                                   | unapproved absences then the      |
|                                   | parent can provide new evidence   |
|                                   | from the school and be reassessed |
|                                   | for School Term Allowance.        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Centrelink only records this      |
|                                   | information because any           |
|                                   | discussions around the number of  |
|                                   | unapproved absences should be     |
|                                   | between the parent/student and    |
|                                   | the school.                       |
