Partner Income Test effect on payments

The Partner Income Test for ABSTUDY customers 22 years or over works by
reducing the amount of the customer's fortnightly payment by 50 cents
for each dollar that their partner earns above the Partner Income Free
Area. The Partner Income Free Area is adjusted for dependent children
(if any) by adding on an amount determined by the number of dependent
children.

A dependent children adjustment is applied for any young person who is
dependent upon the customer/partner, where the young person is:

16-21 years of age, and

-   in full-time or concessional study-load study, and
-   not assessed as independent for the purposes ABSTUDY/Youth Allowance
    (YA), and
-   not receiving Australian Government income support other than
    ABSTUDY/AIC or YA

or

under 16 years of age, and

-   is not assessed as independent for the purposes of ABSTUDY or Youth
    Allowance, and
-   not receiving Australian Government income support other than
    ABSTUDY/AIC or YA
