This document outlines when a customer requires an ESAt.

ESAt and job seekers lodging a medical certificate

Job seekers do not need an ESAt referral when lodging a medical
certificate seeking Temporary Incapacity exemption from mutual
obligation requirements or Disability Support Pension (DSP)
participation requirements.

In all cases, suitably skilled Service Officers are to decide whether to
grant an exemption based on available evidence, including the medical
certificate completed by the job seeker's medical practitioner. Some job
seekers who lodge a medical certificate may be referred for an ESAt to
assess other relevant circumstances, for example Partial Capacity to
Work (PCW) or Temporary Reduced Work Capacity (TRWC).

When an ESAt is required

An ESAt may be required for the following claims or services, unless
there is already a current and valid assessment of the job seeker's work
capacity:

Assessments for Partial Capacity to Work (PCW) or Temporary Reduced Work
Capacity (TRWC) for a job seeker receiving JobSeeker Payment (JSP),
Youth Allowance (YA), Parenting Payment (PP) or Special Benefit (SpB),
including YA (Jobseeker) assessment of independence

Very long-term unemployed job seekers who are having their work capacity
and barriers assessed

JSP customers who have entered a residential care facility

Youth Disability Supplement (YDS)

Program Review and parallel servicing referrals from Disability
Employment Services (DES) providers:

-   Parallel servicing is where the Service Officer or a senior staff
    member continues to support the job seeker alongside the Employment
    Services Provider while the job seeker is undertaking activities
    aimed at addressing their non-vocational challenges

Disability Support Pension (DSP) customers who are under 35 and have
participation requirements

DSP claimants who had their claim rejected and the Medical Assessment
Team (MAT) recommendation is for a review of work capacity and/or
employment services referrals

ESAts triggered by the Job Seeker Snapshot when completed by Services Australia

The requirement for an ESAt can be triggered as part of a Job Seeker
Snapshot. A request for an ESAt referral is required to finalise the Job
Seeker Snapshot, except where:

the ESAt flag can be manually finalised by reapplying the outcomes of a
current and valid assessment of the customer's work capacity

the requirement for the ESAt flag can be withdrawn where it is
determined that the job seeker:

-   does not have significant barriers requiring assessment through an
    ESAt
-   has a temporary incapacity - serious illness exemption

the job seeker is granted an exemption from mutual obligation
requirements or Disability Support Pension (DSP) participation
requirements for an extended period, or meets other conditions where it
is appropriate to defer the ESAt referral:

-   The period of deferment should depend on the job seeker's
    circumstances and not on the period of the exemption
-   During this deferment there is no requirement for an ESAt referral
    to be made

the job seeker is a newly arrived Refugee or Humanitarian Entrant:

-   The ESAt referral should generally be deferred up to 12 weeks after
    the job seeker's arrival in Australia

A Service Officer may use their judgement to determine when to request
an ESAt for a job seeker.

See, Actioning a pending Job Seeker Snapshot initiated Employment
Services Assessment (ESAt) activity.

ESAts triggered by the Job Seeker Snapshot when completed by a jobseeker via the online channel

Some job seekers are automatically referred to Workforce Australia
Online services after claiming income support, such as the Workforce
Australia Online for Individuals employment service.

When referred to Workforce Australia Online for Individuals, job seekers
are asked to complete the Online Job Seeker Snapshot.

The Job Seeker Snapshot will flag when a job seeker might potentially
need an Employment Services Assessment (ESAt), similar to how the Job
Seeker Snapshot works when run by a Service Officer.

An automated referral system transfers ESAt requests from Workforce
Australia Online to Services Australia. Once the customer's payment is
granted, the Services Australia system will then:

-   raise an RFL/UPD activity, and
-   send it to Assessment Services for screening

Assessment Services will review the request and book an ESAt if it is
required.

ESAt referral required

If an ESAt would likely result in a change in the job seeker's work
capacity or type of employment service, Assessment Services will:

-   contact the job seeker to ask for medical evidence (if required),
    and
-   book a suitable appointment

If the job seeker cannot be contacted, Assessment Services may send a
letter inviting the job seeker to provide medical evidence. Assessment
Services will:

-   monitor the job seeker's record, and
-   book an ESAt once the medical evidence is returned

Assessment Services will document when this letter is sent, and a copy
of this letter will be visible on the Document Tools screen. The
Resources page contains an example of the invite letter.

ESAt referral not required

Assessment Services will not contact the job seeker if they decide that
an ESAt is unlikely to change the job seeker's:

-   work capacity, or
-   type of employment service

The job seeker will either:

-   continue with Workforce Australia Online for Individuals, or
-   transfer to a physical Workforce Australia Employment Services
    Provider

For more information, see Selection or allocation of a Workforce
Australia Employment Service.

ESAts requested by Employment Services Providers

An ESAt may be requested by an Employment Services Provider:

-   where the provider notes a significant change of circumstances
    either through individual disclosure or observing behaviour
-   for individuals who have directly registered with an Employment
    Services Provider seeking employment assistance. This includes
    individuals who directly register with a Disability Employment
    Services (DES) provider and do not have a current and valid ESAt

An ESAt can be requested when a Job Seeker Snapshot has been run by the
Workforce Australia provider as part of the Targeted Compliance
Framework.

ESAts for customers not in receipt of a payment

Customers who are not claiming or receiving an income support payment
and are seeking access to a specialist employment assistance service
such as Disability Employment Services (DES) may be required to
undertake an ESAt to determine their eligibility to participate in the
service.

ESAt appointments

The job seeker can be required to attend an appointment for an ESAt
under section 63 of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999. The
requirement to attend an appointment must be reasonable, taking into
account all of the job seeker's circumstances.
