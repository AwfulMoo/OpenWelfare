|                                   | If a person receives 60% Carer    |

|                                   | 60%). However if a person         |

|                                   | receives 100% CA because the      |
|                                   | other carer has not claimed CA    |
|                                   | then the rate of payment of CDAP  |
|                                   | will be 100% ($1,000).            |

|                                   |     therefore each receive 50% or |
