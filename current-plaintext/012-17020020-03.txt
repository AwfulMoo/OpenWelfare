Processing travel/KM items for community nursing

Table 3: This table describes how to process payments of community
nursing claims for travel/KMs.

Note: From 1st January 2019, Community Nursing travel is paid at $0.76
per kilometre after the first 20 KM. Providers are to include KM
travelled and the charge claimed in the service text of online claims.
Subtract the first 20km from each visit from the total KM travelled and
add the residual amount in the claim. A force pend has been placed on
NA10 to allow manual processing of this item. The return message 3-DVA
ITM? has updated to remind staff of processing instructions.
