This document outlines details regarding the provisions allowing
prepayment of certain Centrelink payments. Also outlined is the process
to raise a debt under subsection 1223AA of the Social Security Act 1991.

Prepayments

A prepayment is a payment made to a customer before their correct
entitlement is determined. This may occur with the following payments:

-   prison release payments
-   Crisis Payment (CrP)
-   Anticipated Payment (also known as a Hardship Advance)
-   Social security payments during public holiday periods

A debt will occur where Services Australia later discovers the amount
was:

-   not payable, or
-   payable at a reduced rate

The above applies despite the customer having met their notification
requirements.

Note: CrP is not recoverable unless:

-   the customer was not entitled at the time of grant, or
-   it was paid while the customer was in receipt of an Assurance of
    Support (AoS)
