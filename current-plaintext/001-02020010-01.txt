This document explains the requirement for job seekers to participate
with jobactive providers where required.

Online jobactive employment service

Most job seekers are automatically referred to Online Employment
Services during their Participation Interview with selection and
referral being undertaken by the Department of Education, Skills and
Employment.

Selected job seekers do not require a referral to a jobactive provider,
but instead manage their obligations through jobactive (the online
employment service website).

jobactive organisations

jobactive organisations come under the umbrella of Employment Services
Providers. The outcome of a Job Seeker Classification Instrument (JSCI),
or an Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) if conducted, will determine
the level of service (or stream) the job seeker will receive from
jobactive.

Job seekers who live in a Department of Education, Skills and Employment
designated remote area, are referred to a CDP provider. jobactive is not
available to job seekers in these areas.

New Employment Services Model pilot

From 1 July 2019, all Stream A job seekers in 2 designated pilot areas
are selected by the Department of Education, Skills and Employment to
participate in the New Employment Services Model (ESM) Pilot. The pilot
builds on the existing Online Employment Services by expanding it to
include Parenting Payment Single (with mutual obligations) and
RapidConnect exempt job seekers.

The ESM pilot will continue until the New Employment Services Model is
implemented in July 2022.

Role of Services Australia

The role of Services Australia in online employment servicing is to
explain to the job seeker that they:

have been selected for the OES or ESM and are required to register with
the jobactive website via myGov

must agree to a Job Plan online

will not be required to attend face to face appointments with a
jobactive provider

can contact the Department of Education, Skills and Employment to
discuss:

-   their participation
-   issues accessing the jobactive website
-   completing the Career Profile (also known as your Profile)
-   agreeing to the Job Plan, or
-   exiting from the OES/pilot

Job seekers will agree to a Job Plan, develop or upload a resume, a
career profile and other relevant information and report mutual
obligation activities, (principally job search) via the online
employment service. If at any time a job seeker needs to be transferred
to a jobactive provider, the Department of Education, Skills and
Employment will refer the job seeker.

Job seeker registrations with jobactive

There are 3 categories of job seeker registration:

-   Fully Eligible Participant (FEP): these job seekers are eligible for
    all employment services assistance. Most will be automatically
    referred to OES, or they may require a referral to jobactive
    provider, and depending on the Job Seeker Classification Instrument
    (JSCI) or Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) outcome, may
    participate in 1 of the 3 streams
-   Volunteer job seekers, can be referred to OES for a total of 12
    months service as a Stream A Volunteer
-   No Stream Services Referral Required (NSSRR) customers are
    registered as job seekers to access other programs and services and
    do not require a referral to jobactive

In addition, there are a number of job seeker registration flags:

-   Vulnerable Youth (VY)
-   Vulnerable Youth (Student) (VY(S))
-   Structural Adjustment Programmes

JSCI or ESAt determining level of service

The Job Seeker Classification Instrument (JSCI) or Employment Services
Assessment (ESAt) will also determine the level of service or stream
offered to fully eligible job seekers.

jobactive offers 3 levels of service, or streams, to meet the needs of
job seekers according to their job readiness or barriers to employment.

-   Stream A for the most job ready customers. All Stream A job seekers
    will have immediate access to OES (or a provider if required) for
    assistance with the preparation of a resume and will be advised
    about local labour market opportunities, job search methods and
    provided with access to job search facilities
-   Stream B for job seekers with moderate - significant barriers to
    employment
-   Stream C for job seekers with severe barriers to employment

Job seekers can only progress to a higher stream if the JSCI or an ESAt
(for Stream C job seekers) indicates a higher level of service is
required to address the job seekers barriers to employment

Service Officers should not advise job seekers they are in a particular
Stream

Where a jobactive provider or Department of Education, Skills and
Employment contact centre (online jobactive employment services job
seekers) identifies a job seeker has had a change of circumstances that
may entitle them to assistance in a higher stream, the provider/contact
centre will:

-   send a request to Services Australia for a Change of Circumstances
    JSCI to be conducted, where the job seeker is in their first 6
    months of Stream A or B, or
-   conduct a JSCI for the job seeker, where they have been
    participating for more than 6 months, or
-   refer the job seeker to the agency to report a change in
    circumstances that may require a new JSCI and trigger an ESAt

Services Australia is responsible for updating the JSCI at any time a
job seeker advises a change in circumstance that may impact on the
service provided by jobactive.

The jobactive provider is responsible for providing a tailored service
in accordance with the job seekers stream. They may also consider early
entry for the job seeker into the Work for the Dole Phase.

Note: In some circumstances, historical coding of an Approved Overseas
Absence (AOA) exemption or a Full Time Study (FTS) activity will prevent
a jobactive provider from commencing a job seeker in stream services.

If the agency is approached by jobactive (via Participation Solutions)
or directly by the customer regarding this issue, it should be escalated
to the ICT Service Desk for resolution via the relevant mySupport
Webform.

If this issue is payment affecting, and meets the ICT Service Desk
Escalation Criteria, contact the ICT Service Desk directly for
assistance.

Annual Activity Requirements for job seekers in jobactive

The Annual Activity Requirement for jobactive applies to eligible job
seekers in jobactive. It determines the activities and the number of
hours a job seeker must complete in approved activities when in the Work
for the Dole Phase.

From 20 September 2018, job seekers over 60 years have an Annual
Activity Requirement if they do not fully meet their mutual obligation
requirements through paid work, or approved voluntary work in accordance
with current policy.

Eligible job seekers aged under 60 have an Annual Activity Requirements
when they enter into the Work for the Dole Phase. They must participate
in an approved activity or combination of approved activities to meet
their Annual Activity Requirement.

jobactive organisations will determine the activities the job seeker
must undertake to meet their Annual Activity Requirement and record
these in the job seeker's Job Plan, including the number of hours the
job seeker needs to undertake each fortnight.

Refer to Applying mutual obligation requirements.
