This document explains the requirement for job seekers to participate
with Workforce Australia Employment Services Providers where required.

Workforce Australia Online for Individuals employment service

Most job seekers are automatically referred to Workforce Australia
Online for Individuals during their Participation Interview with
selection and referral being undertaken by the Department of Employment
and Workplace Relations.

Selected job seekers do not require a referral to a provider, but
instead manage their obligations through Workforce Australia Online.

Workforce Australia organisations

The outcome of a Job Seeker Snapshot, or an Employment Services
Assessment (ESAt) if conducted, will determine the level of service the
job seeker will receive from Workforce Australia.

Job seekers who live in a Department of Employment and Workplace
Relations designated remote area, are referred to a CDP provider.
Workforce Australia Employment Services Providers are not available to
job seekers in these areas.

Role of Services Australia

The role of Services Australia in online employment servicing is to
explain to the job seeker that they:

have been selected for the Workforce Australia Online services and are
required to register with the Workforce Australia website via myGov

must agree to a Job Plan online

will not be required to attend face to face appointments with a provider

can contact the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations to
discuss:

-   their participation
-   issues accessing the Workforce Australia website
-   completing the Career Profile (also known as your Profile), or
-   agreeing to the Job Plan

Job seekers will agree to a Job Plan, develop or upload a resume, a
career profile and other relevant information and report mutual
obligation requirements, (principally job search) via the online
employment service. If at any time a job seeker needs to be transferred
to a provider, the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations will
refer the job seeker.

Job seeker registrations with Workforce Australia

There are 3 categories of job seeker registration:

-   Fully Eligible Participant (FEP): these job seekers are eligible for
    all employment services assistance. Most will be automatically
    referred to Workforce Australia Online for Individuals, or they may
    require a referral to a provider
-   Volunteer job seekers, can be referred to Workforce Australia
    Online. Access to the online service is not time limited
-   Job Seeker Registration Only (JSRO) customers are registered as job
    seekers to access other programs and services and do not require a
    referral to Workforce Australia

In addition, there are a number of job seeker registration flags:

-   Vulnerable Youth (VY)
-   Vulnerable Youth (Student) (VY(S))
-   Structural Adjustment Programmes

Job Seeker Snapshot or ESAt determining level of service

The Job Seeker Snapshot or Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) will
also determine the level of service offered to fully eligible job
seekers.

Workforce Australia offers 2 levels of service, to meet the needs of job
seekers according to their job readiness or barriers to employment.

-   Workforce Australia Online for Individuals for the most job ready
    customers. Job seekers will have immediate access Workforce
    Australia Online for assistance with the preparation of a resume and
    will be advised about local labour market opportunities, job search
    methods and provided with access to job search facilities
-   Workforce Australia Employment Services Provider for job seekers
    with moderate to severe barriers to employment

Services Australia is responsible for updating the Job Seeker Snapshot
at any time a job seeker advises a change in circumstance that may
impact on the service provided by Workforce Australia.

The provider is responsible for providing a tailored service in
accordance with the job seekers level of service. They may also consider
early entry for the job seeker into the Work for the Dole Phase.

Note: in some circumstances, historical coding of an Approved Overseas
Absence (AOA) exemption or a Full Time Study (FTS) activity will prevent
a provider from commencing a job seeker in employment services.

If the agency is approached by Workforce Australia (via Participation
Solutions) or directly by the customer regarding this issue, it should
be escalated to the ICT Service Desk for resolution via the relevant
mySupport Webform.

If this issue is payment affecting, and meets the ICT Service Desk
Escalation Criteria, contact the ICT Service Desk directly for
assistance.
