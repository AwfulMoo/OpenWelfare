| Item                              | Example                           |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Wally is a farmer who has a       |
|                                   | $500,000 farming property in a    |
|                                   | discretionary trust. Wally had    |
|                                   | been planning to transfer control |
|                                   | of this trust to Peter (child)    |
|                                   | prior to 1 January 2002 in order  |
|                                   | to continue to be eligible for    |
|                                   | the Age Pension.                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | However, Wally failed to make the |
|                                   | necessary changes in time and as  |
|                                   | a result the pension was          |
|                                   | cancelled on 1 January 2002, when |
|                                   | the trust assets were attributed  |
|                                   | to Wally as the trust controller. |
|                                   | Wally has decided that control of |
|                                   | the farming trust will be         |
|                                   | transferred to Peter. Wally does  |
|                                   | this and supplies the necessary   |
|                                   | documentation to Centrelink on 28 |
|                                   | February 2002.                    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Wally will be considered not to   |
|                                   | be a controller of the trust from |
|                                   | 28 February 2002 and the pension  |
|                                   | can be restored from this date.   |
|                                   | As Wally has surrendered control  |
|                                   | of the trust prior to 1 April     |
|                                   | 2002, deprivation will not be     |
|                                   | considered to have been incurred  |
|                                   | as a result of surrendering       |
|                                   | control of the trust under the    |
|                                   | rules in force from 1 January     |
|                                   | 2002. Wally will instead be       |
|                                   | assessed as if control of the     |
|                                   | trust had been surrendered prior  |
|                                   | to 1 January 2002.                |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If Wally transferred control of   |
|                                   | the farming trust to Peter on or  |
|                                   | after 1 April 2002, Wally would   |
|                                   | be considered to have incurred    |
|                                   | deprivation as a result of        |
|                                   | surrendering control of the trust |
|                                   | under the rules in force from 1   |
|                                   | January 2002. Wally would be      |
|                                   | assessed as having deprived       |
|                                   | themselves of an assessable asset |
|                                   | and a five year deprivation       |
|                                   | period would apply.               |
