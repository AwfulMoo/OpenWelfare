ISR database

The ISR database is a web-based tool used to record information about
face-to-face contact with customers and community throughout the
agency's Indigenous Servicing network. It allows the agency to track
progress on supporting social, economic, educational and community
engagement for Indigenous and regional Australians.

Community Code framework

The Community Code framework has the capability to store data for
current Government initiatives as well as information required for
future policy planning and implementation.

Community Code data enables the accurate and timely extraction of
Management Information (MI) and reporting at the community level. This
information is critical in addressing social inclusion and bridging the
gap challenges facing Indigenous people living in remote localities.

The community demographic data plays an important part in assisting in
the development of policy affecting Indigenous Australians as well as
improved service delivery to customers in urban, rural, and remote
areas.
