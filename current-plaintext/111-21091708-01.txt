This document outlines the support model for staff who are deaf of have
hearing loss within the agency.

Seeking help from TPS

Service Officers who identify as being deaf or having hearing loss can
seek TPS via the Staff who are deaf or have hearing loss SharePoint
page. This model allows staff to select their preferred method of
communication.

The SharePoint page is monitored by Smart Centre officers scheduled to
complete Telephony Typewriter (TTY) duties:

-   when there is a request,, the Service Officer on TTY will
    acknowledge the enquiry if on a TTY call
-   if the TTY staff member is a Technical Peer Support Officer and
    skilled to help with the enquiry, they will provide the support
-   if the TTY staff member is not skilled, they will hand off to the
    appropriate TPS line

Appropriate TPS contacts:

-   general enquiries
-   technical escalations
-   urgent payment reconsideration of decision, if requested when
    advising the customer the outcome of their initial request

Role of TPS staff

Staff acting in a TPS role will be expected to:

-   provide technical support
-   manage technical based escalated customer calls
-   complete a request for review of an urgent payment decision when
    relevant

The Resources page has a link to the SharePoint page, contact details
and user guides.
