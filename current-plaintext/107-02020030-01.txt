This document outlines information about negative adjustments when
reassessing a customer's entitlement. This includes how to document
adjustments. When a Child Care Subsidy (CCS) entitlement is reassessed
the adjustment (either negative or positive) cannot be amended.

Negative adjustment

Reassessment of a customer's entitlement may lead to:

-   underpayment (positive adjustment), or
-   overpayment (negative adjustment)

An investigation of a negative adjustment can result in:

-   no recoverable debt
-   recoverable debt raised
-   recoverable debt raised and waived

Debts less than $50 are waived automatically. However, the following
debts are excluded and must be investigated:

-   Family Assistance
-   ABSTUDY
-   Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) Scheme
-   Pensioner Education Supplement (PES) debts

Identification of debt

Consider:

-   What action generated the debt?
-   Is the debt legally recoverable?

Before making a decision on further action, Service Officers must:

-   check the system to establish payment history
-   determine whether the customer has complied with the notification
    provisions
-   determine whether relevant protocols were followed

Raising a debt

Debts are raised automatically upon finalisation of an earnings or
payment stimulus activity or workflow where the:

-   debt relates to an income support payment covered by the Social
    Security Act
-   debt period is not greater than 14 days (one fortnight) in duration
-   debt does not include a Student Start Up Scholarship, Relocation
    Scholarship or Carer Supplement Payment, and
-   customer does not have a deceased estate pending, bankruptcy or
    imprisonment debt write off in place

Advise the customer of the debt during the conversation when updating
the earnings.

Determine whether a debt is correct. Consider:

-   the legislative basis for the debt
-   whether there is sufficient evidence to prove a debt exists
-   the cost effectiveness of recovery
