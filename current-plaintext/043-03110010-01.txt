Identifying if a customer is a sole trader

A customer's involvement in a sole trader business will usually be
identified at the new claim stage. This will be triggered by the
customer's listing of previous/current employment details. Where a
customer indicates that they were or are receiving income from
self-employment, the Business Details (MOD F) must be issued.

Indicators on the MOD F

If a customer is self employed or operating a business as a sole trader
they will answer question 6 of the MOD F to indicate this.

The features of a sole trader include that:

-   The business is not a separate legal entity from the owner
-   It can be run under the owner's own name or under a registered
    business, for example J Bloggs (trading as) 'Brite-Up Cleaning
    Service'
-   The owner is liable for all the debts of the business
-   The owner is entitled to all the profits of the business
-   One person is the business owner. The term sole trader does not
    refer to how many people work in the business, as a sole trader
    business can have employees
-   The business is not a separate accounting entity (that is, the
    business does not lodge its own tax return)
-   The business is not taxed as a separate accounting entity (that is,
    sole traders need only lodge an individual Form I personal tax
    return)

Other ways to identify a sole trader include that:

-   a tax return for individuals is the only tax return completed as the
    income and expenses of a sole trader business are included in the
    individual's tax return
-   net income or loss from business question is completed in the
    customer's tax return

The Resources page contains a link to the Business Details (MOD F).
