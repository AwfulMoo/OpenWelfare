This document outlines how to add new education details to the student's
record, including where an 'intention to study' (Austudy or Youth
Allowance only) is already recorded and must be updated with actual
course details. The details are most commonly required for ABSTUDY,
Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC), Austudy, Pensioner Education
Supplement (PES) and Youth Allowance (YA) customers.

Situations where this procedure does not apply

Different procedures apply for situations where the customer:

-   will not commence full-time study for YA, Austudy and PES
-   will not commence full-time study for ABSTUDY, ABSTUDY PES, AIC and
    AIC PES
-   is receiving ABSTUDY or ABSTUDY PES and defers or discontinues study
    before the end of the course
-   is receiving YA or Austudy and defers or discontinues study before
    the end of the course
-   is receiving PES or AIC and defers or discontinues study before the
    end of the course
-   is receiving YA, Austudy or PES and changes the course that they
    were studying
-   is receiving ABSTUDY or ABSTUDY PES and changes the course and/or
    education institution that they were studying
-   is transferring from student to job seeker
-   has now finished their course

When to record study details for JobSeeker Payment (JSP), YA (job seeker) or YA (Australian Apprentice)

Study details of customers who receive JSP or YA (job seeker) are to be
recorded on the system if they have been assigned a customer target
category of 'partial capacity to work' or 'principal carer' and are
undertaking study as part of their mutual obligation requirements.

If a YA job seeker or Australian Apprentice is returning to full time
study and wishes to change their activity type to full time student, see
Youth Allowance (YA) job seeker or Australian Apprentice returning to
full time study first before attempting this procedure.

Determining study start dates for YA and Austudy

Most education institutions will have an academic calendar with the
standard date many students will start or end their courses or study
periods. Service Officers can access these dates on the National Course
Approvals sub-site. Education providers often publish their academic
calendars on their websites. It is important to note that many students
will be enrolled in a course that starts or finishes on a different date
to the standard date on the education provider's academic calendar.

From 13 January 2019, Service Officers can accept a student start date
advised by a YA or Austudy customer, providing that date is not greater
than 14 days before the standard course start date published on the
National Course Approvals sub-site, or an education provider's website.

The exception to this is where the student has indicated the date they
have provided is the day they are commencing 'Orientation week' (O
week). O week is not considered part of the student's course.

The student may provide a date that is known to be the start date of O
week. If there is no indication the student is attending O week on the
date provided, the date must be accepted.

Continuing and intending students

When Service Officers are making study updates, consideration should be
given to whether the customer can be considered a continuing/intending
student. This determination may influence what date the customer is
eligible to receive a student payment. The rules for
continuing/intending students vary between different student payments.

Additional coding required for Relocation Scholarship (RS)

Students studying an approved scholarship course may also be qualified
to receive an RS.

RS eligibility explains additional coding required for students studying
an approved scholarship course to ensure that the RS is paid correctly.

Unfavourable decisions

When making an unfavourable decision, speak to the customer:

-   explain the decision
-   give them a chance to provide more information or evidence
-   advise their review and appeal rights, and record an application for
    a formal review of the decision if required

Make 2 genuine attempts to contact the customer before finalising the
decision.

The Resources page contains links to the National Course Approvals
sub-site, the Australian Qualification Framework (AQF) website and
Office Locator. It also contains an example for coding a rejection for
Allowable Time Reached, and a link to the Student Programme Resource
Tool.
