|                                   | automatically recalculated when   |
|                                   | there is a change in certain      |
|                                   | circumstances affecting the rate  |
|                                   | of the customer's pension or      |
|                                   | benefit. This rate recalculation  |
|                                   | occurs on the Services Australia  |
|                                   | system.                           |

|                                   | When there is a DFISA rate        |
|                                   | change, the new amount(s) will be |
|                                   | transmitted to DVA, where the     |
|                                   | customer's DFISA payments are     |
|                                   | adjusted and paid by DVA          |
|                                   | accordingly. DFISA is generally   |
|                                   | paid by DVA fortnightly on the    |
|                                   | DVA payday. DFISA adjustments can |
|                                   | result in a debt or an arrears    |
|                                   | payment with DVA.                 |

|                                   | support rate was nil. If their    |
|                                   | DFISA rate was greater than zero, |
|                                   | the customer would have been      |

Manual calculation of DFISA payments by the DVA Clearance Team

Table 2: This table describes the manual calculations which may be
required when the system does not automatically calculate a DFISA
payment, or when DFISA rates have to be verified for effective periods
before 1 January 2022. The information must be coded on the DFISA
Calculation Details screen. The Actual Rate and the Notional Rate both
require calculation.

DFISA rates can be viewed on the DFISA Summary (DFS) screen, where they
are shown as a daily rate. Selecting a daily rate will display the DFISA
Calculation Details (DFD) screen, where the notional and actual (or
current) entitlement amounts can be viewed, and a notional or manual
rate of DFISA can be coded.
