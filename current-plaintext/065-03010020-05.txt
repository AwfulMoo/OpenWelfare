|                                   | payments suspended in this case.  |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | payments of TAL, PhA and/or UA as |
|                                   | these will be rolled into the     |
|                                   | Pension Supplement. This will be  |
|                                   | paid automatically when they      |
|                                   | reach Age Pension age.            |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | income support payment. As the    |
|                                   | customer has now reached Age      |
|                                   | Pension age they must complete    |
|                                   | and return the SA383 to see if    |
|                                   | they are eligible for Age         |
|                                   | Pension. If there is no           |
|                                   | eligibility to Age Pension they   |
|                                   | may continue to be paid SpB.      |

|                                   | Note: SpB with TPD or TPP visa    |
|                                   | type will cancel at Age Pension   |
|                                   | age as SpB with these visa types  |
|                                   | is age-limited. (This processing  |
|                                   | is unrelated to the transfer to   |

Calculating a customer's Age Pension age transfer date

Due to their date of birth, for the following customers the date that is
6 months after their birthday has to be calculated:

-   People born before 1 July 1955 have reached Age Pension age
-   People born between 1 July 1955 and 31 December 1956 will be
    eligible at age 66.5
-   People born on or after 1 January 1957 will be eligible at age 67

Months have between 28 and 31 days, so if a customer has a birth date at
the end of certain months, the first day of the following month must be
used.

Use the following dates as date of grant of Age Pension for customers
born on these days, whose Aged Pension aged is a half year:

-   for 31 March, use 1 October (as September has only 30 days)
-   for 29 August, use 1 March, or 29 February if it is a leap year (as
    February has 29 days in a leap year, and 28 days for all other
    years)
-   for 30 and 31 August, use 1 March (as February has a maximum of 29
    days)
-   for 31 October, use 1 May (as April has only 30 days)
-   for 31 December, use 1 July (as June has only 30 days)

Note: to check if a year is a leap year, divide the year by 4. If the
answer is a whole number it is a leap year. As 2004 is divisible by 4,
it is a leap year.
