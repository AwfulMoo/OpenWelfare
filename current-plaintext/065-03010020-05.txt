|                                   | and return the SA383 to see if    |

|                                   | is unrelated to the transfer to   |

Calculating a customer's Age Pension age transfer date

Due to their date of birth, for the following customers the date that is
6 months after their birthday has to be calculated:

-   females with an Age Pension age that is 60.5 years, 61.5 years, 62.5
    years, 63.5 years, 64.5 years, 65.5 years or 66.5 years
-   males with an Age Pension age that is 65.5 years or 66.5 years

Months have between 28 and 31 days, so if a customer has a birth date at
the end of certain months, the first day of the following month must be
used.

The birth dates requiring this extra step are 31 March, 29, 30, or 31
August, 31 October and 31 December. For customers born on these days,
whose Age Pension age is a half year, use the following dates as date of
grant of Age Pension:

-   for 31 March, use 1 October (as September has only 30 days)
-   for 29 August, use 1 March, or 29 February if it is a leap year (as
    February has 29 days in a leap year, and 28 days for all other
    years)
-   for 30 and 31 August, use 1 March (as February has a maximum of 29
    days)
-   for 31 October, use 1 May (as April has only 30 days)
-   for 31 December, use 1 July (as June has only 30 days)

Leap years: to check if a year is a leap year, divide the year by 4. If
the answer is a whole number it is a leap year. As 2004 is divisible by
4, it is a leap year.

|                                   | or Partner Allowance (PA) on the  |

|                                   | Example:                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A WA customer is under Age        |
|                                   | Pension age with less than 10     |
|                                   | years residence. They become      |
|                                   | partnered 2 weeks before reaching |
|                                   | Age Pension age and their WA is   |
|                                   | cancelled.                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | In this case the customer loses   |
|                                   | entitlement to the payment        |
|                                   | applicable under section 43(1)(c) |
|                                   | of the Social Security Act 1999   |
|                                   | before turning Age Pension age.   |
|                                   | Therefore, they do not qualify    |
|                                   | for Age Pension as they do not    |
|                                   | have the 10 year residence        |
|                                   | required and at the time they     |
