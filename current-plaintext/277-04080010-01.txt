This document outlines the process for requesting information about a
Centrelink customer record.

Customer first

When sourcing information from Customer First:

Only source information for assessment and collection purposes as per
2016 Governance Arrangement on Centrelink-Child Support information
exchange

Follow the relevant Child Support processes as outlined in Operational
Blueprint to make all decisions. For example, there may be a
relationship decision in Customer First, however a relationship decision
under the Child Support (Assessment) Act is still needed

If there are doubt about the information in Customer First complete the
Centrelink/Child Support Exchange of Information macro

For help applying the information to a child support assessment, see:

-   the relevant intray help
-   specific Operational Blueprint process, or
-   a Service Support Officer
