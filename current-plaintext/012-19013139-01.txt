This document outlines specialty codes recorded in the Provider
Directory System (PDS) for health professionals providing services under
the Medicare program.

Provider Directory System (PDS)

The Provider Directory System (PDS) is the Services Australia database
which records and stores information about health professionals
providing services for Medicare. Services Australia, the Department of
Health and Aged Care and other external stakeholders use PDS data for
various reasons, for example claims assessment, statistical reporting
and analysis etc. The accuracy of this data is critical to these
functions.

Specialty codes

Specialty codes (also known as ‘spec codes’) are added to a health
professionals PDS record to indicate the health professional's
discipline and level of access to Medicare benefits. Specialty codes can
be applied at either the stem level or the stem and location level on a
PDS record.

Some speciality codes in the tables below are no longer used but may
still appear on provider records.

The Resources page contains a list of specialty codes used in the PDS.
