|                                   | drain into surrounding tissues.   |
|                                   | This is generally a treatment for |

| Optical coherence tomography      | A non-invasive imaging test. OCT  |
| (OCT)                             | uses light waves to take          |
|                                   | cross-section pictures of your    |
|                                   | retina.                           |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Optic nerve                       | The bundle of nerve fibres that   |
|                                   | connect the retina with the       |

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Pupil                             | The black circular opening in the |
|                                   | centre of the iris (the coloured  |

|                                   | refracted (bent) as it passes     |
|                                   | through the cornea and lens.      |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Strabismus (squint)               | Is a condition which causes the   |
|                                   | eyes to be misaligned. They are   |

|                                   | the same time. It occurs when the |
|                                   | eye muscles are not working       |

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Ultrasonic echography             | Ultrasound of the eye.            |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Vitrectomy                        | A surgical procedure that removes |
|                                   | the vitreous humor and replace it |
