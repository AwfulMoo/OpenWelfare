This page contains examples of working out a person's fortnightly Family
Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A rate using Method 2. This includes a comparison
with the above higher income free area (HIFA) Method 1 rate. The higher
of the 2 rates is paid.

On this Page:

Examples - comparison of 2018-19 and 2019-20 financial years

The figures used in these examples are for illustration purposes only,
and may not represent the current maximum entitlement rates for the
relevant pension or allowance. For current maximum rates of entitlements
and supplementary payments, see Rates and thresholds.

Rates used in the following examples compare the 2018-19 and 2019-20
financial years to show the changes to the above HIFA Method 1 taper
rate and one-off HIFA increase from 1 July 2019.

The FTB Part A supplement is subject to an income limit and is not
included in the calculations.

Example 1: Single individual with three children, one child in shared care

The figures used in these examples are for illustration purposes only,
and may not represent the current maximum entitlement rates for the
relevant pension or allowance. For current maximum rates of entitlements
and supplementary payments, see Rates and thresholds.

Sarah has 3 children; John aged 2, Megan aged 4, and Kate aged 8. Sarah
shares the care of Kate equally with her previous partner, her shared
care percentage is 50%. Sarah's estimated income is $105,750. Sarah pays
$210 per week rent. Sarah is grandfathered for Energy Supplement Part A.

Method 2 from 1 July 2019

Table 1: This table describes calculating FTB Part A fortnightly payment
rates using the Method 2 calculation. It includes the 1 July 2019
one-off HIFA increase. The taper rate remains unchanged at 30c in the
dollar above the HIFA.

These amounts may not be current. They are examples only. For current
payments, see Rates and thresholds.

As above HIFA Method 1 rate ($6,485.98) is higher than Method 2 rate
($484.43), the above HIFA Method 1 is used up to 30 June 2019 inclusive.

Daily rate = annual rate / 365 (this is rounded after calculating the
person's full FTB daily rate).

Fortnightly FTB rate = daily FTB rate x 14.

Example 2: Couple with two children including a baby

The figures used in these examples are for illustration purposes only,
and may not represent the current maximum entitlement rates for the
relevant pension or allowance. For current maximum rates of entitlements
and supplementary payments, see Rates and thresholds.

Peter and Susan have a baby on 3 May 2019 - Samuel, their second child.
They already receive FTB for Amy who is 4. Their estimated combined
taxable income is $101,000. Susan's FTB is reassessed and she is paid
Newborn Supplement (NBS) for Samuel. Susan is grandfathered for Energy

As Method 2 rate ($1,677.05) is higher than above HIFA Method 1 rate
($812.45), Method 2 is used up to 30 June 2019 inclusive.

Daily rate = annual rate / 365 (this is rounded after calculating the
person's full FTB daily rate).

Fortnightly FTB rate = daily FTB rate x 14.

As above HIFA Method 1 rate ($5,923.05) is higher than Method 2 rate
($1,126.50), above HIFA Method 1 is used up to 30 June 2019 inclusive.

Daily rate = annual rate / 365 (this is rounded after calculating the
person's full FTB daily rate).

Fortnightly FTB rate = daily FTB rate x 14.

Example 4: Couple with six children

The figures used in these examples are for illustration purposes only,
and may not represent the current maximum entitlement rates for the
relevant pension or allowance. For current maximum rates of entitlements
and supplementary payments, see Rates and thresholds.

Jodie and Adrian have 6 children. 3 children are aged 13-15 and 3
children are aged under 13. Jodie has estimated their combined adjusted
taxable income (ATI) is $120,000, which is above the FTB Part A higher
income free area. Jodie is grandfathered for Energy Supplement Part A.

Table 13: This table describes calculating FTB Part A fortnightly
payment rates using the Method 2 rate calculation. It includes the 1
July 2019 one-off HIFA increase. The taper rate remains unchanged at 30c
in the dollar above the HIFA.

These amounts may not be current. They are examples only. For current
payments, see Rates and thresholds.

As above HIFA Method 1 rate ($4,399.05) is higher than Method 2 rate
($2,844.15), above HIFA Method 1 is used from 1 July 2020.

Annikaâ€™s annual FTB Part A rate from 1 July 2020 before reductions due
to non-compliance with immunisation requirements = $4,399.05.

*FTB Part A reduction due to immunisation will be applied to days where
the child does not meet immunisation requirements following a 63 day
grace period. If the child fails to comply after the grace period the
reduction will be applied to the days in the grace period at end of year
reconciliation. The reduction will cease when the child meets
immunisation requirements

The figures used in these examples are for illustration purposes only,

and supplementary payments, see Rates and thresholds.

Jenny has 1 child - Blake aged 5. The child does not meet immunisation
requirements from 1 July 2020. At the end of the immunisation grace
period the child still is not immunisation compliant and remains that
way until the EOFY (301 days). Jenny has an estimated taxable income of
$103,000. As Method 2 rate is higher than Method 1 rate, Method 2 is
used.

If a child is non-compliant for both immunisation and HSFS requirements,
only one rate reduction per fortnight will be applied. This customer has
the HSFS rate reduction only applied while they were in receipt of
income support. Once their income support payment ceased, the
immunisation rate reduction continued.

Example 8: Partnered customer with 3 children, circumstance change causes FTB/CAN-INC.

The figures used in these examples are for illustration purposes only,
and may not represent the current maximum entitlement rates for the
relevant pension or allowance. For current maximum rates of entitlements
and supplementary payments, see Rates and thresholds.

Olivia and Ivan have three children Leonie aged 18, Cedric aged 17, and
Xavier aged 16. Olivia has been receiving FTB Part A for the three
children. The existing income limit for three children is $135,525. The
combined family income estimate is $120,000.

Olivia contacts to notify that Leonie has completed Year 12. This is
updated and Leonie is no longer an FTB child. With two remaining FTB
children in care (Cedric and Xavier), the income limit is $113,710.

The circumstance change has resulted in a new income limit ($113,710.00)
which is less than the existing estimate ($120,000.00). As the nil
entitlement is due to a circumstance change, Oliviaâ€™s FTB will cancel
CAN-INC. Oliviaâ€™s FTB cancels because her income limit has decreased due
to a change in circumstances and not due to a revised family income
estimate.

As of 1 July 2020, the existing family income estimate for Olivia and
Ivan is $120,000.
