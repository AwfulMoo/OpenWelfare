This document outlines the reasons why membership of the Pension Bonus
Scheme (PBS) may be cancelled.

When to cancel PBS membership

Membership of the Pension Bonus Scheme (PBS) is to be cancelled if:

-   the member's claim for Age Pension and the Pension Bonus is
    determined (auto cancelled)
-   the member requests (in writing) that their membership be cancelled,
    or
-   the member doesn't make a proper claim for pension bonus when
    claiming an Age Pension

Cancellation of membership can only occur where the customer was a
registered member of the PBS.
