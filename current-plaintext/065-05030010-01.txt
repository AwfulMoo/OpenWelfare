This document outlines the process to assess claims for aged care
financial hardship (hardship) assistance.

Pre entry hardship assessments

Pre entry hardship assessments are valid for 120 days from the date the
assessment is completed.

If the care recipient does not start home or residential care within 120
days of the hardship assessment being completed, the hardship assessment
expires and is no longer valid. See also, Aged care financial hardship
assistance - overview.

Applying the hardship reduction (fee type)

Post 1 July 2014 fee type hierarchy

Home care must have the fee reduction applied in the following order:

-   Basic Daily Fee (BDF)
-   Income Tested Care Fee (ITCF)

Residential care

Care recipients assessed as low means must have the fee reduction
applied in the following order:

BDF

Means Tested Care Fee (MTCF) - if applicable

Accommodation Contribution (AC):

-   a partial hardship reduction can apply to AC

Care recipients assessed as not low means must have the fee reduction
applied in the following order:

BDF

Means Tested Care Fee (MTCF)

Daily Accommodation Payment (DAP):

-   a partial hardship reduction can apply to DAP

Pre 1 July 2014 - Fee hierarchy and process is unchanged.

Hardship assistance form and fee type hierarchy

Hardship assistance claims were assessed using the fee type hierarchy,
however, with the introduction of the Aged Care Claim for financial
hardship assistance form (SA462), applicants are unable to choose a fee
type for assessment.

If a care recipient, using a previous version of the form, selects a fee
type that differs from the hierarchy:

-   Services Australia staff attempt to contact the care recipient to
    discuss the hardship assessment and the fee hierarchy
-   If the contact is unsuccessful, hardship is assessed using the care
    recipient's elected fee type

If a care recipient is applying for a continuation of hardship
assistance and the new assessment results in a lower hardship rate than
previously granted:

-   Services Australia staff attempt to contact the care recipient to
    discuss the new assessment, and
-   advise the difference in hardship assistance

Duration of hardship and setting a review

Duration

Services Australia can grant a hardship period:

in line with the financial circumstances of the care recipient

up to 3 years from the date of new grant or date the assessment is
completed, whichever is the later

-   this is in addition to any eligible backdated periods
-   for example, start date is in the past. Hardship is backdated to the
    start date and the end date is 3 years from the date the assessment
    is completed

Examples of care recipients that may be granted hardship for up to 3
years include, but are not limited to:

-   non-homeowner income support payment (ISP) care recipients with
    consistently low assets or income under the hardship thresholds.
    Care recipients need to be advised of reassessment options, for
    example, if expenses increase, hardship can be reassessed. See the
    Resources page for information on the financial hardship current and
    historical thresholds
-   pre 1 July 2014 care recipients who no longer have the assets they
    had on date of entry and are therefore unable to afford the
    accommodation charge/bond

Reviews

Reviews provide an opportunity to check the care recipient's
circumstances and confirm ongoing eligibility for hardship assistance.

Service Officers have the option to set a review before the 3year end
date. Extending the grant duration and setting reviews removes the
requirement for a care recipient to reclaim every 12 months.

For some 3 year grants, annual reviews may be required. The following
are examples:

-   ISP care recipient homeowner with a protected person in the home.
    Annual review will determine if the protected person is still in the
    home
-   ISP care recipient homeowner with an asset that cannot be sold or
    borrowed against or jointly owned properties. Annual review will
    determine if joint owner is still unwilling to sell
-   ISP care recipient homeowner with a property that is unreasonable to
    sell as asset. An annual review will determine if the home is still
    occupied

Note: a review is not set if the care recipient is unlikely to have a
change of circumstances or for shorter hardship grant durations (6 or 12
months).

Quality assurance process

Aged care hardship assessments include a quality assurance process. The
aim of the quality assurance process is to ensure correct and consistent
assessment outcomes:

Hardship processing does not include an activity in Customer First

The quality assurance process:

-   is manual
-   aligns with the Quality On Line (QOL) quality assurance program. The
    Resources page contains a link to QOL
-   is undertaken by a hardship subject matter expert nominated by the
    Smart Centre

The Resources page contains a link to the Hardship Quality Checking
procedure.

Temporary COVID 19 policy about assessment of assets that cannot be sold or borrowed against

Staff must assess an aged care financial hardship claim using the new
assets that cannot be sold or borrowed against policy if the applicant
advises:

-   they have an asset that cannot be sold or borrowed against, and
-   are in financial hardship due to COVID-19 restrictions

Travel restrictions prevent the sale of the principal home

Assess the principal home as an asset that cannot be sold or borrowed
against before it is on the market if:

-   COVID-19 enforced travel restrictions have stopped family from
    helping a care recipient to prepare the principal home for sale, and
-   sale of the asset is prevented by the travel restrictions

In these cases:

the initial requirement for the principal home to be on the market for a
minimum of 6 months with at least one price reduction does not apply

code the asset as one that cannot be sold or borrow against for:

-   the period of the enforced travel restriction, plus
-   an additional 2 months to allow the family to prepare the property
    for sale

When the travel restriction ends, the principle home is considered an
asset that cannot be sold or borrowed against again when:

-   the home has been on the market for a period of 6 months with at
    least one price reduction, or
-   it meets the definition of an asset that cannot be sold or borrowed
    against for another reason. For example, the asset is jointly owned
    and the other person refuses to sell

Note: the requirement for the principal home to be on the market for a
minimum of 6 months, with at least one price reduction, has not changed
during the COVID-19 pandemic period. It is still expected that a care
recipient sells their principal home or borrows against the asset to pay
for their aged care costs.

Investment property no longer generating income due to COVID-19

Many care recipients are dependent on the income generated from rental
properties to fund their aged care costs. Due to the Government’s
COVID-19 restrictions, a care recipient may have a substantial reduction
in income because they:

-   are unable to conduct their usual business of leasing the property
    as either long term or holiday rentals
-   do not have the ability to service a loan agreement over the asset

These restrictions may result in an inability for the care recipient to
meet their aged care costs.

Investment properties no longer generating income due to COVID-19 are
classed as an asset that cannot be sold or borrowed against because the
person is:

-   in temporary hardship, and/or
-   it is unreasonable to sell the asset

In these cases, code the investment property as an asset that cannot be
sold or borrowed against for 12 months:

Initial 6 months in recognition of financial hardship due to unforeseen
Government restrictions

Additional 6 months:

-   to allow the care recipient time to become financially stable once
    the COVID-19 pandemic has passed
-   in recognition that it may be slow in re-establishing the income
    stream generated pre-COVID-19 restrictions
