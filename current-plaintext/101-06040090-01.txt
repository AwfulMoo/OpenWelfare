This document outlines a list of the cancellation and rejection codes
for Low Income Health Care Card (LIC).

Centrelink codes

Centrelink uses specific codes when a decision is recorded on a
customer's record to assess their claim, suspend or cancel their
entitlement to a payment or concession card. A description of the code
is used in correspondence with customers when explaining the reason for
suspension, cancellation or rejection.

Restoration of LIC

Rejections can never be restored. A LIC can be cancelled automatically
or manually, but is not able to be suspended.

The Document List (DL) screen should always be checked for information
regarding the suspension as in some cases it may not be appropriate to
restore at the first point of contact. If the LIC has been cancelled
incorrectly, due to error or incorrect information provided by the
customer, Smart Centre Service Officers can restore LIC. For more
information on restoration, see Restoration of a Low Income Health Care
Card (LIC).

The Resources page contains a list of cancellation and rejection codes
for LIC and details on when LIC can be restored and who can restore the
card. A LIC can be cancelled automatically or manually but are not able
to be suspended.
