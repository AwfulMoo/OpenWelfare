New legislation from 1 January 2002 for private trusts and private companies

From 1 January 2002, new rules were implemented for the way private
trusts and companies are treated under the income and assets tests.
Income and assets held by private companies and private trusts are
generally treated as belonging to the person (or persons) who control
the trust or company.

There were system changes introduced to implement the new legislation
from 1 January 2002. Each private trust or private company has its own
record in environment A, and its own Customer Reference Number (CRN).
These entity records are linked to the records of relevant current
customers.

The assessment and coding of the entity record are done by the Complex
Assessment Officer (CAO) as only the CAO has the delegation to make the
decision regarding attribution of assets and income to a customer from
involvement with a private company or private trust.

The Training page contains a link to the courses/training modules in the
Learning Portal relevant for this topic and its procedures
