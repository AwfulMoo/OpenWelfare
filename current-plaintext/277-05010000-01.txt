Court Varied Assessment (CVA)

A Court Varied Assessment (CVA) is an assessment that has been amended
to give effect to certain orders made by the Family Court or Local or
Federal Circuit Court (that is, orders made under s118, 123A or 124 of
the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989).

A court can order that an administrative assessment be varied via a
court order in the following situations:

-   where a COA application is deemed too complex and an objection
    disallowed. Note: from 1 July 2015, a person cannot apply directly
    to a court for a review of these decisions. The person may apply to
    the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) for a first review of the
    decision where the matter has been determined by an objection
    officer as being too complex
-   where an objection officer or the AAT has refused to make a decision
    because the matters raised are too complex. From 1 July 2015, a
    person cannot apply directly to a court for a review of a decision
    where the matter has been determined by an objection officer as too
    complex and may apply to the AAT for a first review of the decision.
    A person dissatisfied with an outcome of the AAT first review can
    appeal to court
-   where a customer has obtained the leave of the court to have a
    period more than 18 months in the past considered by COA and the
    court has chosen to make a departure determination rather than refer
    the case back to Child Support
-   if a customer has another family law or child support matter before
    the court and the court has determined that it is appropriate to
    also deal with an application that will vary the assessment
-   where a liable parent requests for a minimum rate of child support
    to be reduced to nil
-   where a COA decision has been objected to and appealed to the AAT
    and there has been a subsequent appeal to court

Note: orders made by a court under the Family Law Act 1975, such as
maintenance for adult children or overseas maintenance orders, do not
create a CVA. See Stage 1 - variations (CS) or Stage 1 - registrations
(CS) or the Child Support Guide.

Roles and responsibilities

Service Officer (SO3)

-   process a Court Varied Assessment, and
-   relevant decision making

Note: this does not prevent an officer at the SO2 level who has the
support of their Team Leader from carrying out this type of work.
However, the final decision to process a court varied assessment must be
made by an officer at the SO3 level or above.
