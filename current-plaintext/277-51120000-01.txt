This document outlines how to assess, when working out maintenance
income for Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A, the amount of child support
to be excluded from the Maintenance Income Test because it is for child
disability expenses.

Income not considered as maintenance

A payment, benefit or transfer of property is not considered maintenance
income if it is received as child support specifically for expenses due
to a disability or learning difficulty that is permanent or long term.
Examples include medical and hospital expenses, medical equipment and
special accommodation needs.

If the maintenance income assessed for a child includes such expenses,
the percentage of the total amount received for the child that is for
the disability expenses needs to be assessed. This amount is exempt from
the Maintenance Income Test.

Details provided by Child Support

Child support entitlement and disbursement details provided by Child
Support to Centrelink may include child disability expenses.
