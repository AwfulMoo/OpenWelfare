|                                   |     interview is an opportunity   |
|                                   |     for the customer/other        |
|                                   |     person/ex-partner to put      |
|                                   |     forward their perspective of  |
|                                   |     the circumstances. Even if in |

|                                   |     or documentation their        |
|                                   |     explanation may appear to be  |
|                                   |     implausible, it must be       |
|                                   |     explored in a courteous       |
|                                   |     fashion                       |
|                                   | -   Do not frame questions to     |
|                                   |     suggest a particular answer.  |
|                                   |     And do not assume a fact that |
|                                   |     the customer denies or has    |
|                                   |     yet to admit in the           |
|                                   |     interview. For example, if    |
|                                   |     the customer only admitted    |
|                                   |     cohabitation, it would not be |
|                                   |     appropriate to ask 'So, when  |
|                                   |     did you start your de facto   |
|                                   |     relationship?’ This question  |
|                                   |     assumes that the cohabitation |
|                                   |     was a Member of a Couple      |
|                                   |     relationship                  |
|                                   | -   Questioning should be fair    |
|                                   |     and courteous at all times.   |
|                                   |     Service Officers should not   |
|                                   |     seek to discredit the         |
|                                   |     customer by impeaching the    |
|                                   |     accuracy, credibility and     |
|                                   |     general value of the answers. |
|                                   |     Staff can ask further         |
|                                   |     questions to clarify          |
|                                   |     discrepancies. However, be    |
|                                   |     courteous at all times        |

|                                   |     needs to be updated, or if    |
|                                   |     the customer would like to    |
|                                   |     add a postal address          |
