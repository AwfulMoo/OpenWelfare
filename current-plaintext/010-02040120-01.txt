This document outlines how to assess and record a student or Australian
Apprentice's independence for ABSTUDY on the grounds of returning to
live in an Indigenous Australian community.

Independence criteria

Students and Australian Apprentices applying for ABSTUDY are considered
independent if they:

-   are 16 years of age or older, and
-   have returned to live in an Indigenous Australian community after
    being adopted or fostered by a non-Indigenous family for more than 2
    years

This category of independence is reviewable. Once granted, the student
or Australian Apprentice must notify any changes in their circumstances
within 14 days of the change. For example, if they change address to a
location other than an Indigenous Australian community.
