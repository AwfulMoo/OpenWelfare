This document outlines what mutual obligation requirements can be
included in a Job Plan. A Job Plan records the requirements negotiated
between a job seeker and their Workforce Australia Employment Services
Provider or Services Australia. Job seekers subject to RapidConnect and
in Workforce Australia - Online will need to complete their Career
Profile before they can access and agree to their Job Plan.

Job Seeker approved requirements

To meet their mutual obligation requirements, job seekers must
participate in a range of requirements aimed at improving their
employment prospects and targeted towards a job seeker's individual
needs.

Compulsory and voluntary requirements, or a combination of both, can be
included in the Job Plan. Services Australia is responsible for
negotiating and maintaining Job Plans for Centrelink managed job
seekers.

Job seekers must comply with all compulsory requirements included in
their Job Plan. There are consequences under the Targeted Compliance
Framework or the Job Seeker Compliance Framework if the job seeker does
not comply.

Eligibility for ABSTUDY payments

If a part-time course is included in the Job Plan, and the customer is
Indigenous, they may be eligible for other assistance, for example
Incidentals Allowance, under the ABSTUDY scheme. If the customer is
thinking about applying for ABSTUDY for the part-time course, then the
customer must be made aware that the course cannot be included in the
Job Plan as a compulsory requirement. They must be given the option to
not include it, as a customer is not eligible for ABSTUDY assistance if
the same course of study is a compulsory part of the job seeker's Job
Plan. They will, however, be eligible to apply for ABSTUDY assistance if
the course is included as a voluntary requirement in their Job Plan.

The Resources page contains information about types of requirements that
may be added to a Job Plan.
