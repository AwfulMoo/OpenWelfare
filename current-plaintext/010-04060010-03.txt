|                                   | of the journey (for example       |

|                                   | need to explain why. If public    |
|                                   | transport was available for the   |
|                                   | journey, the person will be       |
|                                   | reimbursed only for the cost of   |
|                                   | the cheapest available public     |
|                                   | transport for that trip, even if  |
|                                   | they chose to travel by taxi.     |

|                                   | Allowance, the applicant needs to |

|                                   | travel. If the applicant is       |
|                                   | eligible for Fares Allowance, the |
|                                   | cheapest reasonable form of       |

|                                   | Note: the applicant can claim any |
|                                   | ancillary costs. For example, the |
|                                   | cost of a bus and/or taxi fare to |
|                                   | the train station after they have |
|                                   | travelled. Any claim for          |
|                                   | reimbursement of fares after the  |
|                                   | applicant has travelled would be  |
|                                   | paid to the applicant.            |
