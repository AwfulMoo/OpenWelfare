This document outlines information about aged care reviews and refunds
process in the Aged Care Staff Portal (ACSP). This document applies to
residential care only.

Aged Care Staff Portal (ACSP)

Service Officers can do the following aged care reviews and refunds
tasks in the Aged Care Staff Portal (ACSP) for residential care
recipients only:

-   Search for reviews with refunds requiring manual approval or
    rejection
-   Search for various review outcomes and refunds
-   View Quarterly Review (QR) results
-   Manage QR
-   View all review outcomes and refunds in relation to an individual
    care recipient
-   Manually approve or reject refund amounts
-   Request an ad hoc review for an individual care recipient

Services Australia undertakes reviews of care recipients’ aged care
fees. This ensures the care recipient’s aged care fees align with
changes in their financial circumstances and Aged Care Funding
Instrument (ACFI) classification.

The residential care review types that occur in the ACSP are:

Ad hoc reviews

-   Can either be an automatic or manually generated review
-   Manually generated ad hoc reviews are usually completed to update a
    care recipient’s ongoing fees immediately outside the QR cycle
-   See Aged care reviews - ad hoc reviews for further information

QR

-   Automatic review of fees every quarter completed for all residential
    care recipients
-   See Aged care reviews – quarterly reviews for further information

Departure reviews

-   Automatic review of fees after a care recipient has departed from a
    residential care service
-   See Aged care reviews – Departure reviews for further information

Annual and Lifetime Cap (ALC) reviews

-   A review to apply a means tested care fee change when a care
    recipient has reached the annual or lifetime cap threshold, or their
    anniversary date
-   See Aged care fees and payments - annual and lifetime caps for
    further information

Most reviews are completed automatically. Any completed review may
result in:

-   a change in ongoing fees and/or a refund, or
-   no change to ongoing fees and no refund payable

When a QR review results in a refund and the refund exceeds the
threshold, it will require a Service Officer to review to either:

-   approve a refund in full (a partial refund is not allowed)
-   reject a refund. A refund amount being rejected and referred for
    further investigation

For home care reviews:

the process of managing QR is completed in the Aged Care Management
Payment System (ACMPS). See the Aged care reviews - quarterly reviews
for the process
