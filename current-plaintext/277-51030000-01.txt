This document outlines how private collection of child support affects
Family Tax Benefit (FTB) instalment customers.

Private collection of child support

Child Support will provide entitlement details to Centrelink for
customers:

-   with a child support assessment, or
-   who have registered a court order or formal agreement with Child
    Support

Child support received by an FTB customer and/or their partner may
affect their rate of FTB.

Customers can receive child support:

-   as a cash benefit paid privately, or
-   as a non-cash benefit by private arrangement

Customers choosing private collect have their maintenance income
assessed using the entitlement method. An FTB instalment customer has
their maintenance income estimated during the year using:

-   the current child support assessment, and
-   any changes to the child support assessment so far in the financial
    year

Assessment of private maintenance income from 1 July 2012

From 1 July 2012 for the Maintenance Income Test (MIT), customers are
deemed to be collecting their child support entitlement, even if:

-   they receive less than their entitlement (unless they have an
    exemption), or
-   the amount collected exceeds their entitlement

Customers do not fail the MAT if they are privately collecting less than
their child support entitlement (the deemed amount).

The customer's deemed amount will:

-   apply even if the amount privately collected is less or more than
    the child support entitlement, or
-   be equal to the amount if child support the customer is entitled to
    under the child support assessment

If the customer is having difficulty collecting their full child support
entitlement, they have a choice of:

-   discussing with Child Support the option to collect child support
    payments from the paying parent (including arrears owing)
-   speaking with a social worker regarding a full or partial exemption
-   continuing to privately collect a lesser amount (the customer will
    continue to be deemed to be receiving the full child support
    administrative assessment amount for FTB purposes)
-   discharging their Child Support arrears for a child support
    collection period, and taking responsibility for collecting the
    arrears themselves. Child Support does not report the discharged
    arrears amount to Centrelink. The customer will need to advise the
    discharged arrears details, so they can be recorded as private child
    support income, or
-   collecting arrears owed from a private collect period by Child
    Support. The arrears payments collected by Child Support will be
    automatically reported to Centrelink and included in the MIT. An
    adjustment needs to be made for the private collection period to
    which the arrears relate

Partial exemptions from the Maintenance Action Test (MAT)

Private collect customers not affected by the change:

-   receive less than their full child support entitlement, and
-   have a partial exemption from the MAT

This is because a determination has already been made that it is
considered reasonable to collect less than their full entitlement (for
example, fear of family and domestic violence).

A customer with partial exemption, will have the child support privately
collected used in the MIT, not the full entitlement.

For advice about child support options customers are to contact Child
Support, either [] online or by phone.

Child Support collect customer

Refer a Child Support collect customer to Child Support if they advise
they have received child support from the paying parent.

Assessment of private maintenance income prior to 1 July 2012

Private collect customers have to collect their full child support
entitlement to receive more than the base rate of FTB Part A.
