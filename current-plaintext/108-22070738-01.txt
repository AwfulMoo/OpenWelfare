This document explains how Single Touch Payroll (STP) data is used by
Services Australia. It explains how employment details and income
components are received, displayed and calculated.

 

What is Single Touch Payroll

Single Touch Payroll (STP) is an Australian Government initiative where
employers report payroll information via STP enabled software to the
Australian Taxation Office (ATO) each time employees are paid. This STP
reported payroll information is known as a pay event and can occur
weekly, fortnightly, monthly or other frequencies.

Payroll reporting of PayEvent 2020 data via STP-enabled software was
mandatory from 1 January 2022. The ATO has, however, taken a flexible
approach based on the readiness of the business and their software
provider. This will mean that Services Australia will continue to see
growth in the number of customers with STP data.

Not all payroll data reported to the ATO is required by Services
Australia to administer the Social Security system. Services Australia
accesses and prepares only the required data in near real time to
pre-fill in customer and staff-facing tools. Pre-filling means customers
do not have to provide information that is already known by the
government and provides a simple, helpful, respectful and transparent
experience.

Single Touch Payroll data

Services Australia can access the STP data of customers who are a mutual
client of the ATO and Services Australia. The data can include:

-   employer name and ABN/WPN
-   employment commencement date
-   employment status (full time, part time or casual)
-   salary and wages
-   allowances
-   bonuses and commission
-   voluntary superannuation deductions
-   reportable fringe benefits
-   workers compensation
-   leave and redundancy payments
-   employment cessation details

This information helps Services Australia to better support customers
when claiming income support payments, when reporting employment income
and in determining family income estimates, through payment accuracy.

STP Service Profiling

When an STP employer reports employment income data for a notification
reporter, the system will automatically place the customer onto
statement reporting. This can be viewed on the Reporting Regime Summary
(RPRS) screen, where the reason will show as STP.

If the customer confirms cessation of work with an STP employer, and is
in receipt of a payment with no mutual obligation requirements, they
will be taken off statement reporting 28 days after their cessation
date, unless the customer and/or partner has other employment income.

Note: if a customer contacts after being placed on reporting and advises
they do not work, Service Officers are not to take them off reporting
without discussing the STP employer details available. This can be done
by running the Earnings and Reporting workflow in Process Direct if it
is their reporting day, or the standalone STP Employer Update workflow.

Reviewing and confirming STP data

STP data is presented to customers when they report through their
Centrelink online account, Express Plus Centrelink mobile app or though
Interactive Voice Response (IVR). When claiming certain income support
payments and benefits, STP data will present through their Centrelink
online account or via an Assisted Customer Claim (ACC).

Service Officers can access STP data when using the following in Process
Direct:

-   Earnings and Reporting workflow
-   STP Employer Update workflow
-   STP Interventions workflow
-   manual navigation to the STP Employer Update (EMCF) or STP Employer
    Wage Items (EMGI) screens (view only)

When STP data is available at the time a customer is reporting or
claiming certain income support payments and benefits, the employer’s
name and ABN/WPN will present for the customer to review and either
confirm or reject that they are working for the STP employer.

When confirmed, the customer can merge the STP employer with an existing
employer where it matches on the record, to avoid any duplication of
employers

-   The customer only needs to confirm each STP employer once

If rejected, the STP employer details are added to EMCF with a status of
‘Rejected’

-   Do not take the customer off reporting
-   If STP data is available when next reporting, the STP employer name
    and ABN/WPN will present again for the customer to review
-   If the customer rejects the employer a second time, an STP
    intervention activity will be created for follow up by compliance
    staff

Once a customer confirms an STP employer, each pay event that occurs in
the customer’s entitlement period pre-fills when reporting, for the
customer to check, confirm or change. Where there are multiple STP
employers, the STP income must be reviewed and accepted separately.

Once STP data is confirmed and accepted by the customer, it is
automatically loaded onto the appropriate screens on the customer’s
record. All employment income components that update to the Employment
Income Paid Details (EAPP) screen will be under the one employer name
with a frequency of LOP. See Recording and correcting employment income
details.

If STP data has not pre-filled at the time of reporting, customers can
manually add the pay components, by selecting ‘add pay event’. Manually
added pay events on EMGI will update to EAPP with a verification code of
‘NVE’.

The EMGI screen displays Gross STP Income reported by the STP employer
and Gross Income Reported by the customer. Income Variation will advise
whether income has been varied downward, varied upward or not varied.

Note: remind the customer that if the information does not match their
payslip details, the amounts can be adjusted. Service Officers who are
using the Earnings and Reporting workflow in Process Direct can add
notes about any variations made before finalising the activity.

Correcting confirmed STP data amounts

STP data that has been reviewed and confirmed by the customer will
display on EAPP with a source code of STV and on the IMPS screen with a
source code of STP. If any of these confirmed amounts need to be
updated, evidence must be provided before corrections can be made by
Service Officers. Do not manually make any updates directly on EAPP or
IMPS.

Corrections to these confirmed amounts must be made using the Earnings
and Reporting workflow in Process Direct, and selecting Yes to wanting
to ‘update income for a past period’. After selecting the relevant
periods from the Past Period Range, the EMGI screen appears. The pay
events for each reporting period will display one at a time and once the
corrections are made, will update the coding on EAPP or IMPS.

Note: if the Earnings and Reporting workflow task in Process Direct is
not selected, the edit option on EMGI will not be enabled so Service
Officers will only be able to view the STP data.

Cessation data

When a customer ceases work with an STP employer, cessation data will
pre-fill and include:

-   the date they stopped working
-   the reason they are no longer working
-   whether any unused leave and/or a redundancy payment has been paid

Customers will be asked to provide an explanation when:

-   they are subject to mutual obligation requirements during statement
    reporting or in a new claim
-   STP cessation data is pre-filled, and
-   the STP employer advises the cessation reason is dismissal or
    voluntary

An unemployment failure will automatically generate for PST-skilled
Service Officers to investigate.

When leave and redundancy payments are reported with cessation data, the
customer will be asked to provide the amount of days the leave covers or
their average weekly wage, to determine the duration of any potential
Income Maintenance Period (IMP). Service Officers must ensure that the
leave period is reasonable.

For example, for an unused leave payment of $900 (annual leave), 2 days
would be considered unreasonable but 5 days would be reasonable.

The customer will not need to supply an Employment Separation
Certificate (SU1) when there are no changes made to the cessation data.
However, if there are changes to amounts paid or there is any doubt
about the number of days of the leave or termination payments, an SU1 or
letter from the employer will be required.

Note: some employers may pay their employees Unused leave on Termination
with no actual cessation date or reason being pre-filled. If this
occurs, the customer will be asked if they are still working for that
employer and may need to provide an SU1 where they confirm they have
ceased working. This may occur for the following scenarios:

Transition to Phase 2 PayEvent 2020 (PE2020)

In situations where an employment relationship terminates prior to the
employer transitioning into PayEvent 2020, it is possible that after
they transition to PayEvent 2020 the employer may still make a payment
of unused leave to the individual. That may result in cessation date and
reason being unavailable within the payroll system, as the timing of the
termination was prior to transition, during phase 1. Unused leave and
terminations payments will update to IMP. An SU1/letter from employer
will be required for payments subject to mutual obligation requirements.

Employment basis changes from permanent to casual

Where an employee changes from a permanent employment basis (full time
or part time) to casual. When paid, these entitlements are correctly
classified in STP as unused leave on termination but because the
individual remains a casual employee of the same employer the payment is
assessed as a lump sum and coded on EAPP.

Reinstatement

An employee may leave their employment, be paid their entitlements, and
later be reinstated. Commonly, this can occur in wrongful termination
situations and the effect of the reinstatement is that the cessation is
taken to have never occurred. The instruction for employers is to remove
the cessation date. However, the reinstatement does not change the fact
a payment for unused leave was made, and so it must remain in the STP
reporting. The STP reporting will, as a result, show amounts present as
Unused Leave on Termination without a cessation date or reason. If the
customer advises they are still working for that employer, the payment
is assessed as a lump sum and coded on EAPP.

Pay Per Period (PayPP) amounts

Services Australia uses the STP data from Pay Events to calculate a Pay
Per Period (PayPP) amount. This is done by comparing the gross YTD (Year
to Date) figure of all income components from the previous Pay Event
with that of the current Pay Event. The difference between these amounts
will display as the PayPP amount.

When presented with pre-filled STP data, customers must review and
either confirm or change the PayPP information before the system will
code and apply the amounts. Confirmed PayPP amounts are used to
calculate a customer’s entitlement.

For further information about the different types of income components
refer to Assessment of employment income for Centrelink payments.

Income components that are assessable and included in the PayPP
calculation are displayed to customers when they are reporting through
their Centrelink online account or the Express Plus mobile app, and to
Services Officers on the EMGI screen in Process Direct. See Resources to
view which allowances are assessable.

Compensation payments reported via STP

Customers who are paid worker’s compensation payments by an STP
employer, will have these amounts pre-filled as Paid leave - worker’s
compensation.

When compensation payments are reported through STP, the system will
check the Compensation Management Summary (CMS) screen for a previous
assessment by the Compensation Recovery Team (CRT). Where this has
already been assessed and is coded on CMS, the amounts reported through
STP will not be applied to the record, unless the amounts have changed.

Where there has not been a previous assessment of the worker’s
compensation, the pre-filled Paid leave - worker’s compensation amount
will automatically load onto the EAPP screen for at least 2 fortnights.
The customer will need to complete a MOD C - Compensation Details form.
This can be completed verbally during the customer contact, or via a
paper form.

STP Interventions

A compliance team will manage interaction activities that trigger due to
certain variations made by customers to their STP data.

There are currently 3 STP intervention activity types to address the
following actions:

-   a customer has rejected the STP employer a second time
-   a customer varies the STP reported employment income that is
    presented for the first time
-   a customer varies the STP reported employment income downward by at
    least $299 across a 6 month period

There will be further triggers released to expand the total interaction
activity types to 8. The purpose of our STP interventions is to prevent
unnecessary overpayments for our customers with early education
regarding correct reporting of employment circumstances.

detailing how certain Pay Per Period (PayPP) amounts are calculated for
various scenarios.
