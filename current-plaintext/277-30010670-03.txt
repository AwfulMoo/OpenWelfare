Manually create an ERR

In exceptional circumstances, an ERR may be required to be created to
enable reconciliation of payments received on the employer account.
These can be, but are not limited to:

-   when reconciling s72A payer payments. See Reconcile section 72A
    payments (from manual and non STP employers) Cuba Process Help for
    more information regarding this process
-   when an ERR has not created due to a Cuba error. If this is the
    case, seek further information from a SSO prior, to determine if
    creating an ERR is appropriate based on the circumstances

Complete an employer reconciliation match

The employer reconciliation match process is used to manually finalise
an ERR when an ERR is unable to auto-reconcile, or when an
auto-reconciliation is not appropriate.

Note: the ERR that is to be matched needs to be set to INIT.

Table 3: this table describes how to manually match unallocated
payments, or use top up or excess cash to reconcile an ERR.

Unsubmit a matched ERR

If after matching and submitting an ERR for reconciliation an error is
picked up, or the employer advises of changes to a payer’s actual
deduction amount, amend the ERR prior to the batch run.

Adjusting an ERR

Service Support Officers (SSO) reviewing the creation of a consolidated
revenue debt as a result of an adjustment to the ERR, go to Step 8.

Note1: any adjustments that are made after reconciliation has been
successfully performed may impact on consolidated revenue. Caution
should be taken that all information is as accurate as possible.

Note: ERRs should not be deleted unless the pay dates included should
never have been created. If an ERR needs to be deleted it should be
discussed with an SSO.

When an ERR is deleted the Payer Employer Withholding Enquiry window
displays a status code of DLTE for that pay date. The status does not
update on this window if the pay date is subsequently re-created and
reconciled.

Table 5: this table describes how to make adjustments to an ERR once
employer withholding reconciliation has occurred.
