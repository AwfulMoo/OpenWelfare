This document outlines the changes to hospitalisation reviews. There is
no limit on the number of days a child can be hospitalised for the carer
to retain eligibility for CP and CA, as long as the carer is providing
additional care and attention on a regular and ongoing basis.

Payable during hospitalisation

For adults or children who are hospitalised, the carer may qualify for
payment if the claim is made while the care receiver is in hospital.
This includes babies who have not been home since birth and care
receivers who have a terminal illness.

12 week review

Carers paid CP and/or CA for a child who is hospitalised are reviewed
every 12 weeks (84 days) of continuous hospitalisation using a Review of
Carer Payment and Carer Allowance while your child is in hospital
(SA396). This is a pre-populated form.

24 month full care and medical review

After 24 months of continuous hospitalisation, a Care Load review is
undertaken. The Care Load review is then repeated for each 12 months of
continuous hospitalisation. For example, the child has been in hospital
continuously for 36 months. The care load and medical review includes
completion of a Care Needs Assessment (CNA) and medical report.

The Resources page contains information about the relevant review forms
to be issued every 12 weeks for 24 months, at 24 months and then every
12 months of continuous hospitalisation.
