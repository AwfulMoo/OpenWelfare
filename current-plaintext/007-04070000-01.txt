This document outlines the processes to be followed when a Double Orphan
Pension (DOP) child dies. The DOP payment will cease and if the carer is
an individual, they may be entitled to receive some form of bereavement
payment.

DOP bereavement assistance

DOP bereavement assistance can include:

-   if the child was a Family Tax Benefit (FTB) child of a person, or
    the carer was receiving a service pension and the rate included a
    dependent child add on or guardian allowance for the child,
    continued payment for up to 14 weeks, paid as instalments or as a
    lump sum
-   if the child was not an FTB child, continued payment for 4 weeks

If the carer is an Approved Care Organisation (ACO), no bereavement
payment is available.

Before any action can be taken, the death must be confirmed, see
Confirmation of the death of an adult or child.

The bereavement payment of DOP will be assessed by the DOP and
Bereavement Smart Centre Processing Team. If there is the possibility of
an overpayment, the Service Centre will transfer an ACTDOC to the DOP
Processing Team.

The Resources page contains a link to information for customers on the
Services Australia website about what to do following a death, an
example of how to calculate the bereavement payment and a link to the
Bereavement/DOP Helpdesk for support.
