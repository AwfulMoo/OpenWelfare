Risks to a customer's privacy have been identified. See Separating
Safely - protecting personal details to make sure the customer's
personal details are safe before progressing.

This document outlines information about updating Child Support customer
and assessment information.

Requirement to update Register

Section 13 of the Child Support Registration and Collection Act 1988
requires the Registrar to keep a register of information - known as the
Child Support Register. Section 26 specifies the particulars which are
required and are able to be entered into the Register.

A range of events make it necessary to change entries in the Register.
These include personal information covered in this document.

This document will help ensure that:

-   an accurate decision is made on the information received and
    particulars entered into or varied in the Register (parents have
    objection rights)
-   both parents are fully informed of any changes
-   both parents understand the changes to their registered maintenance
    liability (if any)

The Resources page contains links to information about updating customer
information, Australian Tax Office (ATO) contact details, letters and a
checklist.
