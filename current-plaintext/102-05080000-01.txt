This document outlines information about exemptions from mutual
obligation requirements for job seekers, due to caring responsibilities.

Job Seekers

A JobSeeker Payment (JSP)/Youth Allowance (YA) job seeker can be
exempted from their mutual obligation requirements in special
circumstances. The job seeker's circumstances need to be unforeseen and
causing them major disruption so they are unable to meet their mutual
obligation requirements and it would be unreasonable to expect them to
do so. A person who is looking for work may have the caring
responsibility for a family member who is sick. Job seekers may apply
for an exemption from their mutual obligation requirements for 13 weeks
if this occurs.

If the job seeker is a principal carer, other exemptions, of up to 12
months at a time, may apply if special family circumstances related to
the care of a dependent child exist.
