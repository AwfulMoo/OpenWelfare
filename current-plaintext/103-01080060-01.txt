This document outlines the criteria and process for determining an
exemption from Income Management for certain customers receiving Special
Benefit (SpB).

Exemptions from Income Management

Exemptions from Income Management applies to the Disengaged Youth and
Long Term Welfare Payment Recipient measures only.

Customers receiving SpB may be granted an exemption from Income
Management where both the following are met:

-   they are not the principal carer of a child under 6 years of age,
    and
-   are aged 16 years or older

Background

Customers who are receiving SpB because they do not meet the residency
requirement for Age Pension, Disability Support Pension, or Carer
Payment are treated in the same way as customers who are eligible for
these payments and therefore should be exempt.

Note: SpB customers who are exempt from Income Management under this
criteria can still volunteer for Income Management or be assessed by a
social worker for the Vulnerable Welfare Payment Recipients measure.

The Resources page contains links to the National transfer numbers,
Technical Support Line and the Income Management Exemption and
Assessment Team (IMEAT) in Locator.
