This document outlines information for the ordering of Australian Organ
Donor Register (AODR) brochures.

AODR brochure orders

Orders for AODR brochures can be made for Service Centres and the AODR
State headquarters (SHQ) Teams. Brochures can be provided and posted
with letters to potential organ donor registrants, if requested. For
example:

-   the customer would like to register
-   the customer requests an amendment to the organs/tissue selected on
    their registration
-   the customer requests a donor card, but has an existing intent
    registration
-   the customer wishes to have information in pamphlet form because
    they are unsure if they wish to register

The self-service option is available through myGov and the Express Plus
mobile app and should be promoted in the first instance. A registration
form can be mailed to the customer, if required.

Orders are generally actioned by Management via Services Australia
Product Ordering Portal (POP). Where staff notice stock is depleted,
escalate orders to the appropriate site staff.

The Resources page contains contact details, links to POP information
and how to respond to public or bulk requests for AODR brochures.
