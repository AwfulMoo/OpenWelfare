+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Scenario                          | Description                       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Shelagh requests Austudy payments |
|                                   | to be cancelled                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Shelagh is a full-time student    |
|                                   | receiving Austudy and Shelagh's   |
|                                   | circumstances are unchanged.      |
|                                   | Shelagh is still studying, has    |
|                                   | minimal other income and is still |
|                                   | single. Shelagh has decided to no |
|                                   | longer get Austudy and contacts   |
|                                   | Services Australia to request     |
|                                   | payments be cancelled.            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | After discussing the case, the    |
|                                   | Service Officer cancels Shelagh's |
|                                   | payments on the date provided by  |
|                                   | Shelagh and records on the system |
|                                   | it was done at the customer's     |
|                                   | request.                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | As Shelagh is still entitled to   |
|                                   | Austudy, Shelagh decides the date |
|                                   | of cancellation. If Shelagh       |
|                                   | chooses a date after the date     |
|                                   | paid to plus one day, then there  |
|                                   | will still be some remaining      |
|                                   | entitlement payable. This is paid |
|                                   | once Shelagh reports any income   |
|                                   | from employment.                  |

| 2                                 | Kevin has stopped studying and    |
|                                   | has requested cancellation of     |
|                                   | payments                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Kevin, who is 24 years old, has   |
|                                   | stopped studying 1 week ago.      |
|                                   | Kevin contacts Services Australia |
|                                   | and requests payments be          |
|                                   | cancelled and is not applying for |
|                                   | any other payment at this stage.  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Although Kevin has requested the  |
|                                   | cancellation, this is not a case  |
|                                   | of cancellation at the customer's |
|                                   | request. As Kevin stopped         |
|                                   | studying, there is no entitlement |
|                                   | to Youth Allowance (YA). The      |
|                                   | Service Officer will code the     |
|                                   | cessation of study on Kevin's     |
|                                   | Education Course Details (EDC)    |
|                                   | and Newstart Education Status     |
|                                   | (NES) screens. Once the updates   |
|                                   | are completed and the assessment  |
|                                   | finalised, payments will          |
|                                   | automatically cancel as of the    |
|                                   | day after the last day of study.  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If Kevin has been receiving       |
|                                   | income from employment the        |
|                                   | Service Officer must ask for that |
|                                   | income to be reported so any      |
|                                   | remaining YA entitlement may be   |
|                                   | correctly paid.                   |
