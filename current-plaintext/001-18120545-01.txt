This document explains when early or late lodgement of a job seeker
report can be accepted.

Early reporting

Reporting Statement (SU19) due date

A statement reporter job seeker must report on their on their
Entitlement Period End Date (EPED). The questions in the Reporting
Statement relate to the full fortnight period or the relevant period for
variable reporters.

Early reporting may be accepted if:

-   a customer changes their pay day code, see Changing Entitlement
    Period End Dates (EPED)
-   arrangements are in place for national public holiday processing.
    Job seekers will be notified of the early reporting date, see
    Payment and reporting arrangements over national public holiday
    periods
-   customer advises they are going overseas, see Assessing and coding
    employment income

Customers can view a summary of due to report dates and reporting
periods in their online account. All reporting periods within 12 weeks
of the date viewed will display. The summary is accessed by selecting
Income and Assets > Employment Income > Next reporting periods from the
menu.

Variable reporting

A job seeker on variable reporting can use self-managed service
reporting on their non-stimulus Entitlement Period End Day (EPED). A job
seeker must report employment income paid in their reporting fortnight
if they are a notification reporter.

If the job seeker, or their partner, receives a family assistance
payment, updates to the estimate due to the change in income may be
needed.

Late reporting

Determining and recording a late report

If a job seeker reports late or a self service reporter is referred to a
Service Officer after the report 'drops through', discuss the reason for
late reporting and remind the job seeker to report on their due date to
avoid delays in payment.

Determine:

-   whether or not the reason for late reporting is acceptable
-   if any special circumstances apply for reporting form late, and
-   if payment will be approved and processed

The Service Officer must record:

-   whether or not the reason is satisfactory/acceptable, and
-   for job seekers with mutual obligation requirements or pending
    compliance investigations, how the job seeker has met requirements
    during this period

Reason for late reporting not acceptable

If the reason(s) for late reporting is/are not acceptable, the Service
Officer can cancel/suspend payment and advise the job seeker of the
decision. If payment is cancelled, advise the job seeker to test their
eligibility and re-claim. Job seekers must be advised in writing the
reason their payment is cancelled/suspended.

Outstanding compliance action

Where a job seeker has a participation-related payment suspension or
outstanding compliance action, they will need to re-engage with their
Employment Services Provider and/or speak to the Participation Solutions
Team (PST) about any outstanding failure investigation before reporting
can be finalised. Service Officers must check the Participation
Compliance workflow summary and where the:

-   Completed/Provider to Action section shows outstanding compliance
    actions the provider is responsible for managing, advise the job
    seeker to contact their provider, and/or
-   Outstanding section shows a compliance investigation is outstanding,
    assist the job seeker to contact the PST

Note: any changes to the customer's circumstances on the Reporting
Statement (SU19) must be updated before the customer contacts the PST.

Self service for reporting customers

The obligation to report on their due date applies to job seekers who
use self service (online, Express Plus mobile app or phone self
service). Self service reporters can report up to 13 days after the due
date without any penalty or cancellation.

If the job seeker tries to report more than 13 days after their due
Entitlement Period End Day (EPED) using the self service channels,
reporting will not be available as they will be cancelled Did Not Lodge
(CAN-DNL). The job seeker will receive a message which will refer them
to a Service Officer for assistance.

Job seekers can:

-   update and correct reported employment income online using the
    Update employment income service to change initial report
-   correct employment income reported in the last 6 reporting periods

Note: employment income confirmed via the Single Touch Payroll (STP)
channel cannot be corrected via self service. Customers must discuss
changes and provide evidence to staff.

Genuine attempts must be made to transition customers to report via self
service options before assisted reporting is completed, unless an
Exception applies.

Late Reporting Customers (LRC) screen

The LRC screen lists names and home and/or mobile phone contact numbers
for customers who are due to report on a specified date but have not yet
reported.

The LRC screen is not to be used for these customers regardless of their
choice of reporting channel.

See Reporting screens for information on the LRC screen.

Customer fails to report

A job seeker's payment will not be generated until the Reporting
Statement is submitted and processed. Late reporting (after 5pm on the
due date) can result in the customer and/or their partner’s payment
being delayed.

If the partner is a:

-   notification reporter, payment is made automatically regardless of
    whether the customer has reported or not
-   statement reporter (fortnightly/2 weekly), payment is generated when
    the job seeker reports. Usually when the job seeker reports, their
    partner's payment is generated, unless the partner has mutual
    obligation requirements and is also required to report

If a job seeker fails to report for 2 consecutive fortnights (28 days),
the payment will cancel automatically from Date Paid To +1 (DPT +1). For
more information, see JobSeeker Payment (JSP) cancellations, suspensions
and restorations.

Variable reporting customer fails to report

If the customer is on variable reporting, payments issued automatically
cannot be proven until a Reporting Statement is lodged. For example, if
the customer doesn’t report within 15 days of their reporting date,
payment will cancel back to date last reported +1.

If a job seeker was previously on a variable reporting cycle when
cancelled did not lodge (CAN/DNL) or cancelled failed to report
(CAN/FRP), the system automatically creates an undetermined debt shell.
The debt shell is automatically placed on hold for 21 days to allow time
for the job seeker to make contact and report. If the job seeker reports
while the debt shell is on hold, it will adjust if the payment is
restored. If no report has occurred in the 21 days the debt shell is on
hold, the debt can then be investigated.

When a debt shell is created, a cancellation letter is automatically
sent to the job seeker. This letter advises the job seeker to report
within 14 days of receiving the notification by contacting Services
Australia via phone or going to a service centre. The letter includes a
warning that failure to report may result in a debt being raised for
payments already received within the reporting period.

The expectation for these job seekers is that they contact to discuss
their options for preventing the CAN/DNL or CAN/FRP debt.

Reporting within 13 weeks of payment cancellation

If the job seeker is seeking restoration and reports within 13 weeks of
payment cancellation and it is has been determined:

-   the job seeker was entitled to payment during that period, and
-   continuing ongoing entitlement has been established,

the payment must be restored from the cancellation date and Reporting
Statements are required for each 2 weekly reporting period from their
cancellation date. These Reporting Statements can be confirmed verbally
if the mutual obligation requirements have been met and all employment
income is reported for each 2 weekly reporting period.

When the job seeker's income support payment is:

-   suspended or cancelled, outstanding compliance action is maintained
    where it is likely the payment may be restored back to the
    suspension/cancellation date
-   restored, outstanding compliance action may need to be actioned
    before reporting can be finalised
-   cancelled for a participation-related reason, the payment may not be
    restorable and the job seeker will have to reclaim payment

If the system prompts arrears ensure arrears are correct, particularly
if a debt has already been raised due to the job seeker failing to
report.

If arrears have been manually adjusted to ensure a duplicate payment is
not made, the Service Officer must send an ACTDOC to the relevant Debt
Raising Team to allow adjustment of the debt. The Debt Raising Team is
responsible for adjusting the debt.

Report more than 13 weeks after cancellation

Job seekers who try to report more than 13 weeks after notification of
cancellation, must lodge a new claim.

If the job seeker applies for a formal review of the cancellation
decision, follow normal review and appeal procedures.
