This document outlines how the value of real estate and other assets is
maintained.

Risk based assessment

From 28 June 2014, a risk based model for real estate assessments is
used.

It responds to changes in the customer's circumstances, and in the real
estate market.

Customers provide an estimate. The model decides the best way to assess
the value of the asset. This could result in:

-   accepting the estimate
-   checking the estimate
-   formal valuation

Formal valuations

A formal valuation can be started by:

-   the system at any time under the risk based model, or
-   an APS 5 or above

If a formal valuation is in progress, an activity displays on the Future
Activity List (FAL) screen. The activity:

-   can be on the customer's or partner’s record
-   displays Valuation, and the property ID(s) it relates to

Some formal valuations need to be initiated outside the system and may
not have a FAL activity. For example, a historical valuation is in
progress. The details will be on a DOC, or noted on another activity. If
unsure, email the Valuation Helpdesk. Note: this email address is not to
be given to customers.

The Real Estate Details (RE) screen is updated when the valuation is
completed. The ‘Asset Valuation Source’ will be ‘VAL’ or 'ONS'.

Annual indexation

An annual indexation is applied to the property value of houses, units
and townhouses to maintain the value of real estate assets on customer
records.

Some property types are not subject to indexation, although an
indexation amount will display on the record. See Maintaining the value
of real estate assets on customer records for more information.

Real estate located in Australia

From 28 June 2014, staff can accept the customer's estimate of the value
of Australian real estate for all income support payments unless they
think it is unreasonable. Note: exceptions apply to claims for Pension
Bonus Bereavement Payment (PBBP) or where the Pension Bonus Scheme (PBS)
is involved.

After the grant of the income support payment, the property and customer
circumstances are profiled. The appropriate valuation regime is applied.
If a formal valuation is required, it automatically submits. Returned
valuation data automatically uploads to the customer's record.

Staff must correctly record all information provided by the customer,
including all mandatory fields on the Real Estate Valuation Information
(REVI) screen. The Real Estate Details (MOD R) collects and helps assess
real estate details. Supporting documents needed may include:

-   evidence of any mortgage on the property
-   latest council rates/valuation notice
-   certificate of title or any other title document

Unreasonable estimate at claim

If an APS 5 or above considers the customer estimate is unreasonable, a
valuation is needed before grant. For example, if a customer lives on 25
hectares and advises the value of the home and 2 hectares is the same as
the total property, the APS 5 or above could consider this as
unreasonable.

APS5 can request a valuation within the new claim activity from the Real
Estate Valuation Information (REVI) screen.

PBS and PBBP claims

Some claims will not finalise without a valuation of real estate assets.
They are:

-   Age Pension claims for customers registered for Pension Bonus Scheme
    (PBS)
-   Pension Bonus Bereavement Payment (PBBP)

Liabilities secured over exempt and assessable assets

Accept the customer's estimated value of the exempt asset (for example,
principal home) in most circumstances. If it appears the value is
unreasonable, email details to the Valuation Helpdesk.

If the property has an apportioned liability, the apportionment needs
recalculating if the assessed asset value changes due to an estimate
verification or formal verification.

Review of decision

Maintaining the value of real estate assets on customer records has
information about the process to follow if a customer disagrees with the
amount assessed for real estate assets.
