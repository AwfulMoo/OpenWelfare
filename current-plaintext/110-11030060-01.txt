This document outlines how evidence from an expert witness can be
obtained for fraud investigation and how details are to be maintained on
the investigation record.

Expert witness

An expert witness is an independent witness with a high level of
knowledge, skill or a specialist in the field of evidence to be
presented. They should be selected with consideration of their standing,
qualifications, capabilities and relevant experience. They may be a
person from within Services Australia, or an external person.

The witness needs to be impartial and separate from the investigation
team. They are to be quarantined from the investigation to ensure that
their expert opinion is impartial.

Investigation record

The following case notes and documents are to be recorded:

-   any relevant legal advice obtained regarding using an expert witness
-   court practice notes or case law relating to expert witnesses
-   if experts are to examine material that has a security
    classification, consider the need for a non-disclosure agreement
    before starting work on the investigation

A witness statement or affidavit from the expert witness is to have a
full list of their formal qualifications and a summary of their relevant
experience.
