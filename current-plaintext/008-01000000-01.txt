This document outlines information on the assessment of customer
circumstances at initial contact to identify and provide products and
services for people that are ill, injured or have a disability.

Government intent

When a customer contacts Services Australia seeking assistance because
they are ill, injured or have a disability, they only need to explain
their current circumstances. The agency will then assess the customer's
circumstances so that a package of products and services may be offered
to the customer.

Initial contact

The initial contact may be made to the agency either by phone or in
person. This is when the customer is offered payments and services that
suit their circumstances.

Intent to claim provisions were amended on 1 July 2018 and apply only to
customers in vulnerable circumstances.

Consider alternative payments and services

If the customer's illness, injury or disability does not result in a
continuing inability to work and the customer does not have a job or
study to return to when recovered, alternative payments and services may
be more appropriate.
