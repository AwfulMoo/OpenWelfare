This document outlines how and when declarations are used for Medicare
Compensation Recovery.

Declaration types

Medicare Compensation Recovery uses 2 different declarations for an
injured person to declare something to be true and correct:

Declaration sent with Medicare history statement (if applicable) as part
of the notice to claimant

This declaration allows the injured person to declare that:

-   the services identified (if applicable) in their returned Medicare
    history statement do relate to the compensable injury or illness,
    and
-   they have, or have not, been admitted to a nursing home, residential
    care facility or received home care for the treatment of the injury
    or illness either on a temporary or permanent basis

The Resources page contains a link to the Commonwealth of Australia
Declaration Criminal Code Act 1995 form (MO028).

Section 23A statement including declaration

An injured person or claimant may declare that on the date the amount of
compensation is fixed under a judgment or settlement that:

-   if a notice of past benefits has never been issued, that no Medicare
    and nursing home benefits, or residential and home care subsidies
    have been paid in the course of treatment of, or as a result of the
    injury or illness, or
-   if a notice of past benefits has previously been issued and has
    expired, that no further Medicare and nursing home benefits, or
    residential and home care subsidies have been paid in the course of
    treatment of, or as a result of, the injury or illness

A section 23A statement must be received in writing. The section 23A
statement must be signed and dated by the injured person within 28 days
after the date the amount of compensation is fixed.

Where the notice of judgment or settlement received by Services
Australia indicates a section 23A statement is being provided but it is
not enclosed, a Service Officer must then contact the injured person or
their solicitor and attempt to obtain the document.

The Resources page contains a link to the Medicare Compensation Recovery
section 23A statement form (MO023).

Age of person signing a declaration

There are no legislative rulings in relation to the minimum age of a
person that can sign a declaration. For the purposes of Medicare
Compensation Recovery, a person is considered to be a minor when they
are under 14 years of age.

For all other legal matters a minor is regarded as a person under 18
years of age. Where the injured person is over 14 years of age and under
18 years of age, declarations (including the Medicare history statement
and section 23A statement) can be completed by the:

-   minor under 18 years of age, if they are capable of understanding
    and signing the declaration on their own behalf
-   claimant (normally a parent or guardian) provided the minor under 18
    years of age is enrolled on the parent or guardian’s Medicare card
-   legal representative or litigation guardian (normally appointed by
    the courts)

Valid/invalid Medicare history statement declaration

A valid declaration must have:

-   full name of person making the declaration - injured person (or
    claimant) or authorised third party
-   address of person making the declaration - injured person (or
    claimant) or authorised third party
-   a tick against 1 box in relation to nursing home, residential or
    home care (if both boxes are ticked the declaration is invalid), and
-   signature of the person making the declaration and the date
    declaration is signed

Where the person making the declaration is not the injured person, it
must include:

-   the full name of injured person in the 'Injured person's details'
    fields

Note: if the declaration is being completed on behalf of the injured
person - supporting documentation may be required. For example, Power of
Attorney, Court Order or Last Will & Testament, or for an authorised
third party, a Medicare Compensation Recovery Third party authority form
(MO021).

If the new MO028.2102 declaration is being completed by the injured
person

-   where the name or address details are missing from Q8, and
-   the injured person has completed their details on the form, the
    declaration can be accepted provided the signature can identify the
    injured person

A check may be required on other documents completed by the injured
person such as a previously completed declaration or a Medicare
Compensation Recovery Bank details collection form (MO024) or if
necessary by a phone call to the person, to confirm that the injured
person completed the declaration.

Valid/invalid section 23A statement

A valid section 23A statement must:

-   include full name of injured person
-   include address of injured person
-   include date of birth of injured person
-   include signature of the person making the declaration
-   be signed within 28 days after the amount of compensation was fixed
    by judgment or settlement (date of settlement), and
-   be completed on the current Medicare Compensation Recovery Section
    23A Statement form (MO023)

Note: if the declaration is being completed on behalf of the injured
person, the full name and address of the claimant is also required under
claimant's details. Supporting documentation may be required. For
example, Power of Attorney, Court Order or Last Will & Testament, or for
an authorised third party, a Medicare Compensation Recovery Third party
authority form (MO021).

An invalid section 23A statement is when the:

-   full name and address of injured person is not completed
-   date of birth of injured person is not completed
-   full name and address of claimant is not completed under claimant's
    details (if applicable)
-   signature of the person making the declaration is not completed
-   date the declaration is signed is not within 28 days after the
    amount of compensation was fixed by judgment or settlement (date of
    settlement)
-   declaration is signed prior to the date the amount of compensation
    was fixed by judgment or settlement (date of settlement)
-   declaration is not completed on the current Medicare Compensation
    Recovery Section 23A Statement form (MO023)

Note: if the Medicare card number or Medicare compensation case
reference number is not provided this does not make the section 23A
statement invalid.

Valid s23A statement and valid s18 statement by claimant received for the same case

If the injured person or claimant submits a valid s23A statement
declaring that:

-   no Medicare and nursing home benefits, or residential and home care
    subsidies have been received in relation to the injury or illness,
    or
-   no further Medicare and nursing home benefits, or residential and
    home care subsidies have been received in relation to the injury or
    illness, and

Services Australia has also received a Medicare history statement and
declaration under section 18 (statement by claimant) from the injured
person or claimant declaring that they:

-   have received Medicare and nursing home benefits, or residential and
    home care subsidies in relation to the injury or illness, or
-   have received Medicare and nursing home benefits, or residential and
    home care subsidies in relation to the injury or illness since the
    last notice of past benefits expired, then

the agency must process the verified statement by claimant and include
all eligible benefits received in relation to the compensable injury or
illness in the notice of charge.

See Statement by claimant for Medicare Compensation Recovery for more
information.

Assessing a valid statement including declaration

A statement with a valid declaration received with a Medicare history
statement or notice of judgment or settlement is subject to review if,
within 28 days of receiving the document, Services Australia believes
the statement is not substantially correct.

Any decisions regarding a statement that is not substantially correct
can be appealed through the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. All
decisions must be fully considered and approved by Level APS4 or above
before issuing a notice not substantially correct.
