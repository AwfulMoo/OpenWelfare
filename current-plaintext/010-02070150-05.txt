January 2019 and scenarios of changes to study that affect entitlement.

Term-in-advance payments prior to 1 January 2019

Before 1 January 2019, ABSTUDY payments delivered to boarding schools,
or hostels which are a signatory to the Standard Hostel Agreement, were
delivered as a lump sum term-in-advance payment. An ABSTUDY payment that
was delivered term-in-advance, comprised the total calculated payments,
taking into account the student's circumstances and relevant means
tests, for the relevant school term entitlement period. It was delivered
in a lump sum on a designated payment date of the fourth Thursday of the
school term. A term-in-advance payment processed after the fourth
Thursday was still delivered, but as a lump sum payment. The school term
entitlement periods were:

-   1 January to 31 March
-   1 April to 30 June
-   1 July to 30 September
-   1 October to 31 December
