This document outlines how to action review of FSL decisions.

Closure of SFSS

The SFSS closed from 1 January 2004. Since June 2008 all outstanding FSL
have been transferred to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) for
recovery.

Review of FSL decisions

FSL decisions are reviewed by Services Australia or the Australian
Taxation Office (ATO).

The agency reviews:

-   the student's eligibility to receive the FSL
-   the balance of FSL debt transferred to the ATO
-   the amount of FSL originally paid, including any trade-in or trade
    back
-   the amount of bonus applied to repayments
-   the amount of Consumer Price Index (CPI) adjustment applied before
    the loan was transferred to the ATO, and
-   voluntary repayments that were made before the FSL debt was
    transferred to the ATO

There is no time limit for asking for a review of a SFSS decision made
under the social security law.

The ATO reviews:

-   CPI adjustments applied after the FSL debt was transferred to the
    ATO
-   the amount of compulsory payments to be made
-   deferring or reducing the amount of compulsory repayments, and
-   voluntary repayments made after the FSL debt was transferred to the
    ATO

A customer can seek a waiver of their FSL debt. The waiver is done under
the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (PGPA
Act).

Note: more information regarding a customer's study can also be obtained
from the Education Support Programs Team. This information can be sought
if required to undertake a formal review or if requested by the
Administrative Appeals Tribunal.
