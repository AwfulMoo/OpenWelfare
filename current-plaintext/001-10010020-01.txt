This document outlines Services Australia's roles and responsibilities
in managing job seeker compliance with compulsory requirements and
re-engagement following non-compliance.

Conveying key messages at participation related contacts

Services Australia staff are responsible for reinforcing the following
messages to job seekers during participation related contacts:

To receive a participation payment, the job seeker is expected to:

-   do all they can to find work
-   take personal responsibility for meeting their requirements and
    letting their provider know about anything that may impact their
    ability to do this. This includes recording personal events in a
    calendar so the provider is aware of any issues when setting
    requirements
-   participate in employment services and other activities based on
    their assessed capacity
-   talk with their provider about any circumstances impacting their
    ability to meet requirements so their Job/Participation Plan is
    appropriate and achievable
-   contact their provider beforehand if unable to meet a requirement
-   be aware of what will happen if they do not comply with
    requirements, and
-   if they miss a requirement, re-connect with their provider as
    quickly as possible

Identifying circumstances impacting capacity to comply with compulsory requirements

Services Australia staff may identify personal circumstances impacting a
job seeker's capacity to comply with compulsory requirements. It is
important the circumstances impacting on the job seeker's ability to
comply are recorded on the job seeker's record. The Circumstance
impacting Compliance (CiC) page is used to record the relevant
information. This will help ensure:

-   the provider considers job seeker circumstances when adding
    compulsory requirements in their Job Plan
-   where non-compliance occurs, circumstances are considered if
    determining a failure

Job seeker circumstances impacting ability to comply may be recorded
from any contact with job seekers, including:

-   Participation Solution Team (PST) skilled Service Officers during
    compliance investigations, Capability Assessments or Comprehensive
    Compliance Assessments (CCAs). Note: a PST Skilled Service Officer
    must consult with a PST-skilled Social Worker where the job seeker
    presents with family and domestic violence or has a current Family
    relationships/Domestic violence circumstance recorded. See Accessing
    a PST-skilled social worker
-   Social worker assistance
-   Specialist officers - Community Engagement Officers, Multicultural
    Services Officers, Indigenous Service Officers
-   Prison Liaison Officers assisting job seekers recently released from
    prison
-   Services Australia staff assisting vulnerable job seekers who
    indicate ongoing circumstances impacting their capacity to comply

Job seeker contact following a missed requirement or participation suspension

If a job seeker contacts Services Australia about a
participation-related payment suspension, they may first need to contact
their provider to re-engage or speak to the Participation Solutions Team
(PST) about a failure investigation.

Service Officers must check which compliance system applies to the job
seeker, then

-   advise the job seeker to contact their provider, and/or
-   transfer the job seeker to the PST if an outstanding failure
    requires investigation

If a job seeker misses a requirement and fails to re-engage with their
provider within 29 days, their payment will be automatically cancelled.

Targeted Compliance Framework

All Service Officers have responsibility for generating an unemployment
failure where there is evidence a job seeker who is claiming a
participation payment was voluntarily unemployed or dismissed due to
misconduct. (This does not apply to ParentsNext participants).

PST-skilled Service Officers with a WNPPD security resource and Service
Officers with a UNPP security resource are delegated to investigate and
determine whether an unemployment failure has been committed.

Services Australia has responsibility for conducting Capability
Assessments. PST-skilled Service Officers conduct these assessments.
Consultation with a social worker or other Services Australia specialist
may be needed during the Capability Assessment. For further information,
see Social work role in the Participation Solutions Team (PST).

PST skilled Service Officers also determine reasonable excuse or
misconduct for:

-   work refusal failures
-   unemployment failures submitted by the provider
-   mutual obligation failures for job seekers in the TCF penalty zone

PST-skilled Service Officers determine the applicable penalty and
penalty start dates for unemployment, work refusal, and persistent
mutual obligation failures, and notify the job seeker.

Job Seeker Compliance Framework

Participation Solutions Team (PST) skilled Service Officers investigate
and determine if a failure has been committed, whether generated by
Services Australia, or via an electronic report submitted by a Community
Development Program (CDP) provider. This includes determining reasonable
excuse where applicable.

PST-skilled Service Officers also:

-   re-engage CDP job seekers to their provider where appropriate, and
    restore certain participation suspensions after the CDP job seeker
    has accepted a reconnection requirement
-   determine appropriate penalty and penalty start dates for
    Unemployment Non-Payment Periods (UNPP), and serious failures
-   make decisions on non-attendance, reconnection and No Show, No Pay
    failures
-   advise the job seeker of the outcome of decisions made by Services
    Australia, consequences of these decisions, and their review and
    appeal rights
-   explain and apply serious failure waiver provisions, and schedule a
    waiver re-engagement appointments with CDP providers when a CDP job
    seeker agrees to attend in lieu of serving a serious failure period
-   explain serious failure and UNPP hardship provisions
-   implement Payment Pending Review (PPR) provisions if a UNPP or
    serious failure is being quality checked by a Subject Matter Expert
    (SME), or reviewed by an Authorised Review Officer (ARO) or the
    Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT)

All Service Officers have responsibility for:

-   generating a UNPP for investigation where there is evidence a CDP
    job seeker who is claiming a participation payment was voluntarily
    unemployed, or dismissed due to misconduct
-   generating a serious failure for investigation when a CDP job seeker
    has refused or failed to commence suitable work

Services Australia has responsibility for preparing for and conducting
Comprehensive Compliance Assessments (CCA). PST-skilled Service Officers
(SO5) or social workers conduct these assessments.

The Resources page contains tables summarising the key messages about
the Targeted Compliance Framework and Job Seeker Compliance Framework
that staff deliver at various participation related contacts.
