|                                   | Five salary deductions in         |
|                                   | December are due from the         |
|                                   | employer in January. Only 4 of    |
|                                   | the expected deductions are       |
|                                   | received. In February an extra    |
|                                   | deduction is received. The DIDN   |
|                                   | code against December paydays     |
|                                   | (reconciled in January) reflects  |
|                                   | that not all of the expected      |
|                                   | deductions were received. In      |
|                                   | February an ADDI or AFPM code is  |
|                                   | used to reflect that 1 additional |
|                                   | deduction was received, as it was |
|                                   | not received in January.          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The ADV code is used when         |
|                                   | deductions are received for a     |
|                                   | future pay period.                |

|                                   | 1.  Start with the current        |

|                                   |     this month, subtract any      |

|                                   |     received from the employer    |

|                                   | The result will show whether      |
|                                   | there are any arrears or credits  |
|                                   | on the account.                   |

|                                   | Note: this account balance is     |
|                                   | dependent on the employer         |
|                                   | deducting and remitted the        |
|                                   | expected amounts. If deductions   |
|                                   | are not/have not been made or are |
|                                   | not the expected amount the       |
|                                   | account balance will vary.        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | When discussing the account       |
|                                   | balance with a payer attempt to   |
|                                   | confirm whether deductions have   |
|                                   | been made and the amount of these |
|                                   | deductions. Always advise the     |
|                                   | payer that the amount of          |
|                                   | arrears/credits may change if     |
|                                   | deductions are not made and       |
|                                   | received in line with             |
|                                   | expectations.                     |
