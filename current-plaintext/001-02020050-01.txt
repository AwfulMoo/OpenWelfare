This document explains details about eligibility and registration for No
Stream Services Referral Required (NSSRR) job seekers.

Definition of NSSRR

NSSRR customers need to be registered as job seekers in order to access
other help, but do not want to volunteer to participate in jobactive. As
a result, they are not referred to a provider and do not have access to
Employment Provider Services.

Job seekers in Community Development Program (CDP) are not eligible for
NSSRR, however they may be eligible for No Remote Referral Required
(NRRR).

Eligibility is determined by the Department of Education, Skills and
Employment system.

Eligibility for registration as NSSRR/NRRR job seeker

Customers eligible to be registered as NSSRR/NRRR include:

customers who need a Department of Education, Skills and Employment
record in order to be referred for an Employment Services Assessment
(ESAt) such as customers claiming or receiving Disability Support
Pension (DSP)

full-time students applying for a supplementary allowance determination

full-time students receiving Youth Allowance (YA) or Austudy who are
transferring to a job seeker payment, such as JobSeeker Payment (JSP),
and contact prior to ceasing studies but within 4 weeks of their Student
End Date (SED)

principal carers with long term exemptions from their mutual obligation
requirements (greater than 16 weeks) who do not choose to volunteer with
employment services

certain customers receiving JSP, YA (job seekers), Parenting Payment
(PP) (with mutual obligation requirements) who are meeting their
requirements and do not wish to volunteer for employment services, but
require a Job Plan as part of their eligibility for income support
payment. This includes:

-   principal carers already meeting their mutual obligation
    requirements
-   people with a Partial Capacity to Work of 15 hours or more per week
    who are fully meeting their participation requirements
-   people with a Partial Capacity to Work of 0-14 hours per week who
    are considered volunteers in employment services
-   customers in receipt of an income support payments that have no
    mutual obligation requirements and who do not choose to volunteer
    with employment services are assessed as eligible for child Care
    Subsidy (CCS). If they want to apply for Additional Child Care
    Subsidy (ACCS) (Transition to Work) they will need to be registered
    as NSSRR/NRRR job seekers in order for a voluntary Job Plan to be
    negotiated prior to applying for ACCS (Transition to Work)
-   New Enterprise Incentive Scheme (NEIS) participants presenting to
    Services Australia after the 39 weeks of participation in the Scheme
    to claim income support

Management of registration as NSSRR

Customers are registered for NSSRR/NRRR using either the Participation
Interview standalone Looking for Work (LFW) workflow, and selecting
appropriate responses. However, if a job seeker has already connected to
a provider, they cannot also be registered as NSSRR/NRRR.

An NSSRR/NRRR registration lasts as long as it is appropriate, depending
on the job seeker's circumstances. If job seekers do not meet the
criteria for NSSRR/NRRR registration at any time, such as a principal
carer no longer meeting their mutual obligation requirements, the
NSSRR/NRRR flag must be removed. The customer's registration is changed
to Fully Eligible Participant (FEP)/Remote Fully Eligible (RFE) and they
are referred to a provider, if suitable. NSSRR applies only to the
current period of registration and the flag must be removed before
re-registration, even if it continues to be NSSRR.

Where a NSSRR job seeker chooses to be assessed to determine eligibility
for additional services and allowances, a Job Seeker Classification
Instrument (JSCI) is to be completed so the job seeker can be referred
to a suitable provider. A JSCI is not necessary for NRRR job seekers
except where an Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) is required.
