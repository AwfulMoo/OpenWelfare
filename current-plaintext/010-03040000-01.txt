diagnostic testing and/or receive support for a learning disability, or
when access from the principal family home to the school is cut off due
to special weather conditions.

Short-term Boarding Allowance is not generally available for students in
a special institution catering for students with disabilities or
health-related conditions where they are residing there for period(s) of
less than twenty continuous school days.

Period of AIC allowances

AIC allowances are normally available for the full calendar year, from 1
January to 31 December in the year of study. Pro-rata entitlement
applies if a student is not eligible for the full year, for example, for
short-term boarding or where eligibility commences during the year.
