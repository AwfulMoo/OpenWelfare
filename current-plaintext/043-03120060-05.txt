|                                   | details of a partner's equity in  |

|                                   | Capital Account and a Current     |
|                                   | Account for each member of the    |
|                                   | partnership.                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The Capital Account is used to    |
|                                   | record amounts of capital         |
|                                   | contributed by each partner. This |
|                                   | includes any original capital     |
|                                   | contributed subsequent additions  |
|                                   | and repayments or drawings.       |

|                                   | The Current Account is used to    |
|                                   | reflect changes in the partner's  |
|                                   | equity as a result of profits,    |
|                                   | losses, salaries, wages, and      |
|                                   | drawings.                         |

|                                   | Where the balance sheet contains  |
|                                   | a separate Capital Account and    |
|                                   | Current Account for each member   |
|                                   | of the partnership, the equity of |
|                                   | each partner in the business is   |
|                                   | the total of both the Capital     |
|                                   | Account and Current Account in    |
|                                   | the partner's name.               |

|                                   | However, it is common current     |
|                                   | accounting practice to amalgamate |
|                                   | each partner's Capital and        |
|                                   | Current Accounts and present a    |
|                                   | combined statement of the details |
|                                   | of these accounts for each        |
|                                   | partner. A partner's equity in a  |
|                                   | business is the closing balance   |
|                                   | of the combined Capital and       |
|                                   | Current Account in the partner's  |
|                                   | name.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Note: this equity is based upon   |
|                                   | the value of assets as detailed   |
|                                   | in the partnership financial      |
|                                   | statements (known as book value), |
|                                   | and is not necessarily the        |
|                                   | assessable asset current market   |
|                                   | value of the customer's interest  |
|                                   | in the business. The closing      |
|                                   | balance of a the combined Capital |
|                                   | and Current Accounts for a        |
|                                   | partner provides an indication of |
|                                   | the relative proportions of the   |
|                                   | total assets of the business in   |
|                                   | which each partner holds an       |
|                                   | interest. It is therefore the     |
|                                   | best starting point to calculate  |
|                                   | the current assessable asset      |
|                                   | value of a customer's interest in |
|                                   | a business.                       |

|                                   | Partnership property means        |
|                                   | partnership assets that is,       |
|                                   | assets 'owned' by the             |
|                                   | partnership. These may consist of |
|                                   | assets originally owned           |
|                                   | personally by a partner, which    |
|                                   | are brought into the partnership  |
|                                   | with intention that the asset     |
|                                   | contributed to the business is no |
|                                   | longer the personal property of   |
|                                   | the person, it becomes an asset   |
|                                   | of the business in which all      |
|                                   | partners have an interest. Where  |
|                                   | a partner contributes capital to  |
|                                   | a business in this way, an        |
|                                   | adjustment is usually made to     |
|                                   | their Capital Account to reflect  |
|                                   | this contribution and their       |
|                                   | increased interest in the         |
|                                   | business. Partnership property    |
|                                   | may also consist of assets        |
|                                   | purchased with funds provided     |
|                                   | from the business or from profits |
|                                   | earned by the business.           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The fact that an asset is         |
|                                   | utilised by a partnership does    |
|                                   | not mean that the asset is a      |
|                                   | partnership asset. Commonly, a    |
|                                   | partner may agree to allow a      |
|                                   | business to utilise an asset      |
|                                   | owned personally to produce       |
|                                   | income. Although an asset may be  |
|                                   | used by the partnership, if the   |
|                                   | asset is not contributed to the   |
|                                   | partnership it does not become a  |
|                                   | partnership asset, it remains the |
|                                   | personal asset of the customer    |
|                                   | (e.g. a home office).             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The primary reference sources for |
|                                   | ascertaining which assets are     |
|                                   | partnership assets and for        |
|                                   | determining a partner's interest  |
|                                   | in assets of a business is the    |
|                                   | partnership agreement and the     |
|                                   | business financial statements.    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The presence of a written         |
|                                   | partnership agreement may be      |
|                                   | taken as prima facie evidence of  |
|                                   | the terms of a partnership. The   |
|                                   | terms of a written partnership    |
|                                   | agreement will specify the        |
|                                   | interest of each partner in       |
|                                   | assets of the business detailed   |

|                                   | calculate the assessable value of |

|                                   | business i.e. if the partnership  |
|                                   | agreement specifies a             |
|                                   | proportional ownership this       |
|                                   | proportion should be applied to   |
|                                   | the relevant assets.              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This applies irrespective of the  |
|                                   | legal title in which the assets   |
|                                   | are held. Although the transfer   |

|                                   | partners jointly would be prima   |
|                                   | facie evidence that the asset is  |
|                                   | a partnership asset, the converse |
|                                   | does not lead to the conclusion   |
|                                   | that the property is not a        |
|                                   | partnership asset. Where an asset |
|                                   | is included in the balance sheet  |
|                                   | of a partnership, there is a      |
|                                   | presumption that the asset is a   |
|                                   | partnership asset and that the    |
|                                   | legal owner holds the asset in    |
|                                   | trust for the partners, according |

|                                   | of $60,000 would be shared        |

|                                   | land valued at $100,000. The land |
|                                   | is included in the partnership    |
