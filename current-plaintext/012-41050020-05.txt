Telehealth services and claiming channels

Telehealth services can be lodged via existing electronic and manual
claiming channels.

Easyclaim cannot be used to lodge specialist a Telehealth bulk bill
claim as the system cannot assess the derived fee item number. These
claims must be lodged using another method (such as, manual or online).
