This document outlines information on how income is assessed for a
customer who receives income from a business, when they advise of a
seasonal downturn, but not complete cessation of business activity.

Differing levels of activity

Where a business undertakes different levels of activity throughout a
period as part of its normal operations, the previous profit result will
reflect the pattern of activity. Accordingly, unless there has been a
change in circumstances of the business operations, the net profit
earned from the previous 12 months provides an accurate indication of
the likely rate of income earned by the customer from the business.

This applies to any business structure the customer may be involved in.
Any reassessment requested by the customer requires them to provide full
financial details including profit and loss statement, balance sheet and
evidence of the circumstances that require a review. The customer's
circumstances will then be reviewed based on this assessment.
