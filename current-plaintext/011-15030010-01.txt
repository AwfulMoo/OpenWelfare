This document outlines information about a:

-   Notice of past benefits (NOPB) that becomes a Notice of charge (NOC)
    if it is still current when the claim reaches judgment or settlement
-   NOC that is issued after the claim has reached judgment or
    settlement
-   Notice of past benefits – advance payment (NOPB-AP) that is issued
    to the claimant after the claim has reached judgment or settlement
    and an advance payment has been accepted

Read references to ‘notice of charge’ as NOC and NOPB-AP unless stated
otherwise.

Notice of past benefits and notice of charge

A notice of past benefits or notice of charge provides the total
recoverable amount for a compensation claim.

A notice of past benefits expires after 6 months. It is not payable
unless it is still valid on the date the compensation amount is fixed or
the claimant submits a Section 23A statement.

A notice of charge never expires and is payable within 28 days.

After Services Australia has received a statement by claimant (or if the
time to return the statement has passed) MCRS sends:

the compensation payer:

-   the Notice of past benefits or charge (Z2807) before judgment or
    settlement, or
-   the Notice of charge (Z2811) after judgment or settlement, or
-   nothing if Services Australia has accepted an advance payment, and

the injured person or claimant:

-   a copy of the notice that was sent to the compensation payer – if
    there is a valid Third party authority form (MO021) attached to the
    claim, the copy is sent to the authorised third party instead, or
-   the Notice past benefits – advance payment (Z2811) if the agency has
    accepted an advance payment – if there is a valid Third party
    authority form (MO021) attached to the claim, this is sent to the
    authorised third party instead

Note: if the agency accepts an advance payment, the compensation payer
no longer has authority to access information about the claim.

See Payments, refunds and debts.

Copy of verified services attached or all services included

A list of the Medicare benefits and care costs verified by the claimant
is attached if a statement by claimant was returned by the due date and
is substantially correct. See Extensions, not substantially correct,
decisions and reviews.

No list of Medicare benefits is attached and all services listed on the
Medicare history statement will be included in the total recoverable
amount if a statement by claimant was:

-   not returned
-   returned incomplete, or
-   returned after the due date (including if an extension of time to
    submit the statement was granted)

Note: all care costs identified in a previous notice of past benefits
will be carried forward.

No statement by claimant returned – all services included

Send a notice of past benefits – all services included where the
statement by claimant:

-   is not returned and no Section 23A notice has been received
-   by the due date
-   by the latest date where an extension was granted
-   following a request to provide more information - where a Z2805 –
    Statement not substantially correct letter was sent

All services listed on the Notice to Claimant will be taken as related
to the claim. All nursing home benefits, residential care subsidies and
home care subsidies identified in a previous notice of past benefits
will be carried forward.

Timeframes for issue of notice of charge and notice of past benefits – advance payment

The Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995 (HOSC Act)
prescribes timeframes for the agency to issue a:

-   notice of charge, and
-   notice of past benefits – advance payment

An extension of time to submit a statement and the notice of statement
not substantially correct process may extend timeframes in some
circumstances.

See

-   References page, sections 24(4), 25(4) and 33D of the HOSC Act for
    more information
-   Resources page for relevant issuing timeframes and how to calculate
    them
-   Extensions, not substantially correct, decisions and reviews

Errors in notice of past benefits or notice of charge

Administrative errors

If an administrative error is found:

-   immediately call both the compensation payer and injured
    person/claimant/authorised third party, and
-   advise them a new notice will be sent as soon as possible

This will ensure correct information is used when negotiating the
settlement or judgment amount and minimise rework and extra enquiries
later on.

Amended NOPB or NOC requested

A request may be submitted to remove services included on a NOPB or NOC.

To amend a closed claim the Service Officer must reopen the claim and
reprocess the NOJS or NORA. When the NOJS or NORA has been recaptured
the Reprocess a statement button can be selected on the Review screen.
This will allow reprocessing of the services on the SBC and care costs
that were used to generate the NOC/NOPB-AP.

To amend a NOPB on an open claim Service Officers can select the
Statement by claimant as the document type and the Reprocess a statement
button can be selected.

See Extension, decisions and review for more information on amending a
notice.

No valid notice of past benefits at judgment or settlement

Where no valid notice of past benefits or completed section 23A
statement has been received at the time of judgment or settlement, a
notice to claimant is sent to the injured person or claimant.

When accepting a section 23A statement, the amount from any expired
notice of past benefits relating to the claim, becomes the amount
payable in the notice of charge.

Calculation of s33D due date for notice of charge- with no extension to
return statement

Under section 33D of HOSC Act, if an advance payment has been made, the
date to issue a notice is 3 months from receiving the later of either:

-   A complete and valid notice of judgment or settlement from the
    compensation payer, or
-   The advance payment

Under section 33D of HOSC Act, there are no amounts recoverable by the
agency where:

-   more than 3 months has passed since a complete notice of judgment or
    settlement or advance payment was received
-   no extension was granted, and
-   a notice of charge has not been issued

If the Section 33D date has passed, do not issue a Notice to claimant to
the claimant/injured person, or notice of charge to the compensation
payer.

Calculation of s33D due date for NOPB-AP after an extension

If an extension was granted to return a statement by claimant, the new
33D date is 28 days after the new statement return date if:

-   the new statement return date is after the original section 33D(1)
    date (3 months after the date of receipt of notice of judgment or
    settlement or advance payment, whichever is later)

For example, if the section 33D (1) date was 2 April 2020, but the
extension to return the statement was granted until 10 April 2020, a
NOPB-AP must be issued by 8 May 2020. That is, 28 days after the new
statement return date.

Calculation of s24 (4) due date for notice of charge

Under section 24(4) of HOSC Act, where there has been no advance payment
made:

-   the agency has a maximum of 3 months to issue a notice of charge to
    the compensation payer from the date a completed notice of judgment
    or settlement was received

If the s24(4) date has passed and a notice of charge has not been
issued:

-   there are no amounts recoverable by the agency

When a NOPB-AP or NOC is issued

After a section 23A statement is received

A section 23A statement may be submitted by the injured person if they
have not received:

-   any relevant Medicare benefits since the date on their expired
    notice of past benefits, or
-   a notice of past benefits

The amount payable on the NOPB-AP or NOC will either be:

-   the amount on the expired notice of past benefits, or
-   nil

After an advance payment is received

The recoverable amount is reduced by the advance payment, and a NOPB-AP
will be issued to the injured person or claimant, and:

-   if there is money still outstanding, the amount is payable to the
    agency by the injured person within 28 days after receiving the
    notice, or
-   if there is a refund owed, that amount is paid by the agency to the
    injured person (unless an authority is received to pay a Public
    Trustee)

After an ad-hoc payment amount is received

The recoverable amount is reduced by the ad-hoc payment amount, a notice
of charge will be issued to the compensation payer, and:

-   If there is money still outstanding, the amount is payable by the
    compensation payer
-   If there is a refund owed, the amount is paid by the agency as per
    question 38 of the MO022 form

Notice of reimbursement arrangement, no previous payments received

Where a compensation payer has notified the agency of a reimbursement
arrangement, if a Notice to claimant is:

returned by the due date:

-   a notice of charge with an itemised list of services identified by
    the injured person or claimant will be issued to the compensation
    payer

not returned, or is returned after the due date

-   a notice of charge - all services included will be issued to the
    compensation payer. This will not have an itemised list attached

When the amount can be reduced on a NOC or NOPB-AP

Percentage of apportionment

Where the injured person contributed to their injury or illness
(contributory negligence), a percentage of liability is set at judgment
or settlement. This is known as an apportionment and it reduces the
judgment or settlement amount.

The NOC or NOPB-AP is reduced by the percentage of apportionment
attributed to the injured person. For example, if the injured person was
apportioned 20% liability, the NOC or NOPB-AP amount would be reduced by
20%.

Judgment fixes the amount to be paid and is less than the NOC or NOPB-AP

Where the past Medicare expenses are fixed by court at the time of
judgment this fixed amount becomes the amount payable to the agency.
Where the past medical expenses are fixed by the court at the time of
judgment the amount payable to the agency will be determined by the
notice to claimant. The agency cannot recover more than the total fixed
compensation amount.
