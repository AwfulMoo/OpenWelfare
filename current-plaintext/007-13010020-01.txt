This document outlines the review that is automatically created by the
system when a Family Tax Benefit (FTB) customer becomes linked to a
person who has not provided their Tax File Number (TFN).

TFN details

Both the customer and their partner must have their TFN recorded, or the
partner must have been granted a TFN exemption in order for payment of
FTB to continue. If the customer and partner do not have a TFN or
exemption reason recorded, their payment entitlement will be reassessed.
The reassessment will result in FTB being cancelled.

At the same time the review is created a letter is automatically sent to
the customer advising that no tax file number has been recorded for
their partner.
