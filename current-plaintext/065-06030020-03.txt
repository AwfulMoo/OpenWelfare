|                                   | From 1 July 2009, the concept of  |
|                                   | total net investment losses was   |
|                                   | included in the ATI for CSHC.     |
|                                   | Total net investment losses are   |
|                                   | the sum of net financial          |
|                                   | investment losses and net rental  |
|                                   | property losses. Net financial    |
|                                   | investment losses were not        |
|                                   | previously included in the ATI    |

|                                   | investment losses to reduce their |
|                                   | taxable income. For CSHC          |
|                                   | purposes, these are added back to |
|                                   | their taxable income. By          |
|                                   | including net investment losses   |
|                                   | in the ATI for CSHC, it means     |
|                                   | that such losses cannot be offset |
|                                   | against other taxable income.     |

|                                   | For example, a person has two     |

|                                   | profit of $3,000 and the other a  |
|                                   | loss of $4,000. The assessable    |
|                                   | net investment loss would be      |
|                                   | $1,000.                           |
