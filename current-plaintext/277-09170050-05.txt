|                                   | care change occurs and Kevin now  |
|                                   | has 100% care of Justin. Services |

|                                   | As Jodie's care reduces below 35% |
|                                   | care from 1 August 2018 (date of  |
|                                   | event) and Kevin's increase       |

|                                   | terminating event occurs on 1     |
|                                   | August 2018. Neither parent has a |
|                                   | care percentage of 35% or more.   |
|                                   | When Services Australia was       |
|                                   | advised of the change in care on  |
|                                   | 8 March 2019, a new application   |
|                                   | for child support is required if  |
|                                   | either parent wants to restart    |
|                                   | the case.                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Jodie lodges an objection on 1    |
|                                   | May 2019. The original care       |
|                                   | decision is reviewed and an       |
|                                   | objection decision is made. The   |
|                                   | decision is that from 1 August    |
|                                   | 2018 Jodie has 100% care of       |
|                                   | Justin. The new care              |
|                                   | determination applies from 1 May  |
|                                   | 2019, the date the objection was  |
|                                   | received. As the assessment was   |
|                                   | terminated, Jodie will need to    |
|                                   | make a new application for child  |
|                                   | support.                          |
