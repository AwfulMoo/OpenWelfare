This document outlines information on how a customer can be eligible for
Parental Leave Pay (PPL) under the Paid Parental Leave scheme.

General eligibility

A primary claimant may receive up to 18 weeks (90 payable days) of PPL.

For children that are born or adopted:

before 1 July 2020, PPL is made up a PPL period of up to 18 weeks (90
payable days)

on or after 1 July 2020, PPL is made up of:

-   a PPL period of up to 12 weeks (60 payable days), plus
-   30 Flexible PPL days

PPL can be transferred to an eligible secondary/tertiary claimant, for
example their partner. Claimants need to meet the following:

-   be the primary carer of a PPL child
-   meet a work test (exemptions may apply for secondary/tertiary
    claimants)
-   meet an income test
-   meet Australian residence requirements
-   not have returned to work since becoming the primary carer
    (exceptions apply)
-   make an effective claim

Customers need to consider if PPL is the most beneficial payment to
claim for their newborn or adopted child.
