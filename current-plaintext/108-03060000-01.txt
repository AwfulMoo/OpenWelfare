This document outlines information about the Defence Force Income
Support Allowance (DFISA) and how it supplemented income support
payments affected by Adjusted Disability Pension from DVA.

Defence Force Income Support Allowance (DFISA)

DFISA was an income support payment paid by the Department of Veterans'
Affairs (DVA) to customers whose social security pension or benefit was
reduced (including to nil) because of the inclusion of Adjusted
Disability Pension from DVA as assessable income.

From 1 January 2022, Adjusted Disability Pensions became exempt income
under the Social Security Act 1991 for income support payments,
therefore DFISA was no longer required.

Where a customer's Adjusted Disability Pension from DVA affected their
partner's rate of social security pension or benefit, the partner may
have also been entitled to receive DFISA payments.

DFISA was also paid where there was a reduction in rate because of the
inclusion of Adjusted Disability Pension from DVA in the assessment of
Lump Sum Bereavement Payment, Pension Bonus Scheme and Home Equity
Access Scheme.

There was no claim form or claim process for DFISA. Eligibility is
automatically assessed by the Services Australia system for all
customers who are paid Adjusted Disability Pension from DVA.

Calculation of DFISA is still required for customers who are
retrospectively granted an Adjusted Disability Pension before 1 January
2022.

DFISA-like payments

Payments made under other Commonwealth Acts and regulations (for
example, ABSTUDY) are not covered by the DFISA legislation, so
regulations were introduced that enable DFISA-like payments. These are
identical to DFISA, with the only difference being the name of the
payment.

Calculation of DFISA for periods before 1 January 2022

A person's rate of DFISA is equal to the difference between the actual
rate of social security pension or benefit the person receives, and
their notional rate, which is the rate they would receive if Adjusted
Disability Pension from DVA:

-   was excluded from income in the assessment of the person's actual
    rate, but
-   included in the calculation of rent assistance (for example, the DVA
    rent test is applied)

DFISA = notional rate minus actual rate

The notional rate is the same rate a person would receive if their
income support payments were assessed under the Veterans' Entitlements
Act (VEA) 1986.

The amount of DFISA will be calculated at each rate reassessment for
periods before 1 January 2022, and transmission of new DFISA information
will be sent to DVA at the end of every business day. DVA will generally
pay DFISA fortnightly on the DVA payday.

If the customer was being paid their social security pension or benefit
under the Assets Test, they will not attract DFISA payments as the
Adjusted Disability Pension from DVA did not reduce their payment rate.
If their assessment method subsequently changes from the Assets Test to
the Income Test, the system will automatically calculate whether the
customer is entitled to DFISA for past periods.

DVA Adjusted Disability Pensions

Adjusted Disability Pensions from DVA include the following:

-   Disability Compensation Payments paid under Parts II and IV of the
    Veterans' Entitlements Act (VEA) 1986
-   Permanent Impairment payment and Special Rate Disability Pension
    paid under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act (MRCA)
    2004
-   Temporary Incapacity Allowance (only payable for periods of
    incapacity prior to 20 September 2011)
-   Dependant's Allowance (only payable for periods prior to 20
    September 2009)

Payments affected by DFISA legislation

Payments affected by the DFISA legislation included:

-   ABSTUDY (affected by DFISA-like payments regulations)
-   Age Pension
-   Austudy
-   Bereavement Allowance
-   Carer Payment
-   Child Care Subsidy
-   Disability Support Pension
-   Family Tax Benefit (depending on the taxable status of DFISA)
-   JobSeeker Payment (JSP)
-   Parenting Payment Single
-   Parenting Payment Partnered
-   Partner Allowance
-   Special Benefit
-   Widow Allowance
-   Youth Allowance

The following payments did not attract DFISA:

-   Farm Household Allowance (FHA) payments are not affected by the
    DFISA legislation, as Adjusted Disability Pension from DVA was not
    included as income for Farm Household Allowance purposes
-   Customers paid under the Financial Hardship Guidelines (section 1130
    of the Social Security Act 1991) did not attract DFISA
-   Customers paid a pension under the criteria for blindness that is
    income and assets test free were not eligible for DFISA, however
    their Adjusted Disability Pension from DVA could still affect their
    partner's entitlement. If the blind customer elected to receive Rent
    Assistance, their income support payment is income tested and DFISA
    may be payable

Taxability of DFISA

Where a customer received a taxable income support payment, for example,
Age Pension, the DFISA payment is taxable. If a customer received a
non-taxable income support payment, for example, Disability Support
Pension (under the Age Pension age), the DFISA payment is non-taxable.

DFISA and the income test

Although DFISA ceased for periods from 1 January 2022, retrospective
reassessments may create payments of DFISA after that date. All DFISA
payments are exempt from the Income Test for all income support
payments. However, DFISA is:

-   always included in the ordinary Income Test for Low Income Health
    Care Card (LIC)
-   included in the assessment for Commonwealth Seniors Health Care Card
    (CSHC) only where it is taxable income
-   assessed for Family Tax Benefit and CCS purposes only where it is
    taxable income

Current zero rate (CZR - DFISA)

When a customer's income precludes entitlement, their pension or benefit
is usually rejected or cancelled. Before 1 January 2022, customers who
are paid an Adjusted Disability Pension from DVA will have a DFISA
calculation done before this occurs. If DFISA is greater than zero,
their pension or benefit status is held as Current Zero Rate (CZR -
DFISA). These customers were regarded as receiving the pension or
benefit for which they qualify and entitled to the associated benefits
and concessions relevant to their payment.

CZR DFISA customers must have continued to qualify for their pension or
benefit, and meet the obligations associated with their particular
payment.

Under family assistance law, CZR DFISA customers are taken to be
receiving the social security pension or benefit which is supplemented
by their DFISA payment. They will therefore be exempt from the FTB Part
A income test.

Customers will cease to be CZR-DFISA from 1 January 2022 as Adjusted
Disability Pension from DVA will no longer be assessed under the income
test for income support payments.

amount, and contact details for the Centrelink DVA Clearance Team.
