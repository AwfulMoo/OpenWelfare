This document outlines Services Australia’s assessment of the principal
home, when the customer is moving to a care situation.

Leaving the principal home

Customers, who are homeowners and leave their principal home due to
illness to enter a care situation, may have their home exempted from the
income support payment income and assets test. In general, when a
customer leaves their principal home and enters a care situation the
home is exempt from the assets test for 2 years from the date the
customer entered care. Once the 2 year period has expired, the customer
will be assessed as a non-homeowner and the home will be assessed as an
asset.

For non-homeowners leaving their principal home, see Temporary
accommodation and Rent Assistance (RA).

Type of care situation

Supported Residential Service: if the customer has entered a care
situation in a Supported Residential Service (SRS), the former home is
exempt from the assets test for 2 years from the date the customer
entered care and Rent Assistance (RA) may be payable. If the customer
has paid a lump sum as a condition of entry and the SRS is assessed as a
special residence the customer’s homeownership status and payability of
RA will be determined by assessment of the entry contribution.

Retirement Village: if the customer is a retirement village resident,
and enters a unit or aged care section of the village, for which ongoing
government funding is being provided, and they are an aged care
resident, then the person is 'in residential care'. The former home is
exempt from the assets test for 2 years from the date the customer
entered care. The customer’s homeownership status and payability of RA
will be determined by the assessment of the Entry Contribution (EC).

Care to another: if the customer is a carer who has vacated their
principal home to provide a substantial level of care to a person in a
private home for at least 14 consecutive days, the 2 year exemption also
applies to them. If the care receiver passes away, the carer can also
have a temporary absence applied for up to 12 months from the date the
care receiver passes away, before the former principal home of the carer
is assessed as an asset.

Renting out former principal home

Customers who entered age care prior to 1 January 2017

For income support payments, the value of their former principal home
and any rental income received is exempt while they pay their
accommodation charge or lump sum accommodation payment periodically.

Customers who entered aged care from 1 January 2017

The net rental income from their former principal home is assessed as
ordinary income, which may affect the customer’s rate of income support
payments.

For the purpose of Aged Care Means Test assessments, if the customer is
receiving rental income from their former principal home, see Aged Care
means assessment - Rental income from principal home.

Partnered customers

If the customer entering care is partnered and the partner remains in
the former principal home, then the home continues to be an exempt asset
whilst the partner lives there. The 2 year exemptions only commence when
the remaining partner later vacates the home.

Concurrent exemptions

The principal home’s 2 year exemption from the assets test due to the
customer entering a care situation runs concurrently with other
exemptions (for example, a customer may have temporarily vacated their
principal home with the intention of travelling for 12 months however,
only six months into this exemption they become ill and cease travelling
to move into care). The 2 year exemption starts from when the customer
commences to receive care.

The 2 year exemption due to the customer entering a care situation can
run concurrently with the exemption due to the customer either:

-   accruing a liability to pay an accommodation charge, or
-   paying a lump sum accommodation payment (for example accommodation
    bond or refundable Accommodation Deposit) by periodic instalments,
    or
-   by a combination of a part lump sum and periodic instalments and (in
    both cases) they are receiving rental income from the former
    principal home

Therefore if the customer stops paying accommodation bond instalments or
stops receiving rental income for their former principal home they will
receive the benefit of the remainder of any 2 year exemption due to
entering a care situation. Note: the lump sum accommodation
payment/charge exemption as outlined above can, in some situations,
start to apply from a date after the 2 year exemption of the customer’s
former principal home has ended. The property being rented out must be
the same former principal home that the customer vacated to enter a care
situation. Examples of where this could occur include:

-   A customer who has been in residential aged care for more than 2
    years and who has been paying either an accommodation charge or
    accommodation bond by periodic payments from the date they were
    admitted to care, starts to rent out their former principal home
    that they vacated to enter residential aged care after the 2 year
    exemption of their former principal home has ended
-   A customer’s 2 year exemption of their former principal home after
    vacating it to receive care in a private home (for example. in a
    family member’s home) has already ended before they leave that
    private home where they were receiving care to enter residential
    aged care and they then start to pay either an accommodation charge
    or accommodation bond by periodic payments and at the same time rent
    out their former principal home

In both of the examples outlined above the exemption can start to apply
from the date that all the relevant qualifications are being met at the
same time. For example, from the date that the customer is paying either
an accommodation charge or accommodation bond by periodic payments and
at the same time they are renting out their former principal home that
they had vacated to enter a care situation.

Time limits for exemptions

For customers paying an accommodation charge who first entered
residential aged care:

-   before 1 July 2004, the maximum length of time that the former
    principal home can be exempted from the asset test is 5 years,
    because for these residents an accommodation charge cannot be levied
    for more than 5 years
-   between 1 July 2004 and prior to 1 January 2017, the former
    principal home can be exempt from the income and asset test for an
    indefinite period of time, whilst the mandatory conditions (above)
    are being met, because there is no limit on how long an
    accommodation charge can be levied
-   on or after 1 January 2017, the former principal home will be exempt
    from the assets test for 2 years after the customer vacates it to
    enter a care situation

Accommodation bond exemptions can be for an indefinite period.

Home Vacation review activities have been consolidated across sites
nationally.
