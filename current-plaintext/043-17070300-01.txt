This document contains information relating to registering a new
claimant for the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme (TFES).

Register an eligible claimant

Claimants need to be registered with Services Australia and deemed
eligible to claim TFES assistance.

Registration of a claimant refers to the process of:

-   creating a claimant record
-   obtaining relevant information about the business
-   confirming their identity, and
-   undertaking eligibility checks

Eligibility requirements differ according to the component of the Scheme
applicable to the claimant.

Part 2 of the Ministerial Directions outlines eligibility rules.

Initial contact with a prospective TFES claimant may occur by:

-   telephone call received, querying eligibility and how to apply for
    TFES
-   email received via TFES.SUPPORT mailbox, requesting eligibility
    information
-   prospective claimant accesses the Services Australia website
-   receipt of completed Registration and change of details form
    (TAS020), submitted by prospective TFES claimant
