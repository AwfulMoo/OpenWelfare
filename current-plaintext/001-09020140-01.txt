interacting with a job seeker who has mutual obligation requirements.

Action Items

If the customer has any outstanding issues related to mutual obligation
requirements, they will be displayed under the Action Items section.
These items will also be listed in priority order and should be actioned
from the highest priority. The items can be actioned by selecting the
link located alongside each Action Item, which will take the Service
Officer to the relevant workflow or screen to complete the issue
requiring attention.

Note: Action Items listed on the Participation Summary screen do not
replace the use of the Issue page in the workflow.
