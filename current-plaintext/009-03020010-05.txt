| 1                                 | Commercial Care - Example 1       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A carer provides daily care and   |
|                                   | attention to a care receiver as a |
|                                   | result of their illnesses and/or  |
|                                   | disabilities. Two mornings each   |
|                                   | week, a professional nurse also   |
|                                   | provides specialised care to the  |
|                                   | care receiver. This care would    |
|                                   | not affect the claimant's         |
|                                   | eligibility for CA as the         |
|                                   | claimant is meeting the daily     |
|                                   | care and attention qualification. |

|                                   | If a carer is providing care 4    |
|                                   | days a week and a professional    |
|                                   | nurse provides care on the        |
|                                   | remaining 3 days per week, the    |
|                                   | carer would not qualify for CA as |
|                                   | the carer is not providing        |
|                                   | additional daily care and         |
|                                   | attention.                        |

Dependent child for CA

Table 2: this table describes examples relating to a dependent child for
CA.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

| 1                                 | Dependent child for CA - Example  |
|                                   | 1                                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Billy and Wendy reside together   |
|                                   | but they are not a couple,        |
|                                   | Wendy's disabled child, Victoria, |
|                                   | who is 14 years of age lives with |
|                                   | them. Billy (family friend)       |
|                                   | claims CA caring for Victoria. It |
|                                   | is determined that Billy is not   |
|                                   | qualified for CA because Victoria |
|                                   | is not Billy's dependent child.   |
|                                   | Billy may receive CA auto if he   |
|                                   | qualifies for Carer Payment (CP)  |
|                                   | in respect of Victoria. If Wendy  |
|                                   | claims CA caring for Victoria,    |
|                                   | Wendy qualifies as long as all    |
|                                   | other qualifications are met.     |

|                                   | Rebecca and Joe, a married        |
|                                   | couple, both provide care for     |
|                                   | their child Julie, who is 8 years |
|                                   | of age. Rebecca and Joe share the |
|                                   | care of their child, with Rebecca |
|                                   | providing care for a greater      |
|                                   | period of the week than Joe. It   |
|                                   | is determined that together they  |
|                                   | provide care on a daily basis but |
|                                   | because they are a couple the     |
|                                   | payment is made to 1 member of    |
|                                   | the couple only. Rebecca is       |
|                                   | granted 100% of CA.               |

|                                   | Ben and ex-partner Belinda have a |
|                                   | court order, which details the    |

|                                   | be deemed to be joint as the      |

|                                   | if the care receiver receives     |
