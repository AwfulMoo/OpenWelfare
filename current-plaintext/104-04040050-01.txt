Risks to a customer's privacy have been identified. See Separating
Safely - protecting personal details to make sure the customer's
personal details are safe before progressing.

This document outlines the processes to follow to ensure a customer's
privacy is maintained when making an outbound call or actioning a
callback.

Leaving messages

If the customer is registered for Electronic Messaging via Mobile Phone,
you may send a text message prior to your call advising you will attempt
to contact them shortly.

If the customer is not available or cannot be identified the Service
Officer should advise they will call again later.

If the customer refuses to identify themselves for any reason or if
there is evidence on the customer’s record which indicates security or
privacy concerns, the Service Officer can send a pre-call notification.
If the customer continues to refuse to identify themselves the Service
Officer should provide the correct number for the customer to call back
on the next business day.

It is not appropriate for a Service Officer to disclose the issue they
are calling about or identify the team they work with until the
customer's identity is confirmed.

If there is an answering machine or voicemail, the Service Officer
should leave a short message identifying they are from Services
Australia and ask the customer to call back.

Staff may leave a voice message regardless of whether the customer’s
name is used in the answering recorded message.
