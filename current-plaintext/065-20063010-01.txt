This document outlines aged care ad hoc reviews.

Historical SPARC process

The System for the Payment of Aged Residential Care (SPARC) is the
legacy aged care payment system for residential care. SPARC is a view
only system from 20 August 2022.

To view the legacy SPARC process, see the historical version.

Ad hoc reviews

An ad hoc review:

is completed outside of the quarterly review (QR) process

recalculates the fees a care recipient should pay

takes into account changes in the care recipient’s care needs and/or
changes in financial circumstances

is manually started by a Service Officer for:

-   home care in the Aged Care Management Payment System (ACMPS)
-   residential care in the Aged Care Staff Portal (ACSP)

is automatically started by ACSP for residential care if a significant
change in circumstances results in a fee change. For example, fee
changes as a result of financial hardship assistance, or means are
declared for a care recipient who is Means Not Disclosed (MND)

Manual ad hoc reviews should only be done when:

-   a care recipient requests an immediate review due to a change in
    circumstances which may result in a change to fees
-   an automatic review does not occur and the care recipient is
    significantly disadvantaged (for example, placed in financial
    hardship) if made to wait for a QR to determine a reduction in fees
-   it is required to be completed as part of actioning a quarterly
    review or manual adjustment work item

Ad hoc reviews in home care

An ad hoc review may be needed where:

a home care recipient has a period of leave (social, hospital,
residential respite or transitional care) greater than 28 days:

-   From leave day 29, the service provider subsidy is reduced and
    payable at 25% of the basic subsidy rate
-   Care recipients cannot be asked to pay more than the subsidy payment
    (cost of care)
-   Services should not charge care recipients for home care services
    while accessing transitional or residential respite care
-   See Temporary leave from Home Care Packages on the Resources page
    for more information

a care recipient’s status was means not disclosed (MND), their means are
now disclosed and the assessment backdated

higher fees were incorrectly charged due to data transfer issues between
Customer First and ACMPS

a correction to a means assessment changes an income tested fee (ITF),
income tested care fee (ITCF) or means tested care fee (MTCF)

When an ad hoc review is actioned:

-   a refund is generated
-   new fee rates apply from the date the ad hoc review is actioned
-   change fee letters are sent to the care recipient and the service
    provider

Ad hoc reviews in residential care

When an ad hoc review is actioned:

a refund may be generated

new fee rates apply from the date the ad hoc review is actioned

change fee letters are sent to the care recipient and the service
provider where the ongoing income tested care fee (ITCF)/means tested
care fee (MTCF) and/or the accommodation contribution (AC) has:

-   increased by 10 cents or more per day, or
-   decreased by 1 cent or more per day
