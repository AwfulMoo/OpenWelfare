This document outlines the Process Helps and other supporting documents
to assist Service Officers with Cuba processing in the Child Support
system.

Cuba Help

Cuba Help is designed to complement the Child Support Blueprint
documents and macros.

Actions required to complete a task are not always immediately obvious,
particularly when multiple windows and sub-tasks are required. The
Process Help guides Child Support Service Officers through a specific
task including the required actions and the windows used to complete the
task.
