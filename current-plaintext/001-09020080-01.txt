This document outlines how the mutual obligation requirements are
affected by a Liquid Assets Waiting Period (LAWP).

LAWP

A customer is not entitled to payment of JobSeeker Payment (JSP) or
Youth Allowance (YA) for a period of between 1 and 13 weeks after
calculating a LAWP if the total value of their liquid assets exceeds the
maximum reserve amount of $10,000 for a member of a couple or a single
person with a dependent child, and $5,000 for single recipients before
calculation of a LAWP will occur.

Mutual obligation requirements during LAWP

Customers serving a LAWP are not required to satisfy their mutual
obligation requirements during this period.

Job Seekers will be exempt from RapidConnect, but will still be required
to be registered and referred to an Employment Services Provider. The
provider will determine their mutual obligation requirements and
negotiate a Job Plan.

For the duration of a LAWP, Service Officers are not required to
negotiate a Job Plan as the job seeker does not have mutual obligation
requirements.

Service Profiling

The customer is also excluded from Service Profiling Service Updates for
the entire period where the LAWP results in nil payment.

The Resources page contains examples of applying mutual obligation
requirements and Liquid Assets Waiting Period (LAWP).
