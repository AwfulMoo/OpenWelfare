|                                   | -   whether the original decision |

|                                   |     and the circumstances at the  |

|                                   | A decision to waive a debt will   |
|                                   | not be incorrect solely because   |
|                                   | the customerâ€™s circumstances      |
|                                   | changed after that decision. For  |
|                                   | example, where a debt was         |
|                                   | previously waived because it was  |
|                                   | below $200, the customer was      |
|                                   | non-current and it was not cost   |
|                                   | effective to recover, do not      |
|                                   | reverse the waiver solely because |
|                                   | the customer has subsequently     |
|                                   | been granted a payment and the    |
|                                   | debt could now be recovered by    |
|                                   | withholdings.                     |

|                                   | waived) and the reason for the    |
|                                   | new debt, do not need to be the   |
|                                   | same.                             |
