This document outlines what actions to take when solicitors or
compensation payers are asking if Services Australia has an interest in
a compensation claim.

Agency interest

Services Australia must take compensation payments into account when
determining eligibility for most social security payments or
concessions.

For Centrelink purposes, agency interest exists when compensation
payments made periodically or as a lump sum have an impact on an
individual’s past or ongoing social security entitlements. See Resources
for a list of social security entitlements that may indicate agency
interest.

Payments that do not meet the definition of ‘compensation’ and not
recorded in the Compensation Management System (CMS) may still impact on
social security payments or concessions.

Note: agency interest is not limited to customers in receipt of
compensation affected payments.

No agency interest

Agency interest does not exist for compensation recipients who:

-   have not received a social security payment or concession since the
    incident date, and
-   the lump sum compensation payment does not result in a future
    preclusion period

Conducting interest checks

When actioning third party requests to release a lump sum or periodic
payment, staff must decide if Services Australia has an interest before
recording the information, under The Privacy Act 1988.

An interest check can occur on receipt of a:

-   Compensation Advice of Periodic Payments (SS445) form
-   Compensation Advice of Lump Sum Payments (SS446) form
-   letter from the customer or defendant’s solicitor

After getting a request from a compensation payer or from a customer’s
solicitor the Compensation Recovery Team (CRT) will:

-   authenticate the customer record
-   check if all required details have been supplied
-   decide if the agency has an interest
-   provide a written response to the relevant parties where authority
    or consent exists

The Resources page contains a list of social security entitlements that
may indicate agency interest and wording for Letter text - no agency
interest and the claim has settled.
