This document outlines what actions to take when solicitors or
compensation payers are asking if Services Australia has an interest in
a compensation claim.

No agency interest

Under The Privacy Act 1988 (Privacy Act), Services Australia cannot
create a compensation record where:

-   an individual has not received a compensation affected payment
    (CAP), or
-   the lump sum compensation payment does not result in a future
    preclusion period

Conducting interest checks

An interest check can occur on receipt of a:

-   Compensation Advice of Periodic Payments (SS445)
-   Compensation Advice of Lump Sum Payments (SS446)
-   letter from the customer’s solicitor

After getting a request from a compensation payer or from a customer’s
solicitor

The Compensation Recovery Team (CRT) will:

-   check if Customer Reference Number (CRN) is correct
-   determine if Services Australia has an interest
-   check if all required details have been supplied
-   provide a written response to the enquirer

The Resources page contains wording for Letter text - no agency interest
and the claim has settled.
