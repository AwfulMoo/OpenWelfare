This document outlines information about actioning the monthly rework
report for the Australian Organ Donor Register (AODR) programme.

Rework transactions (AODR)

Every month, an AODR Source Office Processing Volume Report is
generated. This report indicates donor only entitlements that have had a
Medicare card number added during the previous month, but have not been
linked to the Medicare record. An email is sent via Quality Management
to the operator who failed to complete the link, requesting that the
error be corrected.

Service Officers do not need to retrieve the original form or documents
when actioning the rework report. The information featured on the
entitlement, such as the Most Recent Donation Decision Date (MRDD Date),
must be re-entered again when completing the link

For the purposes of the Australian Organ Donor Register (AODR) program,
rework transactions are defined as Donor Only registrations, not linked
to a Medicare number, when permission has been granted.

The Resources page contains additional information about error messages
relating to linking Donor only records.
