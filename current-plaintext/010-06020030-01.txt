[Expand/Collapse all sections]Expand all

This document outlines how to determine the assessment of a Youth
Allowance (YA) claim from a trainee. This will depend on whether the
customer is a full-time student in an approved course, a part-time
student, or the course is not an approved course.

Assessment

-   If the training is full-time and the course being undertaken is an
    approved course, then the customer should be treated as a full-time
    student
-   If the training is full time or part time and the customer is
    employed as an Australian Apprentice (apprentice or trainee) and has
    a current Commonwealth registration number, the customer should be
    treated as an Australian Apprentice
-   If the training is not being undertaken on a full-time basis or is
    not an approved course, then the customer must be treated as a job
    seeker. In doing so, the trainee needs to have their training
    approved as an approved activity under the activity test for job
    seekers. The trainee may have to undertake their training in
    combination with other activities such as looking for work
