|                                   | these guidelines:                 |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   |     non-judgemental and           |

|                                   | -   Make reasonable effort to     |
|                                   |     contact the customer to       |
|                                   |     negotiate a suitable outcome  |

|                                   | -   All negotiations are to start |
|                                   |     from an expectation of        |
|                                   |     payment in full. There are    |
|                                   |     some exclusions so staff      |
|                                   |     should be careful to apply    |
|                                   |     the correct guidelines. Any   |
|                                   |     legislative powers, for       |
|                                   |     example, garnishee, are to be |
|                                   |     used only where negotiation   |
|                                   |     is unsuccessful or cannot be  |
|                                   |     arranged, for example the     |
|                                   |     customer cannot be contacted  |
|                                   | -   The procedural guidelines     |
|                                   |     will identify whether a       |
|                                   |     decision is discretionary.    |
|                                   |     There should be no belief     |
|                                   |     that discretion may be used   |
|                                   |     unless stated                 |
