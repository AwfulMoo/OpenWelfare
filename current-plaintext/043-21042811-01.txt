Bass Strait Passenger Vehicle Equalisation Scheme (BSPVES)

The BSPVES rebate was introduced in September 1996 to reduce the cost of
transporting eligible passenger vehicles across Bass Strait.

Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme (TFES)

TFES was introduced on 1 July 1976 to address the sea freight cost
disadvantage experienced by Tasmanian industries. The Scheme assists
shippers who transport eligible goods by sea between Tasmania and the
Australian mainland. Shippers can make claims for TFES assistance
directly to Services Australia, after paying the freight costs.
