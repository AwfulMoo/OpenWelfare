This document outlines how Service Officers in Smart Centre Call can
assist a job seeker wanting to report for payment by telephone and there
is outstanding compliance action.

Requirement to report

Job seekers, including ParentsNext participants who have compulsory
requirements, are required to report their employment income,
participation details and any change of circumstances to generate their
payment.

Job seekers required to report can do so by self service ([] online,
phone or Express Plus applications) or by lodging their Reporting
Statement (SU19) in person at their local office on a specific day and
reporting frequency (some job seekers also have the option to lodge
their Reporting Statement (SU19) form by fax or post).

Re-engagement with provider required

Outstanding participation-related payment suspensions prevent reporting
being finalised until the required action has been completed.

To prompt timely re-engagement and decision making, Services Australia
must:

-   check which job seeker compliance system applies to the job seeker
    and the participation suspension reason
-   deliver appropriate key messages reinforcing the importance of
    complying with compulsory requirements and remaining engaged with
    their provider
-   appropriately direct the job seeker to their provider or the
    Participation Solutions Team

Contact with Services Australia to discuss compliance action

Outstanding compliance action, including a Comprehensive Compliance
Assessment, Capability Assessment or an active failure will prevent
reporting being finalised. Where contact with Services Australia to
discuss outstanding compliance action is required prior to generating
payment and the job seeker attempts to report via:

-   [] self service online or Express Plus, job seekers will be advised
    to contact the Participation Solutions Team (PST)
-   phone self service, job seekers will be transferred direct to the
    Participation Solutions Team (PST) or Smart Centre Call as
    appropriate during business hours
-   personal or telephone reporting, an issue will display on the job
    seekers record to identify that they need to contact the
    Participation Solutions Team (PST)

Note: job seekers managed under the Targeted Compliance Framework can
choose to accept the financial penalty for certain mutual obligation
failures without a compliance investigation as part of reporting. Where
the job seeker indicates they wish to discuss the failure with Services
Australia, the failure becomes an active failure and will prevent the
finalisation of the report until the job seeker has contacted the PST.

The Resources page contains contact details for the Participation
Solutions Team (PST).
