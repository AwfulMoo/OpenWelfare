Amend group address details in CDMS

Amend personal residential address details in CDMS

Amend group address details in CDMS

An Australian address must be used when recording the group address.
Changing an address on the Amend Medicare Card Details screen in Group
also amends the personal mailing address for the customer. To change a
residential address in Personal, manually amend the address on the Amend
Personal Details screen.

Note: if an address is amended on the Amend Medicare Card Details screen
in Group, the personal mailing address is automatically amended for the
customer. Where the customer has provided a postal address that is
different to a permanent address, the postal address is entered in CDMS
as the mailing address.
