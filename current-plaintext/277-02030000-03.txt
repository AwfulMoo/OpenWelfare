|                                   | order. To be a section 124 order  |
|                                   | it must specify that child        |
|                                   | support will be made as           |
|                                   | non-periodic payments.            |

|                                   | support is to be reduced by an    |
|                                   | amount or percentage (section     |
|                                   | 125). If the order doesn’t state  |

|                                   | reduced, the non-periodic         |

|                                   | by the non-periodic payments, the |

|                                   | amount or percentage,             |
|                                   |                                   |
