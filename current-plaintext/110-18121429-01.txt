This document outlines how Compliance Officers (CO) progress and
complete a customer’s assessment using Assessment Assist in Process
Direct.

Assessment Assist

The Assessment Assist application has been developed to support current
manual handoff for Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) online compliance interventions,
specifically Employment Income Confirmation (EIC) and check and update
past income (CUPI) service.

Assessment Assist:

-   reduces the need for MultiCal debt calculations
-   allows staff to view results of a customer assessment and modify the
    results to progress the assessment through to completion

Accessing Assessment Assist

Assessment Assist can be accessed via the Integrated Review in Process
Direct or launched directly from the Process Direct Inbox.

Assessment edits

The application provides detailed instructions to the CO on how to
action each assessment edit displayed.

Assessment edits will be displayed in the order they need to be
addressed:

-   Customer circumstance edits: an edit relating to the customer's
    circumstances must be actioned outside of the Assessment Assist
    application. Once the edit is addressed in Customer First the CO
    navigates back to Assessment Assist to progress the assessment
-   Entitlement variation edits: an edit relating to a variation in the
    customer's entitlement must be investigated and actioned outside of
    the Assessment Assist application where needed. Once the edit is
    addressed in Customer First, the CO navigates back to Assessment
    Assist to confirm and progress the assessment
-   Adjustment edits: an edit relating to an adjustment in the
    customer's payments must be investigated and updated within the
    Assessment Assist application. The CO confirms the adjustments and
    reruns the assessment to ensure the correct outcome prior to
    progressing the assessment
