This document outlines information for when a Community Development
Program (CDP) job seeker receiving a participation payment becomes
disengaged from their mutual obligation requirements.

Key Objective

The key objective of the Job Seeker Compliance Framework is ensuring CDP
job seekers comply with their mutual obligation requirements. The Job
Seeker Compliance Framework also has a number of safety nets built in to
protect vulnerable CDP job seekers from incurring penalties for
circumstances beyond their control.

Key principles

The following key principles underpin the Job Seeker Compliance
Framework:

-   a focus on participation and maintaining CDP job seeker engagement
    with employment services
-   developing work like behaviours, and
-   ensuring penalties are only imposed for failures within a CDP job
    seekers control

All CDP job seekers receiving a participation payment are expected to
comply with reasonable requirements.

Key features

The following are key features of the Job Seeker Compliance Framework:

Circumstances impacting compliance

Unemployment Non-Payment Periods (UNPP), including Hardship provisions
during a UNPP

Participation payment suspensions

No Show, No Pay failures

Non-Attendance Reports

Connection failures

Non-attendance failures

Reconnection failures

Serious failures:

-   Refusing or failing to accept a suitable job offer
-   Persistent non-compliance

Comprehensive Compliance Assessments (CCA)

Waiving a serious failure period, and

Hardship provisions during serious failure periods

Service delivery responsibility

Both Services Australia and CDP providers have responsibility for
monitoring CDP job seeker engagement with mutual obligation
requirements.

CDP providers are responsible for actioning Non-Attendance Reports
(NAR), including issuing reconnection notices, recording appropriate
outcomes within the On-line Diary in a timely manner, and submitting
Participation Reports or Provider Attendance Reports where they consider
an investigation of a non-compliance event by Services Australia is
required.

Services Australia is responsible for determining whether a connection,
non-attendance, reconnection, No Show, No Pay or serious failure has
occurred or an Unemployment Non-Payment Period (UNPP) will be applied.

Key messages for CDP job seekers reinforced at every participation related contact

The importance of complying with mutual obligation requirements and the
consequences of not doing so should be reinforced with CDP job seekers
at every participation related contact.

This includes reminding CDP job seekers:

-   'If you have compulsory mutual obligation requirements, you are
    required to meet these to remain eligible for payment'
-   'If you are unable to attend an appointment you must contact the
    organisation that you have the appointment with as soon as possible
    to advise why you are unable to attend'
-   'If you do not attend an appointment and you have not contacted
    beforehand, your payment may be reduced or stopped, even if you had
    a good reason for not being able to attend'
-   'If you fail to attend, or behave inappropriately at a job
    interview, your payment may be reduced or stopped'
-   'If you are found to have been persistently not meeting your
    requirements, or refused a suitable job, your payment may stop for
    up to 8 weeks'
-   'If you become voluntarily unemployed without a good reason or are
    dismissed from your job due to misconduct, you may not be paid for 8
    weeks, or up to 12 weeks if you have received relocation assistance
    through an Employment Services Provider'
