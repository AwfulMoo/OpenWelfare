Performing annual tasks

The following tasks are performed on an annual basis:

-   Bulk income requests
-   Bulk annual assessments

Bulk income requests

A bulk income request is received from Inland Revenue, New Zealand
(NZIR) annually. The request is for Child Support to provide NZIR with
updated income information for payer’s in Australia so that this updated
information can be returned to NZIR to update assessments and forward
back to Child Support.

When the request is received via the spreadsheet from NZIR, Child
Support will liaise in the first instance with the Australian Taxation
Office (ATO) so that the ATO can provide most recent taxable income
information for the payer shown on the spreadsheet.

Bulk annual assessments

NZIR send an email in the last week in March with the subject heading
‘Bulk Annual Assessment Run’. The email includes a spreadsheet titled
'BAA Run to ACSP dd mm yy sent’. The spreadsheet contains updated
assessment information. Before the bulk annual assessments are
processed, the spreadsheet is:

-   checked
-   saved, and
-   reformatted
