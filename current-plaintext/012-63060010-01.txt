This document outlines the functions of the complex drugs database.

Complex drugs database

The complex drugs databases are used to store information on prescribers
accessing complex drugs for their patients.

Prescriber information is only kept if accessing complex drugs funded by
the Australian Government and administered by Services Australia staff
delivering Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) services in Hobart’s
Smart Centre.

The complex drugs database keeps records on prescriber and patients.

Specialty database information sharing

Information in the complex drugs databases may be shared with the
specialty databases if the prescriber’s patients are receiving treatment
under multiple programs.
