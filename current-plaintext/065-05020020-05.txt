| 1                                 | Question: How do I calculate the  |
|                                   | equivalent daily accommodation    |
|                                   | payment?                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | When a completed means assessment |
|                                   | results in a care recipient being |
|                                   | assessed as not low means, the    |
|                                   | care recipient will negotiate the |
|                                   | cost of their accommodation with  |
|                                   | their provider. This is the       |
|                                   | Refundable Accommodation Deposit  |
|                                   | (RAD). To calculate the           |
|                                   | equivalent Daily Accommodation    |
|                                   | Payment (DAP) of a RAD, the       |
|                                   | formula is:                       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   Equivalent daily payment =    |
|                                   |     refundable deposit x maximum  |
|                                   |     permissible interest rate     |

|                                   | The formula remains the same in a |
|                                   | leap year. This remains the same  |
|                                   | while the care recipient remains  |

|                                   | results in a care recipient being |
|                                   | assessed as low means, the means  |
|                                   | assessment also determines the    |

|                                   | care, they have 28 days to enter  |
|                                   | an agreement that states how they |
|                                   | will pay their accommodation      |
|                                   | payment. If they do not choose    |
|                                   | within 28 days, they are charged  |
|                                   | a daily payment. An accommodation |

|                                   | -   a combination of refundable   |

|                                   | If they agree to pay a lump sum,  |

|                                   | from this balance to meet their   |
|                                   | accommodation costs. This applies |
|                                   | to DAP payments and is at the     |
|                                   | care recipient’s request.         |
