This document outlines the procedures involved in processing
cancellations, restorations and suspensions to ABSTUDY payments.

Cancelling ABSTUDY

Before cancelling a customer's ABSTUDY payment, take care to confirm the
customer no longer meets the qualification and/or payability provisions
for ABSTUDY. If the decision is to cancel, an advice must be sent to the
customer with the cancellation reason and review and appeal rights.

Suspending ABSTUDY

Before suspending a customer's ABSTUDY payment, take care to confirm the
customer is temporarily not eligible for payment.

A customer may not be qualified for payment temporarily, or for a
specific period, as a result of changes in their circumstances. An
investigation may be required by Services Australia into their
eligibility for ABSTUDY. In such cases, their payment should be
suspended. See Suspension of ABSTUDY payments.

Restoring ABSTUDY

Restoration of suspended or cancelled ABSTUDY payments usually occurs
when a customer's qualification for ABSTUDY has been re-established
after a cancellation or suspension.

Unfavourable decision

When making an unfavourable decision, speak to the customer:

-   explain the decision
-   give them a chance to provide more information, and
-   advise their review and appeal rights

Check and update contact details

Every customer's address (including postal address) and phone details
(including mobile phone numbers) must be checked at every contact, and
updated if required. Note: if the customer has authenticated themselves
via IVR, address details do not need to be confirmed.
