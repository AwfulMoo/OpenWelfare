|                                   | Generally, most organisations/    |
|                                   | institutions will claim FTB for   |

|                                   | or FTB is not paid for the child, |

|                                   | The only exception to this is     |
|                                   | where a child residing in an ACO  |
|                                   | is an FTB child of a person but   |
|                                   | that person is not being paid FTB |
|                                   | due to the application of the FTB |
|                                   | income test. The child could not  |
|                                   | be granted a LIC in this case.    |
