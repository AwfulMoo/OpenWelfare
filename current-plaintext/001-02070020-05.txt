| 2                                 | More detail about the reason why  |
|                                   | a penalty was not imposed on a    |
|                                   | job seeker                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This information can be provided  |
|                                   | as it will help providers         |
|                                   | determine whether the job seeker  |
|                                   | is meeting their mutual           |
|                                   | obligation requirements and will  |
|                                   | give the provider a better        |
|                                   | picture of how to deal with the   |
|                                   | job seeker in the future. This    |
|                                   | may also help to reduce the       |
|                                   | number of inappropriate           |
|                                   | participation reports recorded    |
|                                   | for the individual job seeker     |
|                                   | and/or improve the quality of     |
|                                   | those reports.                    |

| 3                                 | Detail of a job seeker's current  |
|                                   | requirements (for example work,   |
|                                   | study) in order for providers to  |
|                                   | determine if a participation      |
|                                   | report should be lodged           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This information can be provided  |
|                                   | as it will help providers         |
|                                   | determine whether it is           |
|                                   | appropriate to record a           |
|                                   | participation report for the job  |
|                                   | seeker. If it became apparent     |
|                                   | that the job seeker failed to     |
|                                   | attend an appointment because of  |
|                                   | casual work or some other         |
|                                   | recorded activity, the provider   |
|                                   | would make better judgements      |
|                                   | about the appropriateness of      |
|                                   | recording a participation report. |

|                                   | location or contact details to    |
|                                   | determine if interview notices    |
|                                   | from the provider have been       |
|                                   | issued appropriately              |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | While address information is      |
|                                   | exchanged via IT systems, it is   |
|                                   | possible that the provider has    |
|                                   | been notified of a temporary      |
|                                   | change of address that the job    |
|                                   | seeker has not disclosed or       |
|                                   | simply that the provider believes |
|                                   | there may be something wrong with |
|                                   | the address information they have |
|                                   | (or that Services Australia has). |

|                                   | This information can be provided  |
|                                   | as providers also have            |
|                                   | responsibilities to ensure that   |
|                                   | Services Australia is aware of    |
|                                   | the job seeker's employment and   |

|                                   | correctly declaring earnings. The |
|                                   | time spent in casual work will    |
|                                   | also affect the requirements      |
|                                   | placed on the individual by their |
