This document outlines information about the types and causes of debts.

Why debts occur

Debts can occur when Services Australia:

-   reassess or adjust a customer's entitlements
-   complete a review (Compliance or Service Update)
-   transfer customers between payment types
-   determine an advance as legally recoverable debt
-   gets a tip-off

Locating debts

View debts:

-   resulting from a reassessment on the Activity List (AL) screen in
    Customer First or Customer Record
-   coded in the Integrated Review System (IRS) in the Debt Management
    and Information System (DMIS) on the AL screen
-   in Process Direct on the Debt List located in Debts > Launch Debt
    Management > Debt List

In all other cases, manually add a debt to DMIS or to Process Direct.
