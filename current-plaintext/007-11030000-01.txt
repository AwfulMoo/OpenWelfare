This document outlines the process for Family Tax Benefit (FTB), Child
Care Subsidy (CCS) and Child Care Benefit (CCB) reconciliation and lump
sum claim assessments, when actual income details have not been received
from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). All CCB/CCR references relate
to financial years before 2018/2019.

Exchange of information

Information is exchanged between the ATO and Services Australia. This
allows FTB, CCS and CCB reconciliation and FTB/CCB lump sum claim
assessments to be completed.

Where the customer and/or partner have lodged a tax return, the ATO will
send the following:

-   actual income from a person's tax return for a financial year
-   the date a person’s tax return was lodged for a financial year
-   a wash up transaction to advise of any debt offsetting and to
    finalise the assessment

A customer may alternatively submit a ‘Return Not Necessary’ (RNN)
advice through the ATO, meaning they have received an ATO exemption from
lodging a tax return.

In some circumstances information is not received from the ATO. This
could be due to:

-   issues with the Mutual Customer Identification (MCI), including
    where the link has closed because it is more than 3 years after the
    relevant financial year
-   system problems
-   back dated marital status updates where the ATO link has not yet
    established for the updated partner
-   manual processing of the person's tax return by the ATO

If the required information has not been received, the reconciliation or
lump sum claim assessment may not be finalised and in some cases a
non-lodger debt may generate.

The Resources page contains a link to the ATO website for progress of
tax return information.
