This document outlines how to use the application to help customers link
their Centrelink, Child Support and/or Medicare services to their myGov
account. No other services can be linked.

myGov Staff Linking Application

Use the myGov Staff Linking Application to generate a unique single-use
linking code.

The linking code is valid for 14 days. Staff can issue a new linking
code at any time.

Use the myGov Staff Linking Application to generate a linking code. Make
sure the customer has:

a myGov account, and

a record with:

-   Centrelink
-   Child Support and/or
-   Medicare

Do not use the myGov Staff Linking Application for third parties
requesting a linking code for a customer they represent. This includes:

-   Centrelink nominee arrangements, where the nominee requests a
    linking code for their principal's account. Nominee’s must use their
    own myGov account and their personal linking code to access their
    principal's account
-   Medicare customers with Power of Attorney (POA) who request a
    linking code for a customer they legally represent
-   Child Support representatives with ordinary authority or Child
    Support authorised agents, who request a linking code for the
    account of the parent or carer they represent

Customer Authentication

A Service Officer must be satisfied the person requesting the linking
code is the owner of the program ID/s being linked.

Customers must provide:

a valid program ID, such as:

-   Centrelink Customer Reference Number
-   Child Support Customer Reference Number, or
-   Medicare card number (including Individual Reference Number)

personal information relating to that program ID, such as:

-   name
-   date of birth
-   address

approved identity documents (original documents) to progress the
registration through the Fast track process or questions and answers
(Q&A) Proof of Record Ownership (PoRO), to verify they own the member
service record being linked

Fast track registration

This option is available to:

-   Service Officers assisting customers face to face
-   Silver Service
-   Smart Centre staff

Service Centre and Silver Service staff can issue a linking code using
the Fast track registration process if:

-   the customer has provided their program ID,
-   an approved identity document and
-   passed the initial PoRO questions program ID (Name, Date of Birth
    (DOB), address) presented on the Customer information page

Smart Centre staff can only use the Fast track registration process with
an identity document verified through the Document Verification Service
(DVS) using the prescribed process for each member service.

Centrelink customers

Centrelink customers must satisfy initial PoRO questions by confirming
their name, date of birth and address and when:

In person, or via Silver Service, the customer must provide an approved
photo identity document (original document)

By phone:

-   Staff are to issue a linking code using the Q&A PoRO process or,
-   Staff are to use the Fast track process for Centrelink customers, by
    verifying an approved identity document through the Identity
    Confirmation Dashboard, when they have failed to successfully
    complete or unable to complete the Q&A PoRO process

Centrelink customers with a placeholder address of “C/O AUTO CTAT” must
have the address updated in their Centrelink record as part of this
process. This address is a result of a child record being promoted to a
person record. See Updating address details.

Medicare customers

Must satisfy initial PoRO questions by confirming their name, date of
birth and address:

-   Staff are to issue a linking code using the Q&A PoRO process, when
    the customer is on the phone, or
-   When the customer is at a Service Centre (face to face), the Fast
    track option is available when the customer provides a photo
    identity document, or
-   If the customer has passed the initial PoRO questions, but has
    failed to successfully complete the Q&A PoRO process, staff may use
    the Fast track process after successfully verifying a identity
    document/s using Document Verification Service (DVS)

Child Support customers

Must satisfy initial PoRO questions by confirming their name, date of
birth and address:

-   Staff are to issue a linking code using the Q&A PoRO process, when
    the customer is on the phone, and
-   Staff must ask Q&A PoRO questions to establish the customer is who
    they say they are and to verify they own the member service record
    before issuing a linking code

A Service Officer must be satisfied the person requesting the linking
code is the owner of the program ID/s being linked.
