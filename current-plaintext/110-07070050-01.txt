This document outlines the process for requesting additional information
for the Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) End of Year (EOY)
circumstance review forms.

Failure to return or incomplete EOY review form

In some cases, applicants for Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC)
return their End of Year (EOY) review form to the AIC Smart Centre
without fully completing the questionnaire and/or without supplying all
necessary documentation. In order to process these reviews a request for
the documentation to be supplied will be sent to the applicant.

Additional Boarding Allowance (ABA)

Instances also occur where the applicant wishes to apply for ABA and the
EOY review form did not request the relevant income details.

In some cases AIC Smart Centre staff may phone the applicant to request
missing documentation.

The EOY review can be processed and the Basic Boarding Allowance paid.
The applicant should be informed that Additional Boarding Allowance can
only be paid when the information/documentation requested has been
supplied.
