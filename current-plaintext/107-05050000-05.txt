Recovery action warnings

Recovery action warnings inform the customer on what action Services
Australia may take if they become non-compliant during the recovery
process. That is, not entering into a reasonable repayment arrangement
or not adhering to an agreed arrangement.

Warnings can be given verbally or in writing. Where verbal warnings have
been given the specific warnings need to be documented. For example,
customer has been provided with:

-   Bank, Tax, and Wage garnishee
-   Interest Charge (IC)
-   Departure Prohibition Order (DPO), and
-   legal proceedings warnings

Action the agency may take:

-   Interest Charge (IC)
-   Wage Garnishee
-   Bank Garnishee
-   Tax Garnishee
-   Legal Proceedings
-   Departure Prohibition Order (DPO)

Note: debt offsetting during family assistance reconciliation and lump
sum claim processing may still occur even though one of the above
actions has been taken. For example, debt offsetting may still happen
while a wage garnishee is in place.

Letters that include warnings:

-   Account payable
-   Reminder letter
-   Payment Not Received Letter
-   Withholdings Ceased Letter
-   Payment Confirmation Letter
-   DRC to customer contact letter with final option (Q190)
-   DRC to customer contact in response EDF debtor match (Q289)
-   DRC to customer result of withholdings review (Q246)
-   DRC to customer outcome repayment/deferral request (Q313)
