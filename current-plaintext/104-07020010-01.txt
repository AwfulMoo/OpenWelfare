This document outlines how staff request and apply an email redirection
and how email redirections are reviewed.

Customer management - Email redirections

Some of our customers may require on going management or intensive
support. Email redirection is one form of ongoing customer management.
Email redirection allows Services Australia to consolidate all incoming
email correspondence and provide the customer with a consistent level of
service.

Email redirections will only be approved in very limited circumstances,
including but not limited to:

-   The customer makes multiple contacts. An email redirection will
    allow the agency to consolidate contact to assess risk
-   The customer contacts pose a risk to staff safety/wellbeing
-   The customer has a Managed Service Plan (MSP) in place and continues
    to contact outside of their service arrangement
-   The customer has an MSP in place with write only restriction and
    contacts staff other than their One Main Contact (OMC)/ Personalised
    Services Service Officer (PSSO)
-   The customer makes frequent contact, lodges duplicate complaints, or
    makes unreasonable demands that impacts on the agency's ability to
    provide service to other customers
