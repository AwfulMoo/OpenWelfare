This document outlines the assessment process for Assistance for
Isolated Children (AIC) enrolment checks.

Enrolment checks

AIC students are subject to enrolment checks each term.

Details received from education providers may show one or more of the
following. The student:

-   is not enrolled at the recorded education provider
-   has ceased studies
-   did not start studies
-   started studies late
-   changed study load

Use the enrolment check to determine the student's eligibility during
their course of study.

Start of enrolment checks

How AIC enrolment checks are issued, depends on the education provider
recorded on the student's Education Details (EDC) screen:

Electronically, through the Integrated Review System (IRS) for:

-   SA Secondary government schools
-   QLD, WA, TAS and ACT Primary and Secondary government schools

Manual paper forms for:

-   NSW, VIC and NT Primary and Secondary government schools
-   SA Primary government schools
-   all non-government schools

Customer contact

Make 2 genuine contact attempts to contact the applicant to confirm the
student's circumstances when a discrepancy is identified in the
enrolment response.

Service Officers can re-assess AIC payment(s), where the applicant:

-   confirms the details in the enrolment check
-   can provide a reasonable excuse for the discrepancy, or
-   says the student was impacted by circumstances beyond their control

Get verification documents when the applicant does not meet one of the
above criteria, verification documents are needed.

If the applicant cannot be contacted by phone, suspend the AIC
payment(s) and issue written notification to the applicant.

AIC applicants have up to 29 days (14 days to respond plus 15 additional
delivery days for remote applicants) to contact from the date
information is requested, to discuss the student's circumstances. If the
applicant fails to contact Services Australia within this period, their
AIC payment(s) for that student may be stopped.

Verification

Where evidence is needed, issue a Request for Information (Q781) letter.
Ask the applicant to provide the documents within 14 days.

Third parties and applicants have an obligation to provide the
information under section 343 of the Student Assistance Act 1973.

Cancelling an Enrolment Check

Enrolment checks are non-discretionary reviews. Only AIC-skilled Service
Officers should cancel them.

Third party debts

AIC Scheme debts may be the responsibility of a third party. This could
be an educational institution, parent or guardian. Check to confirm
which party directly received the payment.

Further details needed

If the applicant has been told verbally or in writing that they must
give more details, there is no need to attempt to try to contact the
customer. This does not apply to vulnerable or at risk customers.
