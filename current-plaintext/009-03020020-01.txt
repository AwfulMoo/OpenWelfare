This document explains details about Carer Allowance (CA) (auto).

CA (auto) eligibility

CA (auto) is automatically payable for each child care receiver for the
period for which the carer is paid Carer Payment (CP) (child) for the
same care receiver, where the carer is not already receiving CA (child)
for the care receiver/s under the standard provisions.

This means CA (auto) may be payable even if the standard provisions for
CA (child) are not met. For instance, the condition is expected to last
for at least 6 months but not 12 months, or the child is not a dependent
child of the carer.

Applying for CA (child)

If a carer does not qualify for CP (child), they can still apply for CA
(child) under the standard provisions. If this is the case, this
procedure does not apply.

Note: encourage carers to apply for CA (child) when they apply for CP
(child). This is to make sure they can still be considered for CA
(child), if their CP (child) is rejected.

The Disability Care Load Assessment Determination (DCLAD) (2020) is used
to assess qualification for CP (child) and/or CA (child).
