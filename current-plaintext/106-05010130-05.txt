| 4                                 | Clarice is eligible for AIC and   |
|                                   | is boarding privately. Clarice    |
|                                   | starts study on the first day of  |
|                                   | the school term, that is, on 31   |
|                                   | January, but does not start       |
|                                   | boarding until 15 February.       |

|                                   | As this is more than 14 days from |
|                                   | the start of the term, the AIC    |
|                                   | start date would normally be 15   |
|                                   | February.                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | However, Clarice's applicant      |
|                                   | advises they could not start      |
|                                   | their boarding on time due to the |
|                                   | board provider being ill, and     |
|                                   | Clarice did start boarding as     |
|                                   | soon as they were well enough.    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | In this case, AIC could be paid   |
|                                   | from 1 January as the delay was   |
|                                   | due to unforeseen circumstances   |
|                                   | and the student started as soon   |
|                                   | as possible after those           |
|                                   | circumstances ceased.             |

|                                   | starts boarding at school on 21   |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | As Dominic has started on time,   |
|                                   | the AIC is payable from the start |
|                                   | of the Term 3 Instalment period,  |
