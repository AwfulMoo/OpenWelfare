|                                   | Joe advised on 20 December of a   |
|                                   | change of address to a retirement |
|                                   | village. An information notice    |
|                                   | was sent to Joe's new address     |
|                                   | requesting rent details. Joe did  |
|                                   | not reply and his Age Pension was |
|                                   | suspended 14 days later. Joe's    |
|                                   | Age Pension was cancelled         |
|                                   | automatically after 13 weeks. The |
|                                   | date of effect of the             |
|                                   | cancellation is the date of       |
|                                   | effect of the suspension.         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Joe applied for a formal review   |
|                                   | 12 weeks after the cancellation   |
|                                   | decision and provided the         |
|                                   | outstanding information. An ARO   |
|                                   | decided to restore Joe's Age      |
|                                   | Pension. As the decision to       |
|                                   | cancel Joe's Age Pension took     |
|                                   | effect on the day his Age Pension |
|                                   | was suspended, the date of effect |
|                                   | of the restoration is the date of |
|                                   | suspension. Joe can be back paid  |
|                                   | from the date Age Pension was     |
|                                   | suspended.                        |

|                                   | income and a letter is sent       |

|                                   | On 1 November Joe advises of the  |
|                                   | reduction in overseas income      |
|                                   | which took place on 1 August.     |
|                                   | Joe's rate is adjusted from 1     |
|                                   | November because of the date of   |

|                                   | arrears from 1 September as the   |
|                                   | application for a formal review   |
|                                   | on 2 November is within 13 weeks  |

|                                   | than the application of section   |
