This procedure only applies to payments and services aligned to the
Legacy POI tiered model. For other agency payments and services, see
Identity Confirmation.

This document outlines how to check and code POI documents on customer
records.

Checklist for Service Officers when POI is lodged

Identity documents must be original, unaltered and listed in Legacy POI
tiered model A-Z documents.

-   Documents provided by a customer that meet the Legacy POI tiered
    model requirements need to be coded on the legacy POI screen
-   Documents with the highest point value or Proof of Birth/Arrival
    documents must be coded first
-   Documents must be provided from the approved list until the required
    points value has been reached

Customers can provide POI:

-   in person at a service centre
-   in person at an Agent or Access Point, or
-   by post to Emergency Processing Services Australia. Note: this
    should be a last resort. The preferred option is for a customer to
    provide their original identity document/s in person at a service
    centre, Agent or Access Point

Coding POI document summary

Staff must enter document details as they appear on the document.

Supporting evidence must be supplied if the customer’s name at birth,
maiden name or other legal name has never been coded as their previous
legal name. If the customer has changed their name, see Changing the
legal name of customers or their children.

This procedure summarises how to code the legacy POI screen. This screen
can only be accessed via the legacy POI Document Selection (PDS) screen
when:

-   completing a new claim activity
-   the customer has not attained the required legacy tier level and
    extra identity documents are needed, or
-   the customer has been granted a legacy POI exemption and extra
    identity documents are needed

If POI has previously been provided and meets the legacy tier
requirements of the service reason claimed, the legacy POI screen will
be protected, for viewing only for example. Limited updates of the
legacy POI screen are required for abridged claims and manual transfers.

Many document codes on the legacy POI screen will have system edits to
ensure a valid document number. Use field help to view the format of the
Serial/Registration number for a document.

There is a limit of 11 lines on the legacy POI screen.

Correcting POI coding errors

From here the delegated staff member can amend the POI documents.

Delegated staff may be Quality Online (QOL) Checkers, Team Leaders or
Zone Identity Subject Matter Experts.

Historical POI details

The legacy POI Historical Details (POIH) screen displays all POI
documents held on the customer's record prior to September 2001. This
screen is for display of previously held POI documents only. No
documents can be selected or amended.

The Resources page contains a link to Program Identity contact details.
