This document outlines information about specialist services available
to refugees, humanitarian entrants and protection visa holders. It
contains a detailed table of both Services Australia and external
specialist services available.

Specialist services

Customers who are identified as being a refugee, humanitarian entrant or
protection visa holder have access to many specialist services to assist
them with their individual needs. Referrals should be made by Services
Australia where it is apparent that a customer is having difficulty with
issues, such as settling within Australia, linguistic and social
difficulties, health problems, grief and coping with the effects of
torture and trauma.

For many refugees, the effects of torture and trauma are ongoing and may
affect their ability to speak and answer questions, learn a new
language, find suitable accommodation and adjust to the new way of life
within their new host country. These difficulties may be further
compounded for customers who live in remote or rural areas.

Multicultural Services Officer

If a customer requires special help or the particular services offered
by an external service provider, contact should be made with a
Multicultural Service Officer (MSO).
