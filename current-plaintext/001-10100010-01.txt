This document explains the process undertaken by Participation Solutions
Team (PST)-skilled staff who are responsible for deciding serious
failures when a Community Development Program (CDP) participant refuses
to accept or fails to commence a suitable job.

Serious failure for refusing to accept or failing to commence a suitable job

A serious failure may require investigation when a CDP participant
refuses to accept or fails to commence a suitable job.

These may be triggered when:

-   a Participation Report is received from a CDP provider, or
-   information received directly from the CDP participant indicates
    their refusal to accept or failure to commence a suitable job. In
    these cases Services Australia staff will generate the serious
    failure for investigation

Serious failure conditions

A serious failure has only occurred because of a CDP participant
refusing to accept or failing to commence a suitable job if:

-   the CDP participant was receiving a payment subjected to mutual
    obligation requirements on the failure incident date, and
-   the position offered was suitable work based on the CDP
    participant's individual circumstances, and
-   the CDP participant did not have a reasonable excuse for refusing to
    accept the offer or commence work as planned

Responsibilities of PST-skilled Staff with WNPPD security resource

PST-skilled staff with WNPPD security resource are responsible for:

reviewing existing information on the CDP participant's record which may
be relevant to the failure. This includes reviewing the Participation
Report and provider comments

determining the validity of the failure

establishing contact with the CDP participant to:

-   discuss the failure, and
-   record the CDP participant's explanation for the failure

contacting third parties such as Employment Services Providers or
employers, to gather further information about:

-   the position offered
-   how the offer was made, and/or
-   the refusal to accept or commence suitable employment

determining whether personal factors or barriers impacted on the
suitability of the employment or the CDP participant's capacity to
accept the job offer. This may include consultation with a Centrelink
specialist or Indigenous Cultural Consultant

recording all elements of the investigation in the Compliance
Investigation workflow

determining whether a serious failure has occurred and notifying the CDP
participant of this determination
Note: when PST-skilled staff (WNPPD) are not at the APS5 level,
consultation with a Service Officer (SO5) must occur before a decision
is made to apply a serious failure for refusing or failing to commence a
suitable job

explaining the serious failure penalty and offering the CDP participant
the opportunity to waive the serious failure penalty by attending a
waiver re-engagement appointment

re-engaging CDP participants who agree to attend a waiver re-engagement
appointment with their provider

determining if hardship provisions apply when the CDP participant does
not have capacity to attend a waiver re-engagement appointment

The Resources page contains a table outlining the different types of
serious failures relating to failing or refusing to accept a suitable
job offer.
