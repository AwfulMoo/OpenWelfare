This document outlines the functions and information available in the
Participation Compliance Hub.

Using the Participation Compliance Hub

The Participation Compliance Hub is the system tool used to manage all
Targeted Compliance Framework and Job Seeker Compliance Framework
compliance actions.

It includes access to the following workflows:

-   Generate Compliance Action workflow
-   Capability Assessment workflow
-   Compliance Investigation workflow (CIW)
-   Comprehensive Compliance Assessment (CCA) workflow
-   Review Decision workflow

IT Security Resources restrict certain actions in the Participation
Compliance Hub. This ensures that only Participation Solution Team (PST)
skilled staff make certain decisions. These security resources enable
Services Australia to:

-   build and maintain expected levels of expertise, and
-   provide enhanced monitoring and governance to apply financial
    penalties accurately and consistently

All staff with access to the Centrelink system have base level access to
the Participation Compliance Hub.

This enables staff to:

-   generate a compliance action, and
-   view screens in an outstanding or completed compliance investigation

The Resources page contains the security resources needed to access the
Participation Compliance Hub, Product Manager Rules for PFDEC, UNPPD and
WNPPD security resources, and high level overviews.
