This documents outlines information about MIC Interventions.

Outline of MIC interventions

The Customer Compliance Division is conducting MIC Interventions for
customers who may be at risk of receiving the incorrect rate of payment
due to income received from Family Day Care (FDC) and Trusts.

MIC Interventions are triggered from external data matching with third
parties such as Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and Department of
Education, Skills and Employment.

The MIC gives the customer the opportunity, to confirm or update income
information provided to Centrelink by third parties.

All MIC Interventions are actioned by the Customer Compliance Division.
