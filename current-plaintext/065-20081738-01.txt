Aged care COVID-19 support supplement

The aged care COVID-19 support supplement helps to cover the additional
costs of care in residential aged care services during the coronavirus
(COVID-19) pandemic.

These costs include:

-   additional staffing
-   training
-   supporting visitation and connections
-   personal protective equipment

The supplement is paid as one off lump sum amounts. Both supplement
amounts are based on each service’s:

-   Modified Monash Model (MMM) classification
-   Occupied beds for the February 2020 claim in relation to the first
    supplement amount
-   Occupied beds for the June 2020 claim in relation to the second
    supplement amount

Eligibility

All government funded permanent residential and respite aged care
services get the supplement after the February 2020 and June 2020 claims
have been submitted and approved. This includes care recipients with the
Aged Care Funding Instrument (ACFI) NNN classification for the February
2020 and June 2020 claim months.

Residential aged care services do not need to apply for the aged care
COVID-19 support supplement. Services Australia will automatically pay
the aged care COVID-19 support supplement after the relevant claims have
been submitted and approved.

If the residential service:

-   has not submitted a February 2020 and June 2020 claim, the
    supplement will not be paid until that claim is submitted and
    approved
-   makes retrospective changes that affect the number of occupied beds
    for February 2020 and June 2020, adjustments will be made and
    reflected in the next payment statement

The aged care service will receive the funding in respect of the care
recipient. The funding will not impact a care recipient’s means
assessment and their ability to contribute towards government funded
aged care services.

Payment information

The System for the Payment of Aged Residential Care (SPARC) calculates
the supplement amount. It uses the residential and respite occupied beds
reported by the residential service for February 2020 and June 2020.
This is multiplied by a daily rate based on the service's Modified
Monash Model (MMM) score.

The Department of Health and Aged Care has set the below supplement
rates for:

the first supplement

-   MMM1 as $31.38 per day
-   MMM2 to MMM7 as $47.07 per day

the second supplement

-   MMM1 as $32.48 per day
-   MMM2 to MMM7 as $47.81 per day

Residential aged care services outside major metropolitan areas will get
a 50% loading to cover any additional costs of providing care in these
areas.

Note: the supplement amount:

-   includes any retrospective changes to the February 2020 and June
    2020 occupancy
-   is a set rate per day and does not include care recipients who do
    not have an ACFI reflected for February 2020 and June 2020
-   is displayed on the summary page of the payment statement as an
    ‘Adjustment’, and
-   a note in the provider notes section of the payment statement will
    advise what the supplement is for and the total amount of the
    supplement paid to the service
