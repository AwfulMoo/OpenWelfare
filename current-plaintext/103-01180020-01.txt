This document outlines information for social workers when determining
eligibility for Income Management as a Vulnerable Welfare Payment
Recipient (VWPR).

Eligibility for IM under VWPR measure

This procedure is not relevant for customers who are auto triggered for
the Vulnerable Welfare Payment Recipient Income Management measure.

Customers will be considered eligible to be placed on to Income
Management by a Services Australia social worker, at their discretion,
if the customer's individual behaviours or circumstances provide
evidence they are vulnerable and/or at-risk and would benefit from
Income Management.

Income Management is an additional tool for social workers to use when
working with vulnerable or at-risk customers.

Any external organisations (State Housing authorities, aged care
services, health services and Community agencies) can refer a customer
to Services Australia to be considered for Income Management under the
VWPR measure. This referral will be assessed by a Services Australia
social worker with determination as to a customer's suitability for
Income Management to lay solely with the social worker, taking into
consideration that Income Management is only one tool available to
social workers to assist vulnerable customers.

Social workers are responsible for making a determination of a
customer's vulnerability and will consider if Income Management is
appropriate for the customer.

Criteria for IM under VWPR measure

A customer is to be income managed under the Vulnerable Welfare Payment
Recipient (VWPR) measure if they meet the following conditions:

-   A Services Australia social worker has determined that the customer
    is a Vulnerable Welfare Payment Recipient
-   The customer's usual place of residence is within a declared area
-   The customer is in receipt of a category H welfare payment
-   The customer is not already subject to an Income Management measure
    which is above the Vulnerable Welfare Payment Recipient (VWPR)
    measure in the Overview and hierarchy of income management measures
-   The customer does not have an excluded payment nominee. Note: the
    social worker may choose to cancel the nominee arrangement at the
    time they declare the customer as a Vulnerable Welfare Payment
    Recipient if it is shown that the arrangement is not in the
    customer's best interests

Factors to consider

To determine if a customer is a Vulnerable Welfare Payment Recipient for
Income Management, the social worker considers whether:

-   the customer is experiencing an indicator of vulnerability
-   the customer is meeting their priority needs and the priority needs
    of their partner, children or other dependents
-   Income Management is an appropriate support for the person to meet
    their responsibilities, build and maintain self-care and manage
    their money

Indicators of vulnerability

Customers may be considered experiencing vulnerability due to one of the
following indicators:

-   financial hardship
-   financial exploitation
-   failure to undertake reasonable self-care
-   homelessness or risk of homelessness
