This document outlines the process for dealing with a child support
terminating event.

Terminating events

When Child Support becomes aware that a terminating event has occurred,
immediately take steps to vary or end a child support assessment to
reflect this event on Cuba from the date that the event occurred.

If an election to end application is received from a payee, see Ending a
Child Support assessment.

The Resources page contains additional details on individual terminating
events.
