This document outlines the Non-Attendance Failure penalty period that
applies as a result of a Non-Attendance Failure being applied under the
Job Seeker Compliance Framework for Community Development Program (CDP)
participant's.

Applied non-attendance failures

The Job Seeker Compliance Framework focuses on encouraging CDP
participants receiving participation payments to remain engaged with
their Provider and to comply with their mutual obligation requirements.
Financial penalties are only imposed for failures within a CDP
participant's control, for example, as a result of deliberate or
persistent non-compliance.

A non-attendance failure will be applied following investigation of the
reported failure when a CDP participant does not have a reasonable
excuse for not attending a compulsory appointment with their provider
that was not a reconnection or further reconnection requirement and:

-   they are currently receiving a participation payment, and
-   a Non-Attendance Report (NAR) has been accepted by Services
    Australia for the same incident date

When a non-attendance failure is applied, the CDP participant enters
into a non-attendance failure penalty period. A penalty amount will be
calculated for each business day of the non-attendance failure period.

Deemed date of notification

A non-attendance failure period commences from the earliest date the CDP
participant is deemed to have been notified their participation payment
is not payable due to the appointment they missed. This is referred to
as the deemed date of notification and is recorded in the NAR summary on
the Participation Compliance Hub screen.

The deemed date of notification is dependent on the method of
notification. For notification:

-   as a letter, the deemed date of notification will be eight days from
    date of despatch
-   by email or SMS, the deemed date of notification is the date of
    validation of the NAR (that is, the date the NAR was accepted by the
    Services Australia system)
-   verbally, the deemed date of notification is the date the verbal
    notification was issued

When a letter, email or SMS is sent but another form of notification is
also successful, the earliest deemed date will be used to calculate the
penalty.

Non-attendance failure period

A non-attendance failure period commences from the deemed date of
notification that their participation payment is not payable due to the
appointment they missed, and will end the day before one of the
following:

-   the CDP participant's reconnection requirement
-   the day the provider deems the CDP participant has met the
    requirement
-   the day the provider determines they are no longer required to
    comply with the reconnection requirement
-   the day the provider attempts but is unable to book a re-engagement
    appointment within two working days excluding public holidays
    (providing the CDP participant has agreed to re-engage)
-   Services Australia determines the CDP participant no longer has the
    capacity (for example when an exemption from their mutual obligation
    requirements has been granted) to comply
-   the CDP participant is formally notified of a requirement to attend
    a Comprehensive Compliance Assessment (CCA)
-   the CDP participant's re-engagement appointment is
    rescheduled/cancelled by their provider
-   the CDP participant's participation payment is cancelled to grant a
    non-participation payment
-   the CDP participant's participation payment is cancelled for at
    least 10 weeks or re-granted with a break in payment, or
-   the CDP participant commences a serious failure period or
    Unemployment Non-Payment Period (UNPP)

Penalty calculation

Non-attendance failure penalties are based on a business day
calculation. This means the CDP participant will generally accrue a
daily penalty equal to one tenth of their fortnightly payment for each
day the penalty applies. Saturdays and Sundays falling in a
non-attendance failure period will not accrue a penalty.

The non-attendance failure penalty is calculated based on the CDP
participant's basic benefit and certain supplementary payments. The
non-attendance failure penalty is calculated after the income and assets
test has been applied to the CDP participant's basic benefit but before
any withholdings of penalty amounts for previous failures or
withholdings are deducted for debts or advance payments.

Supplementary payments included in the penalty calculation

The following participation related supplements are included in the
calculation of the non-attendance failure penalty:

-   Approved Program of Work Supplement (APWS)
-   Language, Literacy and Numeracy Supplement (LLNS)
-   Energy Supplement paid on a fortnightly basis. Note: the Energy
    Supplement is not included in the penalty calculation if it is paid
    on a quarterly basis

Mutual obligation requirements during a non-attendance failure period

CDP participants are required to continue to meet their regular
reporting requirements during a non-attendance failure period.

Further non-attendance failures, connection and No Show, No Pay failures
cannot be applied when the failure event occurred during a period the
CDP participant was in a non-attendance failure period.

A non-attendance failure or reconnection failure that relates to a
different sequence of failures, such as linked to a different
NAR/failure event cannot be applied during a non-attendance failure
period.

The Resources page contains a sample penalty calculation for
non-attendance failures, reconnection and No Show, No Pay failures.
