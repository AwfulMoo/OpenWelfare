|                                   | receipt back to the originator,   |
|                                   | unless otherwise agreed.          |

| Complex clearance requests (Part  | Centrelink and DVA to contact and |
| A and B)                          | discuss alternative timeliness    |
|                                   | standards.                        |

| Release of DVA arrears (Part C)   | Part C of the DVA clearance form  |
|                                   | must be forwarded to Centrelink   |
|                                   | prior to release of any arrears   |
