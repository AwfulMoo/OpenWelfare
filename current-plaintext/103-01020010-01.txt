This document outlines how to identify whether a customer is subject to
Income Management and how to assist these customers.

Identifying income managed customers

To identify if a customer is income managed, the benefit status line on
a customer's record will display 'INM' immediately before their payment
type. Details regarding qualification for Income Management, account
details and priority needs can be found on the Income Management Summary
screen.

Requests for an urgent payment

When an income managed customer contacts Services Australia, Service
Officers must conduct all necessary business, ensuring any messaging
within scripts or workflows are relayed to the customer, prior to
referring them to a specialised Service Officer. The exception to this
is a request for an urgent payment, as these requests must be referred
to a specialised IM Service Officer for assessment.

Service Officer initiated assessment result process

If a Service Officer initiates an assessment result (AR) process on an
income managed customer, or a potential income managed customer, and
further action is required, one of the following will display:

-   the Income Management Summary screen (workflow), or
-   the Income Management Warning and Error (IMWE) screen (manual
    coding)

These screens will display a message or Work Item that could impact
Income Management and this must be addressed as part of the contact. An
un-actioned Work Item will also create an INM/ACT activity on the
Activity List (AL) screen.

Service Officers actioning work items

When a Work Item or INM/ACT is generated, the following process should
be followed:

Access Services Service Officers:

-   Utilise current procedures to assist in actioning the Income
    Management and BasicsCard Work Items
-   Seek assistance from a specialised Service Officer (if available) or
    Service Support Officer (SSO), or
-   Contact the Access Services Support Line (select Income Management
    option 7). Specialised staff will assist Service Officers to be able
    to complete the customer's enquiry or update. Note: where customers
    are income managed under the Cape York Initiative, Service Officers
    should firstly attempt to contact the Cape York Team (CYTT)

Smart Centre Telephony Service Officers are to transfer the customer to:

-   the Income Management Line
-   the Indigenous Services queue (if appropriate), or
-   Multilingual Call (if appropriate)

All appropriate discussions and updates must be completed whilst the
customer is present.

Income managed customer initiated contact

In addition to their normal business, income managed customers may
contact the agency because they:

-   have received a letter advising them to contact to discuss
    commencing Income Management
-   have been advised or become aware their payments are subject to Auto
    Income Management
-   have had their payments suspended or cancelled because they failed
    to contact after being placed on Auto Income Management
-   are requesting to make Changes to Income Management priority needs
    including requests for a one-off payment
-   have been advised or become aware Income Management is due to end or
    has ended
-   are enquiring about Income Management but have not yet been assessed
    for Income Management

Role of Access Service Officers

In all instances, Access Services Service Officers should assist
customers with their Income Management enquiries utilising the resources
available. However, Initial Assessment interviews must be completed by a
specialised Service Officer and a suitable appointment must be booked
for these interviews.

The Resources page contains links to Office Locator, Customer Financial
Capability Branch and Income Management homepages.
