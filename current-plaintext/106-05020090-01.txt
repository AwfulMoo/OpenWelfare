This document outlines how the Seasonal Work Preclusion Period (SWPP) or
Seasonal Work Non-Benefit Period (SWNBP) can be waived, in part or in
full.

On this Page:

When the SWPP may be waived

The customer must confirm they are in severe financial hardship. The
hardship must be a result of unavoidable or reasonable expenditure and
incurred while they were subject to the preclusion or non-benefit
period.

The customer’s available funds have to be less than the equivalent of
one fortnightly payment at their maximum rate.

If the customer's available funds are greater than their maximum
fortnightly rate, the SWPP cannot be waived.

-   JobSeeker Payment (JSP)
