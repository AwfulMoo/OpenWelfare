This document outlines how to action a WIP – Practice Stream only
practice to become a PIP consenting practice. This action requires the
practice to be registered for both the WIP – Practice Stream and the
PIP.

PIP consenting practices

Practices can participate in the PIP and WIP – Practice Stream with
separate practice profiles.

Practices that do not consent to use PIP information for the WIP –
Practice Stream will:

-   be registered as non-PIP consenting
-   not share the same practice ID, and
-   make updates to practice details separately in their PIP and WIP –
    Practice Stream practice profiles

Incentive payments may be wrong if updates are not made to each profile.

owner or an authorised contact person must provide a written

-   Via email

The correspondence must include:
