Government intent

The Child Support Scheme was formed to assist separated parents to take
responsibility for the financial support of their children. The Child
Support Registrar administers the Child Support Scheme, which was
introduced by the Australian Government in 1988.

On 1 July 2011, the Australian Government Department of Human Services
began delivering the services and payments provided previously by the
Child Support Agency, Medicare Australia, Centrelink and the then Family
Assistance Office. Child Support became a service delivery brand within
the department.

On 1 February 2020, the Department of Human Services transitioned to
become the Australian Government agency Services Australia. This did not
change the operation of the Child Support Scheme.

The Child Support Scheme involves the assessment of child support in
accordance with a formula as well as the collection and enforcement of
court orders, child support agreements and child support assessments.
