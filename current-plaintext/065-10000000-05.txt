Multiple notifiable events

When a WP customer notified multiple events within 14 days and the first
notifiable event resulted in an adverse decision and the second
notifiable event resulted in a favourable decision which nullified the
earlier event, WP should not have been cancelled.

For an example that could also apply to WP, see the Resources page for
Partner Allowance (PA) qualification and savings provisions.

Determining if a cancelled WP can be restored or regranted

This table provides situations when Wife Pension (WP) has been cancelled
and indicates whether WP can be restored or regranted. As WP can no
longer be restored or regranted, these rules no longer apply from 20
March 2020. Customers will need to claim a new payment.
