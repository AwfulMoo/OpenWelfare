This document outlines information about the Aged Care Staff Portal
(ACSP).

Aged Care Staff Portal (ACSP)

Service Officers can use the Aged Care Staff Portal (ACSP) to:

-   process events and claims for home and flexible care services
-   search for services within all care types
-   register invoice amounts, report Commonwealth (CW) unspent amounts
    and view a care recipient’s home care account for home care purposes
    only
-   approve home care and flexible care claims
-   manage and request registration of service user details, and
-   manage and register service contact details

Note:

-   A flexible care service can either be a short-term restorative care
    or a transition care service
-   The processing of residential care events and claims must continue
    to occur in the System for the Payment of Aged Residential Care
    (SPARC)
-   This ensures the correct processing of aged care subsidies and
    supplements for all care types

Service Officers can use the ACSP via 2 different views - Service in
Context and Care Recipient in Context (CRiC). The Service in Context
view provides Service Officers information from a service’s perspective.
The CRiC view provides Service Officers a more holistic view from a care
recipient’s perspective compared to the Service in Context view. That
is, they are presented with care recipient information across their
journey within various aged care services.

To access the ACSP, Service Officers must have the relevant security
role in ESSentials and access to the relevant Tivoli Access Manager
(TAM) group.

The Process page describes how Service Officers can request access to
the ACSP and use the ACSP.

The Resources page contains question and answers about the ACSP, a link
to the ACSP and mySupport.
