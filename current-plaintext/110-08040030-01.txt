This document outlines notification period extensions granted by the
Secretary.

Extension of time

Where the Secretary of the Department of Social Services, or their
delegate, considers that it would be unreasonable for a customer to
notify within 14 days, the Secretary, or their delegate, may give
particular groups of customers up to 28 days to report changes.

For customers granted an extended notification period, the extended
period applies from the date of the event that led to them being granted
the extension.

Example: CIS customers have a 28 day notification period.
