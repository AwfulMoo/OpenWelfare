This document explains how to manage board and tuition charges, and
scholarship details for ABSTUDY secondary school students living away
from home and boarding at a school, hostel or in an approved ABSTUDY
Homestay arrangement.

Board, tuition and scholarship details

The rate of ABSTUDY for secondary school students who live away from
home and board at a school, in an approved ABSTUDY Homestay arrangement,
or at a hostel which is a signatory to the ABSTUDY Standard Hostels
Agreement, is affected by:

-   the annual amounts charged for board and tuition, and
-   the annual amount of any scholarship received that contributes
    towards board and tuition

Annual request

Each year on the last Monday of October, Services Australia sends an
email to ABSTUDY boarding schools and hostels asking for their annual
board, tuition and scholarship information for the next academic year.
If a response is not received by the due date, the previous year's
details will carry over into the next academic year. This could result
in incorrect ABSTUDY payments being issued.

Reviews and Manual Follow-up (MFU) activities

A review (Group Codes 3 and 5) with a due date of 1 February is created:

-   automatically for each ABSTUDY secondary boarding student
-   manually, as a MFU, when ABSTUDY is granted for a new academic year
    and the boarding and tuition fees were not known when the claim was
    processed

For more information, see Actioning Reviews and Manual Follow-ups (MFUs)
associated with End of Year (EOY) processing.
