MoC decision support template

Considering if a customer is a MoC - 5 factors

Further help for staff to guide staff in determining if a person is a
MoC or if SUOR circumstances continue.

Not all factors need to be present and a customer’s holistic
circumstances need to be considered after assessing the five factors

In determining the customer is no longer SUOR (a MoC), assessors must be
satisfied that indicators of a relationship outweigh the indicators that
no relationship exists

It is also important to remember that the presence of family and
domestic violence may indicate a customer is not a MoC and the SUOR
situation continues

An interview may be required to let the customer and the ex-partner
provide more information, give their perspective on the relationship and
any other supporting information they may have. For example, if:

-   the customer and ex-partner have provided conflicting information in
    forms, or
-   there is doubt about the validity of information received if the
    same handwriting has been used on both forms

|                                   |     example, mortgage repayments, |

|                                   |     would be reasonable to expect |
|                                   |     the ex-partner is paying for  |
|                                   |     board and/or lodgings; if     |
|                                   |     it’s a joint mortgage, it’s   |
|                                   |     reasonable to expect the      |
|                                   |     repayments are equally split. |

|                                   | -   If joint assets were          |
|                                   |     purchased, why did this       |
|                                   |     occur. Is this a reasonable   |
|                                   |     expectation or is the         |
|                                   |     purchase indicative of a MoC  |
|                                   |     relationship.                 |

|                                   |     exist, why does the customer  |
|                                   |     share the insurance policies. |

|                                   | maintain separate finances.       |
|                                   | However, most couples are likely  |
|                                   | to share finances in some way.    |

|                                   |     reasonable. For example,      |
|                                   |     affordability or is there     |
|                                   |     indications there may be a    |

|                                   |     ‘reasonable’. For example, if |

|                                   |     lease term is less than the   |
|                                   |     length noted, this may need   |
|                                   |     investigation. Or it may be   |
|                                   |     reasonable to continue        |
|                                   |     sharing because they can’t    |
|                                   |     afford to move out; they may  |

|                                   |     extended periods due to       |

|                                   |     reasonable. For example,      |

|                                   |     If so, this may need further  |
|                                   |     investigation to determine    |
