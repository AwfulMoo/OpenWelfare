This document outlines describes the process of accessing archived
Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) Scheme data using the Archiving
and Culling Engine (ACE) application.

Archiving AIC records

The general rules for archiving AIC records with service reasons EIC
(Assistance for Isolated Children person applicant) and EIS (Assistance
for Isolated Children student applicant) are:

-   The record must have been cancelled for 3 or more years
-   The record must not have a recent or unfinalised Debt, Appeal,
    Prosecution or Compensation activity

The Archive History (ARH) screen shows the benefit/s that have been
archived for a Customer Reference Number (CRN), and when the archiving
occurred.

Not all data for a 3 year old cancelled record is archived. Assessment
and Summary data is archived. No Person data or common Circumstance data
is archived, and this data is retained for use by other mainframe Income
Support Integrated System (ISIS) Common Platform Systems.

After a record has been archived, the data normally displayed on certain
Assistance for Isolated Children mainframe screens will be displayed in
a similar format in ACE.

The Resources page contains a link to the Archiving and Culling Engine
(ACE).
