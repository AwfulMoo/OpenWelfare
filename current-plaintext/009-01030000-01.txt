This document outlines information about referrals to organisations that
provide assistance to carers about various aspects of their caring role.

Making a referral

Any referral is voluntary and with the carer's consent. Any discussion
with the carer must be undertaken with sensitivity and with careful
consideration of the carer's circumstances.

The referral may be made as part of the new claim process, but can be
made at any other time the carer is in contact, including during
reviews.

The Resources page contains links to useful contact information for
carers.
