This document outlines what determines a customer's rate of Youth
Allowance (YA).

On this Page:

Rate of YA calculated individually

A person's rate of YA is calculated individually taking into account
their personal circumstances. The starting point for this calculation is
the maximum payment amount applicable to a person depending on:

-   their age
-   whether they are at home or away from home
-   whether they are partnered, and
-   whether they have dependent children

Circumstances that can affect the rate of YA

The following is a list of additional circumstances that can affect the
payment rate of YA:

-   Parental Means Test
-   personal income test
-   Student Income Bank
-   Australian Apprentice Income Bank
-   Working Credit
-   partner income test
-   whether a customer is transferring from other long-term income
    support payments
-   whether a customer's first language is not English and they are
    undertaking an approved course in English (as a second language)
-   whether job seekers receiving YA are subject to financial penalty
    for failing to meet a compulsory requirement
-   debt withholdings

-   Disability Support Pension (DSP) customers under 21 years of age, or
