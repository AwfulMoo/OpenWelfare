date the employer received the payment on the customer’s behalf

There is no liquid assets criteria for this event.

A customer who is in gaol or imprisoned is not eligible for the COVID-19
Disaster Payment.

If a customer’s employer has not allowed them to attend work and earn
their usual income, as they are not vaccinated against COVID-19, the
customer may be eligible if they meet all eligibility criteria.

Self-employed customers can have the same work and home address.

Customers involved in a trust or company

Customers who only derive their income from a trust or company
(distributions/dividends) are not eligible:

-   a customer must be working and due to the restricted movement be
    unable to work and therefore unable to earn an income
-   distributions/dividends will not count as employment as the
    restricted movement is not affecting their income

Company directors

A customer who is a company director, even when they draw a wage from
the business, cannot receive the COVID-19 Disaster Payment if the
business has received a state small business payment.

The customer may be eligible to receive the COVID-19 Disaster Payment
if:

-   the business has not received a state small business payment,
-   the customer draws a wage from the business, and
-   all other eligibility criteria is met

For help assessing eligibility:

-   see the scenarios
-   contact the Level 1 Helpdesk/Technical Peer Support (TPS)

Unable to work and earn usual income

To receive a payment, customers must be ‘unable to attend work and
therefore unable to earn their usual income due to a state public health
order for restricted movement’.

This means the customer cannot earn their usual amount of income from
any employer (existing or new).

That is, if a customer has lost income from an employer, but is able to
regain the same lost income from a new employer, they:

-   can attend work and earn their usual income, and
-   are not eligible to receive a payment

Reasons a person may be unable to attend work and earn their usual
income

A person may be unable to attend work and earn their usual income for a
number of reasons related to the restricted movement conditions. This
includes where customers:

-   are not permitted or unable to work from home
-   cannot attend work due to caring responsibilities
-   are not vaccinated against COVID-19
-   have an exemption from wearing a mask, however, cannot work because
    of a state public health order mandating mask wearing (this must be
    because of a state public health order and not because of a
    condition an employer has placed on a person’s employment)

Unable to attend work and therefore unable to earn their usual income
means the customer, in the relevant period, must have lost at least:

-   8 hours of work, or
-   1 full day of work

A full day of work does not need to be at least 8 hours.

For example: a customer normally works a 3 hour shift during the
relevant period and cannot attend that shift because of the restricted
movement. The customer meets the 'unable to attend work and therefore
unable to earn their usual income' criteria as they have lost 1 full day
of work in the relevant period.

If a customer does not lose 1 full day of work, they must lose at least
8 hours of work in the relevant period.

For example:

-   A customer normally works 1 x 10 hour shift during the relevant
    period. They work 5 hours of that shift. The customer does not meet
    the 'unable to attend work and therefore unable to earn their usual
    income' criteria as they have not lost at least 8 hours of work or 1
    full day of work in the relevant period
-   A customer normally works 2 x 10 hours shifts during the relevant
    period. They work 5 hours each day of those 2 shifts. The customer
    does meet the 'unable to attend work and therefore unable to earn
    their usual income' criteria as they have lost 10 hours of work in
    the relevant period

See payment amounts.

Relevant periods

-   Relevant period 1: 16-18 October 2021 inclusive

Staff must check a customer lives, works or was present in a relevant

To be eligible to receive a payment, the address must be in the blue
shaded area.

Present in

For income support payment customers - COVID-19 Disaster Payment, the
eligibility criteria covers whether a customer lives, works or has been
present in (visited) a relevant area.

The area must be:

-   declared a COVID-19 hotspot, and
-   under period of restricted movement

A second public health order:

-   is a state or territory public health order that restricts a
    person's movement, due to them being in a COVID-19 hotspot that was
    also under a restricted movement order at the time they were there,
    even if they are now in another location
-   includes stay at home orders, self-quarantine or mandatory
    (supervised) quarantine
-   can differ depending on the home state or territory

The address the customer was present in within the COVID-19 hotspot area
will be checked using the Geospatial tool to make sure the relevant area
was 'declared a COVID-19 hotspot' and is under a period of restricted
movement.

Earnings reporting

Customers must have reported income to either Centrelink or the
Department of Veterans’ Affairs:

At least once between 22 August 2021 and the start date of the relevant
period being claimed, or

Any time before the start date of the relevant period being claimed for,
where:

-   their income has not varied since 22 August 2021and the customer is
    not required to report income, or
-   self-employed and the last report was before 22 August 2021but the
    ongoing income was declared

Customers receiving Age Pension (Blind) or Disability Support Pension
(Blind) are not subject to earnings reporting for the income support
payment customers COVID-19 Disaster Payment.

Leave entitlements

To get the COVID-19 Disaster Payment, customers must not be receiving
pandemic related leave entitlements or will exhaust those entitlements
during the same relevant period.

Customers do not need to take:

accrued leave entitlements such as:

-   annual leave
-   long service leave
-   unpaid leave

leave they are not entitled to access if they have been stood down
without pay by their employer under the Fair Work Act, for example:

-   paid sick leave
-   carer’s leave
-   compassionate leave

However, if a customer is receiving any of the above leave types,
including pandemic related leave entitlements, during the entire
relevant period, they:

-   have not lost income, and
-   are not eligible to receive the income support payment customers -
    COVID-19 Disaster Payment

For unpaid leave, while the customer may have lost income, they would
not meet the ‘would have worked’ criteria. That is, if a person is on
unpaid leave, they would not have worked even if the restricted movement
did not occur.

If these leave entitlements do not cover the entire relevant period the
customer meets this eligibility requirement.

For example, if a customer has leave entitlements, including pandemic
related leave entitlements, that cover 3 days of the relevant period,
they meet this eligibility requirement. Note: the customer must meet all
eligibility requirements for at least 1 day in the remaining period.

Payment amount

If the customer is eligible, the payment amount is $200.

The payment cannot be paid pro rata. The customer must be paid the full
amount of $200.
