This document outlines the process for transferring undisbursed Income
Management funds to the General Ledger Account, also known as the
Official Public Account (OPA).

General Ledger Account

The General Ledger Account holds income managed funds which Services
Australia has been unable to disburse to a customer. Reasons for not
being able to issue income managed funds may include, but are not
limited to:

-   Customers not having a current bank account (for example a payment
    returned from a financial institution)
-   Customers who have an outstanding stale or stopped cheque, or
-   Deceased customers where the agency has not been able to locate
    their Legal Personal Representative (LPR) or appropriate person/s
    finalising the estate

Disbursement of funds prior to transferring to the General Ledger Account

The agency will attempt to contact a customer to determine how funds
should be disbursed before transferring funds to the General Ledger
Account.

Although these funds no longer display in a customer's Income Management
Account, a customer, or a deceased customer's LPR or appropriate
person/s finalising an estate, can access these funds by lodging a
Notice to prepare a Refund Account (SF030) form.

The Resources page contains links to the Income Management homepage, the
Financial Delegations table, and the Income Management Payments and
Contact Team (IMPACT), a link to the Notice to prepare a Refund Account
(SF030) form and a sample SF030.
