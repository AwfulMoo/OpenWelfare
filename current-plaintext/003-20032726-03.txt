There are no handoffs for CrP-NHE. All enquiries/claims must be actioned
at first point of contact engaging Main Business Line TPS support that
aligns with the customer’s payment type as needed.

For multiple and complex issues that need a professional assessment,
refer to a social worker after completing action required. For example
family and domestic violence.

For verbal claims for CrP-NHE where the customer is calling from a
service centre, flag with a Team Leader immediately. The service centre
can be advised of the health risk and take appropriate action.
