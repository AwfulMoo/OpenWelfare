Assessment of YA for the away from home rate due to excessive travel time

Travelling time is taken to be excessive if the journey from the
parental home to the approved activity or place of work by public
transport exceeds 90 minutes. This includes walking time and waiting
times between different modes of transport.

In certain cases, this will be obvious (for example, a customer leaves
Alice Springs to attend university in Darwin).

In many cases it will not, especially for travel within a metropolitan
area. In these instances, it would be necessary for the customer to
provide a detailed schedule of the journey.
