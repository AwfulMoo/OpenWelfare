|                                   | overpayment should be raised.     |

|                                   | The assessment should be based on |
|                                   | the customer's estimate of the    |
|                                   | value of the former home (and any |
|                                   | other real estate item) until a   |
|                                   | valuation is obtained. Unless the |
|                                   | delegate considers it warranted a |
|                                   | valuation should only be obtained |
|                                   | where total assets (including the |
|                                   | customer's estimate of real       |
|                                   | estate value) are within $20,000  |
|                                   | of the allowable assets limit.    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Note: overpayments should only be |
|                                   | raised if a customer has          |
|                                   | deliberately misrepresented the   |
|                                   | details of the asset.             |
