This document outlines the Initial Assessment interview held prior to a
customer commencing Income Management (IM).

On this Page:

Initial assessment interview

When a customer is identified for or referred for IM, they are sent a
letter requesting they contact Services Australia to arrange an Initial
Assessment interview.

An Initial Assessment interview is required to place a customer on any
measure of IM. In summary, the interview:

-   explains in detail how IM works
-   determines how their income managed funds can be best used to meet
    their priority needs and those of their family
-   provides information about other services which may assist them,
    including Centrepay
-   explains how they can request reviews of Income Management decisions

Documentation required

Customers should be advised to bring information about their regular or
known expenses to their Initial Assessment interview to assist in
setting up appropriate allocations. Recommended documentation:

-   utility and telephone bills to obtain provider details and account
    information
-   regular expense information, for example, food, clothing, school
    fees
-   details of any known future expenses, for example, motor vehicle
    registration, travel expenses
-   rent certificate or lease agreement. This should be provided if the
    customer wishes to pay rent to a head tenant or private landlord

Use of interpreters

Customers who have limited or no use of the English language or, are
deaf or hearing impaired, should have access to an interpreter for
Initial Assessment interviews.

A qualified interpreter should be used rather than a friend or relative.
For more information see Booking an interpreter for an appointment.

Failure to attend interview

If a customer does not attend an Initial Assessment interview within
their Income Management engagement period, IM will be automatically
applied to their payments.

If a customer still does not attend an Initial Assessment interview 28
days after Auto IM commences, their payment may be suspended.

Nominee arrangements

If a customer has a payment nominee who is not an excluded payment
nominee for income management purposes, the nominee must attend the
Initial Assessment interview as they are responsible for managing the
customer's payments.

Exemptions and exclusions

The Initial Assessment interview also provides information to eligible
customers about an exemption or exclusion from IM:

-   Exemptions: available to Disengaged Youth and Long Term Welfare
    Payment Recipients customers only. For more information, see
    Customers requesting an exemption from Income Management
-   Exclusions: available to automatically triggered Vulnerable Welfare
    Payment Recipients (VWPR Youth) customers only. For more
    information, see Exclusions for automatically triggered Vulnerable
    Welfare Payment Recipients (VWPR Youth) Income Management for
    Service Officers

All other measures are not eligible for an exemption or exclusion.
