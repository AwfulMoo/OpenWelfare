Compensation debts

Compensation debts are either 'compensation payer debts' or 'customer
debts'.

-   Compensation payer debts are repaid directly to Services Australia
    in one lump sum
-   For customer debts, the customer will negotiate the repayment of the
    debt with the Debt Recovery Team

Compensation recovery team (CRT)

The CRT recover compensation payer debts. The CRT can take appropriate
action if the debt is not fully repaid within 28 days.

Special circumstances

There are special circumstances provisions in the Social Security Act
1991 that will allow Services Australia to reduce a compensation debt or
preclusion period.

Debt waivers

Legally recoverable compensation debts are subject to consideration for
waiver. Test all waiver provisions that apply.

The waiver of a charge is dependent on the recoverable amount specified
in the Recovery Notice under section 1184.

Waivers, like any other decision, can be reviewed and changed.

Correcting compensation debts

Where a charge or an income debt has been recovered, the CRT will need
to ensure the customer's Payment Summary is adjusted and sent to the
customer.
