This document outlines the process where Carer Payment links between the
carer and care receiver records on Centrelink's computer system do not
exist.

Linking carer and care receiver

Since 1 July 1999, carer and care receiver records are linked. However,
the links between the two records were not automatically created at that
time. Links between the carer and care receiver have been created as the
customer's payment has come up for a review, however, if a customer has
been missed this procedure can be followed.

Where the carer and care receiver are not linked and the absence is for
Carer Payment, the absence cannot be coded.

The Resources page contains links to the Services Australia website for
publications for carers, and to the My Aged Care website for information
about Commonwealth Respite and Carelink Centres.
