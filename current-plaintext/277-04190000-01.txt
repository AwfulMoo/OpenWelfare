Employer debt

An employer owes a debt to the Services Australia if an amount is
payable to the Registrar under employer withholding (EW) by subsection
47(1) of the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988. The
agency is a priority creditor in insolvency processes for child support
deductions, not for penalties, costs or fines, and the insolvency agent
must be made aware of this.

Note: in this document the term insolvency process refers to
liquidation, administration or receivership. The term insolvency agent
refers to the person(s) in charge of the insolvency process. Specific
processes for each type of insolvency will be noted in this document
where relevant.
