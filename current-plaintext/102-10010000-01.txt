Cancellation, suspension and rejection codes

The Centrelink computer system requires a specific code when a decision
to cancel or suspend a payment, or to reject a claim, is recorded. A
description of the code is used in correspondence with customers.

The procedure that identifies the codes for the Newstart System (NSS)
includes codes for Austudy, JobSeeker Payment (JSP), Youth Allowance
(YA), and Special Benefit (SpB) paid under the various NSS payment
conditions.
