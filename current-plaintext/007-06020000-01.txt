This document provides information on cancelling and restoring Double
Orphan Pension (DOP) and rejecting DOP claims.

DOP processing

The DOP and Bereavement Smart Centre Processing Team action
cancellations and restorations of DOP.

Cancellation of DOP usually occurs when a customer or DOP child has a
change of circumstances that results in a loss of DOP qualification. The
DOP Smart Centre Processing staff complete reassessments or reviews of
entitlement that may result in cancellation of payment.

Restoration of DOP usually occurs when a customer has re-established
qualification for payment after cancellation.

Rejection of DOP claims

The process for rejecting a DOP claim is part of assessing eligibility
and coding the DOP claim. The claim can be automatically rejected based
on information coded on the system or manually rejected using one of the
DOP rejection codes.
