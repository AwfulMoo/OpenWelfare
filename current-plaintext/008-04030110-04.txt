Agreements and arrangements

The relationship between Services Australia and government departments
are bound by a high level multilateral strategic partnership document
and several detailed Bilateral Management Arrangements (BMA), each
between Services Australia and individual departments.

BMAs specify Commonwealth services to be provided by Services Australia
and conditions applying to the provision of those services. They improve
assurance arrangements to provide greater transparency over the agency's
performance in meeting service delivery outcomes, risk management and
accuracy targets.

See Department of Social Services (DSS) Relationship Team.
