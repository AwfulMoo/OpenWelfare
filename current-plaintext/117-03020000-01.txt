Periodic charge

A charge is the amount of social security payments to be repaid when a
customer receives a payment solely representing arrears of periodic
compensation.

An arrears of periodic charge cannot be calculated if:

-   paid with other components as part of a lump sum, or
-   paid after a person's death

Different rules apply to ABSTUDY for the treatment of compensation
payments.
