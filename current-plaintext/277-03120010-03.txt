Effective 16 December 2014, decisions cannot be made on COA applications
where the COA application was made after the assessment has ended for
the child.

This is a Family and Domestic Violence Interaction Point. If the
customer is with another person, on speakerphone, or already identified
with family and domestic violence concerns, continue with the current
business conversation. Otherwise, go to the Family and domestic violence
procedure to conduct the risk identification and referral process.
