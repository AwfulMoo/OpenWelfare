This document outlines the action required to complete Family Tax
Benefit (FTB) or Child Care Benefit (CCB) reconciliation for a customer
where the ATO provides Actual Income (AIN) which has not automatically
been applied to a customer’s record, and/or where large arrears or large
debts are generated.

Note: all CCB/CCR references relate to financial years prior to
2018/2019.

ATO Verified Income (#ATOVER)

Where ATO provides Actual Income (AIN) and reconciliation cannot
automatically complete on the customer and/or partner record, an #ATOVER
keyword is added and manual reconciliation is required to complete the
activity.

Often an additional keyword is also automatically added, giving the
specific reason that manual intervention is required to complete the
activity. Where no additional Manual Invention (MIV) keyword has been
added, reasons that manual reconciliation is required for #ATOVER
activities include:

-   if arrears or a debt is being calculated for a period outside of the
    reconciliation assessment, including those associated with income
    support payments. For example, arrears are being generated for a
    period FTB was prohibited (PIP’d) after a previous non-lodger debt
    is resolved
-   there is a change to an Newborn Supplement (NBS) and Newborn Upfront
    Payment (NBU) start date, altering from one financial year to
    another and NBS offsetting is being applied, and/or a NBU/NBS debt
    is calculated
-   an Assessment Warning and Error (AWE) error message or bug error is
    present
-   there is/was another started activity preventing reconciliation
    completion
-   maintenance income may be changing for a retrospective period

Large Arrears Amounts (#LGEARR)

Where the reconciliation calculation generates a large FTB arrears
amount equal to or greater than $10,000, a #LGEARR keyword is added and
manual reconciliation is required to complete the activity.

From September 2010 additional business rules were implemented to also
produce the #LGEARR keyword in the following circumstances:

Low Income Estimate:

-   A reconciliation which is completing on the basis of low income
    estimate income, that is an income estimate of less than $6001 for
    the customer and/or their partner as at 30 June (adequate income
    reason IUC, IU2 or IU3), or
-   Actual taxable income has been recorded for the previous financial
    year which was $6001 or more, and
-   A non-lodger exemption has not been recorded on the FAO
    Non-Lodgement Exemption (FNLE) screen for the relevant year

Note: adequate income reasons IUC, IU2 and IU3 only apply for financial
years prior to the 2015-16 financial year.

Child Support Agency Transaction:

-   A reconciliation activity that was triggered by a Child Support
    Agency transaction (*SP)

Large Debt Amounts (#LGEDBT)

Where the reconciliation calculation generates a large FTB debt amount
equal to or greater than $10,000, a #LGEDBT keyword is added and manual
reconciliation is required to complete the activity.

From September 2010 additional business rules were implemented to
produce the #LGEDBT keyword in the following circumstances:

Where a debt is equal to or over the debt threshold:

-   The #LGEDBT keyword is produced if the reconciliation activity was
    triggered by a Child Support Agency transaction (*SP)
-   The #LGEDBT keyword does not produce where the debt is a non-lodger
    debt
