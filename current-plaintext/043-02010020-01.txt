This document outlines information about employer registration for
Employer Reporting Service (ERS).

On this Page:

Purpose of ERS

Employers have the option to nominate to reply to requests for employee
payroll information using the ERS online on the Services Australia
Website. They can register online or by contacting the National Business
Gateway (NBG).

Employers are asked to provide payroll information for past or present
employee(s) for a specific period, including the Request for Employee
Information (SU658) form and/or a Request for Further Employee
Information (SU659) form.

Registration options for employers

Employers can register their details with Services Australia via
Centrelink Business Online Services (CBOS) on the Services Australia
Website.

Employers can register:

-   Online using a current Australian Taxation Office (ATO) digital
    certificate or AUSkey
-   Online without an ATO digital certificate or AUSkey
-   By phone by contacting the NBG
-   It should be noted that ATO digital certificates are being replaced
    by AUSkey so, when an employer's current ATO digital certificate
    expires, they will need to register for an AUSkey

The Resources page contains links to Request for Employee Information
forms and links to the Services Australia Website CBOS page and AUSkey
websites.
