This document outlines how Services Australia provides assistance when a
customer has recently arrived as a migrant, refugee, humanitarian
entrant or has been granted a Permanent Protection Visa to live in
Australia.

Government intent

Migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, particularly those with low
English proficiency or poor literacy in their own language, are among
our most vulnerable members of the community. They often have complex
needs, particularly in relation to health, welfare and language
services.

Services Australia, the Department of Health and Aged Care and the
Department of Home Affairs strive to meet the needs of migrants,
refugees and asylum seekers in the areas of government services, health
and education.

English language assistance

The Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP) provides free English language
courses to help eligible adults settle in Australia. AMEP is
administered by the Department of Home Affairs.

The program caters for the individual circumstances of the customer,
including the needs of customers living in rural and regional locations.

Case management

Specialised and Intensive Services (SIS) is a program designed to
provide specialised and intensive case management support for recently
arrived refugees and other humanitarian entrants who have complex needs.

The service will support refugees and humanitarian entrants where
pre-migration experiences, severe physical and mental health conditions,
or crisis events after arrival in Australia present significant barriers
to successful settlement.
