This document outlines how to identify instances where recipients of a
disability payment may have difficulty complying with their notification
requirements.

Notification provisions

People with a disability who receive payments must comply with their
notification requirements. Most customers have 14 days to notify
Services Australia of a change in circumstances. Exceptions apply to
Centrelink International Services (CIS) customers, and customers
notifying of bereavement events. In both these cases, the notification
period is 28 days.

Ability to comply

It is important to be aware of the type of disability, illness or injury
a person has and the impacts, as it may affect their ability to comply
with notification requirements. For example, an intellectual disability
may affect a customer's ability to remember to advise a change of
circumstances, or a physical injury may prevent a person from attending
an office. In these cases it may be necessary to offer the customer
alternative ways of complying with their notification obligations taking
into account their circumstances (for example, online services, phone,
fax, post, email, or by appointing a correspondence nominee).
