On this Page:

ACCS (Grandparent)

Additional Child Care Subsidy (ACCS) (Grandparent) is intended to
provide additional assistance with the cost of child care to principal
carer grandparents receiving an income support payment.

This support provides eligible customers with:

-   up to 100 hours per fortnight of subsidised care, and
-   a subsidy equal to 100% of the fee charged, up to 120% of the hourly
    rate cap

ACCS (Grandparent) is second in the hierarchy of ACCS payments.

General eligibility for ACCS (Grandparent)

A customer may be eligible for ACCS (Grandparent) if they are first
assessed as eligible for CCS and:

-   meet the definition of grandparent
-   receive an eligible income support payment, and
-   have 65% or more care of their grandchild, and
-   have substantial responsibility for the day to day decisions about
    the care and welfare of the child

Applying for ACCS (Grandparent)

There is no stand-alone verbal claim option for customers wishing to
apply for ACCS (Grandparent). Applications can be made:

-   at the time of completing an online or staff assisted claim for
    Child Care Subsidy (CCS). The ACCS (Grandparent) application is
    imbedded within the CCS claim. This means the ACCS (Grandparent)
    question set will present if responses in the CCS claim indicate
    they may be eligible for ACCS (Grandparent)
-   [] via the customer’s online account. Customers current on CCS who
    receive an income support payment and have at least one CCS child in
    care with a relationship of ‘grandparent’, will be presented with
    the Grandparent menu option in their online services

There is no separate offline (paper) application for ACCS (Grandparent),
however the FA084 Claim for Child Care Subsidy form includes the option
to apply for ACCS (Grandparent).

The Resources page contains links to the Department of Education, and
Services Australia websites, and a link to the FA084 Claim for Child
Care Subsidy form.
