|                                   | Bill advises gross annual income  |
|                                   | in July 2014 of $15,600 per annum |
|                                   | ($1,300 per month).               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Bill contacts on 15 October 2014  |
|                                   | and informs the gross income has  |
|                                   | increased to $1,500 per month.    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Bill has already received $1300   |
|                                   | per month for July, August and    |
|                                   | September. This is equal to       |
|                                   | $3,900.                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Bill will now receive $13,500     |
|                                   | ($1500 x 9) for the period        |
|                                   | October 2014 to June 2015.        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Therefore, the total gross income |
|                                   | for the financial year is $17,400 |
|                                   | ($3,900 + $13,500). The new gross |
|                                   | annual income to be coded from    |
|                                   | date of advice will be $17,400.   |
