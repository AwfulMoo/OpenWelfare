About your claim for Double Orphan Pension.

Before a claim for Double Orphan Pension can be assessed, we need to
determine if {Child's name} would be your Family Tax Benefit child and
the easiest way to do this is to make a claim.

You do not need to be paid Family Tax Benefit to receive Double Orphan
Pension, however the information obtained through the claim assists us
in determining eligibility and the amount of Double Orphan Pension you
may be entitled to.

To make a claim for Family Tax Benefit, sign into my.gov.au then select
Centrelink from your service list. If you do not have a myGov account or
Centrelink online account, you will need to create one and then link
them.

If you can't claim online you can print and complete a claim form and
take it to a service centre.

Please make sure you have your bank account details (including BSB and
account number), you and your partner's tax file numbers and income
details as these will be required to complete your claim.
