|                                   | intention of an order. Before     |

|                                   | court, a SSO may need to seek the |

|                                   | administer the order, they have   |
|                                   | the option to return to court.    |
|                                   | For example there may be an       |
|                                   | unemployment clause in an order   |
|                                   | that suspends a liability when    |
|                                   | the paying parent is unemployed.  |
|                                   | The order may state that the      |
|                                   | father is to advise Child Support |
|                                   | when he recommences work but      |
|                                   | there is nothing else in the      |
|                                   | order to define what is meant by  |
|                                   | ‘unemployed’. If the customers    |
|                                   | cannot agree on a definition, the |
|                                   | dissatisfied parent would need to |
|                                   | go to court to obtain a new       |
|                                   | order.                            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If all or part or the court order |
|                                   | is not administrable, go to Step  |
|                                   | 6 or Step 7, otherwise go to      |
