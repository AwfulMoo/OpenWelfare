| 1                                 | Autonomous customer in receipt of |

|                                   | in Australia had an initial       |
|                                   | portability interview for a       |
|                                   | temporary departure to Malta for  |

|                                   | The customer was not entitled to  |
|                                   | indefinite portability or other   |
|                                   | special portability for DSP but   |
|                                   | has been assessed as severely     |
|                                   | disabled. After 2 weeks, the      |
|                                   | customer returns the form AUS172  |
|                                   | which was endorsed by the Maltese |
|                                   | social security authority. As the |
|                                   | customer's autonomous portability |
|                                   | does not cease until 4 weeks in a |
|                                   | rolling 12 month period, a review |
|                                   | must be set to code the transfer  |
|                                   | to the Agreement with Malta from  |
|                                   | the date domestic entitlement     |
|                                   | ceases.                           |

|                                   | The customer was not entitled to  |

|                                   | special portability for DSP and   |
|                                   | has not been assessed as severely |
|                                   | disabled. After 8 weeks, the      |
|                                   | customer returns the form AUS172  |
|                                   | which was endorsed by the German  |
|                                   | social security authority and the |

|                                   | assessment. A decision is made    |
|                                   | that the customer is not severely |
|                                   | disabled. Under the Agreement     |
|                                   | with Germany a person who is not  |
|                                   | severely disabled can only meet   |
|                                   | the claim requirements if they    |
|                                   | are an Australian resident and in |
|                                   | Australia. As they are not in     |
|                                   | Australia at the date the         |
|                                   | transfer is required, the         |
|                                   | customer does not meet the claim  |
|                                   | requirements and cannot be        |
|                                   | transferred to the Agreement to   |

|                                   | record was suspended on departure |

|                                   | evidence of the flights. As the   |
|                                   | delegate was not satisfied the    |
