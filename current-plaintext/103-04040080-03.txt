This page contains information on the steps to take when using the
Payment Adjustment (PYAJ) screen.

Using the PYAJ screen

This table describes how to adjust a payment using the PYAJ screen. The
PYAJ screen should only be used to make payments if the system cannot
process refunds or if there are genuine system faults which prevent the
normal use of the system to make a payment.
