This document outlines how to check and update a customer's access to
Interactive Voice Response (IVR) self service reporting. It explains
codes and customer messages.

SSAF screen

Use the SSAF screen to:

-   check a customer's eligibility to report using self service IVR
-   turn off a customer's access to report using self service IVR
-   exclude a customer from reporting using self service IVR
-   turn on a customer's access to report using self service IVR

The SSAF screen does not affect a customer's general access to
Centrelink self service.

Under the business function:

-   exclusion codes exclude the customer from reporting via self service
-   information codes ensure the customer receives the correct messages
    or pathway when reporting

The Resources page explains SSAF exclusion codes, information codes and
'unable to report' messages.
