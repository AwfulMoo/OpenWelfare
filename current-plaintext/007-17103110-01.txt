This document outlines information relating to CCS and the school status
and age of an eligible child, and the exemptions available.

Advising of school status

Customers need to advise Services Australia on future and actual dates
when:

-   their child starts attending primary school
-   their child starts secondary school, and
-   any changes to these dates

They will be prompted to advise the future school start date for
children when claiming CCS.

Customers can update their child's school status by:

-   [] selecting the manage child education details service option from
    the Child Care menu in their online account, or
-   verbally updating the child's details by contacting the agency

When a child attends a centre-based day care service or an outside
school hours care service, the applicable hourly rate cap will depend on
whether the child is school aged or below school age.

A school aged child is a child who is:

-   in school, including being home schooled, or
-   6 or older

Preschool child

A preschool child is a child who is attending:

-   an early education program (such as a preschool or kindergarten
    program) offered at a centre based day care service
-   in the year that is 2 years before grade 1 of school

School child

A school child is a child who is:

-   attending primary school or secondary school, or
-   on a break from school (for example, school holidays) and will be
    returning to school after that break

A child is considered a school child from the day they first attend
school, not from the start of the calendar year. They remain a school
child during school holidays.

CCS eligibility for secondary school children

Customers need to advise when their child starts attending secondary
school as this may affect the child's eligibility for CCS. To be
eligible for CCS, the child must be aged 13 years or under and not
attending secondary school, or have an exemption.

Reminder notices are sent in January of the year a child turns 11, 12
and 13, asking information on:

-   their child's secondary school enrolment, and
-   the date the child is due to start

The child will be assessed as having no CCS entitlement from their 13th
birthday, if:

-   they turn 13 and there is no secondary school status recorded, and
-   a request for information was sent in the previous CCS year

If the customer has not advised the child secondary school status by the
child's 14th birthday, CCS will cancel. The customer must reclaim if CCS
has been cancelled due to child education level not met.

School age exemptions for CCS

While it is intended CCS is only available for children up to 13 years
and not attending secondary school, exemptions for CCS to apply after
the child's 13 birthday are available in certain circumstances.

To be eligible for a school status, and age and school exemptions:

-   it must be unreasonable for the child to be left unsupervised, and
-   a suitable adult over the age of 18 (this includes all other support
    networks, not just the parent/s or carers) is not available to
    provide the necessary care

An exemption must be sought prior to CCS cancelling due to the child's
education level

Requests for exemptions are assessed on a case by case basis.

If CCS has cancelled, the customer will need to reclaim.

School status exemption - children 13 years and under

An exemption is available for children 13 years or under attending
secondary school.

Customers must provide a Commonwealth statutory declaration form that:

-   states why it is unreasonable for the child to be left unsupervised,
    and
-   confirms there is no suitable adult over the age of 18 (this
    includes all other support networks, not just the parent/s or
    carers) available to provide the necessary care

If the child is 13 years or under with a disability and attending
secondary school, the customer will also need to provide evidence of the
child's disability which includes:

National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) participants number, or

evidence to support children with permanent or non-permanent conditions
or undergoing assessment (non NDIS participant): The child has, or is
undergoing an assessment for, one or more conditions:

-   listed in Schedule 1 of the Minister's Rules, as diagnosed by a
    medical practitioner
-   listed in Schedule 2 of the Minister's Rules, as diagnosed by a
    psychologist
-   referred to in Part 2 of Schedule 3 to the Disability Care Load
    Assessment (Child) Determination 2020 by a medical practitioner

The above additional evidence requirements are required for children 13
years or under with a disability, as they may be eligible for a longer
exemption than those without a disability.

Age and school status exemption - 14 to 15 years

An exemption is available for children 14-15 years with a disability or
medical condition attending secondary school.

Customers must provide a Commonwealth statutory declaration form that:

-   states why it is unreasonable for the child to be left unsupervised,
    and
-   confirms there is no suitable adult over the age of 18 (this
    includes all other support networks, not just the parent/s or
    carers) available to provide the necessary care

If the child is an National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS)
participant, the customer only needs to provide the child's NDIS
participants number.

If the child is not an NDIS participant, documentary evidence must be
supplied showing the child has a diagnosed medical condition:

-   listed in Schedule 1 of the Minister's Rules, as diagnosed by a
    medical practitioner
-   listed in Schedule 2 of the Minister's Rules, as diagnosed by a
    psychologist
-   referred to in Part 2 of Schedule 3 to the Disability Care Load
    Assessment (Child) Determination 2020 by a medical practitioner

Age and school status exemption - 16 to 18 years

For children who are aged 16, 17 or 18 years, exceptional circumstances
must also exist. It is not possible to provide a list of all the
circumstances which may meet the definition of exceptional. The
following list provides examples of what may be considered:

-   affected by domestic violence
-   experiencing serious illness or medical condition or hospitalisation
    preventing a customer (or partner) from working or caring for their
    child
-   experiencing serious mental health issues that prevent the customer
    (or partner) working or caring for the child
-   participating in a treatment or rehabilitation program to address
    substance abuse issues that prevents the individual working or
    caring for the child
-   impacted by significant trauma
-   experiencing short-term incapacity
-   attending a funeral or bereavement service or the resolution of an
    estate where long distance travel is required
-   responding to an emergency in their capacity as an employee (for
    example, SES during fires)
-   complying with a compulsory obligation imposed by the court (this
    covers undertaking community service, being on jury duty or being a
    witness)

Note: children with a disability or medical condition aged 16 to 18 who
are assessed as meeting the eligibility requirements, will be limited
for the period from their 16th birthday to the date they turn 19 or the
end of their final year of school, whichever comes first.
