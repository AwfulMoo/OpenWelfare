Practice Incentives Program (PIP)

The PIP aims to support general practices to continue providing quality
care, enhance capacity and improve access and health outcomes for
patients. Services Australia administers the PIP on behalf of the
Department of Health and Aged Care. The PIP is not a legislated program
and is delivered under program guidelines.

The PIP has 9 individual incentives:

-   After Hours Incentive supports general practices to provide their
    patients with appropriate access to after-hours care
-   eHealth Incentive encourages general practices to keep up to date
    with digital health and adopt new health technology
-   General Practitioner Aged Care Access Incentive encourages General
    Practitioners (GPs) to provide increased and continuing services in
    Australian Government funded residential aged care facilities
-   Indigenous Health Incentive supports general practices and
    Indigenous health services to provide better healthcare for
    Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients, including best
    practice management of chronic disease
-   Procedural General Practitioner Payment encourages GPs in rural and
    remote areas to maintain local access to surgical, anaesthetic and
    obstetric services
-   Quality Improvement Incentive rewards practices for participating in
    and reporting on continuous quality improvement activities in
    partnership with their local Primary Health Network
-   Rural Loading Incentive provides an additional loading for PIP
    practices in rural and remote areas, based on their Rural, Remote
    and Metropolitan Areas (RRMA) Classification
-   Teaching Payment encourages practices to provide teaching sessions
    to undergraduate and graduate medical students preparing to enter
    the Australian medical profession
-   PIP COVID-19 Vaccine General Practice Incentive supports PIP
    practices participating in Australia’s COVID-19 Vaccine National
    Rollout to provide continuity of care and deliver two doses of a
    COVID-19 vaccine to their patients
