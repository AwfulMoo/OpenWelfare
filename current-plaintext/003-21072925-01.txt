This document explains the explanation of decision (review) process for
the COVID-19 Disaster Payment and Income support payment customers -
COVID-19 Disaster Payment.
Note: Do not use this document if there is an error with an automatic
payment.

Review

There is no time limit to request an explanation of a decision.

If a customer does not understand or does not agree with the reason/s
for a Services Australia decision, they can ask for an explanation of
the decision.

A Suitably Skilled Officer will provide an explanation of the decision.

The Suitably Skilled Officer will:

-   investigate the decision
-   correct any identified errors
-   undertake any reassessment, and
-   contact the customer to explain the decision

No further appeal can be considered by:

-   an Authorised Review Officer (ARO), or
-   the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT)

When a customer has advised of a change in circumstances and the
customer should have received the higher rate of payment, (for example,
the customer was paid $450 but should have been paid $750), if the
customer:

-   has not advised of a change in circumstances within 14 days, a
    review by a Suitably Skilled Officer is needed
-   has advised of a change in circumstances within 14 days, a review by
    a Suitability Skilled Officer is not needed

For Abridged customer claims, customers must meet 2 further requirements
if advising of a change of circumstances within 14 days. They must:

-   previously have received an automatic payment at the higher rate,
    and
-   make a declaration of actual hours lost making them eligible for the
    higher rate

If the abridged customer claim does not meet these 2 requirements, a
review is needed.

If, following an explanation of a decision, staff identify a customer
has a change in circumstances and automatic payments need to stop, see
COVID-19 Disaster Payment - automatic payment and change of
circumstances.
