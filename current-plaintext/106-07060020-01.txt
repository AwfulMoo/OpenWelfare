This document outlines how customers can provide their TFN when claiming
a payment.

TFN application forms

A TFN lets Services Australia match and compare details with the
Australian Taxation Office. This helps the agency to pay customers the
correct rate based on their payment type.

Customers can apply for a TFN using:

-   Tax file number - application or enquiry for individuals (NAT 1432),
    or
-   Tax file number - application or enquiry for Aboriginal and Torres
    Strait Islander people (NAT 1589)

For more details on the Tax file number - application or enquiry for
individuals living outside Australia (NAT 2628) form, see Provision of
Tax File Number (TFN) for family assistance and Paid Parental Leave
scheme payments. Note: customers must lodge these forms with the
Australian Taxation Office (ATO).

Customers, who live in Australia and their partners, must give a valid
TFN to get a:

-   Centrelink payment, or
-   Commonwealth Seniors Health Card (CSHC)

Customers must give their parents or guardians TFN if they want to
claim:

-   Dependent Youth Allowance (YA), and
-   ABSTUDY, See TFN for ABSTUDY

A customer's claim for a social security payment will reject if they:

-   do not provide their TFN
-   do not provide evidence of a TFN application, or
-   are not eligible for a TFN exemption

TFN when making a new claim

A customer will need to provide a TFN statement in writing when:

-   asked for on an online claim
-   asked for on an approved form, or
-   they get a notice asking for their TFN

Customers will not need to provide their TFN if:

-   they have been on a social security payment, and
-   their TFN is on record

Refugees and non-resident spouse

See Obtaining a TFN for newly arrived refugee customer if a customer:

-   is a newly arrived refugee claiming Family Tax Benefit (FTB), and
-   authorises Services Australia to get a TFN online

Note: customers cannot get FTB until they provide their TFN.

Use the ATO's Online Individual Auto Registration Tool for customers
with:

-   humanitarian, or
-   refugee sub-class visas

When a customer's partner applies for a TFN as a non-resident spouse,
see Helping customers obtain a Tax File Number (TFN) for family
assistance.

For customers issued with humanitarian or refugee sub-class visas, the
preferred method of obtaining a TFN is via the ATO's Online Individual
Auto Registration tool. See the Resources page for a link to the
Individual Auto Registration tool.

ABSTUDY and Commonwealth Seniors Health Card (CSHC)

This procedure does not apply to customers who need a:

-   TFN for ABSTUDY
-   TFN for Commonwealth Seniors Health Card (CSHC)

ATO proof of identity documents

If a customer does not have enough identity documents for ATO
requirements, see Insufficient identity provided, Step 3 in Table 2.

Note: ATO proof of identity documents differ to Identity Confirmation
documents required for Centrelink payments and services.

For a list of ATO identity codes and accepted document types, see the
Resources page.
