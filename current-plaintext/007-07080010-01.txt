This document outlines that taxable income is one of the components of
adjusted taxable income (ATI) used for Family Tax Benefit (FTB), Child
Care Subsidy (CCS), Stillborn Baby Payment (SBP), Parental Leave Pay
(PPL) and Dad and Partner Pay (DAP).

ATO assessment

Taxable income is income as assessed by the Australian Taxation Office
(ATO). If families are unsure if income is taxable, or if they need to
lodge a tax return, or need advice about other income for example,
reportable fringe benefits (including any exempt reportable fringe
benefit amounts), they should visit the ATO website for more
information.

Generally, taxable income includes assessable pre-tax income received by
the person, less any expenses incurred in receiving that income. The ATO
allows deductions for total net investment losses, but for family
assistance purposes the loss amount is recorded separately and is added
to their adjusted taxable income (ATI). Tax-free pensions and benefits,
reportable fringe benefits (including exempt reportable fringe
benefits), reportable superannuation contributions and tax exempt
foreign income and income earned overseas that is not taxable in
Australia are also included separately in ATI.

ATO link for FTB and CCS

For individuals required to lodge an income tax return, the ATO
transfers actual ATI details to Centrelink for FTB/CCS reconciliation
and lump sum claims after the end of the relevant financial year, with
the exception of tax-free pensions and benefits, foreign income and
deductable child maintenance expenditure.

A person's actual taxable income is the amount written on their Notice
of Assessment (NoA) sent by the ATO after the person's income tax return
has been assessed. Note: income details reported by the ATO will
automatically have amounts released under the First Home Super Saver
(FHSS) Scheme or COVID-19 early release of super excluded, as these do
not form part of a customer's ATI. However, for these customers the
taxable income amount on their NoA may be higher than the amount
reported by the ATO via the data link on our system as the ATO does
regard a portion of the released funds as taxable.

If they are not required to lodge an income tax return, for example,
their income is below the tax threshold and they have not had tax
withheld, they must tell Services Australia and provide an estimate of
their ATI. This must include all taxable income they will receive in the
financial year. A loss is treated as zero taxable income.

Low estimate or employment change electronic messages

Single Touch Payroll (STP) is an Australian Taxation Office (ATO)
initiative where employers submit payroll data to the ATO with each pay
event. Where a customer is a mutual client of Centrelink and the ATO,
the ATO will share the customer’s STP data with Services Australia.

STP data helps identify customers at risk of underestimating their
annual income. Electronic reminders (SMS or email) are sent to
identified customers prompting them to check the accuracy of their
family income estimate. This reduces the likelihood of a Family Tax
Benefit (FTB) overpayment at reconciliation time.

Customers who are confident their estimate is accurate do not need to do
anything. The messages are a prompt only.

A document will show on the customer's record if they received an
electronic message and detail the reason it was sent. A customer can be
selected for multiple reasons. Staff can view this document:

assistance payments contains customer scenarios and electronic messaging
examples.
