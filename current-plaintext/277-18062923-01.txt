This procedure contains instruction for WA Ex-nuptial child support
cases only.

This document outlines information about identifying and managing the
recovery of payee overpayments and other kinds of payee debts. It also
outlines information about creating a consolidated revenue debt.

Definition of overpayment

Overpayments occur when the payee receives funds in satisfaction of a
payer’s child support liability to which they were not or are no longer
entitled due to a change to their child support entitlement.

Recoverable overpayments

Not all overpayments are recoverable, including:

-   section 107 order
-   assessment ends from the start date due to objection, AAT first
    review decision or court order
-   payer has not met their legal obligation

At the end of 2012 a new policy was introduced to prevent overpayments
being recovered that resulted from:

-   the late lodgement of tax returns or failure to comply on time with
    the requirements for the non-lodgement of tax returns
-   the payer's failure to advise an address change which results in a
    delayed residency decision and subsequent terminating event

This policy can be applied to the remaining amount of overpayment that
occurred in the past.

Other types of payee debt

Other payee debts occur when:

-   a retrospective variation creates an excess non-agency payment (NAP)
    credit
-   money received from a third party in error is disbursed to the payee
-   the ATO requests the repayment of a tax refund intercept payment
    (TRIP)

For more information on types of overpayments see the Child Support
Guide 5.5.5: Overpayments.
