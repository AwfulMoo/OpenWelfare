This page contains an outline of the common circumstances under which
Child Support will end a child support case without a request from the
receiving parent.

Ceasing child support

This table describes some of the common circumstances under which child
support payments may be ceased without a request from the receiving
parent.

Note: a customer reconciling or commencing a de facto relationship with
the child's other parent is not a terminating event for child support
until the parents are reconciled or in a relationship for 6 months or
more. Prior to the 6 month mark, customers have the choice of:

-   suspending the child support case for 6 months
-   ending the child support case

There are other circumstances where a Family Tax Benefit (FTB) customer
may voluntarily end a child support assessment.

|                                   | If an exemption is backdated, the |
|                                   | other issue for FTB is how to     |
|                                   | treat amounts of child support    |
|                                   | paid/received for the period of   |
|                                   | the exemption.                    |

|                                   | Amounts of child support paid     |
|                                   | after the case end date would     |
|                                   | most likely occur in cases where  |
|                                   | the paying parent is no longer    |
|                                   | considered a parent of the child. |
|                                   | For example, where Child Support  |
|                                   | has implemented a court           |
|                                   | declaration that the paying       |
|                                   | parent is not the parent and the  |
|                                   | assessment is ended from the      |
|                                   | start date.                       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If a section 107 order is made    |
|                                   | through the court, which deems    |
|                                   | the paying parent not to be the   |
|                                   | parent of a child, the child      |
|                                   | support case is ended from the    |
|                                   | start date of the case. In this   |
|                                   | situation, the payee may incur a  |
|                                   | child support overpayment due to  |
|                                   | the backdated case end. Where the |
|                                   | 'payee' is required to repay any  |
|                                   | amount of the child support, the  |
|                                   | amounts repaid will need to be    |
|                                   | removed from the MIT calculation  |
|                                   | in order for the FTB to be        |
|                                   | reassessed.                       |
