This document explains the processes for deciding if a Job Seeker
Compliance Model Unemployment Non-Payment Period (UNPP) applies because
of voluntary unemployment, or dismissal because of misconduct for a
Community Development Program (CDP) job seeker /new claimant. It also
explains if UNPP applies when to reinstate the payment under hardship
provisions.

Reasons for applying a UNPP

A UNPP applies when a CDP job seeker:

-   voluntarily ceases suitable employment without a reasonable excuse
-   is dismissed from suitable employment due to misconduct as a worker,
    or
-   does not commence suitable work for which relocation assistance has
    been paid

When a CDP job seeker does not commence suitable work and they were not
paid relocation assistance for that job, a serious failure may apply.

Duration and start date of UNPP

When a decision is made to apply a UNPP, unless the CDP job seeker is
eligible for payment under hardship provisions, participation payments
will not be payable, for a period of:

-   8 weeks or
-   12 weeks for a CDP job seeker who leaves or fails to commence a
    suitable job offer after receiving relocation assistance through
    their provider

The start date of the UNPP will depend on whether the CDP job seeker was
receiving a participation payment at the time they became unemployed.

-   If the CDP job seeker was not in receipt of a participation payment
    at the time they became unemployed, the UNPP commences from the date
    the CDP job seeker became unemployed
-   If the CDP job seeker was receiving a participation payment at the
    time they became unemployed, the UNPP commences from the date that
    is more beneficial, either the date of unemployment or the start
    date of the instalment period following the date the determination
    is made that a UNPP applies

Serving a UNPP with other waiting periods or exclusion periods

A UNPP may be served concurrently with other waiting periods including:

-   Liquid Assets Waiting Period (LAWP)
-   Income Maintenance Period (IMP)
-   Seasonal Workers Preclusion Period (SWPP)
-   Moving to an Area of Lower Employment Prospects (MALEP)

When other waiting or exclusion periods extend beyond a UNPP, there is
no requirement to proceed with the UNPP investigation.

MALEP and UNPPs

When a job seeker has left work voluntarily (or is unemployed as a
result of misconduct) and Moved to an Area of Lower Employment Prospects
(MALEP) both a UNPP and a MALEP must be considered. Any periods of the
UNPP and MALEP exclusion period that overlap can be served concurrently.

Note: MALEP should not be investigated when a CDP job seeker:

-   leaves work voluntarily or becomes unemployed due to misconduct
-   they received relocation assistance to start the job, and
-   they are remaining in the location for which they were paid
    relocation assistance

MALEP may apply if the CDP job seeker moves to a new location after they
become unemployed. See Moving to an Area of Lower Employment Prospects
(MALEP) employment related exclusion period.

Mutual obligation requirements and reporting during UNPP

Job seekers who are serving a UNPP are not required to comply with
mutual obligation requirements and are not required to report for the
duration of a UNPP.

Responsibility for investigating a UNPP and determining hardship provisions

The responsibility for investigating a UNPP is dependent on various
factors including how the customer became unemployed and when the UNPP
was identified.

Service Officers who apply a UNPP are also responsible for:

-   determining whether a CDP job seeker is eligible for payment under
    hardship provisions during a UNPP, and
-   ending the UNPP if hardship provisions apply

The assessment of hardship may occur either during the course of
finalising the determination to apply a UNPP or at any stage while the
CDP job seeker is serving the UNPP.

UNPP hardship provisions

Payment may be reinstated during a UNPP under hardship provisions if a
CDP job seeker:

-   falls within a class of person specified by the Secretary of the
    Department of Education, Skills and Employment, and
-   is severe financial hardship as a result of the UNPP

Class of person specified by the Secretary of Department of Education, Skills and Employment

For the purposes of reinstating payment during a UNPP, a CDP job seeker
is in a class of person specified by the Secretary of Department of
Education, Skills and Employment when they meet at least 1 of the
following conditions:

-   have significant family and caring responsibilities, including
    persons with a dependent child
-   have an illness, impairment or condition that requires treatment and
    cannot afford this treatment after meeting their essential expenses
-   have a diagnosed cognitive, neurological, psychiatric or
    psychological impairment or mental illness
-   do not have access to safe, secure and adequate housing or are using
    emergency accommodation or refuge

Severe financial hardship

Severe financial hardship means a CDP job seeker who:

-   has a dependent child or is a member of a couple with liquid assets
    below $5000 (including partner's liquid assets)
-   is not a member of a couple and has liquid assets below $2,500

Making payment under hardship provisions

CDP job seekers can test their eligibility for payment under hardship
provisions at any time during a UNPP. If a CDP job seeker doesn't
initially qualify due the level of their liquid assets, they can
approach Services Australia at any time during the UNPP for reassessment
of hardship. The rules that relate to unavoidable or reasonable
expenditure for the Liquid Assets Test do apply in these situations.

When a CDP job seeker, being a class of person assessed as eligible for
payment under hardship provisions, payment will be reinstated from the
later of:

-   commencement of the UNPP, or
-   the date the CDP job seeker requested the assessment of eligibility
    for hardship provisions, and met the eligibility criteria

When payment is reinstated under hardship provisions, the CDP job seeker
will be required to comply with mutual obligation requirements,
including the requirement to connect with the CDP provider unless an
exemption is granted.

The Resources page contains scenarios to help determine the appropriate
start date for a UNPP.
