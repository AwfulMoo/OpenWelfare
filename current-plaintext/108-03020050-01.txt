This document explains how to record the details on the CRIA screen.

Non-customer CRIA Test

All non-customer care receivers are subject to the non-customer CRIA
test. However, there are some exceptions. This procedure gives details
about the non-customer CRIA test, as well as who is exempt from those
tests.

CRIA screen

The CRIA screen is used to record income and asset details of:

-   non-income support single adult care receivers
-   non-income support partnered adult care receivers regardless if
    their partner is or is not receiving an income support payment, and
-   all child care receivers

The CRIA screen needs to be coded for:

-   new claims
-   adult and child care receiver’s income and asset reviews, and
-   restorations of payments

Child care receivers are all subject to the CRIA test without exception,
and the CRIA screen should be coded.

Adult non-customer care receivers not subject to the CRIA test

Adult non-customer care receivers are not subject to the non-customer
CRIA test if they:

-   are a higher Adult Disability Assessment Tool (ADAT) score adult who
    is receiving a social security pension or benefit, or a DVA Income
    Support Payment
-   would be eligible to receive such a payment but for the sole reason
    that they have not been an Australian resident for a long enough
    period

In these cases, the CRIA screen does not need to be coded.

The Resources page has links to the Carer Payment Income and Assets
details of the person being cared for 16 years and over (SA304a) and
Carer Payment Income and assets details - child being cared for - under
16 years (SA304c).
