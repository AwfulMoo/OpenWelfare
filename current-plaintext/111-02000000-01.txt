This document outlines processes to be followed when locating and
retrieving archived information in relation to Centrelink payments and
services.

Purpose and functions

Services Australia is required to keep customer information for a
certain period of time so that data can be accessed for the purposes of
appeals, audits or investigation of debts. Some information may relate
to payments previously administered by other departments.

The Archive Systems team undertakes these functions:

-   providing support for archiving of data
-   culling data that has been archived and is no longer required online
-   culling dispensable data
-   automated production of culling lists for paper customer files
-   providing support for the Archiving and Culling Engine (ACE),
    including new archives - this engine provides the facilities to
    archive data from any source system, hold it in an archive storage
    database, and retrieve the archived data over Centrenet
-   dealing with Customer Archive Retrieval (CAR) requests
