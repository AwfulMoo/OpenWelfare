Step parents policy advice

Note: the advice below is also the intention of ABSTUDY Policy and
applies to ABSTUDY customers.

Step-parent is the married or de facto partner of the parent who has
primary care and responsibility of the dependent Youth Allowance or
ABSTUDY customer. For Youth Allowance customers, the definition is found
in the Social Security Act 1991, section 5(1), Family relationships
definitions - children. For ABSTUDY customers, the term 'parent' is
defined in the Glossary of the ABSTUDY Policy Manual.

The income of the step-parent will be included in the Parental Income
Test for the purposes of determining the rate of Youth Allowance or
ABSTUDY Living Allowance for a customer where the step-parent lives with
the parent and the customer normally lives with the parent and
step-parent. The earliest that this may be applied is from the date that
the parent and step-parent normally live together and this may include
the event occurring while the customer is absent from the home but
normally lives with the parent.

Normally lives with means that the customer's normal home is the same as
the parent and step-parent. The customer may live away from home for the
purposes of undertaking study, to search for work and/or undertake other
activities but still not establish their own permanent and separate home
that is, they intend to return home.

However, should they have established a separate home with no intention
of returning, other than for a visit, then it may be accepted they do
not normally live at home, subject to verification. Whether or not the
customer has ever normally lived with the step-parent, once they cease
to normally live at home is irrelevant and for the purposes of the
Parental Means Test the step-parent's means should not be included.

It is possible that over a period of time the customer may claim to move
in and out of the parent/step-parent's home on a permanent basis and if
proper verification process is applied each time then there is no
impediment to such a change in circumstances being applied.
