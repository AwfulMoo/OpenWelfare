This document outlines the procedures relating to Fares Allowance (FAA)
for ABSTUDY.

Purpose of FAA

The purpose of FAA is to cover the cost of specific travel for students
who need to live away from home to attend study or to participate in an
approved Away from Base activity. This allows the student to participate
fully in the approved course while maintaining contact with his/her home
community. Persons other than students may also be eligible for FAA in
specified circumstances. FAA is not paid for daily travel between the
student’s study residence and the education institution.

Students who may be eligible for FAA

FAA may be available to the following students:

-   full-time and concessional study-load secondary and tertiary
    students eligible for the Away from Home Rate
-   full-time and concessional study-load independent and pensioner
    students who need to study away from their permanent home
-   full-time and concessional study-load Masters and Doctorate students
    (instead of Relocation Allowance)
-   full-time and concessional study-load students and part-time
    students to attend an approved Away From Base activity
-   full-time and concessional study-load secondary students in State
    Care who are eligible to live away from home but are not eligible
    for Away from Home Rate of Living Allowance

An Australian Apprentice is not entitled to FAA for the Australian
Apprenticeship.

Travel available to qualified students and approved travellers

The types of specified travel that may be available to qualified
students and approved travellers include:

-   Travel at commencement and end of study period
-   Tertiary or secondary non-schooling semester travel
-   School vacation travel
-   Compassionate travel
-   Away from Base travel
-   Examination travel
-   Graduation travel
-   Non-student travellers
-   Masters and Doctorate travel for ABSTUDY
-   Orientation or Special Purpose visit travel
-   Emergency and disaster travel

In some circumstances, other people may also be entitled to FAA,
including:

-   parents/guardians
-   a family member or community member with significant ties to the
    student
-   a students' dependant/s
-   an education institution representatives

Note: some restrictions apply to eligibility for assistance to travel
interstate.

Cost of transport

The mode of transport approved for fares will normally be the most
practicable and cost effective for the journey, and reasonable in the
circumstances. ABSTUDY FAA assistance is normally available between the
permanent home and the study location, although travel to another
destination other than the permanent home or usual study location can be
available in certain circumstances. See Determining the appropriate
travel destination for ABSTUDY Fares Allowance (FAA).

Claiming FAA

In most cases, students will have their fares booked by Services
Australia in advance. A student may however, choose to pay their own
fare and seek reimbursement from Services Australia. In these cases, an
amount equivalent to the cost normally incurred by Services Australia
(rather than the full cost incurred by the student) may be reimbursed.

Tertiary, independent and pensioner students, and non-student
travellers, for example supervisors, who 'no show' on travel organised
by Services Australia will be penalised for not undertaking the booked
travel, and in some cases, travel for that journey may not be authorised
in advance.
