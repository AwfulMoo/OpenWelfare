FTB reconciliation and ATO lodgement scenarios

Table 2

From the 2012-13 financial year, customers have until the end of the
lodgement year to meet requirements for FTB reconciliation. An extension
may be granted if there were special circumstances that prevented them
from meeting the relevant requirement by the end of the lodgement year.

For 2011-12 and earlier financial years, customers had 2 years after the
end of an entitlement year to meet requirements for FTB reconciliation.
