This document outlines the use of the SA369 to assess a customer's
entitlement to an Income Support Payment (ISP) or Farm Household
Allowance (FHA). It helps find out if more information and investigation
is needed and asks the customer to give supporting documents to confirm
their income and assets.

Information about Income and Assets (SA369)

The SA369 forms part of the new claim process. It asks questions about
the customer's income and assets. If a customer has a partner, the
income and assets details for both the customer and their partner are
obtained even if the partner is not claiming.

If the claim has been completed using the Assisted Customer Claim (ACC)
process it includes all the questions from the SA369 and produces a list
of supporting documents needed to verify the income and asset details
declared in the claim.

Alternatively, if the Age Pension claim pack was issued using the First
Contact Concessions, Carers and Seniors (FCCCS) workflow it may contain
a pre-populated Income and Assets (SA415) instead of an SA369. The claim
for Carer Payment (CP) and Carer Allowance (CA) claim pack may instead
include a pre-populated Income and Assets (SA414).

For FHA claims, see:

-   Claiming Farm Household Allowance (FHA)
-   Assessing assets for Farm Household Allowance (FHA)
-   Assessing income for Farm Household Allowance (FHA)

Note: the Income and Assets (Mod iA) can be accepted instead of the
SA369 form normally sent with a pension claim, as the question set and
supporting documents meet the claim requirements.
