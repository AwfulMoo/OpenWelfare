|                                   | This example shows the            |
|                                   | calculation for 1 week of care.   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A similar calculation would occur |
|                                   | for each week of child care where |
|                                   | a customer had a current CCB fee  |
|                                   | reduction in force. A total       |
|                                   | result for the relevant financial |
|                                   | year would be calculated.         |

|                                   | Jennie lodged an estimated income |
|                                   | in order to receive CCB as a fee  |
|                                   | reduction for 2013-14. Based on   |
|                                   | the estimate, Jennie's CCB        |
|                                   | percentage was 50%.               |

|                                   | In the week ending 13 April 2014, |
|                                   | child Mike was in care for 50     |

|                                   | Care Centre. Mike is a non-school |
|                                   | child. Little Treasures charges   |
|                                   | $300 per week for full time care  |
|                                   | of 50 hours per week.             |

|                                   | day care for 2013-14 is $3.99.    |
|                                   | The part time % is 100% as Mike   |
|                                   | was in full time care for the     |
|                                   | week. The schooling % is 100% for |
|                                   | a non-school child.               |
