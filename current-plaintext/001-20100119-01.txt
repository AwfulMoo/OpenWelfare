This document outlines how the coronavirus (COVID-19) response impacts
on processes and mutual obligation and participation requirements. The
government may declare certain areas have reduced or suspended mutual
obligation due to COVID-19.

Reduced Requirements

Reduced, or altered, mutual obligation requirements may apply to job
seekers and ParentsNext participants (hereafter referred to as job
seekers) in response to COVID-19 outbreaks or other risks arising from
the COVID-19 pandemic. These arrangements may apply to customers in
receipt of:

-   JobSeeker Payment (JSP)
-   Youth Allowance (YA) (other)
-   Parenting Payment (PP) for a single customer (when their youngest
    child turns 6)
-   Parenting Payment and are a compulsory ParentsNext participant
-   Special Benefit (SpB) (Nominated Visa Holders)

In response to COVID-19 outbreaks, the Government may choose to alter
(or suspend) mutual obligation requirements for job seekers. This may be
applied or removed from multiple locations either separately or
concurrently at any time. If this occurs, specific rules will apply
based on a job seeker's geographical location, such as State / Territory
and/or by postcode.

When a job seeker changes address, reduced mutual obligation
requirements will automatically apply if they move into a relevant area.
Reduced mutual obligation requirements will automatically cease if they
move out of the relevant area.

All job seekers, regardless of geographical location, may also be
eligible for other COVID-19 specific arrangements (e.g. exemptions from
mutual obligation requirements due to COVID-19).

The Resources page contains exemption codes and links to external
websites for further coronavirus (COVID-19) details.
