This document outlines the process of triaging documents using the KOFAX
system.

The KOFAX system

The KOFAX system will sort documents received through fax and/or email.
This includes documents:

-   manually scanned, or
-   forwarded by email

The KOFAX system can filter out work items for other services managed by
Services Australia.

All documents are kept as electronic files.

The KOFAX Validation application

Use the KOFAX Validation application to:

-   classify documents. This is when the system does not do this
    automatically
-   correct, validate and verify batch data

This application will assign documents to the relevant work type.

KOFAX Document Review application

Use the KOFAX Document Review application to:

-   split
-   merge
-   rotate, or
-   reorder pages

This application will assign documents to the KOFAX Validation
application.

The Resources page has Multi-Functional Device (MFD) scanning errors and
resolutions and KOFAX application keyboard shortcuts.
