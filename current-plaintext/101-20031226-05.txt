|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Elsa is receiving Age Pension,    |
|                                   | but received a nil rate (CZR) of  |
|                                   | payment on the 10 July 2020 due   |
|                                   | to income received. Although Elsa |
|                                   | is on a nil rate of payment, they |
|                                   | are still taken to be receiving   |
|                                   | the Age Pension. Elsa is eligible |
|                                   | for the second Economic Support   |
|                                   | Payment.                          |

| 2                                 | FTB Lump Sum customer             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Praveen was a Family Tax Benefit  |

|                                   | 2020, but claims FTB payment as a |
|                                   | lump sum at the end of the        |
|                                   | financial year. Praveen is        |
|                                   | entitled to receive the second    |
|                                   | Economic Support Payment, but     |
|                                   | will not receive this payment     |
|                                   | until completing their tax return |
|                                   | for the 2020/2021 financial year. |

| 3                                 | Receiving multiple payments that  |
|                                   | do not attract the Coronavirus    |
|                                   | Supplement                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Bertram was a current Department  |
|                                   | of Veterans' Affairs (DVA)        |
|                                   | customer 10 July 2020 and held a  |
|                                   | Low Income Health Care Card (LIC) |
|                                   | on this date.                     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Bertram is entitled to receive    |
|                                   | the second Economic Support       |
|                                   | Payment as a DVA customer.        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Holding a LIC does not give       |
|                                   | Bertram entitlement to the second |
|                                   | Economic Support Payment, but it  |
|                                   | does not prevent Bertram from     |
|                                   | receiving the second Economic     |
|                                   | Support Payment for their DVA     |
|                                   | payment. This is because LIC does |
|                                   | not attract the Coronavirus       |
|                                   | Supplement.                       |

|                                   | attracts the Coronavirus          |

|                                   | JSP customer on 10 July 2020.     |
|                                   | Trang was on a nil rate (CZR) of  |
|                                   | JSP due to employment earnings    |
|                                   | and did not receive the           |
|                                   | Coronavirus Supplement but is     |
|                                   | still considered to be receiving  |
|                                   | this payment even at a nil rate.  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | As Trang was also receiving a     |
|                                   | PCC, he is eligible to receive    |
|                                   | the second Economic Support       |
|                                   | Payment.                          |
