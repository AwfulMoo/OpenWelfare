|                                   | involved in a feud with another   |

|                                   | into violence in public. Threats  |
|                                   | of violence have been posted to   |

|                                   | Tamisha would be approved for     |
|                                   | away from home rate because her   |
|                                   | education is impeded by the       |
|                                   | threat of violence in the home.   |
|                                   | While the threat comes from       |
|                                   | people living outside the home,   |
|                                   | violence from the threats is      |
|                                   | likely to occur within the house. |

|                                   | causing trouble. Michael's mother |
|                                   | wants to remove him from the      |
|                                   | influence of his friends and send |
|                                   | him away to study. Normally away  |
|                                   | from home rate would not be       |
|                                   | approved as the issues concerning |

|                                   | of the home. However on closer    |
|                                   | investigation, Michael's father   |
|                                   | is abusive when he's been         |
|                                   | drinking excessive amounts of     |
|                                   | alcohol and terrorizes Michael at |

|                                   | granted because Michael's actions |
|                                   | outside the home were due to      |
|                                   | difficult home conditions inside  |
|                                   | the home that also impeded his    |

|                                   | school. The past few weeks there  |
|                                   | have been several incidents of    |
|                                   | violence between groups within    |
|                                   | her community. There has also     |
|                                   | been an increase in crime and     |

|                                   | to send Miriam away to boarding   |
|                                   | school.                           |

|                                   | from home rate as although the    |
|                                   | conditions are outside the        |
|                                   | permanent home, they are in the   |

|                                   | and are disrupting her ability to |
|                                   | study at home. Note: this         |
