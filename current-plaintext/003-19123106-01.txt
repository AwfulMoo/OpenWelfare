This is not the same as the Victorian Bushfires, February 2019. When
assessing claims for the Victorian Bushfires, February 2019, go to
Assessing claims for emergency payments for Victorian Bushfires,
February 2019.

There are different Local Government Areas (LGAs) for AGDRP/NZ DRP and
for DRA/NZ DRA for the Victorian Bushfires, December 2019.
Formal approval has been given to commence rejection of claims for all
declared and non-declared Local Government Areas. This also applies to
DRA/NZ DRA Determination 2020 claims where a Request for Information
(RFI) letter was sent requesting documentary evidence of income.

This document outlines how to determine if Australian Government
Disaster Recovery Payment (AGDRP), Disaster Recovery Allowance (DRA) or
their associated ex-gratia payments can be paid to customers affected by
activated emergency events.

Reasonably close to the bushfire (AGDRP/ex-gratia DRP only)

Static maps are not available

For the Victorian Bushfires, December 2019 the customer’s principal
place of residence must be:

-   within one of the designated LGAs and
-   ‘reasonably close’ to the bushfires

Live maps can be used to assist in assessing reasonably close. Live maps
detail the burn scar for each fire and can be used to assist in
determining the likelihood that any major damage was a direct result of
the designated bushfire.

See the Resources page to access the live map links.

Customer's principal residence outside 10km burn scar radius

Customers located outside of the 10km radius of a bushfire burn scar may
require a greater degree of examination and customer questioning to
ensure the damage claimed was a direct result of the declared major
disaster.

Where the customer's principal place of residence is outside the 10km
burn scar radius, Service Officers can escalate the claim to the
Emergency Management Technical Peer Support once the following have been
completed and the investigation is documented on the customer's record:

-   All other eligibility criteria has been assessed as met
-   Major damage criteria has been established, the customer has clearly
    demonstrated how they have met the criteria. For information see the
    Process page when assessing 'major damage' and 'reasonably close'
-   If the Service Officer doubts the validity of the customer’s claim,
    evidence should be requested before escalating to the Emergency
    Management Technical Peer Support

The Emergency Management Technical Peer Support reviews the customer's
record to ensure all information has been provided/documented. If more
information is required, they advise the Service Officer to:

-   ask the customer to provide the information required, and
-   place the claim on hold with the relevant keyword

If all information has been provided, the Emergency Management Technical
Peer Support escalates the claim to the Emergency Management Level 2
Helpdesk/TPS. See the Escalation of claims from the Emergency Management
Technical Peer Support to the Emergency Management Level 2 Helpdesk
table in Assessing eligibility for the AGDRP or ex-gratia DRP.

If the customer’s principal place of residence is more than 15km from
the closest burn scar, evidence to support the major damage assessment
should be requested. Once evidence has been provided a referral is made
to the Emergency Management Technical Peer Support for escalation to
Emergency Management Level 2 Helpdesk.

    non-declared LGAs

    Information (RFI) letter was sent requesting documentary evidence of

Claim forms are available on the Services Australia Website and on the
intranet, see the Resources page for a link.

-   call the Australian Government Emergency Information Line on 180 22
    66 to claim over the phone, or

Payment methods

There are a range of payment methods available for customers. These
include:

-   New Payments Platform (NPP)
-   Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) payments

Discuss the preferred method of payment for the customer. Use of NPP and
RTGS will help customers adversely affected by the major disaster
receive their payment/s faster.

NPP is not available for all banks, but RTGS is available for most
banks. Check which payment methods are available before discussing
payment options with the customer.

NPP is capped at $3,000. Any attempt to transfer more than that amount
will result in no funds being transferred in that attempt.

Claims must be finalised before using the NPP. For further information
see Immediate payment by payment method New Payments Platform (NPP).

Additional Child Care Subsidy (ACCS) (Temporary Financial Hardship)

Customers may be able to get ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship) if they
have been impacted by a declared disaster and claiming AGDRP.

ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship) provides short-term support to
families experiencing significant financial stress due to circumstances
beyond their control. This additional financial assistance will help
ensure continuity of care for the child and support families when they
need it most.

To be eligible for ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship), customers must:

-   be eligible for Child Care Subsidy (CCS)
-   be assessed as experiencing temporary financial hardship for an
    event that occurred no more than six months before the application
    is made
-   have had a substantial reduction in their ability to pay child care
    fees as a direct result of the temporary financial hardship

To support an application for ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship)
customers must:

-   provide evidence that the event(s) occurred less than 6 months prior
    to the application
-   demonstrate a causal link between the event(s) and their financial
    hardship

Customers who are applying for ACCS Temporary Financial Hardship (as a
standalone application or a combined CCS claim) can submit evidence that
they or their partner have claimed for or received AGDRP. No further
evidence is required.

Customers still need to provide evidence the emergency event has caused
financial hardship and demonstrate the causal link between the event and
their reduced ability to pay child care fees.

If a customer wishes to apply for ACCS transfer the customer to 136 150.
