This document outlines what happens when applicants in receipt of AIC
Scheme notify that they have changed, or intend to change their home
address or that of the AIC student.

Service Officer roles

Where an applicant or student changes their address, Service Officers
must:

-   record the details and
-   refer the details to the relevant AIC Smart Centre for action

Service Officers should also refer the following changes to the relevant
AIC Smart Centre for action:

-   basic address changes for the applicant
-   new bank account arrangements
-   change of schools

AIC Smart Centres

As a general protocol, changes of circumstances and actions to suspend,
cancel or restore payments should only be undertaken by AIC Smart Centre
staff. Where there is any doubt, the Service Officer should call the
relevant Smart Centre about what action they can or cannot take.

Customers calling other Smart Centre Call queues with AIC queries should
be transferred to the dedicated AIC lines on 132 318 and should be
advised to use that number for further calls.

The Resources page contains a link to the AIC Claim (SY040) form.
