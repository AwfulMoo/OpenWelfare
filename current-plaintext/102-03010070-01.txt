This document outlines what happens when applicants in receipt of
Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) Scheme notify that they have
changed, or intend to change their home address or that of the AIC
student.

Service Officer roles

Where an applicant or student changes their address, Service Officers
must record the details and refer them to the relevant AIC Smart Centre
for action.

If there are basic address changes for the applicant, new bank account
arrangements, and/or changes of school, the Service Officer should also
refer these changes to the relevant AIC Smart Centre for action.

Where to find AIC Smart Centres

As a general protocol, changes of circumstances and actions to suspend,
cancel or restore payments should only be undertaken by AIC Smart Centre
staff. Where there is any doubt, the Service Officer should call the
relevant Smart Centre about what action they can or cannot take.

Customers calling other Smart Centre Call queues with AIC queries should
be transferred to the dedicated AIC lines on 132 318 and should be
advised to use that number for further calls.

The Resources page contains a link to the AIC Claim (SY040) form.
