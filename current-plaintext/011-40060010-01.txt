This document outlines the process to search and register a customer for
Medicare. It also explains how to search and perform various enquiries
in CDMS.

Mandatory detailed search in CDMS

Service Officers must complete a mandatory detailed search before:

-   registering a consumer
-   amending a consumer
-   inquiring on a consumer

See Table 1 on the Process page for how to do a mandatory detailed
search.

Note: an Individual Healthcare Identifier (IHI) or Australian
Immunisation Register Supplementary Identification Number (AIR SIN)
record may have been allocated to a consumer before enrolment in
Medicare. For example, an individual may have been created by:

-   the ‘Request an Individual Healthcare Identifier (MS003) form’, or
-   the IHI Service in myGov, or
-   AIR SIN record – manually created by AIR Service Officers

In these cases a customer record will already exist in CDMS. Services
Officers must ensure the existing consumer record is used and linked to
the Medicare enrolment. Do not create a new record.

If more than one record is found, see Duplicate PIN and Consumer IDs in
Medicare.

Document verification

Service Officers need to verify identification documents in Document
Verification System (DVS) before processing an application. The Process
page contains details on how to verify and record this information.

Where the customer is an applicant for permanent residency or has been
granted permanent residency, Service Officers must try to identify them
via:

-   Visa Entitlement Verification Online (VEVO), or
-   Immigration Datalink

If the applicant:

-   can be identified via VEVO or the datalink, Service Officers do not
    need to use DVS
-   cannot be identified via VEVO or the datalink, Service Officers must
    verify the documents in DVS before processing the application

See Applicants for permanent residency eligibility for Medicare and
Permanent residents eligibility for Medicare.

My Health Record questions for a customer

My Health Record preferences are processed in the Medicare entitlement
screens in CDMS.

Applicants can answer My Health Record questions for themselves and
children under 14 years of age.

Forms can be used to enrol additional persons 14 years and over. These
additional persons must complete and sign their own My Health Record
questions on the form.

The Resources page contains:

-   eligibility document requirements to register a customer for
    Medicare in CDMS
-   details on group and personal history categories
-   contact details for Medicare eligibility and enrolments and the
    Medicare Customer Data Integrity Unit
