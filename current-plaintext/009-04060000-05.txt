+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Example                           | Description                       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Constant care requirement         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Mike has become a quadriplegic    |
|                                   | and suffered brain damage as a    |
|                                   | result of a car accident.         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Mike has an ADAT score of 135     |
|                                   | with a total health professional  |
|                                   | questionnaire score of 52. Mike's |
|                                   | parent Jane, together with Jane's |
|                                   | 2 siblings each provide care.     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Jane provides 14 hours care and   |
|                                   | each of the siblings provide 8    |
|                                   | hours care. There is an overlap   |
|                                   | in the mornings and evenings when |
|                                   | 2 carers are needed to accomplish |
|                                   | Mike's needs.                     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | As each carer is providing the    |
|                                   | equivalent of a working day of    |
|                                   | care, they could not be expected  |
|                                   | to sustain workforce              |
|                                   | participation.                    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | They each, therefore, meet the    |
|                                   | constant care requirement.        |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 2                                 | 2 or more carers                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Julie and her adult children,     |
|                                   | Joanna and John, each care for    |
|                                   | Julie’s partner, Dave who is      |
|                                   | frail aged and a paraplegic.      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Dave has an ADAT score of 125     |
|                                   | which means 2 or more carers can  |
|                                   | qualify for CP for care provided  |
|                                   | to him.                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Joanna and John each take 10 hour |
|                                   | shifts in caring for Dave.        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Joanna cares for Dave from 5am to |
|                                   | 3pm each day. John cares from 1pm |
|                                   | to 11pm. Julie provides care as   |
|                                   | needed over a 24 hour period.     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Julie cannot manage a lot of the  |
|                                   | care by herself and needs the     |
|                                   | adult children to lift and move   |
|                                   | Dave while she changes bedding,   |
|                                   | washes or massages Dave, feeds    |
|                                   | him and prepares his food or      |
|                                   | changes his clothes.              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | They are all providing care at    |
|                                   | least equivalent to a working day |
|                                   | each day even when caring at the  |
|                                   | same time, and they could not be  |
|                                   | expected to sustain workforce     |
|                                   | participation.                    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Both Joanna and John meet the     |
|                                   | constant care provisions as well  |
|                                   | as Julie, and because Dave's ADAT |
|                                   | score is over 80, (of which 32 is |
|                                   | attributable to the HPA) they     |
|                                   | each meet the constant care       |
|                                   | requirement and all qualify for   |
|                                   | CP                                |
