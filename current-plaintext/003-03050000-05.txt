Help from Technical Peer Support

If staff need help to finalise a claim, they must not call Technical
Peer Support (unless the customer is on the phone).

Before seeking help from Technical Peer Support using a Technical
Support Request staff must:

-   thoroughly research Operational Blueprint and other available
    resources
-   try to resolve the issue at a local level, for example, using local
    MS Teams chats

If:

-   an issue cannot be resolved and further technical assistance is
    needed, staff will lodge a Technical Support Request
-   staff have not received an outcome for their support request by the
    end of their shift, the related activity is to be placed on hold
    using the reason ‘hold to user’

Note: where a customer is on the phone, staff can call Technical Peer
Support.
