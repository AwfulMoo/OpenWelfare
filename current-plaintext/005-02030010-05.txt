Permanent Refugee Type Visas

Refugee-type visas allowing holders or former holders a Qualifying
Residence Exemption (QRE) for all payments/cards.

Note:

-   Person must not also be an Australian resident, and the visa must
    not have been cancelled (for example, if the person departed long
    enough for the visa to run out).
-   People who arrived on pre-1 September 1994 refugee/humanitarian
    visas of the old type also have QRE for all payments/cards.

Family members (partner or dependent child) or someone who arrived on
one of those listed below (or on pre-1 September 1994 types) also have
QRE, but not for the Age Pension (AGE) or Disability Support Pension
(DSP).

Pay (DAP) and Low Income Card (LIC), but which generally allow no
portability because they do not allow return to Australia if the person

790 (when available) may be portable if travelling for an approved
reason.
