Notification requirements

Customers who travel and stay in caravan parks, motels, camping grounds
or similar, need to advise of their new accommodation details:

-   each time they change address, and/or
-   pay a different amount for their accommodation

Failure to advise a change of address does not mean the Rent Assistance
(RA) should be cancelled. The failure to advise may impact on the rate
paid, due the date of effect rules which apply to:

-   the income support payment, or
-   Family Tax Benefit (FTB) (Part A)

Eligibility

Homeowners who have temporarily vacated their principal place of
residence to travel are generally not eligible for RA while their
principal place of residence remains an exempt asset.

Homeowners who have permanently vacated their principal place of
residence to travel may be eligible for RA while travelling.

Non-homeowners may be eligible for RA while travelling, RA can only be
paid for one address:

-   If they continue to rent their principal place of residence while
    they are temporarily travelling, RA can continue to be assessed on
    that property
-   If they have permanently vacated their principal place of residence
    RA may be payable for amounts paid for accommodation fees and/or the
    hire of the mobile accommodation (if relevant)

RA not payable

RA is not payable when customers own their mobile accommodation and
they:

-   Free camp, or
-   Park their mobile accommodation in the yard of family or friends and
    no rent is paid
