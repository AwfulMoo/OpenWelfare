This document outlines how to help customers use the Care plan search
history screen.

Care plan search history screen

Customers can access the Care plan search history screen in their
Medicare online account to check when a health professional has searched
their Medicare claims history for care plan eligibility.

Health professionals can access the screen via Health Professional
Online Services (HPOS).

Care plans may be created for patients under the following initiatives:

-   Chronic Disease Management (CDM)
-   Better Access to mental health services
-   Treatment and management plans for eating disorders

Note: eating disorder treatment and management plans are not supported
by the care plan history search in HPOS.

Health professionals cannot access a customer’s actual care or treatment
plan through Medicare. They can only check a customer’s eligibility for
Medicare services (Medicare Benefits Schedule items) to create, review
or manage a care plan.

See the Process for handling customer enquiries.

The Resources page contains a link to the Reporting fraud page on the
Services Australia website and screenshots of the Care plan search
history screen.
