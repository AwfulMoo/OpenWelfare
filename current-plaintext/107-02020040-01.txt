This document outlines how to manually create debt records on the Debt
Management and Information System (DMIS).

Reassess the customer's record

Reassess a customer's record to create a debt where possible. This
maintains system integrity.

Create a manual debt where reassessments do not create an undetermined
debt.

Account Payable letter

Before issuing any debt notice, refer to Safeguarding customer privacy
when raising and recovering debts. Issue an Account Payable letter to a
customer when a debt is determined.

Non Debt Programme or Compliance and Debt Operations staff

Record details on an ACTDOC when reassessment activities do not generate
a debt shell automatically. Transfer the ACTDOC to Compliance and Debt
Operations for further review. Create ACTDOC using the guided procedure:

-   Office: XWA > Type: ACTDOC > Category: DMB Raising > Item Name: Debt
    Raising

Note: check when a manual debt is raised for an income support payment.
This may affect FTB. Any FTB debt will need to be investigated and
raised if appropriate.
