[] Customers can use the Check independence through work history online
service to check whether they have met the self-supporting independence
criteria through their work history.

To identify the remoteness category of a customer's home address for the
purposes of Relocation Scholarship or self-supporting independence,
refer to the Student Regional Area Search tool.

Note: Service Officers and customers may experience intermittent system
issues when using the search tool. If this occurs, the following
workarounds can be applied:

-   Service Officers: After selecting on the link above, a 'Service not
    available' error may appear. If this occurs, refresh the page [F5]
    until the correct page appears
-   Customers: Customers can access the service by navigating to the
    Centrelink online accounts page on the Services Australia Website.
    From here, the customer should be able to access the 'Student
    Regional Area Search' link under the 'What you can do online'
    section. This link is also available via the Independence for Youth
    Allowance page. If a customer reports receiving a 'Service not
    available' error after selecting the link, tell the customer to keep
    trying until the page loads successfully
