Working to help people experiencing family and domestic violence

The Family and domestic violence page on the Services Australia Website
has information for community organisations and other government
departments outlining how the Services Australia can help customers who
are in violent situations.

Social workers have a key role to play in directly and indirectly
assisting customers who are experiencing family and domestic violence.
Social workers, as the family and domestic violence contact person in
the service centre and Smart Centre, ensure that staff are familiar with
policies that are implemented and reviewed on a regular basis. They also
ensure that appropriate referral/consultation procedures are in place to
ensure that customers experiencing violence receive prompt assistance.
