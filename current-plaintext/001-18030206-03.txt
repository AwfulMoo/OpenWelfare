|                                   | focuses on all of the relevant    |
|                                   | facts relating to the work that   |
|                                   | the job seeker has left and their |
|                                   | reasons for leaving. These facts  |
|                                   | inform the decision on whether    |
|                                   | the job seeker will incur an      |
|                                   | unemployment preclusion period or |
|                                   | non-compliance cancellation.      |

|                                   | consider whether the employee was |

|                                   | excuse for the misconduct. This   |
|                                   | is because misconduct is a        |
|                                   | behaviour within the job seeker's |

|                                   | The reason for termination must   |
|                                   | be a result of misconduct at work |
|                                   | and not because of the employee's |
|                                   | general behaviour. The incident   |
|                                   | must have either occurred in      |
