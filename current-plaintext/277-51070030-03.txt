customer is with another person, on speaker phone, or already identified
with family and domestic violence concerns, continue with the current
business conversation. Otherwise, go to the Family and domestic violence

This page contains the Maintenance Action Test (MAT) codes and how they
are recorded and updated. To update maintenance action outside a new
claim activity and for periods after 2007-08, use the Maintenance Action
workflow. These tables may be used if the workflow is unavailable, to
code maintenance action within a claim activity or to manually record
maintenance action.
