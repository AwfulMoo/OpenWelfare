This document outlines information on what happens when the principal
carer of a dependent child fails to attend a Participation interview.

Participation interview

Job seekers who are the principal carer of a dependent child will have
part-time mutual obligation requirements once their youngest child
reaches a certain age.

This age depends on the type of payment received by the job seeker:

-   Parenting Payment Single - youngest child aged 6 years and less than
    8 years of age
-   JobSeeker Payment (JSP) or Youth Allowance (YA) principal carer
    (partnered) - youngest child aged 6 years or more
-   JSP or YA principal carer (single) - youngest child aged 8 years or
    more

If the job seeker is in receipt of payment when their youngest child
reaches the relevant age, a compulsory participation interview will be
required.

While their youngest child is below the ages indicated above, the
customer can participate in Employment Provider Services as a volunteer.

Note: partnered job seekers whose youngest child is aged 6 years or more
and single job seekers whose youngest child is aged 8 years or more, are
no longer eligible to receive Parenting Payment and must claim either
JSP or YA as a principal carer of a dependent child.

New claim when youngest child reaches relevant age

If the customer is claiming a payment after their child has reached the
relevant age, and the customer is Centrelink managed, a Job Plan must be
negotiated with the new claim.

Failure to attend the compulsory participation interview

If the customer fails to attend the appointment their payment should be
suspended Fail to Attend Interview (FAI). See Conducting a Parenting
Payment Single (PPS) Compulsory Participation Interview.

Note: job seekers who are required to attend compulsory appointments
must receive proper notification and reasonable notice of the
requirement to attend the appointment.
