specialists and services that are available to students and Australian

Agency's role

The role of Services Australia is to provide access to information about
education and training and other external specialists or services which
may be of benefit to a student or Australian Apprentice. Services
Australia staff should explain all available options to the student or
Australian Apprentice. However, it is the responsibility of the customer
to make the appropriate choices for themselves individually.
