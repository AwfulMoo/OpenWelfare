All online claims for AGDRP/NZ DRP and DRA/NZ DRA meet the minimum
identity requirements. No further identity documents need to be provided
or coded in the Document Verification Service (DVS).

For phone claims and claim forms, where identity document/s do not
verify in the DVS, staff must not follow the process to record
alternative identity in Process Direct.

If a customer does not meet eligibility criteria for payment, identity
documents do not need to be checked or requested.

This document outlines the process for confirming that customers meet
identity requirements for emergency payments.

Emergency payments

Emergency payments include:

-   Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment (AGDRP)
-   Disaster Recovery Payment for New Zealand non-protected Special
    Category (subclass 444) visa holders (NZ DRP) - previously ex-gratia
    DRP
-   Disaster Recovery Allowance (DRA)
-   Disaster Recovery Allowance for New Zealand non-protected Special
    Category (subclass 444) visa holders (NZ DRA) - previously ex-gratia
    DRA

Identity requirements – online claim and Assisted Customer Claim (ACC)

For claims where there is online claim and ACC capability

-   AGDRP and NZ DRP activations from January 2022, and
-   DRA and NZ DRA activations from February 2022

Note: if a customer does not meet eligibility criteria for payment,
identity documents do not need to be checked or requested

Online Claims

Staff do not need to review or follow-up any identity requirements for
online claims.

These customers meet:

-   identity requirements by being previously known to Centrelink and
    using their existing Centrelink online account to lodge their claim,
    they do not need to provide any further identity documents to be
    verified, or
-   abridged identity requirements (Connected ID) by creating a new
    myGov account and linking it to a Centrelink online account. This
    way they meet identity requirements to receive a payment

When allocated a claim, staff must check the ‘Channel.’ If it shows as
WEB CHANNEL, this is an online claim lodged by a customer and the
customer will meet the identity requirements. ‘Submitted by’ will show
the customer’s CRN.

If the ‘Channel’ shows as INTERNAL this is a phone claim lodged using
Assisted Customer Claim (ACC). ‘Submitted by’ will show the User ID of
the Service Officer who submitted the ACC.

Phone claims - ACC

Every attempt must be made to establish a customer’s identity at the
time of their claim to avoid the need for the customer to attend a
service centre in future.

Service Officers must be satisfied that the person making the claim is:

-   who they say they are, and
-   eligible to receive the payment

Emergency payments can be paid before a customer has met the minimum
identity requirements

Minimum identity requirements for phone claims and claim forms

-   A confirmed identity status or Tier One POI (50 points) coded in
    Customer First. Minimum requirements mean Tier Two POI and Tier
    Three POI are also accepted. For the full list of acceptable
    documents and the categories they can be used for, see Legacy POI
    tiered model A to Z documents, or
-   An approved Commencement Of Identity (CoI) or Primary Use in
    Community (PUiC) identity document coded and verified in the
    Identity Confirmation Dashboard in Process Direct

Note: a Drivers licence that verifies in DVS is equal to 50 points

No further identity documents need to be verified if a customer meets
the minimum identity requirements. However, for phone claims, customers
must be authenticated and establish Proof of Record Ownership (PoRO) at
the time of their claim. Under no circumstances prompt the customer,
give them hints, or give them answers to the PoRO questions.

If a customer does not meet the minimum identity requirements, they must
be asked to provide the details of one of the following identity
documents:

Commencement of Identity (CoI)

-   A customer can demonstrate CoI in Australia by providing documents
    that confirm their birth in Australia or proof of arrival in
    Australia, establishing the customer's existence in Australia, or

Primary Use in Community (PUiC)

-   These documents are generally government issued and most contain a
    photograph and security features

Note: this excludes student cards and Proof of Age card. Noting foreign
passports with an Australian visa are accepted by phone as an Australian
Visa in the COI field.

Each identity document will be coded and verified in the Identity
Confirmation Dashboard in Process Direct.

Customers must provide consent before documents can be verified through
the Document Verification Service (DVS).

Customers must agree to the declarations read to them.

For customers genuinely unable to provide the required identity
credential details during their phone claim (that is, one CoI or PUiC
document coded and verified in the Identity Confirmation Dashboard in
Process Direct)

they must attend in person within 28 days to provide these documents.
See Providing identity

-   Do not complete an alternative identity assessment or code an
    identity review period in Process Direct:

See Providing identity

a manual review is coded in Customer First

-   Do not complete an alternative identity assessment or code an
    identity review period in Process Direct

Providing identity

Customers who do not have a confirmed identity status or Tier One POI,
Tier Two or Tier Three on their record can provide the details of one
CoI or PUiC identity document over the phone.

Customers will need to provide their consent to have the details
verified in the Document Verification Service (DVS).

Customers unable to provide the required identity document details over
the phone must provide the minimum identity requirements:

-   in person at a service centre so that a Service Officer can verify
    the POI, or
-   in person at an Agent or Access Point so they can verify the POI and
    send this through to the agency for actioning, or
-   by post to Emergency Processing Services Australia
    Note: this is a last resort. Customers should provide POI in person
    at a service centre, Agent or Access Point

If a customer posts their identity documents, return them. See Sighting,
recording and returning original documents.

For minimum identity requirements, see:

-   Identity requirements – online claim and Assisted Customer Claim
    (ACC)
-   Identity requirements – no online claim and Assisted Customer Claim
    (ACC)
