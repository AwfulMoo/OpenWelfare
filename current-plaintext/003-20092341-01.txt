Scripts and process

During an activation, site management will give staff details about
whether the calls will be inbound or outbound.

A Process page will update in this document if current activations have
process instructions, scripts or contact lists for outbound calls. Team
Leaders will coordinate the names of the people staff need to contact.
To avoid duplicate contacts, staff must only contact the names allocated
to them.
