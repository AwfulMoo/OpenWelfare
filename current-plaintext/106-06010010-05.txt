Examples of Australian residence periods on Norfolk Island

This table contains information about when periods residing on Norfolk
Island count as periods of Australian residence.

Residing on Norfolk Island is determined using the same factors as
residing in Australia. From 1 July 2016, past and current periods
residing on Norfolk Island count as a period of Australian residence if
the person also held legal permanent resident status at the time.

Most social security payments and concession cards require a person to
be an Australian resident for a minimum period to qualify for payment.
This is either a qualifying residence period or a Newly Arrived
Resident's Waiting Period (NARWP). For more information, see Australian
residence requirements for payment.
