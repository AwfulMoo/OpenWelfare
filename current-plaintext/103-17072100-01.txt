This document outlines the process to be followed to code NIM and issue
associated letters for NBG staff.

NBG role in NIM

While any network staff can action an Income Management Work Item
relating to NIM, NBG are responsible for monitoring these work items to
ensure they are actioned in a timely manner.

As letters are not automatically generated when a customer commences or
ends NIM, NBG are responsible for the issuing of the Online Advice (OLA)
letters required in the application of NIM.

NIM MFU activities

In addition to Income Management Work Items, Manual Follow-up (MFU)
activities are created when future actions are required on a customer's
record. An MFU can be created manually by a Service Officer or
automatically generated in the following circumstances:

-   a payment nominee starts or ends Income Management
-   change in the status of the payment nominee's Income Management (for
    example, Auto/Manual)
-   change in the measure under which the payment nominee is income
    managed
-   a payment nominee arrangement ends
-   an income managed customer has or appoints a payment nominee, or
-   an income managed customer becomes a payment nominee
