This document outlines how to use the Earnings Apportionment Tool (EAT).

Scope and function

EAT is a spreadsheet that:

-   accepts actual verified employment income
-   apportions the employment income to a customer's entitlement period
-   transfers the actual and apportioned employment income to the
    customer's Centrelink record

EAT as a support tool

EAT does not calculate debts, but helps record one-off employment
income. Use EAT to:

-   download actual employment income from the customer's record, and
-   the Debt Explanation tool (ADEX) to explain how the employment
    income was assessed

There are limits on which debts can be calculated on the Centrelink
system. See the ADEX training module.

Business integrity requirements

Upload the EAT sheet for combined debts raised for more than $10,000.

If using online workflows, there will not be an EAT sheet to upload. For
prosecution referrals, the sheet in its original form is required. These
can be uploaded using the Document Upload Facility when saved as an XLSX
file type.

The Resources page has links to the EAT tool, user guide and ECRM Image
Deletion Request form, common errors, and FAQs.
