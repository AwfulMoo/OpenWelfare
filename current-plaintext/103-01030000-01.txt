This document outlines how Income Management (IM) is impacted when a
customer moves out of an IM area.

Relocating outside an Income Management area

Customers who move out of a declared Income Management area may continue
to be eligible for IM. Refer to the Process page for more information.

Customers who disagree with a decision relating to their IM measure may
appeal the decision.

Effect on Income Management

Child Protection Income Management (CPIM), Supporting People at Risk
(SPaR)

IM will continue until a Revocation of Income Management is lodged by
the approved referring authority or the notice expires.

Vulnerable Welfare Payment Recipient (VWPR) - social worker assessed

IM will continue until a social worker ends the Vulnerable Notice or the
Notice expires.

VWPR - auto triggered youth category

IM will continue under the same rules as if they had remained in the
declared Income Management area. The customer can still apply for an
exclusion from IM.

Disengaged Youth (DEY) and Long Term Welfare Payment Recipients
(LTWPR) - Compulsory Income Management

IM will continue for 13 weeks from the date the customer moved outside
the Northern Territory. Customers can still apply for an exemption from
IM.

Voluntary IM (VIM)

IM can continue indefinitely or customers can choose to end their VIM
Agreement any time after completing the mandatory 13 weeks.
