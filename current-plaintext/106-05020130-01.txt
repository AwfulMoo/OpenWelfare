This document outlines information regarding the process when employees
are affected by a major business closure or disruption. In these cases,
contact with the employer should be made as early as possible, to assist
the employer and employees involved.

On this Page:

Contact from employers/employees

If employers or employees contact a service centre or Smart Centre Call,
details should be forwarded to the relevant Zone Office or National
Business Gateway.

Information to obtain from employer/union

The employer and trade union(s) should be contacted to obtain
information including:

-   the total number of workers affected, unions involved and location
    of the situation
-   the nature of the situation (e.g. strike, lock out)
-   whether there are non-union members and/or contractors affected
-   the date the situation commenced
-   what (if any) entitlements are being paid and for how long, and
-   possible flow on effects to other businesses

Appropriate response for affected customers

The Zone Office or service centre involved will determine the
appropriate response for the affected customers. This could include:

-   seminars
-   individual interviews
-   information sessions
-   Financial Information Service (FIS) assistance
-   Identifying if a customer is eligible for income support and other
    products, which may include running the First Contact Concessions,
    Carers and Seniors (FCCCS) application
-   Skills for Education and Employment (SEE) information

Note: when attending a workplace for redundant or retrenched workers,
staff must ensure information sheets are provided to employees.

The Resources page contains links to publications forming an Information
Kit for Employees/Employers facing redundancies/retrenchments, including
a Beyond Blue booklet for retrenched workers and a link to a Department
of Education, Skills and Employment information sheet. There is also a
'Guide for major business closures, industrial disputes and stand downs'
for staff reference.
