|                                   |     whether a claim could be      |

|                                   | there may be a significant factor |
|                                   | of contributory negligence. For   |
|                                   | example, the customer caused the  |
|                                   | injury while intoxicated and on   |
|                                   | duty                              |

|                                   | -   It is rare that a customer or |
|                                   |     their partner is exempt from  |
|                                   |     having to pursue a claim.     |
|                                   |     This is because in cases of   |
|                                   |     contributory negligence,      |
|                                   |     compensation payments are     |
|                                   |     generally only reduced        |
|                                   |                                   |
