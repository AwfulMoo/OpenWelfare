This document outlines information to assist in making the correct
decision regarding the reversal of any debt waiver action.

Delegations for reversal of waiver

Service Officers have the delegation to reverse a waiver or adjust the
amount of the debt. The delegations for reversal of waiver are the same
as those to apply a waiver. See Delegations of managing debts.

A debt waiver reversal occurs if:

-   the original decision no longer exists, or
-   never existed

A partial reversal of a waiver cannot occur. If the waiver was for an
incorrect amount, a whole waiver reversal must occur. After this, apply
a new waiver for the correct amount.

The References page contains links to Accountable Authority instructions
(AAI).

Reviews and reversal of waiver

The delegate can review a decision if satisfied there is sufficient
reason. This includes any previous decisions made to waive a debt. This
review is also known as a Secretary initiated review of decision.

If the review determines the previously waived debt should be set aside,
varied, or changed, then all or part of the waived amount may be
included within the new debt decision

Debt staff undertaking Compliance interventions do not need to
reconsider previously waived small debts into the new debt calculations.
