This document outlines how to arrange withholdings from a third party's
Centrelink payment to pay a debt.

Third party withholdings

A customer may request a third party withholding arrangement to repay
their debt if they are:

-   not a current Income Support Payment (ISP) recipient, or receives a
    payment that cannot be withheld and
-   unable to enter a payment arrangement

If a customer starts receiving a payment that is subject to withholding
arrangements, Services Australia will commence withholdings from the
debtor’s payment. Third party withholding arrangements will need to be
reviewed. Due to system limitations third party withholdings should not
be encouraged.

A customer may request a third party withholding arrangement if the
third party:

-   gives authority, and
-   agrees to the repayment amounts

If the third party has withholdings in place to repay their own debt:

-   do not stop these withholdings for another party
-   withholdings may apply to a second payment type if they get one

If the third party later on gets a debt of their own:

-   the system will not stop the withholding arrangement
-   contact the third party to tell them that the third party
    arrangement will stop (unless they get two payment types)
-   a new withholding arrangement will be put in place so they can repay
    their own debt
-   contact the customer to make a new repayment arrangement
