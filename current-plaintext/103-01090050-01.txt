Income Management Work Items and messages

If the system or a Service Officer initiates an Assessment Result (AR)
process on an income managed customer or a potential Income Management
customer and further action is required, one of the following will
display:

-   the Income Management Summary screen in workflow, or
-   the Income Management Warning and Error (IMWE) screen if coding
    manually

These screens may display a message or Work Item that could impact
Income Management. All appropriate discussions and updates must be
completed while the customer is present to address the Work Item
generated.
