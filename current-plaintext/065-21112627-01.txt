qualify for the Scheme.

Customers can:

    agreement by using Centrelink online services

Change fortnightly loan payments

get

Customers can get up to 150% of the maximum pension rate payable, that
includes the:

-   pension payment, and
-   loan payment

Payment options are:

-   the maximum amount that can be paid (Up to 150% of the maximum
    applicable pension rate). See Rate payable

    or
-   a fixed amount. For example, a customer can choose to get $300 extra
    per fortnight

Customers can:

-   request 1 change to their payment at a time

    date the request is made, and
-   withdraw requests

request being finalised. See Home Equity Access Scheme consent for more
details

If the nominee or customer sent their request with consent, and would
like to cancel or withdraw their request, the nominee or customer must:

All Scheme payments the customer gets add to the loan balance, and

Home Equity Access Scheme variation form (SA497)

If customers are unable to use online services, they can advise changes
in circumstances using the SA497 form.

-   For partnered customers, both members of the couple must sign in
    writing their agreement to any changes in the loan
-   Both members of the couple must be aware of the terms of the loan,
    including any changes. This is regardless if the partner shares
    ownership of the real estate used to secure the loan. For example,
    where a new asset is added as security, both partners must sign the
    advice
-   If there is a third party/trust or company interest in a Scheme
    loan, the third party/trust or company must also agree to any change
    in writing
