This document outlines the procedure when referring a job seeker to an
Employment Services Provider.

Referral to Employment Service Providers

Service Officers may refer job seekers to an Employment Services
Provider. Employment Services Provider is a generic term that covers a
range of organisations, including Workforce Australia Employment
Services Providers, Workforce Australia - Transition to Work (TtW),
Disability Employment Services (DES) and Community Development Program
(CDP). This topic provides information on Services Australia role in the
referral process.

Selecting a provider at New Claim

Job seekers will select or be automatically allocated a provider
including Workforce Australia Online for Individuals during their
initial contact with the agency. If the job seeker is subject to
RapidConnect and not referred to Workforce Australia Online, they must
be referred to an available appointment within 2 days. If there are no
available appointments, they can select from providers who have
appointments available within 14 working days.

The Participation Interview is used to complete the Job Seeker Snapshot
(when required) and refer job seekers to an Employment Services
Provider.

Job seekers who do not have a preference for a provider are randomly
allocated one from those in the local area. Job seekers can ask to
exclude certain providers from the random allocation process.

Note: there is only one CDP provider per remote area, job seekers in
these areas will not have a choice of providers.

Referral to Workforce Australia Online for Individuals employment service

Most job seekers are referred to Workforce Australia Online for
Individuals, with selection and referral being undertaken by the
Department of Education, Skills and Employment during the Participation
Interview. Selected job seekers do not require a referral to a Workforce
Australia provider, but instead manage their obligations through the
Online Services website.

Services Australia's role in selecting a Workforce Australia provider

It is the agency's role to give the customer unbiased information about
providers to assist them with their choice of provider. The agency can
give the following information to assist customers in choosing an
Employment Services Provider:

-   the names of available providers
-   provider locations
-   provider appointment availability
-   the Star Rating if available (for DES providers only)

Initial appointment

At the initial appointment with the provider, the job seeker and the
provider discuss job search requirements and complete a vocational
profile and a resume. In most circumstances, an Employment Services
Provider will negotiate a Job Plan with the job seeker at this
appointment.

Workforce Australia

Workforce Australia provides job seekers a range of tailored services,
according to their circumstances and needs. A job seeker registering for
services will be referred to a provider who will deliver or broker all
appropriate services available during the customer's period of
registration.

The outcome of the Job Seeker Snapshot, or an Employment Services
Assessment (ESAt) if conducted, will determine the level of service the
job seeker will receive from Workforce Australia.

Job seekers identified as eligible for TtW should not be referred to a
Workforce Australia Services Provider.

Community Development Program (CDP)

When a job seeker lives in a Department of Education, Skills and
Employment designated remote area, they are referred to a Community
Development Program (CDP) provider.

There is only one CDP provider per remote area, job seekers in these
areas do not have a choice of providers.

Disability Employment Services (DES)

Disability Employment Services (DES) offers 2 programs to help people
whose disability, injury or health condition is their primary barrier to
finding and maintaining employment. The participant will be in either
Disability Employment Services - Disability Management Service (DES-DMS)
or Disability Employment Services - Employment Support Service
(DES-ESS), depending on their level of need and their eligibility for
Program Services:

Disability Employment Services - Disability Management Service (DES-DMS)

-   provides services to job seekers with temporary or permanent
    disability, injury, or health conditions who require the assistance
    of a disability employment service and who may require flexible
    ongoing support but are not expected to need regular long-term
    support in the workplace: and

Disability Employment Services - Employment Support Service (DES-ESS):

-   provides services to job seekers with permanent disability and who
    are assessed as needing regular long-term ongoing support in the
    workplace

DES is funded by the Department of Social Services (DSS).

See Referring a job seeker to Disability Employment Services (DES) for
further information regarding the referral process.

The Star Rating system (DES only)

The Star Rating system, where available, measures the success of a DES
provider in finding jobs for job seekers. The highest rating is five and
the lowest is a rating of one. New providers may have a nil rating and
as such, the rating in these instances does not indicate poor
performance of the provider - this should be taken into account when
explaining ratings to customers. If the customer is a RapidConnect
customer, the system will only display the list of providers with
immediate appointments and will not display their full status.

Workforce Australia - Transition to Work (TtW)

The Workforce Australia - Transition to Work (TtW) Service is for young
people 15- 24 years of age who are not in education or employment and
are at high risk of long term unemployment. Participants will be given
pre-employment assistance by a TtW provider to prepare them for work, an
apprenticeship, a traineeship, or further education. Eligibility is
determined by the Department of Education, Skills and Employment ICT
system.

TtW services are provided by Employment Service Providers that operate
separately to Workforce Australia Service Providers, Disability
Employment Services, and Community Development Program. A job seeker
eligible for TtW must not be referred to a Workforce Australia Services
Provider.

Breakdown in relationship with provider

If the job seeker believes they can receive a better service elsewhere,
they should talk to their current or proposed provider. Job seekers may
be transferred by agreement if the losing and gaining providers agree to
the transfer. A request for transfer may also be lodged electronically
by a job seeker via their Personal Page on the Workforce Australia
website, see Resources for a link.

If a job seeker advises Services Australia that they refuse to engage
with their Workforce Australia provider due to a breakdown in
relationship with their provider, the job seeker must be advised to
contact the Department of Education, Skills and Employment Customer
Service Line, See Resources for a link. This includes situations where
the job seeker has been exited from their provider due to threatening,
aggressive, or violent behaviour and there is a Job Seeker Incident
Report (JSIR) recorded, and they wish to discuss the exit or referral to
another provider.

CDP job seekers cannot generally transfer between providers unless they
move to another region, however these job seekers may also be referred
to the Department of Education, Skills and Employment National Customer
Service Line (NCSL), See the Resources page for a link, where they have
reported a breakdown in the relationship with their provider.

Participant Initiated Transfer (DES only)

Once the participant commences DES, they are able to use a Participant
Initiated Transfer at any time. Participants can use these transfers up
to 5 times over a 2 year period.

Participants should contact the National Customer Service Line to help
to make this change. They will not be asked to provide a reason for
wanting to change DES provider.

If the participant exhausts their 5 initiated transfers, or do not wish
to use their initiated transfers, they can still transfer using a
Transfer by Agreement but only after ESAt is finalised.

The Resources page contains a link to the Workforce Australia website
and contact details for the Department of Education, Skills and
Employment.
