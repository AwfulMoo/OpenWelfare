This document outlines information about suspending disbursements of
child support payments to a payee.

Suspending disbursements

A person may apply to a court having jurisdiction under the Child
Support Assessment Act for a declaration that the person should not be
assessed in respect of the costs of the child. This is an s107
declaration. If a person applies for an s107 declaration, payments to
the payee for that child must be suspended until the court makes a
decision.

See Section 107 and Section 143 orders for Child Support customers for
more information.

A person who disputes (objection, Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT)
review or court application) the validity of a child support assessment
on grounds other than parentage can apply to Child Support to suspend
disbursements to the payee. Child Support is not legally required to
suspend disbursements. However, an application for suspension will be
accepted unless doing so will cause financial hardship to the payee and
children.

After the dispute process is finalised, Child Support must either resume
payments to the payee (if the application is not successful) or
negotiate a refund of suspended disbursements to the payer.
