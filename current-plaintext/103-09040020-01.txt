This document outlines how to undertake the Post Approval Checklist
(PAC).

PAC

The PAC is a discussion that is conducted over the phone by the Third
Party Programmes team with a Business that has recently been approved to
use Centrepay. The PAC must be conducted after 30 business days of the
business’s Centrepay application being approved. All PACs must be
completed within 8 weeks from the date they are created.

The PAC is designed to build the relationship with the business, confirm
the business details are accurate, review the business’s deduction
authority, and ensure the business understands its obligations under the
Centrepay Policy and Terms.

The Resources page contains links to the Services Australia website for
information about Centrepay, and relevant resources.
