This document outlines information on transferring non priority calls
within the network.

Transferring a non priority call

Calls that are transferred to other customer segments (queues) may be
treated as either priority or non-priority calls. If the call is of an
urgent nature, or the caller is advising of a death, or they are in a
distressed state then it will be transferred as a priority call. In
order to reduce the ability for a caller to access a queue from a
separate line of business, Service Officers should advise callers of the
most appropriate phone number for assistance to use at their next
transaction, this should be followed, wherever possible with customer
enquiries being answered, or issues resolved at the first contact.

Where assistance is unable to be provided due to the caller contacting
the incorrect line and attempting to be transferred between queues, the
call should be quickly finalised by politely thanking them for calling
and providing the most appropriate phone number for assistance.

Priority calls are transferred by using the Priority Transfer option;
non-priority calls are transferred by using the National Transfer option
(a non-priority transfer to another queue).

When a full authentication check has been completed, this should be
recorded on a DOC whenever the National Transfer option is used.
