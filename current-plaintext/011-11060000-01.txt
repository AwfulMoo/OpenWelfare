This document contains information on how to search for an existing
organ donor registration and perform an inquiry on Australian Organ
Donor Register (AODR) or Donor Only entitlements and history.

Determine existence of organ donor registration

Perform a detailed search by consumer details to determine if a new
registration is required or if a registration already exists, when:

-   processing an organ donor registration form
-   amending a registration, or
-   searching for entitlement records

This will determine if any or multiple registrations exist.

All searches are conducted through the Consumer Directory Maintenance
System (CDMS).

Search results display either:

-   matched consumers with an AODR entitlement
-   matched Donor only entitlements
-   both of the above
-   Information Message 01138 ‘View End Dated Entitlement Details’
    (returned via the amend search where entitlement has already been
    end-dated)
-   Information Message 00461 ‘No records found’ (returned if the search
    cannot find any matching data. Amend search criteria to attempt
    again)

Security check for organ donor registration

All organ donor registration enquiries must pass a security check before
registration and donation decisions are confirmed or accessed. Where a
registration is not linked to Medicare, confirm the caller’s identity by
requesting their full name, date of birth and current mailing address.

The full AODR security check and escalation process can be found on
Australian Organ Donor Register (AODR).

The Resources page contains information about AODR contacts.
