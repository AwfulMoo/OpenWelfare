| Terminology                       | Definition                        |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Radiation oncology                | A medical specialty that involves |
|                                   | the controlled use of radiation   |
|                                   | to treat various forms of cancer. |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Radiation therapy or radiotherapy | This is the actual treatment      |
|                                   | delivered by a radiation oncology |
|                                   | team using x-rays or gamma rays.  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Radiotherapy is provided as:      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   teletherapy (external         |
|                                   |     source), or                   |
|                                   | -   brachytherapy (a source       |
|                                   |     placed internally in the      |
|                                   |     body)                         |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Site                              | The anatomical location of the    |
|                                   | tumour in a patient e.g.          |
|                                   | prostate.                         |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Primary site                      | The primary site or primary       |
|                                   | tumour is the place in the body   |
|                                   | where the original type of cancer |
|                                   | cell commenced its growth e.g.    |
|                                   | prostate.                         |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Secondary site                    | A secondary site or secondary     |
|                                   | tumour is when primary site       |
|                                   | cancer cells have spread to a     |
|                                   | second site in the body. For      |
|                                   | example, cancer cells originating |
|                                   | in the prostate may spread to the |
|                                   | left lung creating a secondary    |
|                                   | cancer site in the left lung.     |
|                                   | This is not a new primary cancer  |
|                                   | of the lungs but secondary        |
|                                   | prostate cancer and is defined as |
|                                   | a secondary site or metastasis.   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Field                             | The area of the tumour site       |
|                                   | irradiated in a single            |
|                                   | application. Radiation beams are  |
|                                   | delivered at different angles     |
|                                   | across the tumour site. At each   |
|                                   | treatment, radiotherapy can be    |
|                                   | delivered across the tumour in:   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   a single field (at one angle) |
|                                   | -   multiple fields (at more than |
|                                   |     one angle)                    |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Dosimetry                         | A dose of radiation treatment is  |
|                                   | the total amount of treatment to  |
|                                   | be delivered to a tumour site     |
|                                   | over a period of time. The dosage |
|                                   | to be absorbed by the patient is  |
|                                   | calculated and measured by a      |
|                                   | dosimeter prior to a treatment.   |
|                                   | Calculating and planning the dose |
|                                   | is referred to as dosimetry.      |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Fractionated treatment            | When the total dose of radiation  |
|                                   | to be delivered is divided into   |
|                                   | small amounts over a period of    |
|                                   | weeks or months.                  |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Hyperfractionated treatment       | Radiation therapy treatment       |
|                                   | delivered multiple times a day    |
|                                   | instead of in a once a day dose   |
|                                   | e.g. treatment is delivered to    |
|                                   | the same tumour site once in the  |
|                                   | morning and once in the           |
|                                   | afternoon.                        |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Teletherapy                       | Treatment is from an external     |
|                                   | source, for example, cobalt.      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Orthovoltage and megavoltage      |
|                                   | radiotherapy are a form of        |
|                                   | teletherapy.                      |

| Surface moulds                    | Contain sealed radioisotopes and  |
|                                   | are applied to the patient's skin |
|                                   | daily, usually for several weeks. |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Radioactive implants              | Used to administer either         |
|                                   | intracavitary or interstitial     |
|                                   | brachytherapy.                    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Radioactive implants are either   |
|                                   | preloaded or afterloading.        |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Intracavitary brachytherapy       | Insertion of a radioactive        |
|                                   | implant into a pre-existing body  |
|                                   | cavity, for example, the uterine  |
|                                   | cavity.                           |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Interstitial radiotherapy         | Insertion of a radioactive        |
|                                   | implant directly into body        |
|                                   | tissues containing cancer, for    |
|                                   | example, the tongue.              |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Preloaded radioactive implant     | Already contains the radioactive  |
|                                   | material and thus exposes the     |
|                                   | operator to radiation.            |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Afterloading radioactive implant  | Filled with the radioisotope      |
|                                   | after it is inserted into the     |
|                                   | patient's body. The radioisotope  |
|                                   | may be put into the implant       |
|                                   | manually or automatically, using  |
|                                   | a computer system.                |
