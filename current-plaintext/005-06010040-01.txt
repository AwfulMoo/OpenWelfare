This document outlines the process for Service Officers to follow when a
customer who is receiving Status Resolution Support Services (SRSS)
payment advises their circumstances have changed.

Department of Home Affairs responsibilities

Department of Home Affairs is responsible for:

-   determining eligibility for SRSS payment
-   deciding which Band the customer will be paid under
-   determining whether the customer should be paid as partnered or
    single
-   determining whether the customer has dependent children in their
    care
-   determining biodata (legal name and DOB) for the customer

Determining the start date of the customer’s SRSS payment

The Department of Home Affairs will provide:

-   details for each customer to Services Australia
-   the eligibility dates of the SRSS payment, and
-   details of when a change to any of the above occurs

Changes updated by Services Australia

Changes that can be accepted from the customer and updated by Services
Australia include:

-   change of address and rent (if a customer in Band 2 or Band 3
    advises they have changed address, refer the customer to the
    Department of Home Affairs)
-   change of payment destination (must be in customer’s name)
-   changes in income and /or assets
-   earnings

The Service Officer may need to clarify the effect on the customer’s
payment with the Department of Home Affairs before coding the relevant
updates. Do this by contacting the SRSS Helpdesk.
