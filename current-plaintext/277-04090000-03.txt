|                                   |     therefore the original        |
|                                   |     discharge amount of $500 is   |

|                                   |     the $500 discharge amount =   |

|                                   |     arrears owing due to the      |

|                                   |     scenario, the $100 liability  |
|                                   |     reduction is less that the    |
|                                   |     $500 discharged arrears       |
|                                   |     amount, therefore the         |
|                                   |     original discharge amount of  |
|                                   |     $500 is adjusted to $400. The |

|                                   |     payee overpayment, that is    |
|                                   |     $500 original discharge less  |
|                                   |     the $100 liability reduction  |
