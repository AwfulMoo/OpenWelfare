|                                   | Maggie is 14 years of age and in  |
|                                   | Year 8. Maggie's parents, Jill    |
|                                   | and Robert, are separated and     |
|                                   | have a shared care arrangement.   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Jill holds a current Health Care  |
|                                   | Card (HCC) and has been granted   |
|                                   | ABSTUDY Schooling A benefits for  |
|                                   | Maggie.                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Robert receives JobSeeker Payment |
|                                   | (JSP) and has lodged a claim for  |
|                                   | ABSTUDY Schooling A for Maggie.   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | As both parents are responsible   |
|                                   | for Maggie, they qualify for      |
|                                   | ABSTUDY Schooling A benefits. The |
|                                   | first to apply is the 'eligible'  |
|                                   | applicant. Therefore, Jill will   |
|                                   | retain the entitlement and the    |
|                                   | claim by Robert is to be          |
|                                   | rejected.                         |

|                                   | If another applicant lodges a     |
|                                   | claim for ABSTUDY Schooling A, it |
|                                   | is not appropriate to cancel the  |
|                                   | current payment of an eligible    |
