For staff conducting Compliance Assurance and Debt Operations Division
(CADOD) interventions only.

This document outlines how to determine if an identity mismatch or data
discrepancy has occurred when completing a compliance intervention and
the steps involved to action.

Determining if an identity mismatch has occurred

An identity mismatch can be identified if there is a discrepancy between
the customer’s details in the match data and the information on the
Centrelink record. For example, the match data may relate to another
person.

If after consultation with the Quality Development Officer (QDO), the CO
is unable to confirm the validity of the match based on the checks
undertaken, the intervention is referred to the CADO Service Desk.

The Resources page contains a link to the Australian Taxation Office
(ATO) contact details and the CADO Service Desk Online Form.
