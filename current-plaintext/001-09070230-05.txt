| 1                                 | Question: Are PP job seekers      |
|                                   | subject to the short course       |
|                                   | approval policy?                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: No. PP job seekers are    |
|                                   | not subject to the short course   |
|                                   | approval policy and can undertake |
|                                   | approved study for longer         |
|                                   | periods. PP job seekers can       |
|                                   | participate in full-time or       |
|                                   | part-time study to meet their     |
|                                   | mutual obligation requirements,   |
|                                   | as long as they are undertaking   |
|                                   | at least 15 hours of study per    |
|                                   | week, or 30 hours per fortnight.  |
|                                   | PP job seekers are not required   |
|                                   | to claim for a student payment    |
|                                   | when they commence full-time      |
|                                   | study.                            |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 2                                 | Question: When can Services       |
|                                   | Australia approve a part-time or  |
|                                   | full-time course for PP job       |
|                                   | seekers?                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: PP job seekers, as        |
|                                   | principal carers, can fully       |
|                                   | satisfy their mutual obligation   |
|                                   | requirements through approved     |
|                                   | study of at least 15 hours per    |
|                                   | week, or 30 hours per fortnight.  |
|                                   | There is no minimum number of     |
|                                   | contact (classroom or otherwise   |
|                                   | directed) hours.                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The study can be approved by the  |
|                                   | agency regardless of whether the  |
|                                   | institution regards the course as |
|                                   | full-time or part-time. The study |
|                                   | can also be approved regardless   |
|                                   | of the duration of the course. In |
|                                   | other words, PP job seekers with  |
|                                   | mutual obligation requirements    |
|                                   | are not subject to short course   |
|                                   | approval rules, so undertaking    |
|                                   | full-time study does not affect   |
|                                   | their qualification for payment.  |

| 3                                 | Question: In the case of course   |
|                                   | approvals, who is the decision    |
|                                   | maker (DM)?                       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: It will depend on who is  |
|                                   | approving or rejecting the short  |
|                                   | course application. This means    |
|                                   | that the DM could be either the   |
|                                   | provider or a Service Officer.    |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 4                                 | Question: Can a job seeker        |
|                                   | request a review of the decision  |
|                                   | if Services Australia or a        |
|                                   | provider does not approve a short |
|                                   | course?                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: If a job seeker is not    |
|                                   | satisfied with a provider         |
|                                   | decision in regards to            |
|                                   | non-approval of a short course    |
|                                   | and following discussion with the |
|                                   | provider it is clear they will    |
|                                   | not change their decision, the    |
|                                   | job seeker may contact the        |
|                                   | Department of Employment and      |
|                                   | Workplace Relations to lodge a    |

|                                   | As with any adverse decision made |
|                                   | by a delegate of the Secretary    |
|                                   | under Social Security Law, a job  |
|                                   | seeker can request a review of a  |
|                                   | decision relating to the          |
|                                   | requirements of a Job Plan,       |
|                                   | whether made by the provider or a |
|                                   | Service Officer.                  |

|                                   | A review officer can overturn a   |
|                                   | decision relating to the          |
|                                   | requirements of a Job Plan only   |
|                                   | where the decision is not         |
|                                   | consistent with Social Security   |
|                                   | Law (for example, because the job |
|                                   | seeker cannot reasonably be       |
|                                   | expected to meet the terms of the |
|                                   | Plan or where a term is precluded |
|                                   | by the legislative instrument).   |

|                                   | A review officer cannot overturn  |
|                                   | a Job Plan related decision       |
|                                   | simply because the review officer |
|                                   | or the job seeker disagrees with  |
|                                   | the decision.                     |

|                                   |     study guidelines for JSP/YA.  |
|                                   |     The job seeker would need to  |
|                                   |     talk to a provider (if in a   |
