This document outlines the circumstances when a Medicare Compensation
Recovery cases may be terminated.

Case termination

A 'terminated case' is not the same as a 'closed case'. A case is closed
after it has been finalised when a judgment or settlement is reached.
Whereas a case is terminated when it will not or cannot be finalised by
a judgment or settlement.

It is important to assess the case, decide the reason and any evidence
required and make a decision on whether or not the case should be
terminated. For example, when the case has settled for less than $5,000
but indicates legal or other costs in addition to this, it may still be
notifiable to Services Australia under the Health and Other Services
(Compensation) Act 1995. See Table 1 for process steps to assess and
decide to terminate an existing case.
