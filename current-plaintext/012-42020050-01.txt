This document outlines information about the credentialling of nuclear
medicine specialists and consultant physicians for Medicare purposes.

Consultant Physician or Specialist recognition

Recognition as a consultant physician or specialist in Nuclear Medicine
does not automatically mean the medical practitioner is eligible to bill
or claim Nuclear Medicine or PET items in the Medical Benefits Schedule
(MBS). They also need credentialling.

Nuclear medicine and PET credentialling

-   To access nuclear medicine or PET MBS items, medical practitioners
    must be credentialled in Nuclear Medicine and/or PET by the Joint
    Nuclear Medicine Credentialling and Accreditation Committee (JNMCAC)
-   Medical practitioners must apply for credentialling through JNMCAC
-   The JNMCAC secretariat advises Services Australia when the
    specialist’s name has been included on the Register of Credentialed
    Nuclear Medicine and/or PET Specialists

Services Australia:

updates the specialist or consultant physician’s record in the Provider
Directory System (PDS)

writes to the specialist or consultant physician advising the medical
practitioner that the JNMCAC have confirmed they are credentialled in
Nuclear Medicine and/or PET:

-   for specialist or consultant physician credentialled in Nuclear
    Medicine, they are advised of the start date to access nuclear
    medicine items in the MBS
-    for specialist or consultant physician credentialled in PET, they
    are advised they don’t have access to claim or bill Medicare PET
    items and that they must complete the Positron emission tomography
    statutory declaration form (HW064). See Positron Emission Tomography
    (PET) services for credentialed medical practitioners

The credentialling start date is the date advised by JNMCAC. This can be
a date in the past, but cannot be a date before the date that specialist
recognition in Nuclear Medicine was granted

Information and relevant application forms are available from the
Australasian Association of Nuclear Medicine Specialists (AANMS)
website. See the Resources page for a link to the website

Medicare access

Nuclear Medicine

Recognition as a credentialled Nuclear Medicine specialist allows the
medical practitioner to bill and claim for nuclear medicine imaging
items listed in group 14 of the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS). That
is, from the start date advised by JNMCAC.

PET

Being crendentialled in PET, does not give access to bill or claim PET
items listed in the MBS

Access is granted if the medical practitioners Positron emission
tomography statutory declaration form (HW064) is approved

Once approved the medical practitioner will be registered as approved
for:

-   PET services, and
-   the Location Specific Practice Number (LSPN) added

The date of effect to claim or bill PET items is the date Services
Australia receives the completed Positron emission tomography -
statutory declaration form (HW064)

Re-credentialling

-   The re-credentialling process occurs biannually
-   The Joint Nuclear Medicine Credentialling Accreditation Committee
    (JNMCAC) provides an updated list of credentialled Nuclear Medicine
    physicians to Services Australia
-   Failure to meet re-credentialling requirements results in the
    cessation of the specialist or consultant physician's eligibility to
    access the nuclear medicine items in the Medicare Benefits Schedule
-   Services Australia notifies the specialist or consultant physician
    (in writing) of the effective end date
