Actioning the Work Item and making an exemption service offer

The Work Item cannot be manually completed, but will be automatically
removed once the outcome of the discussion with the customer has been
recorded on the IM Service Offer screen.

Access Service Officers are required to have a broad understanding of
the eligibility criteria and assessment process for Income Management
exemptions to answer initial enquiries and outline the Eligibility for
Exemption requirements prior to warm transferring the customer to the
Income Management Exemption and Assessment Team (IMEAT). However they do
not conduct the assessment and cannot make decisions regarding
exemptions.

The IMEAT conduct all exemption assessments for customers to ensure
consistency of decision making. Only staff in IMEAT are authorised to
complete the Compulsory IM exemption workflow to grant an exemption.

Eligibility for exemption

For customers with dependent children wishing to test their eligibility
for an exemption, Service Officers are to discuss and complete the IM
Service Offer workflow before transferring to IMEAT. The discussion
should include the below points. See the Process page for more
information.

Financial Vulnerability Test - If the assessment determines there have
been no signs of financial vulnerability in the last 12 months, the
customer is then required to provide evidence they are undertaking
responsible parenting.

The child is enrolled in and attending school, and has no more than five
absences for each of the previous two school terms that are not
satisfactory to the person responsible for the operation of the school.

The child is enrolled in and attending school, and has no more than five
absences not satisfactory to a person responsible for the operation of
the school, but the customer is taking reasonable steps to ensure the
child attends school as required. A customer is taking reasonable steps
to ensure the child attends school if they have taken steps to stop
truancy, for example, addressing bullying at school

The child is being provided home based schooling approved by the
state/territory Department of Education. The written consent letter from
the Department of Education approving home schooling would be required

Customers with children under compulsory school age need to provide
evidence for two of the following health related activities:

-   Immunisation appropriate for the child's age
-   A general health check-up for each child
-   Participation in an individualised plan for the child from an allied
    health professional, for example, report from a speech therapist,
    occupational or physical therapist
