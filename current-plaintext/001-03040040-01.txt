Do not undertake any MALEP assessments. The Department of Social
Services (DSS) have paused all Moving to an Area of Lower Employment
Prospects (MALEP) assessments.

This document outlines whether to apply a 26 week employment related
exclusion period because a job seeker has lowered their employment
prospects without a sufficient reason.

From 23 March 2021, the Minister for Employment, Workforce, Skills,
Small and Family Business has made a determination to continue the pause
of all MALEP assessments indefinitely.

Key Objective

The Moving to an Area of Lower Employment Prospects (MALEP) policy was
created to discourage unemployed job seekers from limiting their
employment prospects by relocating to an area where the likelihood of
finding work was significantly lower than in their previous location.

Key Principles

All job seekers in receipt of, or claiming JobSeeker Payment (JSP),
Youth Allowance (YA) (job seeker) or Special Benefit (SpB) with
Nominated Visa Holder (NVH) mutual obligation requirements will not be
payable for a period of 26 weeks if they:

-   move to a new place of residence, and
-   the move lowers their employment prospects, and
-   they do not have a sufficient reason for moving (as defined in the
    Social Security Act 1991), and
-   there is insufficient evidence that the job seeker's skills are in
    demand in the new area

All other job seekers - including those who are Mature Age, Principal
Carer Parents, have a Reduced Work Capacity or an exemption from mutual
obligation requirements for any reason - may incur a MALEP 26 week
employment related exclusion period. Any change of address must be
assessed under the MALEP policy, with clear documentation included to
explain why an employment related exclusion period has - or has not -
been applied.

MALEP 26 week employment related exclusion period cannot be waived,
unless the job seeker either:

-   returns to their original residence, or
-   moves again to a new location that has equal or better employment
    prospects than the residence the job seeker was living in prior to
    the move that resulted in the employment related exclusion period
    being imposed

When a MALEP Assessment is not required

Job seekers are not subject to MALEP if they receive either:

-   Parenting Payment with mutual obligation requirements, or
-   Special Benefit (SpB) with mutual obligation requirements (such as,
    they are not subject to Nominated Visa Holder mutual obligation
    requirements)

A MALEP Assessment is not required and the move is 'automatically
approved' if:

-   the job seeker's previous and new address are both in the same town
    and postcode
-   the job seeker is moving to 1 of the 5 major metropolitan areas in
    Australia - Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth or Adelaide, or
    within 90 minutes travel from 1 of these areas

MALEP Assessment - Comparing Labour Markets

The application of MALEP initially starts with the analysis and
comparison of 2 local labour markets - the one where the job seeker
currently resides and the one to which the job seeker proposes to or has
moved to.

As a general rule, if the area to which the job seeker proposes to move
has an unemployment rate at least 2% higher than that in the area where
they currently reside, a MALEP employment related exclusion period will
apply unless the job seeker:

-   has an acceptable reason for the move
-   will reside within a reasonable commuting distance of a labour
    market that has an unemployment rate equal to or better than their
    previous address, or provides sufficient evidence to confirm they
    would not be lowering their employment prospects

MALEP Assessment - Acceptable Reasons for Moving

Where a job seeker has moved to an area of lower employment prospects, a
MALEP employment related exclusion period will be applied unless it can
be demonstrated that the job seeker has an acceptable reason for moving.

Careful consideration should be given to every job seeker's individual
circumstances, however the job seeker will only be considered to have an
acceptable reason if they:

-   are moving in order to accept, or commence a confirmed offer of
    suitable employment
-   are moving in order to undertake a labour market programme or a
    rehabilitation programme approved by the Department of Employment
    and Workplace Relations
-   are moving to a labour market that has demonstrated demand for the
    job seeker's skills (thereby increasing their chances of securing
    employment)
-   are going to live with or near a family member who has already
    established residence (must have been living in the new residence
    for at least 26 weeks) in the new area
-   dependent job seekers who move when their parent changes residence
    (Youth Allowance only)
-   are moving to treat or alleviate a physical disease or illness
    suffered by the job seeker or an immediate family member
-   are moving because of an extreme circumstance, for example, family
    and domestic violence, destruction of family home, etc
-   have been transient or homeless and has been offered stable
    long-term accommodation in the new area, or
-   have been given an offer of public housing and there is no other
    suitable houses on offer within an area of better employment
    prospects, or
-   will suffer unreasonably severe financial difficulties if they are
    to remain at their current location

The onus is on the job seeker to provide the Service Officer with
sufficient evidence to verify they have an acceptable reason for moving.
The Service Officer must ensure this evidence is clearly documented or
scanned on the job seeker's record when recording the MALEP Assessment
outcome. For more information and example of evidence required see the
Resources page.

Note: commuting time should be calculated using the transport method the
person has available to them such as car, bike and public transport. If
'Whereis.com' is used to make a decision, then it must be documented on
the job seeker's record that Whereis.com was used in the calculations.

MALEP and unemployment due to a voluntary act or misconduct

Where voluntary unemployment has occurred as part of moving to the new
area, a compliance investigation is required. Any period the MALEP
employment related exclusion period and financial penalty as a result of
compliance overlap may be served concurrently.

If a job seeker leaves work voluntarily or due to misconduct and
received relocation assistance to start the job, a MALEP should not be
investigated where the job seeker remains in the location for which they
were paid relocation assistance.

If however, the job seeker left the same job for which they received
relocation assistance to move to a location other than their previous
home address, a MALEP investigation may be appropriate.

Recording the MALEP Assessment outcome

MALEP decisions are recorded on the Incident Summary (BIIS) and Incident
Details (BIDE) screens.
