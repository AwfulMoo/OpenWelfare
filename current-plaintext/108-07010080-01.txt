This document outlines the Fair Entitlements Guarantee (FEG) and General
Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme (GEERS) programs and the
eligibility criteria.

Commencement dates of FEG and GEERS

The Fair Entitlements Guarantee (FEG) and General Employee Entitlements
and Redundancy Scheme (GEERS) are programs run by the Department of
Education, Skills and Employment. GEERS was established on 12 September
2001 to replace the Employee Entitlement Support Scheme (EESS). FEG was
established from 5 December 2012 and has replaced GEERS. These programs
assist people whose employment was terminated due to their employer's
insolvency or bankruptcy.

Fair Entitlements Guarantee (FEG)

To be eligible for the FEG, claimants must meet the conditions of
eligibility as prescribed by the Fair Entitlements Guarantee Act 2012
(the FEG Act). The conditions are:

The claimant's employment has ended

The claimant's former employer entered liquidation or bankruptcy on or
after 5 December 2012

The end of the claimant's employment:

-   was due to the insolvency of their employer, or
-   occurred less than six months before the appointment of an
    insolvency practitioner for the employer, or
-   occurred on or after the appointment of an insolvency practitioner
    for the employer

The claimant is owed employment entitlements

The claimant has taken steps to prove those debts in the winding up or
bankruptcy of the employer

At the time the claimant's employment ended, they were an Australian
citizen or, under the Migration Act 1958, the holder of a permanent visa
or special category visa; and

The claimant has made an effective claim for assistance. To make an
effective claim, the claimant must lodge a FEG claim form and include
all mandatory information and documentation. Claims must also be made:

-   no more than 12 months after the end of the claimant's employment or
    the date of the insolvency event (whichever is later), and
-   before the discharge of the claimant's former employer's bankruptcy
    (if their employer was a bankrupt)

General Employee Entitlement and Redundancy Scheme (GEERS)

To be eligible for GEERS, claimants must meet all of the eligibility
requirements outlined in the GEERS Operational Arrangements.

To receive GEERS assistance:

The claimant must be an employee of an employer who has entered
liquidation or bankruptcy before 5 December 2012

The termination of the claimant's employment must be linked to the
insolvency of their former employer. The link between termination of
employment and insolvency will usually be clear when their employment
has ceased in one of the following ways:

-   their employment was terminated because an insolvency practitioner
    was appointed to their employer
-   they resigned after the appointment of an insolvency practitioner to
    their employer, or
-   they resigned or their employment was terminated in the six month
    period before an insolvency practitioner was appointed to their
    employer

They must be owed eligible employee entitlements by their employer and
their entitlements must be provided for in an industrial instrument,
such as legislation, an award, an agreement or a written contract of
employment

They must be an Australian citizen or the holder of a permanent resident
visa

Department of Education, Skills and Employment must receive a GEERS
claim within 12 months of one of the following events (whichever
occurred last):

-   the termination of the claimant's employment
-   resignation from employment, or
-   the date the insolvency practitioner was appointed to their employer

People not eligible for FEG or GEERS

FEG or GEERS assistance is not available for excluded employees
(including company directors, principals of bankrupt employers and their
relatives), contractor, subcontractor, agent, shareholder, investor, and
volunteer, or are owed money by the employer for any reason other than
in respect of eligible employee entitlements.

Treatment of payments from FEG or GEERS

Payments from the FEG or GEERS are treated as any other termination
payments. An Income Maintenance Period (IMP) and/or a Liquid Assets
Waiting Period (LAWP) is assessed as if the payments were received
directly from the employer on termination.

Overpayments

Services Australia is advised of recipients of the FEG and GEERS funding
on a regular basis through liaison between the Department of Education,
Skills and Employment and the National Business Gateway. Where a FEG or
GEERS claimant is overpaid by the Department of Education, Skills and
Employment, Services Australia is notified of these overpayments so the
customer's income support payment can be adjusted accordingly (for
example, reversal of any coded income as per original Department of
Education, Skills and Employment advice and pay arrears if appropriate).

website which provides extensive details about FEG and GEERS.
