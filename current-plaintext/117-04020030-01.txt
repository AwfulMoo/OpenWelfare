This document outlines the method for altering a compensation preclusion
period where special circumstances exist.

Compensation - related preclusion period

Use this process to change the future part of a preclusion period. Do
not use if:

-   a social security debt needs changing, or
-   a further preclusion period will be aggregated in the future, or
-   changing the preclusion period also results in a change to the
    customer's social security debt

Use this process when a decision maker has made a new decision about a
preclusion period or an Authorised Review Officer, tribunal or court:

-   has decided to change a preclusion period to end on a new date
    because of special circumstances, and
-   the decision does not include a specific amount to be disregarded
