subject to CPI increases each financial year. For the period 2 July to

Annual subsidy cap scenario

The following is a scenario of how families can access the Child Care
Subsidy (CCS) annual subsidy cap when they have multiple children
attending an In Home Care (IHC) service.

Scenario:

Sam and David are shift workers and have been connected with an in home
carer through an IHC support agency. They have a combined annual income
of $201,000 so are subject to the CCS annual subsidy cap.

Sam lodges a claim for CCS for their three children Zander, Ryder and
Holly, and is assessed as eligible for all three children. As IHC is
provided at the family level the enrolment notice submitted by the IHC
service will only be for one child, in this instance Zander. The session
reports submitted to the agency at the family level will be linked to
Zander’s record.

As Sam and David are subject to the annual subsidy cap, once this is
reached for Zander, the IHC service will lodge a new enrolment for
Ryder. Sam will need to confirm the enrolment notice for Ryder before
CCS can again be paid. The family attendance information will continue
to be submitted and will now be linked to Ryder’s record.

The same process would apply for Holly once the annual subsidy cap is
reached for Ryder.

Multiple Child Subsidy (MCS) scenario

Hannah and Michael have three children, Melissa aged 4, Renee aged 3 and
Jess aged 1. Due to the parents’ working commitments they need to access
an In Home Carer (IHC) through an IHC support agency for Melissa and
Renee, Jess continues to attend regular Centre Based Day Care (CBDC).

The family has 3 children aged 5 or under so they are entitled to the
higher CCS percentage increase of 30% for Renee and Jess up to a maximum
of 95%. As Melissa and Renee are attending an IHC service, the family:

-   will not be entitled to the higher CCS rate for any sessions of care
    Melissa and Renee attend at the IHC service
-   will be entitled to the higher CCS rate for Jess as she is attending
    a CBDC
