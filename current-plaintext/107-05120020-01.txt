This document outlines when new and partially recovered small debts are
waived.

Cost effective debt recovery

Provisions to waive small debts are contained within the:

-   Social Security Act 1991
-   Family Assistance (Administration) Act 1999, and
-   Paid Parental Leave Act 2010

These provisions allow delegated Debt staff to waive small debts where
it is not cost effective to pursue recovery. This applies to new debts
with a value of less than $50.

Debts raised under the Student Assistance Act 1973 are limited to a
waiver amount of $50. This applies to the following debt types:

-   ABSTUDY
-   ABSTUDY Pensioner Education Supplement (PES)
-   Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) Scheme
-   Financial Supplement Loan (FSL) for ABSTUDY or ABSTUDY PES students

Raise debts over $50 unless other waiver provisions are applicable.

Advance payments

A customer cannot receive an Advance payment while owing a debt to the
Commonwealth. If a customer requests an advance and a small amount is
still outstanding staff do not waive the balance:

-   the debt cannot be legally waived
-   the customer can pay the remainder of the debt to allow approval of
    the new advance

Automatic small debt waivers

The system may automatically waive small debts for certain payment
types. Debts that require further investigation or actions will require
manual action. For example, see Cancellation of Pensioner Education
Supplement (PES), ABSTUDY PES and Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC)
PES payments. Generally for the system to waive a small debt, the debt
will need to meet the following criteria:

-   a reassessment produces a 'negative adjustment' on the Assessment
    Results (AR) screen
-   the debt is not for Family Tax Benefit (FTB), and
-   the amount is less than $50

The system may also waive a small debt if:

-   a customer's payment is cancelled and they have received an advance.
    The amount outstanding is less than $50. The amount will be auto
    waived (any amount $50 and over will be automatically raised)
-   after FTB reconciliation occurs, any debt confirmed to be less than
    $50 is automatically waived. Manually action small FTB amounts if
    they are generated outside of the reconciliation process (see below)

A debt recalculation may include a period for a previously waived debt
(for example, because it was less than $50). See Reversal of waivers

Waivers, like any other decision, can be reviewed and changed.

When waiving a debt of less than $50, either automatically or manually,
no Recovery Fee is applied.

Note: there is no requirement to record the legislative reason for a
waiver on a DOC when the waiver is automatic. This is contained in
Section 6A of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999.

Interest Charge automatic small debt waivers

If a customer pays the balance of all outstanding debts (including any
interest payable), the residual interest calculated for the final period
will waive automatically if it is less than $200.

For example, when a debtor has paid their debt in full, and the final
residual interest is:

-   less than $200, the system will automatically waive it
-   more than $200, the system will create a Manual Follow-up (MFU) for
    Debt Recovery staff. The customer is contacted to recover the
    residual amount outstanding

Manual small debt waivers

A debt for less than $50 may be manually added (via the Add Debt (OPAD)
screen). The Debt Management and Information System (DMIS) will
automatically go to the Add Waiver (OPWAA) screen. Waive the debt with a
reason code of 'LTF' (less than fifty).

Record the details on a DOC as per minimum DOC standards for debt
waivers.

Family Tax Benefit (FTB) small debt waivers

If a 'negative adjustment' of less than $50 is created for FTB, the
screen flow will go from the Assessment Results (AR) screen to the
Assessment Consequences (ASC) screen.

Once on the ASC screen, staff can decide to:

-   manually waive the amount, or
-   refer it for further action/investigation

FTB debts of less than $50 can only be waived if it is a qualification
debt.

Debt shells for small amounts not qualification related should be
'finalised, no debt' with a reason code of 'FAM'. The amount is included
in reconciliation.

Recovery Fee and small debt waivers

Do not apply a recovery fee when waiving a working age payment debt of
less than $50. This is for debts with a debt reason of:

-   IES (own earnings undeclared/coded)
-   ISI (own earnings wrongly declared/coded), or
-   UCE (undeclared cash earnings (customer portion only)

Parental Leave Pay (PPL) small debt waivers

A debt waiver reason code 'LTW' (less/likely less than $200) is only for
PPL. The waiver may be applicable when it is not cost effective to
recover the remaining amount, that is the debt is:

-   equal to or more than $50, and
-   less than $200

Only Debt staff can use this waiver reason. Do not use this during
general debt raising as a waiver reason.

Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (PGPA) debts

There is no legislative basis to waive PGPA debts.

The PGPA replaced the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997
(FMA) from 1 July 2014.

Income Management customer debts less than $50

Treat these debts the same as other customer debts less than $50 under
the:

-   Social Security Act
-   Family Assistance Act
-   Paid Parental Leave Act, or
-   Student Assistance Act

Social workers' role in Payments and Integrity

Referral to Services Australia social workers within Payments and
Integrity may be appropriate. They provide support to customers who are:

-   vulnerable 'at risk'
-   have complex needs, or
-   have barriers to economic and social participation

The additional problem of managing multiple debts from Services
Australia and other institutions can be overwhelming. This can result in
a greater risk of non-compliance. For more information, see Social
workers role in Payments and Integrity.
