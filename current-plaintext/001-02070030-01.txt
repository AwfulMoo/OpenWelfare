This document outlines the Department of Employment and Workplace
Relations process that occurs where there is a breakdown of the
relationship between a job seeker and their Workforce Australia
Employment Services Provider.

Relationship failure between Workforce Australia and the job seeker

Transfer between Workforce Australia providers are the responsibility of
providers and the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations.

Where the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations determines
the relationship between a job seeker and their Workforce Australia
provider has broken down, they may transfer the job seeker to another
Workforce Australia provider where one is available. The request to
transfer can be initiated either by the job seeker or a Workforce
Australia provider.

The role of Services Australia

Job seekers who approach the agency about a breakdown in their
relationship with their Workforce Australia provider should be advised
to discuss this with their provider in the first instance. Workforce
Australia providers have processes in place to deal with these
situations. The agency should only tell job seekers to contact the
Department of Employment and Workplace Relations National Customer
Service Line in limited circumstances as detailed below.

When to refer job seekers to the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations Customer Service Line

Job seekers should initially talk to their providers about a transfer to
another provider. However, in limited circumstances, job seekers
requesting a transfer may be advised to directly contact the Department
of Employment and Workplace Relations Customer Service Line for job
seekers, to request referral to another provider. This includes job
seekers who:

-   refuse to engage with their Workforce Australia provider, or
    approach a new provider
-   can clearly demonstrate they will receive better servicing if they
    transfer to another provider, or that they have had a relationship
    breakdown with their provider which prevents them from receiving
    appropriate servicing
-   have a restricted servicing agreement in place that indicate a
    restriction on face to face service by Workforce Australia providers
-   want to have a declined transfer request reviewed
-   have level 3 incident reports recorded on the Customer Incident
    Management System (CIMS)

If there are serious Services Australia or Department of Employment and
Workplace Relations incidents recorded, staff should use their
discretion in regards to sending the job seeker to their provider. If
there is doubt, tell the job seeker to contact the Department of
Employment and Workplace Relations Customer Service Line, see the
Resources page for contact details.

Outstanding participation suspension at the time job seeker requests transfer

A participation suspension (TCW or TCF) does not automatically lift when
a job seeker transfers to a new provider. The provider who serviced the
job seeker when the suspension report was generated is responsible for
notifying reconnection requirements and determining when to lift the
payment suspension. Provider contact details are contained in the
suspension report accessed via the Participation Compliance workflow and
sent to the job seeker via SMS and a suspension letter.

Service Officers are required to:

-   deliver key messages about personal responsibility and complying
    with compulsory requirements
-   provide the job seeker with the provider's contact details to
    discuss the suspension, reconnection requirements and request for
    transfer

For further information, see Provider responsibilities for managing
compliance with compulsory requirements.

Provider contacts requesting exit

Workforce Australia providers that contact the agency about a breakdown
in their relationship with a job seeker should be directed to contact
their Department of Employment and Workplace Relations Contract Manager
in the first instance.

The Resources page contains a link to the Workforce Australia website
and contact details for the Department of Employment and Workplace
Relations Customer Service Line.
