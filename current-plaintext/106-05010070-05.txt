Customers not affected by multiple entitlement exclusions

Customers are able to be suspended on Disability Support Pension (DSP)
due to specific 'return to work' reasons and at the same time claim and
become current on another social security benefit, such as JobSeeker
Payment (JSP), Youth Allowance (YA) or Parenting Payment (PP), if their
income is below the income test threshold for that payment. These
customers are not affected by multiple entitlement exclusion provisions.

It does not include the non-income support payment types of Exceptional
Circumstances Relief Payment (ECRP).

Education and employment examples of multiple entitlement exclusions

Table 1: This table describes the examples of specific education and
employment related multiple entitlement exclusions that apply to each
