This document contains information on registering a claim for the
Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme (TFES).

On this Page:

Registering a paper claim

When a paper claim for TFES is received via post, fax or email, the
Service Officer will:

-   conduct a pre-assessment check
-   register the paper claim
-   note if the claim is incomplete

Online claims

An online claim may be lodged via the Third Party Portal or the
Tasmanian Bulk Upload System (TBUS).

Basic data entry

Once a manual claim has been assessed and additional data entry is
required, the Service Officer will complete the basic data entry.

Rejecting a claim

For a manual claim to be rejected it must be registered first on the
TFES system via myHSI. A front of line claim may be rejected for the
following reasons:

-   request from the claimant, for example, submitted claim twice or
    made error
-   duplicate claim received
-   ineligible claim

Resubmissions of previously rejected claims

A manual claim may be resubmitted after rejection.

Issuing a new claim form

A new claim may be requested from the claimant due to an outdated manual
claim form being received.

The Resources page contains links to forms and various websites for
additional information on TFES.
