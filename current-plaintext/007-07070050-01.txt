This document outlines information relating to Family Tax Benefit (FTB)
dates of effect and notification requirements.

Notifying a change in circumstances

Customers receiving FTB by instalment must notify as soon as possible of
a change in circumstance that is likely to affect their eligibility to
FTB or will cause a reduction to their FTB rate. The date of effect
(DOE) is when the customer's rate is changed.

The changes that a customer must tell us about are written on the back
of letters they receive when their rate changes.

Customers claiming for a past period should keep a record of any changes
so they can let Services Australia know of these when they claim.

The date a customer's rate is changed (DOE) depends on what has happened
and whether their rate will increase or not.

Generally, except for changes in income, the customer's rate is varied
from the date of event (DOV).
