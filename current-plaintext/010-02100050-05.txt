|                                   | As the train and bus service      |
|                                   | exceed the reasonable travelling  |
|                                   | time, the appropriate mode of     |
|                                   | transport is via an economy       |
|                                   | airfare.                          |

|                                   | Mikaela is eligible for           |
|                                   | reimbursement of $230, the cost   |
|                                   | of the air ticket. Because        |
|                                   | Mikaela travelled on the          |
|                                   | appropriate mode of transport,    |
|                                   | the actual cost of the ticket is  |
|                                   | reimbursed. This is irrespective  |
|                                   | of whether a quote from QBT       |
|                                   | identifies an air ticket as       |
|                                   | costing more or less than the     |
|                                   | $230 amount paid by Mikaela. The  |
|                                   | actual cost of the ticket is      |
|                                   | reimbursed and therefore          |
|                                   | obtaining a quote from QBT is not |
|                                   | necessary.                        |
