For Complex Assessment Officer (CAO) use only

This document outlines attributable stakeholders' role in controlled
private companies. From 1 January 2002, the rules on how we assessed
private companies and their treatment under the income and assets tests
changed.

On this Page:

Attributing a company's assets and income

Where a customer controls or has contributed to a private company, the
assets and income of that company may be taken into account (attributed
to the customer) when assessing the customer's entitlement to income
support payments or concessions. The determination is made by a Complex
Assessment Officer (CAO), based on information provided on the Private
Company form (MOD PC) and accompanying documents.

All customers claiming, or in receipt of, mean tested income support
payments made under the Social Security Act 1991 and Veterans'
Entitlements Act 1986 with an involvement in a private company may be
affected by attribution.

Control tests

Attribution of the income and assets of a company will be based on the
following tests:

-   formal control test
-   informal control test
-   source test

If a company is a controlled private company and customer has an
involvement, then that customer is an attributable stakeholder unless
the Complex Assessment Officer (CAO) determines otherwise.

Determining whether a customer is an attributable stakeholder

The MOD PC contains information relevant in determining whether a
customer is an attributable stakeholder, such as:

-   all parties acting as directors
-   all shareholders and the nature and extent of their share holding
-   contributors and the extent of their contribution
-   genuine investors and the extent of their investment (equity
    contribution)
-   customer's loans to the company and the extent of those loans (loan
    contribution)
-   persons who have made gifts and the extent of their gifts (gift
    contribution)
-   the relationship of the parties to each other

It will be necessary to show how the income and assets have been
apportioned, that is the percentage and/or dollar amount and to whom. It
may be possible for an organisation to have the income attributed in
different percentages or dollar amounts to the attribution of the
assets.

Relevant factors stipulated by legislation

Relevant factors stipulated by legislation for an attribution decision
are:

-   the strength of control available to be exercised (for example,
    whether control is shared)
-   the exercise of control in practice
-   whether any contributions have been made to the affected structure
    and their size in relation to the total assets of the structure
-   the scope for the controller/s to benefit from distributions
-   the history of distributions of capital and income from the
    structure
-   the use and enjoyment of the assets and/or income from the structure
-   any pre-existing or proposed attribution as determined by another
    Commonwealth department or agency (for example, Department of
    Veterans' Affairs)
-   any other factor that, in the opinion of the Secretary of the
    Department of Social Services, should be taken into account

Reconsideration of customer as an attributable stakeholder

If the outcome is that the customer is to be considered an attributable
stakeholder but the CAO or the customer considers this unfair or that it
was not an intended consequence of the legislation and policy, a
submission to have the decision reconsidered can be lodged.

If a CAO wishes to have the decision to consider the customer as an
attributable stakeholder reconsidered, all relevant information and
documents need to be collated and a formal submission made to the
National Income and Assets policy Level 2 helpdesk. The helpdesk may
consult with the Level 3 helpdesk. If needed the Level 3 helpdesk will
consult with the Department of Social Services (DSS).
