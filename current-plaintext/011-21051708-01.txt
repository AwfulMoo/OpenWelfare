This document outlines details about evidence of identity (EOI) required
for individuals who apply for an Individual Healthcare Identifier (IHI).

On this page:

EOI document

If a person is not eligible for Medicare or a Department of Veterans
Affairs (DVA) pension or benefit, they must provide evidence of their
identity to register for an IHI.

An IHI gives access to online proof of vaccination history.

The EOI documents provided at the time of registration are recorded in
the Consumer Directory Maintenance System (CDMS). Only the document
types, for example an Australian driver licence or foreign passport are
recorded.

Do not record the document identification numbers, for example driver
licence number or a passport number.

See Create Verified Individual Healthcare Identifier (IHI) in Healthcare
Identifiers (HI) Service for more details.

Document certification

Evidence of identity documentation needs to be certified as true copies
of the original document.

See the Resources page for a link to how to get certified copies.

Documents to confirm EOI for an IHI

The customer must supply either 1 primary or 2 secondary documents.

Primary document list:

-   Australian passport
-   foreign passport or travel document with valid Australian visa
-   Australian driver licence
-   photo identification card issued by the Commonwealth, state or
    territory government
-   Australian birth certificate or birth extract

Secondary document list:

-   Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) issued United Nations
    convention travel document
-   foreign government issued documents (for example, driver licences)
-   security guard/crowd control photo licence
-   consular photo identity card issued by DFAT
-   Australian tertiary student photo identity document
-   Australian secondary student photo identity document
-   certified academic transcript from an Australian university
-   Australian bank or financial institution card

Note: if a person is asking for a pseudonym IHI they must already have a
verified IHI. This means they have already supplied the necessary
documents from the above list, or be eligible for Medicare.

Pseudonym applications are always processed by Tier 3.

The Resources page includes a link to the Services Australia website for
how to get certified copies.
