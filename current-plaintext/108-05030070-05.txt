|                                   | taxable income is $178,000; the   |
|                                   | claim will reject due to income.  |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | 2019 when more unpaid leave will  |
|                                   | be taken.                         |

|                                   | As Marly's nominated start date   |
|                                   | is still in the same financial    |
|                                   | year as the original nominated    |
|                                   | start date and not before the     |
|                                   | date of claim, the income is      |
|                                   | still based on 2017/2018          |

|                                   | be rejected.                      |
