BasicsCard merchant application process

Stores or businesses can apply to be a BasicsCard merchant by
downloading a BasicsCard Merchant Application pack from the Services
Australia website. Application packs can also be sent out by contacting
the Merchant Helpdesk. See the Resources page for a link to the
application pack and contact details for the Merchant Helpdesk.

Income management

Income management is designed to ensure that money provided for the
welfare of individuals and their families is spent on priority goods and
services.

Income management is a practical measure to assist customers to meet
essential household needs and expenses. It does not reduce a customer's
entitlements, rather it sets aside a percentage of certain income
support and family payments to be spent on priority goods and services
such as food, housing, clothing, education and health care.

Customers cannot purchase alcohol, home brew concentrate, home brew
kits, tobacco, pornography or gambling products and services with income
managed funds. Customers receive the remaining part of their payments as
usual, and have total discretion to spend that money as they wish.

How income management can benefit a business

Once a business is approved to receive income managed funds it may
benefit in the following ways:

-   receiving frequent and regular payments
-   improved cash flow
-   improved financial planning
-   a reduction in overdue bills
-   a reduction in the amount of time and/or money spent on
    administering bad debts and service disconnections

Different ways a business can receive income managed funds

There are various ways in which a business can receive income managed
funds. These include:

-   a direct deduction facility
-   manual 'one off' payments
-   the BasicsCard (EFTPOS network)

BasicsCard

The BasicsCard provides customers on income management with greater
choice and flexibility to purchase priority goods and services from a
broad range of merchants. Customers can use their BasicsCard at approved
stores and businesses that display a BasicsCard sticker.

The BasicsCard is a PIN protected card which allows customers to access
their income managed money through a business or store's EFTPOS
facilities.

The BasicsCard cannot be used to purchase:

-   alcohol
-   home brew concentrate
-   home brew kits
-   pornography
-   tobacco
-   gambling products, or
-   gift cards/vouchers.

The BasicsCard can also not be used for:

-   cashout from a store or ATM
-   book up (obtaining goods on credit)

Locating organisations where a BasicsCard can be used

The 'Find a business or organisation' search facility available on the
Services Australia website can be used to search for BasicsCard
businesses and organisations.

See the Resources page for a link to the Organisation Finder Service.

Guidelines for storage of confidential information

Guidelines have been developed for Third Party Organisations (TPO) to
help meet their obligations to securely store confidential documents.
See the Resources page for a copy of the guidelines.

The Resources page contains links to the Income Management organisations
page and the BasicsCard for businesses page on the Services Australia
website. This page also links to a search tool for businesses already
registered for BasicsCard, the Organisation Finder Service for Third
Party Organisations, as well as information for merchants regarding the
secure storage of records.
