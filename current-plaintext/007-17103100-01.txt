This document outlines Child Care Subsidy (CCS) and Additional Child
Care Subsidy (ACCS).

Government intent

The intent of the Child Care Subsidy (CCS) and Additional Child Care
Subsidy (ACCS) is to simplify the current child care assistance suite of
payments. It will provide better targeted assistance for low and middle
income families and additional support for vulnerable families.

CCS replaces Child Care Benefit (CCB) and Child Care Rebate (CCR). ACCS
replaces Special Child Care Benefit, Grandparent Child Care Benefit, and
Jobs Education and Training Child Care Fee Assistance.

CCS and ACCS commenced 2 July 2018.

Child Care Subsidy (CCS)

Child Care Subsidy (CCS):

-   is income and activity tested
-   is based on actual hourly session fees capped for each service
-   is for children attending an approved child care service
-   is paid directly to the approved child care service in arrears, and
-   is passed onto families as a fee reduction

Additional Child Care Subsidy (ACCS)

Additional Child Care Subsidy (ACCS) provides targeted additional fee
assistance to families and children facing barriers in accessing
affordable child care.

Families may be able to access further assistance through ACCS in the
following circumstances:

-   ACCS (Grandparent) - for grandparents receiving an income support
    payment who have 65% or more care of a grandchild and substantial
    responsibility for the day to day decisions about the care and
    welfare of the child
-   ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship) - short term assistance for
    families experiencing significant financial stress due to
    exceptional circumstances
-   ACCS (Transition to Work) - for families transitioning to work from
    an income support payment with a Job Plan (Participation Plan) or
    Disability Support Pension Participation Plan, or undertaking an
    approved study or training activity
-   ACCS (child wellbeing) - to support the safety and wellbeing of
    children (claimed by approved child care services only)

ACCS hierarchy

A customer can only be eligible for one type of Additional Child Care
Subsidy (ACCS) payment at a time for a session of care.

The order of hierarchy for ACCS is:

-   ACCS (child wellbeing)
-   ACCS(Grandparent)
-   ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship)
-   ACCS (Transition to Work)
-   Child Care Subsidy (CCS)

Where a customer is eligible for more than one type of ACCS for a
session of care, the type of ACCS higher in the hierarchy will take
precedence. For example, if a customer meets the criteria for ACCS
(Grandparent) and ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship) for a session of
care, they will be assessed as eligible for ACCS (Grandparent).
