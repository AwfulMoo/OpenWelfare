| 1                                 | What does ‘eligible to receive an |
|                                   | income support payment’ mean?     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If a carer or close relative had  |
|                                   | lodged an appropriate claim, and  |
|                                   | at the date of event (DOV) they   |
|                                   | would have qualified for an       |
|                                   | Australian Government income      |
|                                   | support payment (ISP). This       |
|                                   | includes ISP granted at a zero    |
|                                   | rate.                             |

|                                   | The ISP only needs to be payable  |
|                                   | at the DOV, not for the entire    |
|                                   | period (prior 2 or 5 years) the   |
|                                   | carer or close relative has lived |
|                                   | in the principal home.            |

|                                   | There is no requirement for a     |
|                                   | carer or close relative to lodge  |
|                                   | a claim to test their ISP         |
|                                   | eligibility where it is only for  |
|                                   | aged care protected person        |
|                                   | purposes.                         |

|                                   | A carer does not have to receive  |
|                                   | Carer Payment or Carer Allowance  |
|                                   | to be considered a carer for aged |
|                                   | care purposes.                    |

| 2                                 | Is a protected person eligible    |
|                                   | for Carer Payment when the care   |
|                                   | recipient enters care?            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A protected person only has to be |
|                                   | eligible to receive a Carer       |
|                                   | Payment at the DOV, not receive   |
|                                   | the payment.                      |

|                                   | Eligibility for Carer Payment     |
|                                   | continues for 14 weeks from the   |
|                                   | date that the care recipient      |
|                                   | enters residential care, however  |
|                                   | a Carer Allowance payment is      |
|                                   | cancelled effective from the care |
|                                   | recipient’s date of entry. As     |
|                                   | long as the protected person      |
|                                   | remains qualified during this 14  |
|                                   | week period, the protected person |
|                                   | status applies.                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | When the 14 weeks has passed, the |
|                                   | protected person must be eligible |
|                                   | to receive another income support |
|                                   | payment for the former principal  |

|                                   | There may also be reasons that    |
