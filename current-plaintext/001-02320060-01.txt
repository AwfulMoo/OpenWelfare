This document provides information about the early finalisation of an
Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) report. This is required where a
new ESAt referral needs to be made and a previous ESAt report is not yet
finalised.

If a new ESAt is required, a request for an ESAt can be made and
Assessment Services will follow the below process for early finalisation
of previous ESAt.

Automatic finalisation

An ESAt referral can only be made when a previous ESAt report has a
status of 'Finalised'. This means any new ESAt referrals required within
the 28 day period a report takes before automatically finalising, cannot
be made unless the previously submitted ESAt report is finalised early.

New ESAt referral required

There are a number of instances where a new ESAt referral is required
before the initial ESAt report has been finalised. For example, the
customer lodges an appeal within 28 days of the initial ESAt and a new
ESAt is required.
