+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+

Couple run a farm, as well as agistment (directly related business).

The farm has a cash turnover of $180,000 and deductions of $250,000 =
net income is $70,000.

The agistment has a cash turnover of $350,000 and deductions of $300,000
= nett income is $50,000.

They then receive non-farm income totalling $60,000 shared equally
between them ($30,000 each).

Combine the net positions of the farm business and directly related
business, the farm business income is -$20,000, this will trigger the
allowable reduction. The most they can reduce their non-farm income is
$20,000 in total between them. This reduction of $20,000 can be
apportioned between partners at whatever percentage they prefer (for
example, 50/50, 70/30, 100/0, 0/100).

The assessable employment income will be reduced to $40,000, the
employment income would need to be reported as fortnightly income as per
current reporting requirements, not as a lump sum estimate.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| Net position          | -$80,000              | $70,000               |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

Single farmer has a farm, job and cash invested

-   Farm has a cash turnover of $180,000, deductions of $260,000. Net
    income is -$80,000
-   Wages and income are $70,000
-   The loss of the farm is greater than the wages, and less than
    $100,000 limit

Therefore, all assessable income from wages are reduced by $70,000, and
the single farmer has no income to be applied to the FHA income test.

Scenario 3 for farm business losses - Farm business making a profit

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| Allowable deductions  | $100,000              | -                     |

| Gross income (other   | -                     | -$150,000             |

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| Net Position          | $20,000               | -$150,000             |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

-   Farm business is making a profit of $20,000
-   The unrelated business is running at a loss of $150,000
-   The hairdresser loss cannot be offset against the farm profit as
    this is not a directly related business
-   For the purposes of FHA, the income to be assessed for FHA is
    $20,000

| Net Position          | -$180,000             | $120,000              |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

Farm has a cash turnover of $120,000 and deductions of $300,000, net
income is -$180,000 and gross wages are $120,000

-   Up to $100,000 of the farm business loss can be used to reduce the
    assessable income
-   The assessable wages income for FHA purposes is $20,000

Scenario 5 for farm business losses - Complicated businesses

If more than one person has an equal share in the farm business, the net
position of the farm business is split according to how many people were
involved in the farm.

For example, if the farm has a loss of $180,000 this would be split as
follows:

-   2 people would be 50% = -$90,000
-   4 people would be 25% = -$45,000

The allowable reduction applied to each individual's income would be as
per their apportionment percentage recorded.

Scenario 6 for farm business losses - customer provides new farm business estimate

A current customer has non-farm income with a farm business estimate
loss of $10,000 recorded since 2018.

The customer contacts on 22 February 2020 and gives a new farm business
estimate loss of $90,000.

The new farm business income estimate is applied from 22 February 2020
(date of notification).
