This document outlines information on processing Manual Follow-ups (MFU)
tax activities for debt/s raised for an arrears payment.

Calculation of arrears payment

The tax system calculations are based on receipt of payment within a
financial year. Arrears payments are reported on the payment summary in
the year in which they were paid.

If arrears will be recovered, the debt is raised for the actual date the
arrears payment was received.

Action MFU tax activities

The MFU tax activity:

flags that the payment summary will not issue, and

must be actioned to:

-   correct the negative amount, and
-   issue the payment summary to the customer

Compliance and Debt Operations (CDO) staff will:

-   investigate the errors
-   correct the debt component amounts in the customer's record
-   determine when an MFU tax activity must be reassigned to a non CDO
    team for corrective action, and
-   send a TZSMFU Referral Fast Note with action required

MFU tax activities that do not require access to the 'Change' function
on the Tax Payment Summary (TXGS) screen will be reallocated.
