| Example                           | Description                       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Legally recoverable debt for      |
|                                   | Youth Allowance (YA)              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | On 1 February 2018 a customer     |
|                                   | provides a copy of their parent's |
|                                   | tax Notice of Assessment (TNA)    |
|                                   | for the previous financial year   |
|                                   | (that is, for the 2016-17 year).  |
|                                   | The TNA is dated 1 November 2017. |
|                                   | There is an increase in the       |
|                                   | actual income from the 2015-16    |
|                                   | financial year to the 2016-17     |
|                                   | financial year. The increase      |
|                                   | meets the 125% rules.             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The system applies the actual     |
|                                   | income from 23 September 2017.    |
|                                   | This generates a debt from 23     |
|                                   | September 2017 to 31 January      |
|                                   | 2018. The debt start date is the  |
|                                   | Entitlement Period Start Date     |
|                                   | (EPSD) of the period that ends on |
|                                   | or after 1 October. In this case, |
|                                   | the customer's is pay code 4, so  |
|                                   | the start date is 23 September    |
|                                   | 2017.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The portion of the debt that is   |
|                                   | legally recoverable is from the   |
|                                   | first day of the period that      |
|                                   | includes 1st January to the 31st  |
|                                   | January 2018. For this customer   |
|                                   | the date would be 30 December     |
|                                   | 2017 as this is the EPSD of the   |
|                                   | first period that includes 1      |
|                                   | January 2018.                     |
