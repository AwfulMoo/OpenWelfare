Known Cuba Issue Cuba will not allow a child to be correctly added as an
active relevant dependent to a registration if the child has an ended or
ineligible 'claimed for' role, and only 1 registration is recorded for
that case. What do I need to do? Escalate the matter to a Service
Support Officer (SSO). The SSO needs to manually calculate the Child
Support rate including the relevant dependent allowance and apply a
manual periodic amount or formula modification. The initial manual
period/formula modification amount will not change unless it is manually
updated when changes that should alter the Child Support rate occur.
Manual periods/formula modifications have a 'W' warning sign in the
Preconfirmation Results window which indicates these calculations must
be considered along with other changes to eligibility to give effect to
a correct assessment.

|                                   | Reconciliation date is 10         |
|                                   | January, the end suspension date  |
|                                   | is 9 July not 10 July. Recording  |

|                                   | Therefore the end case date is    |
|                                   | also 9 July. End case date is the |
