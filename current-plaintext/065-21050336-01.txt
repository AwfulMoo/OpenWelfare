This document outlines the process for when the Aged Care Management
Payment System (ACMPS) receives means assessment data from a different
source.

On this page:

ACMPS and means assessment data from a different source

Aged care systems use means assessment data to calculate and set fees.
The Aged Care Management Payment System (ACMPS) receives means
assessment data from 2 different sources:

-   Services Australia (CLK), and
-   Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA)

Service Officers investigate and manually accept or reject means
assessment data if ACMPS:

-   is linked to 1 source of means assessment data, and
-   data from a different source is received

Reasons for a different source of means assessment data include:

Care recipient is coded as means not disclosed (MND) by Services
Australia, then

-   a means assessment is completed by Department of Veterans’ Affairs
    (DVA)

DVA is responsible for the care recipient, then

-   a change in income support payment type or cancellation of payment
    makes Services Australia responsible for investigating the means
    assessment data

Care recipients – liability and means assessment responsibility

Note: the liability and responsibility indicators may not be the same.

The agency/department with:

-   Liability for an aged care recipient makes the payment (including
    supplement and/or income support payment)
-   Responsibility for an aged care recipient is responsible for
    completing the means assessment

For example:

-   Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA) is liable for a care recipient
    who receives a DVA war widow(er)’s pension (with no DVA income
    support supplement). See the Resources page for more information on
    pension for orphans and war widow(er)s
-   Services Australia is responsible for the same care recipient as the
    agency provides means assessment information to Aged Care Management
    Payment System (ACMPS) for aged care purposes

Means Not Disclosed (MND)

For care recipients who enter care on or after 1 July 2019, ACMPS
determines the responsible agency/department.

If it is:

Services Australia

-   an entry event is sent to Customer First
-   the means assessment is completed, including if care recipient is
    MND

Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA)

-   an entry event is sent to the DVA Aged Care System
-   Aged Care Management Payment System (ACMPS) automatically applies
    MND (if applicable)
-   DVA completes the means assessment when received

For care recipients who entered care before 1 July 2019:

-   Entry events were sent to Customer First (Services Australia)
-   Services Australia was responsible for finalising the means
    assessments as MND when no means assessment was lodged
-   Customer First continues to send data to ACMPS for an MND assessment
    if any details change
-   If DVA subsequently completes a means assessment, the MND status in
    Customer First needs cancelling

Departments for Aged Care Assessments.

referral task cards, webform and the DVA website.
