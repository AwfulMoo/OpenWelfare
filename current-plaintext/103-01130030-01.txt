This document outlines when to book an Initial Assessment interview.
This procedure is to be used by the Income Management Contact Officer
(IMCO) after they receive the Notice to Commence Income Management from
the Child Protection Authority case worker.

Initial Assessment interview

The Initial Assessment interview cannot be conducted until a valid
Notice has been received from the relevant State or Territory Child
Protection Authority. The interview is booked when the Services
Australia Income Management Contact Officer (IMCO) has received the
Notice to Commence Income Management and determined the customer is
eligible for Income Management.

An Initial Assessment interview is conducted by a Service Officer for
customers referred to Child Protection Income Management to explain
Income Management in detail and to determine how the income managed
funds of the customer can be best used to meet the individuals and/or
their family's priority needs.

-   check whether the customer requires an interpreter and follow the
    process to book an interpreter for an appointment if required

-   check the customer's current rate of payment and any regular income
-   check whether the customer has any current Centrepay deductions or
    Rent Deduction Scheme payments

Failure to attend interview

Customers who fail to attend their Initial Assessment interview will:

-   have all their payments subject to auto Income Management, and
-   have their payments suspended if they do not have a follow up
    Initial Assessment interview within 14 days after auto Income
    Management commenced
