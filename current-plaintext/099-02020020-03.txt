|                                   |     members may have to ask other |

|                                   |     because they cannot say the   |

|                                   |     also be offensive to the      |
|                                   |     person for the Service        |

|                                   |     Officers should sensitively   |
|                                   |     ask the person if it is       |
|                                   |     alright for them to use the   |
|                                   |     deceased customer's name. If  |
|                                   |     the person is not comfortable |
|                                   |     with this, avoid using the    |
|                                   |     deceased customer's name      |
|                                   |     wherever possible. See        |
