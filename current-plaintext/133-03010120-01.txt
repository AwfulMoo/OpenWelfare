This document outlines how eligible families can claim the annual SIFS
online. Customers can claim SIFS for any period in the assessment year
they were not eligible for Family Tax Benefit (FTB). Customers who do
not want to claim FTB can claim SIFS. For eligible FTB customers, SIFS
is payable with FTB.

Contact about claiming

SIFS claims are assessed against circumstances for the assessment year
(2012-13 onwards). Families have until 30 June each year to lodge their
SIFS claim for the previous financial year. For example, by 30 June 2019
for the 2017-18 financial year. Note: from the 2017-18 financial year
onwards, SIFS is not payable to new customers. Grandfathering provisions
for SIFS apply for existing customers.

Claiming SIFS

Online

[] Customers need to register with an active Centrelink online account
to claim SIFS online.

ACC

Staff must complete Assisted Customer Claim (ACC) for customers who
contact and are unable or unsuitable to complete an online claim.
Collect the information to submit their SIFS claim. Advise the customer
of any documents they may need to finalise the claim.

The online claim process helps to ensure customers submit complete and
accurate claims. Customers can submit a claim after:

-   they answer all mandatory questions
-   accept a declaration

SIFS online claims for the 2017-18 and later financial years

From the 2017-18 financial year onwards, grandfathering provisions are
in place for eligible families. These customers are assessed for SIFS
(at a rate greater than nil) in respect of 30 June 2017. To keep their
SIFS grandfathering status, these families must maintain continuous
eligibility to SIFS payments from 1 July 2017. The grandfathering status
will reassess when:

-   a customer undergoes FTB reconciliation
-   their lump sum claim is assessed, or
-   their SIFS standalone claim is assessed

[] Customers who do not receive FTB for the full financial year must use
the stand-alone SIFS online claim to apply for SIFS.
