This procedure outlines how to request and manage customer tasks related
to claims for Family Tax Benefit (FTB), Parental Leave Pay (PPL) and Dad
and Partner Pay (DAP) claims and Add Newborn activities. With the
introduction of Circumstance Change Monitor (CCM) for families online
claims (OLC) and Assisted Customer Claims (ACC), customers see tasks in
their online account when they need to provide more information to
support their claim.

Requesting customer tasks

To send a request for additional information required to assess PPL, DAP
claims or PPL Add Newborn activities, use [more options] > Request
Documents in Process Direct for customers subscribed to MyGov Inbox.

To send a request for additional information required to assess FTB,
FTB/PPL combined claims, FTB or FTB/PPL combined Add Newborn activities,
use the Request Documents Q777 guided procedure in Customer First.

If an OLC (or ACC with a source code of PHO or INV) or Add Newborn
activity has been submitted, the Request Documents application will
automatically:

-   place the Social Application on hold
-   create a task for the customer in their OLC, or Add Newborn activity
-   send a paper letter to the customer
-   send an ‘on hold’ notification (depending on the customer’s
    electronic message (EM) preference)
-   update the Customer Tasks tab and Request and Manage Customer Tasks
    guided procedure in Customer First with the documents that have been
    requested from the customer
-   create a DOC/Note on the customer’s record

Managing customer tasks

If an OLC, ACC or Add Newborn activity has been submitted, staff must
use the Tasks icon in Process Direct or Request and Manage Customer
Tasks guided procedure in Customer First to manage customer tasks.

These can be used to:

-   view the customer's outstanding and completed tasks
-   update the task status (for example, from Required to Supplementary)
-   review the customer's claim

Paper claims

To send a request for additional information required to assess a
Families paper claim staff must use the Request Documents Q777 guided
procedure in Customer First.

No tasks will be created in the customer's online account.

The Resources page has examples of genuine and non-genuine attempts to
provide requested information and documents available in families claims
and Add Newborn activities in Process Direct.
