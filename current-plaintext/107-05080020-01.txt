This document outlines the steps for manually submitting debts and
re-submitting debts to an ECA.

Referral criteria

For manual referral of a debt to an ECA:

-   the customer must have at least one other debt currently with the
    ECA, and
-   all criteria for referral to an ECA must be met

Re-referral criteria

For a debt to be re-referred, it must have been returned or recalled
from the ECA. There is no limit to the number of times a debt can be
re-referred.

Before re-referring a debt to an ECA, debt staff must liaise with the
External Collection Liaison team via email to obtain approval. See the
Resources page for contact details.

Multiple debts

A customer with more than one debt may have a debt/s with:

-   an ECA, and
-   the agency

Do not recall debts from an ECA in these situations. Investigate whether
the debt/s with the agency meet the criteria for ECA referral. If so,
staff should manually refer the debt/s to an ECA or allow automatic
referral to take place.

The Resources page has contact details for External Collection Liaison
team.
