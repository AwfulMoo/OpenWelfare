This document outlines the steps in manually submitting debts and
re-submitting debts to an ECA.

Referral criteria

For manual referral of a debt to an ECA:

-   the customer must have at least 1 other debt currently with the ECA
    and
-   all criteria for referral to an ECA must be met

Re-referral criteria

For a debt to be re-referred, it must have been returned or recalled
from the ECA. There is no limit to the number of times a debt can be
re-referred.

Multiple debts

A customer with more than 1 debt may have a debt/s with:

-   an ECA and
-   the agency

Do not recall debts from an ECA in these situations. Investigate whether
the debt/s with the agency meet the criteria for ECA referral. If so,
staff should manually refer the debt/s to an ECA or allow automatic
referral to take place.
