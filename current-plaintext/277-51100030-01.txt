This document outlines how the value of private health insurance and
other medical expenses, when provided as child support or spousal
maintenance, may be assessed as maintenance income which can affect the
rate of Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A.

Examples of health expenses

Some examples of health expenses that can be treated as child support
are health insurance premiums, the cost of prescriptions and medical
equipment, the cost of medical treatment, ambulance transport, and
treatment by health professionals, etc.

For health insurance premiums:

-   only the amount paid to insure the payee and child/ren is assessed
-   the 30% government rebate available on private health insurance
    premiums must be taken off the full cost. (Premiums are generally
    quoted with the rebate already taken off)

For medical expenses, any amount the payer could claim back from
Medicare or from private health insurance is not assessed.

Some maintenance income is not assessable as it is exempt maintenance
income.

Child support agreements

Child support agreements with a start date of 1 July 2008 or later are
no longer manually assessed or coded by Centrelink staff, they are
assessed by Child Support.

For agreements with a start date before 1 July 2008, any non-cash
maintenance must be manually recorded on the Centrelink system for the
period up to and including 30 June 2008. For agreements that were in
place before 1 July 2008 that have been accepted by Child Support and
transitioned under the Child Support Scheme Reforms from 1 July 2008,
non-cash maintenance previously coded on the Centrelink system is
maintained by Centrelink.

The Resources page contains examples of assessing the value of health
insurance as maintenance income.
