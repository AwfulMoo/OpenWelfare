|                                   | full-time course would normally   |
|                                   | be expected to have an activity   |
|                                   | type of job search.               |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | A customer has been accepted into |
|                                   | the next intake of a course, but  |
|                                   | that is not for another 3 months. |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | work available, which would not   |
|                                   | affect their ability to undertake |
|                                   | the course of study. The customer |
|                                   | would be encouraged to seek       |
|                                   | temporary, part-time or casual    |
|                                   | work, even if only for a short    |
|                                   | period.                           |
