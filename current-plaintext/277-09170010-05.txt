| Example                           | Description                       |

| 1                                 | A customer dissatisfied with a    |
|                                   | care decision says:               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | ‘The care you have is wrong, I    |
|                                   | have the children with me 3       |
|                                   | nights a week so she doesn’t have |
|                                   | 100% care. I’ve told you this so  |
|                                   | many times and you still haven’t  |
|                                   | corrected the assessment. It’s no |
|                                   | wonder men kill themselves’.      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Say to the customer when reading  |
|                                   | the objection back:               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | ‘The grounds of your objection    |
|                                   | are that the mother does not have |
|                                   | 100% care of the children because |
|                                   | you regularly have them for 3     |
|                                   | nights a week.’                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | In this example:                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Record the objection as the       |
|                                   | parent disputes the care decision |
|                                   | that the other parent has 100%    |
|                                   | care, because he states he has    |
|                                   | care for 3 nights a week.         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Do not record the statement ‘It’s |
|                                   | no wonder men kill themselves’ as |
|                                   | part of the objection. This means |
|                                   | the objection does not need       |
|                                   | redacting or it that it isn’t     |
|                                   | properly made. However, the       |
|                                   | customer’s comment about          |
|                                   | self-harm needs to be managed in  |
|                                   | accordance with the security      |
|                                   | incident policy.                  |

|                                   | care decision says:               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | ‘The assessment is incorrect      |
|                                   | because Mr Jones didn’t tell you  |
|                                   | the real reason why I wouldn’t    |
|                                   | let Jack go back into this care   |
|                                   | even though the order we got a    |
|                                   | few months ago gives him shared   |
|                                   | care. I can send you the Police   |
|                                   | Report, which shows that when     |
|                                   | Jack was staying with Mr Jones a  |
|                                   | few weeks ago, they got into an   |
|                                   | argument during which Mr Jones    |
|                                   | punched Jack in the face and      |
|                                   | broke his nose. Jack texted me    |
|                                   | immediately after the incident    |
|                                   | and I picked him up and took him  |
|                                   | to hospital to get urgent medical |
|                                   | treatment. There is no way I will |
|                                   | be letting Jack go back into Mr   |
|                                   | Jones’ care until he gets his     |
|                                   | anger issues under control’       |

|                                   | In this example, do not redact    |
|                                   | the sensitive material about      |
|                                   | alleged FDV. It is relevant in    |
|                                   | making of an ‘actual care in      |
|                                   | special circumstances’ decision   |
|                                   | and must be provided to the other |
|                                   | party.                            |

|                                   | reflect the court ordered care of |
|                                   | shared care because there was an  |
|                                   | incident where you allege Mr      |

|                                   | that incident, Jack texted you    |
|                                   | and asked you to pick him up, and |
