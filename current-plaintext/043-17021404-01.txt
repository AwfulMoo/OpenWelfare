For staff in the Tasmanian Transport Programs (TTP) Team only

This document provides details for assessing an extension of time (EOT)
request for the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme (TFES). An
extension of time may be requested for any time limit specified in the
Ministerial Directions. Senior Executives of the Department of
Infrastructure and Regional Development hold the authority to make
determinations regarding an extension of time request. Claimants most
frequently request an extension for the time limit to lodge a claim.

Claimant enquires about an extension of time (EOT)

Claimants may request an EOT before or after a decision has been made on
eligibility or payment. A request may be lodged with Services Australia
or with the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development.

Making the request for EOT

All requests for an EOT must be:

-   in writing with reason as to why the extension is required
-   submitted via email, fax or post
-   relevant claim ID, shipment date, date range or circumstance

Note: EOT requests may be accepted from the claimant or claims agent.

All requests for EOT are forwarded to the Department of Infrastructure
and Regional Development by the Programme Team.
