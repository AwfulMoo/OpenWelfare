|                                   | However, if the customer          |
|                                   | indicates they have new           |
|                                   | information about their case or   |

|                                   | case, the Service Officer should  |
|                                   | encourage the customer to first   |
|                                   | contact the claim manager who     |
|                                   | investigated the claim to raise   |
|                                   | these matters. The claim manager  |
|                                   | can then explain the process for  |
|                                   | making a reconsideration request. |

|                                   | are unhappy about the decision or |
|                                   | how the agency handled their      |
|                                   | claim. Customers can contact the  |
|                                   | Ombudsmanâ€™s office for the cost   |
