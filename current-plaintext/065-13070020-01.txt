and Aged Care Management Payment System (ACMPS).

Service converts to an MPS

The Multi-Purpose Service (MPS) program provides health and aged care
services in rural and regional areas that cannot support both a hospital
and a separate aged care home. This allows people to stay in their own
communities as they get older, close to their families and community
ties.

If a government-subsidised residential aged care service converts to an
MPS, the service will cease to be eligible for residential aged care
subsidy. The Department of Health notifies Services Australia about
these service conversions as part of the service closure process.

Variation to Aged Care approved places

The Department of Health notifies Services Australia when an aged care
service receives approval for a variation to its allocation of approved
places.

The Department of Health updates the National Approved Provider System
(NAPS) with the variation to approved places. This information flows
through to the System for the Payment of Aged Residential Care (SPARC)
and Aged Care Management and Payment System (ACMPS).

Any adjustment to payment of government subsidies may need to be
applied.

From 27 February 2017, Increasing Choice in Home Care commenced. The
allocation of approved places within the Aged Care Approvals Round
(ACAR) process ceased for home care. Approved places for a home care
service applied up to and inclusive of the February 2017 claim month.

Service under administration

Aged care providers may become bankrupt or insolvent if they are unable
to repay debts. These include aged care providers that are in voluntary
administration, liquidation or receivership.

The Department of Health notifies Services Australia about aged care
providers that are under administration. Services Australia will
undertake the necessary process to ensure the government aged care
subsidies are paid correctly.

Notification of changes

Aged care services must notify the Aged Care Quality and Safety
Commission of changes to authorised contact and organisation details.
This ensures aged care services receive important notifications and
correspondence. This must be completed within 28 days of the change
occurring.

Closing a service

The Department of Health notifies Services Australia of aged care
services that are closing. Services Australia will undertake the
necessary process to ensure the government aged care subsidies are paid
correctly.
