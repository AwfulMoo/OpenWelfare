This document outlines how details of a trust or company are recorded on
an entity's record using the T&C Miscellaneous Details (TRMD) screen.

Purpose of the TRMD screen

This screen is used to record and display information such as:

-   which financial year has been used in the latest annual review of
    the organisation
-   whether an estimate or discretion assessment was applied
-   the type of organisation
-   the main business activity
-   the date of event of the last review of the organisation
-   the Attribution Period review date

The TRMD screen is updated when the organisation is first assessed and
when income reviews are completed.

If an estimate or discretion assessment is indicated then the
organisation must be reviewed within six months.
