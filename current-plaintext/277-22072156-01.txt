This page explains how to assist Child Support customers affected by
current emergency events.

Emergency events and payments

Emergency events include a major disaster, pandemic or overseas
terrorist attack.

Emergency payments may become available after an emergency event and
released after a determination by the:

-   relevant Minister (for a major disaster), or
-   Prime Minister (for an overseas terrorist attack or pandemic
    outbreak)

When the claiming period for an emergency event ends:

-   the emergency event is closed, and
-   customers may only lodge a claim where special circumstances apply

Types of payments

For declared major disasters:

-   Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment (AGDRP) and Disaster
    Recovery Payment for New Zealand non-protected Special Category
    (subclass 444) visa holders (NZ DRP)
-   Disaster Recovery Allowance (DRA) and Disaster Recovery Allowance
    for New Zealand Special Category (subclass 444) visa holders (NZ
    DRA)

For declared acts of terrorism, see Australian Victim of Terrorism
Overseas Payment (AVTOP)

Pandemic payments include:

-   COVID-19 Disaster Payments
-   COVID-19 Consumer Travel Support Program Round 2
-   Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment

Help for Child Support customers

Services Australia may endorse the following for emergency events:

-   an estimate deeming policy for Child Support customers
-   an Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment (AGDRP)
-   other emergency payments and services

If an estimate deeming policy is endorsed, customers can have the start
date of their estimate apply from the date of the event if they are:

-   financially impacted by an emergency event, and
-   eligible to lodge an estimate

Note: estimate deeming policies do not automatically apply for emergency
events.

Where an emergency event has occurred, be cautious in collection
activities.

Estimate deeming policy

Child Support estimate deeming policies allow for the customer’s
estimate, or subsequent estimate, to start from the date of the event
that affected their income. This is instead of the date the estimate was
lodged.

The agency tells staff when an endorsed estimate deeming policy applies:

-   for a specific emergency event, and
-   the effective start date

If a customers is eligible to lodge an estimate, staff can apply the
endorsed policy if the customer meets all of the following criteria:

-   They live or work in an area affected by natural disaster
-   Their income is reduced due to a natural disaster, and
-   They contacted Child Support within a reasonable period to lodge an
    estimate. A reasonable period would generally be no more than 28
    days

The endorsed estimate deeming policy applies to estimates that are
accepted, pended, or yet to be lodged.

The Resources page lists the endorsed estimate deeming policies.
