Rejection codes for advance payments

Table 3: This table contains a list of rejection codes for advance
payment requests for the Scheme. The codes are listed in alphabetical
order.

For advance requests rejected for one of the below reasons via a new
claim, the overall claim will reject for reason ARJ (advance claim
rejected). That is, if the customer has only requested an advance
payment (without a fortnightly payment), and they are otherwise
qualified to participate in the Scheme.
