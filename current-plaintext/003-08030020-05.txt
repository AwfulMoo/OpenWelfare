Substantial change in circumstances

Examples where SpB would not be payable include:

-   If a customer's available funds were depleted due to the purchase of
    a house or vehicle, the customer has not suffered a change of
    circumstances beyond their control
-   If a person is granted a permanent visa offshore and has been
    offered employment in Australia to start upon arrival. If the offer
    of employment is withdrawn before arriving in Australia, this is not
    considered a substantial change of circumstances
-   While there is an expectation that a claimant (and their partner)
    are responsible for the decisions affecting their individual
    situations, mitigating circumstances may exist that need more
    deliberation when assessing an individual's claim for SpB. The
    delegate has the authority to consider all available information
    regarding the claimant's individual circumstances before deciding if
    there was a substantial change in circumstances that was beyond the
    person's control
-   The SpB claimant and the partner decide to have a child during the
    NARWP period. The birth of a child (including multiple births) is
    not considered to be a substantial change in circumstances. However,
    discretions should be applied if there are homeless considerations
    and each case should be reviewed individually

Changes considered substantial for SpB

Table 2: examples of circumstances that would be considered a
substantial change for the purpose of qualification for SpB. The
substantial change in circumstances must have occurred after the person
arrived in Australia.

Changes not considered substantial for SpB

The following situations would not be considered a substantial change in
circumstances for the purpose of qualification for SpB - where no other
extenuating circumstances are involved.

-   Claimant and partner are separated but living under one roof
-   Partner and the visa holder separate due to breakdown of the
    relationship and there is no domestic violence involved
-   Partner misrepresents their circumstances (financial, physical,
    material) and the partnered provisional visa holder chooses to leave
    because of this
-   Partner leaves work to study or train, engages in an unprofitable
    business, resorts to excessive gambling or makes another lifestyle
    choice that impacts on the couple financially
-   A claim is lodged after 1 January 2012 and the person states they
    are unaware of the legislative change that removed family member as
    an exemption from the NARWP for partnered provisional visa holders
