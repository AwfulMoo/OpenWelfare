This document outlines information about JobSeeker Payment (JSP).

Government intent

Services Australia is committed to providing individual tailored
'service offers' as part of the life events approach which underpins the
Service Delivery Model. A service offer consists of a selection of
products and services put together in response to the customer's life
event and delivered in such a way that takes account of their individual
situation, needs and expectations.

On 20 March 2020, JobSeeker Payment (JSP) was introduced to replace the
following payments:

-   Newstart Allowance (NSA)
-   Sickness Allowance (SA)
-   Wife Pension (WP)
-   Widow B Pension (WidB)
-   Bereavement Allowance (BVA)
-   Partner Allowance (PA)
-   Widow Allowance (WA)

JSP provides financial help for customers aged 22 years and over and
under age pension age who are:

-   looking for work and willing to take part in activities that
    increase their chances of finding a job or
-   unable to work, study or look for work due to medical condition,
    illness or injury

Eligibility requirements

JSP is subject to eligibility requirements. To receive JSP, customers
are required to participate in activities that increase their chances of
finding work. This is called meeting the mutual obligation requirements.
Mutual obligation requirements differ depending on the individual's
situation, but generally, customers must apply for jobs, train or study,
or work part-time. A short term exemption from mutual obligation
requirements may be applicable in special circumstances. The amount of
JSP depends on each customer's situation and waiting periods may apply.
