Pathology assessing rules and principle and action required

Table 1 - This table describes how to assess pathology claims for VAP.

Most pathology rules are assessed by patient episode (PA date).

Effective 30 October 2011, the system uses the date of request to
determine if the services claimed are payable. Staff will not be
required to make a manual determination.

Note: there is no change to the pathology policy or business rules.

|                                   | The term 'Rule 3 exempt' (R3EX)   |
|                                   | describes an arrangement which    |
|                                   | allows for certain tests from the |
|                                   | same request to be repeated over  |
|                                   | a 24 hour or 6 month period.      |
