This document outlines the process to assist Service Officers with
handling a foreign pension claim once it has been received in a service
centre and for staff in International Services (CIS) to process the
claim before sending overseas.

Impact on mailing issues due to coronavirus (COVID-19)

Due to coronavirus (COVID-19), there may be mailing issues for customers
outside Australia and Agreement partners.

Sending foreign pension claims

Service Officers are to assist customers to claim a foreign pension if
requested.

After assisting a customer to lodge a foreign pension claim, service
centre staff must record the lodgement.

From December 2022, all foreign pension claims will be scanned. The
Process page contains more information.

CIS are responsible for:

-   processing claims from an agreement country in accordance with the
    Administrative Arrangements under the agreement, including
    completing an Agreement liaison form
-   sending foreign pension claims to the relevant authority

For known information on payments from:

-   Agreement countries, see the individual country file in
    International Social Security Agreements
-   Other significant non-agreement countries, see Eligibility and
    coding of foreign pensions from non-agreement countries. Note:
    details are not available for all countries, so staff may not be
    able to assist a customer in all cases

The Resources page contains links to the International Services homepage
and the International Program homepage. It also contains contact details
for Centrelink International Services (CIS), and a copy of the Foreign
Pension Claim coversheet.
