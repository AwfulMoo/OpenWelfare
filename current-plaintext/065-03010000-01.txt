This document outlines how a customer or an individual or organisation
correspondence nominee can claim Age Pension online, or with help from a
Service Officer using Assisted Customer Claim (ACC). Eligible customers
may also claim the Pension Bonus Payment when claiming Age Pension.

Age Pension eligibility and when to claim

A person may qualify for Age Pension if they have reached Age Pension
age and they meet Australian residence and income and asset test
requirements.

Claims can be lodged up to 13 weeks before the person's qualification
date, for example the date they reach Age Pension age.

For information about payments and services available, see Initial
contact by a customer who has retired or is about to retire.

Initial contact to claim Age Pension

[] If a customer or their nominee contacts to claim Age Pension, Service
Officers must offer an online claim first and explain the benefits of
claiming online, such as:

-   Helping to apply for the right payment through streaming questions
    and early warnings if they may not be eligible
-   Providing less information, as details from their Centrelink record
    will be pre-populated into the online claim
-   Being able to monitor the progress of their claim through their
    Centrelink online account or the Express Plus Centrelink mobile app.
    Note: the Centrelink Express Plus mobile app is not available to
    nominees acting on behalf of their principals

If the customer or the correspondence nominee declines the online claim
offer, a Service Officer can use ACC to collect claim information from a
customer or the correspondence nominee either over the phone or
face-to-face. Once ACC is completed, advise the customer or the
correspondence nominee of any outstanding documents they must provide or
action they have to take to submit their claim. Customers can submit the
documents via their online account or Express Plus Centrelink mobile
app. Alternatively, if the customer is unable to access their online
account, the Service Officer can then scan and upload the documents for
them.

If using ACC to submit a claim, the Service Officer must ask the
customer or their nominee to accept a verbal declaration. If a verbal
declaration has not been completed and documented, send the Customer
Declaration Form (CDF). The customer needs to sign and return the CDF
before submitting the claim. Once returned, scan the CDF to the
customer's record. If required, the claim can then be submitted by a
Service Officer.

If the customer or nominee is unable or unwilling to claim online or use
ACC, running the First Contact Service Offer will send out the correct
form, including if both members of a couple want to claim payment. Where
both members of a couple wish to complete their own claim for privacy
reasons, run FCSO for each of them. If the customer is a member of the
Pension Bonus Scheme and also wants to claim the Pension Bonus, Service
Officers must recommend they contact a Financial Information Service
(FIS) Officer before they lodge their claim.

Transfers and re-claims

Separate procedures apply for:

-   Transfers to Age Pension for income support payment customers
-   Re-claiming Age Pension after it has been cancelled or rejected

Online claim

[] Customers or their correspondence nominee must be registered with an
'active' Centrelink online account. Organisation nominees must be
registered for the Business Hub to access nominee services online.

Once registered, to start an online claim for Age Pension (and Pension
Bonus) they must:

-   Sign into myGov and access their linked Centrelink online account.
    Organisation nominees must log into Provider Digital Access (PRODA)
    to access nominee services in Business Hub
-   Nominees must select the person they wish to act for
-   Select the My Details from the menu, then My profile, update and
    save any changes to their personal details (such as address and
    relationship details)
-   Select Payments and Claims > Claims > Make a claim from the menu
-   From the Make a claim page select Get started under the Older
    Australians category
-   Answer the streaming questions on the Check your Eligibility page to
    check their eligibility for Age Pension, including details of
    circumstances to help the customer determine if they are in a crisis
    situation. The online claim will advise why they may not be eligible
    and refer them to the Payment and Service Finder or advise them to
    contact Services Australia to discuss a more suitable payment. They
    can select Back to return to Make a claim page to begin another
    claim type

The Next steps page advises the customer of any further information or
documentation required for their claim to be submitted.

Customers must provide all their required documents, and confirm their
identity (if there is no Identify Confirmation (ICI) recorded) to be
able to submit their claim. Some exceptions apply. To confirm their
identity they generally will need to visit a service centre to show
their identity documents. If their photo identification is verified at a
service centre, the customer can submit their remaining documents
online. Where a customer is unable to attend in person, see Supporting
Identity Confirmation for customers unable to attend in person.

If both members of a couple want to claim Age Pension online at the same
time, they will usually need to complete their own an online claim. If
certain conditions are met, the option to complete as a combined claim
is offered.

The online claim will expire after 13 weeks if not submitted.

Combined partner online claim

[] A customer may be eligible to lodge a claim on behalf of their
partner when claiming Age Pension online.

Partners of customers who wish and are eligible to lodge an Age Pension
combined partner online claim must be registered with an active
Centrelink online account and subscribed to electronic messaging.

The Age Pension combined partner claim will send a notification to the
partner asking them to log into their own online account to respond to
the customer's request to lodge as a combined partner claim. Once the
partner has completed this task and either customer or partner has
lodged all required documentation the claim will be submitted as an Age
Pension combined partner claim.

Note: the partner task must be completed within 3 days of being notified
of the task or it will disappear.

Assisted Customer Claim (ACC)

Service Officers can run ACC with the customer or correspondence nominee
to obtain and record the claim information. Service Officers can run ACC
for a combined claim where both members of the couple are eligible. They
can also run an ACC for the partner of an Age Pension combined partner
claim. A nominee cannot finalise the ACC online (unless they are nominee
for both customer and partner), see Age Pension combined partner online
claim.

ACC can also be run for an Age Pension and Pension Bonus claim. Staff
must recommend to customers that they contact a Financial Information
Service (FIS) Officer before submitting their claim. See Initial contact
to claim Pension Bonus Payment (PBP).

ACC is similar to the online claim and contains the same questions to
ask the customer. Service Officers can access ACC via the ACC desktop
icon, enter the customerâ€™s Customer Reference Number (CRN) and run the
workflow.

Start ACC with the customer, showing them how easy it is to claim
online. Encourage them to complete the rest at home in their own time.
If they submit the claim online, they can monitor the progress of their
claim through their Centrelink online account or the Express Plus
Centrelink mobile app.

To submit their claim, the customer must:

-   Answer all mandatory questions
-   Provide all required documents
-   Verify their identity if there is no Identify Confirmation (ICI)
    recorded

Exceptions apply for some vulnerable customers.

Customer declaration and submitting the claim

Once ACC has been completed by the Service Officer, the customer must
either:

[] Access the draft claim through their Centrelink online account or
Express Plus Centrelink mobile app to upload their documents and submit
the claim, or

Accept a verbal declaration and provide all required documents before
submitting their claim. Read the customer the verbal declaration script.
Tick the box on the Review you claim page if they accept. This will
confirm that the declaration script has been read, and that the customer
accepts it. Once the verbal declaration is accepted and ACC submitted a
DOC containing 'Staff assisted verbal declaration accepted - Yes' will
display in:

-   Process Direct notes
-   Customer First Super Case
-   The Customer Claim Summary

If the customer is unable or declines to make a verbal declaration, the
Service Officer must:

-   Invite the customer to log on to their online services, accept the
    customer declaration and submit their claim, or
-   Provide the customer with a Customer Declaration Form (CDF). The
    claim must not be submitted by the Service Officer without the CDF
    being completed, signed and returned

If the customer fails to submit their claim the claim will expire after
13 weeks.

Carer Payment - Home Equity Access Scheme recipients

Carers currently receiving CP that is fully-funded through the Home
Equity Access Scheme may wish to claim CP when their assets are under
the limit. Carers with a benefit status of CAR/CZR-PLS are:

-   unable to submit a CP online claim
-   unable to have ACC run, and
-   advised in the CP online claim to contact Services Australia

To issue the appropriate claim forms, run the First Contact Service
Offer (FCSO).

Lodgement of paper claim or documentation

Check documentation for the customer (and for their partner if
applicable).

If required, code the customerâ€™s identity details using the Identity
Confirmation Dashboard in Process Direct.

Scan the claim and supporting documentation on Day 1 for action by
processing staff. Only scan identity documents if they are required for
verification purposes other than identity assurance.

The Resources page contains links to the Services Australia website for
information about payments and services for older Australians, and a
link to the Customer Declaration Form.
