|                                   | Voluntary one off payments of     |

|                                   | A customer or their partner can   |
|                                   | make one voluntary payment on a   |
|                                   | debt or on a number of debts      |
|                                   | after becoming unemployed or      |
|                                   | incapacitated, with the           |
|                                   | non-compulsory amount/s being     |
|                                   | disregarded in calculating the    |
|                                   | recipient's liquid asset level.   |
|                                   | This applies only if:             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   the debt is not related to    |
|                                   |     the principal home or any     |
|                                   |     other residential property,   |
|                                   |     and                           |
|                                   | -   the payment is voluntary,     |
|                                   |     (that is, more than the       |
|                                   |     minimum payment), and         |
|                                   | -   the payment is the first      |
|                                   |     voluntary payment made on     |
|                                   |     that debt since the customer  |
|                                   |     became unemployed or          |
|                                   |     incapacitated                 |

|                                   | For example, a customer has an    |
|                                   | outstanding credit card balance   |
|                                   | of $2,000. The minimum payment is |
|                                   | $25. The customer pays the        |
|                                   | balance in full. The assessment   |
|                                   | of their liquid assets are        |
|                                   | reduced by $1,975.                |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The payment can still be          |
|                                   | disregarded if the customer makes |
|                                   | the payment while serving a LAWP, |
|                                   | that is, after the claim is       |
|                                   | processed. In this case, the      |
|                                   | claim may need reassessing to     |
|                                   | reduce the length of the LAWP.    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A one-off debt payment cannot be  |
|                                   | disregarded if the payment is     |
|                                   | made after the LAWP has been      |
|                                   | served. In this case there is no  |
|                                   | need to reassess the claim.       |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | When a self-employed customer is  |
|                                   | holding net GST liabilities,      |
|                                   | these amounts will be exempt for  |
|                                   | the purpose of calculating the    |
|                                   | LAWP.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This means that the net liability |
|                                   | is the GST collected less the     |
|                                   | input tax credits which are       |
|                                   | deducted from the amount payable  |
|                                   | to the Australian Taxation Office |
|                                   | (ATO).                            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The customer must supply evidence |
|                                   | of GST registration otherwise the |
|                                   | amounts will be included in the   |
|                                   | calculation of the LAWP.          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The customer must supply evidence |
|                                   | at the end of the payment quarter |
|                                   | that the amount was paid to the   |
|                                   | ATO otherwise an overpayment will |
|                                   | be raised and debt recovery will  |
|                                   | commence. The onus is on the      |
|                                   | customer to provide evidence of   |
|                                   | GST registration if they want     |
|                                   | their net GST liabilities to be   |
|                                   | exempt from the LAWP calculation. |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Note: GST liabilities are payable |
|                                   | to the ATO four times a year.     |
|                                   | However, the ATO has advised that |
|                                   | businesses can submit their GST   |
|                                   | liabilities as a weekly, monthly  |
|                                   | or quarterly payment. The ATO     |
|                                   | provides personalised payment     |
|                                   | books to businesses if they would |
