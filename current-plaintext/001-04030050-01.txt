This document outlines information to help Service Officers decide if a
customer is eligible for independent status for Youth Allowance (YA)
because the customer has a partial capacity to work.

Assessment of independence

YA (job seeker) may be considered independent for the period they are
assessed as having a partial capacity to work following an Employment
Services Assessment (ESAt) by an Assessment Services assessor.

Note: this assessment of independence does not apply to YA
(students/Australian Apprentices) or Disability Support Pension (DSP)
customers. They may test their qualification for independence under one
of the other categories for independence.

Reviews of independence

Once a customer is assessed as independent because they have a PCW, a
review can be manually or automatically started (for example, an
automatic review will be created if a new ESAt changes their work
capacity). Reviews monitor the customers continuing eligibility for
independent status.

Independent YA customers are not subject to assessment under the
Parental Means Tests. However, if they are still living at home they are
paid the Accommodated Independent rate.

Unfavourable decision

When making an unfavourable decision, speak to the customer:

-   explain the decision
-   give them a chance to provide more information
-   advise their review and appeal rights
