|                                   | Sue received $3,500 from a        |
|                                   | deceased estate. This was a       |
|                                   | one-off lump sum. This is         |
|                                   | considered an exempt lump sum.    |
|                                   | Sue must also advise how the      |
|                                   | money is spent as this may affect |
|                                   | Sue's payments. For example, if   |
|                                   | the money was invested, it must   |
|                                   | be determined if it is an         |
|                                   | assessable asset. Deeming rules   |
|                                   | would also apply to any money     |
|                                   | invested.                         |

|                                   |     the money. For example, if it |
|                                   |     is used to purchase a motor   |
|                                   |     vehicle, the value of the     |
|                                   |     motor vehicle will be         |
|                                   |     assessed as an asset of the   |
|                                   |     person. If is it used to pay  |
|                                   |     off a mortgage on the         |

|                                   |     asset. If it is placed in a   |
|                                   |     financial investment it will  |
|                                   |     be assessed as a financial    |
|                                   |     asset, and the interest it    |
|                                   |     earns will be treated under   |

|                                   |     which the money is put,       |
|                                   |     depends on the circumstances  |

|                                   |     treated in the same way as    |
|                                   |     any other financial asset and |
|                                   |     is assessable under the       |
