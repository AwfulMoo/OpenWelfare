This document outlines electronic funds transfers (EFT) for Medicare
claims.

Payment cycle

The Medicare patient claim EFT payment cycle takes between 1-3 days.

Payments processed before the cut-off of 6:30 pm Australian Eastern
Standard Time (AEST) are transferred into the claimant’s nominated
financial institution, in most cases, the next business day after the
claim has been processed. This excludes claims processed on weekends and
national public holidays.

Medicare cannot guarantee that in all cases, for all financial
institutions, funds will be available the next business day. This is
dependent on the individual’s bank clearance processes. Any enquiries
from the claimant regarding availability of deposits should be directed
to their financial institution.

Service Officers should perform a public security check with the
claimant, then confirm bank account details used for the funds in
question to ensure the correct details have been provided.
