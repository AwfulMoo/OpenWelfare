Claimant Declaration

"Do you declare that you have incurred the expenses for the services for
which you are claiming and that they are not for the purposes of
superannuation or provident account schemes, admission to a friendly
society, life insurance, mass immunisation, or health screening and are
not connected with the patient's employment?

To the best of your knowledge and belief, is all the information
disclosed true and correct?

Do you authorise Medicare to contact the referring practitioner or the
provider for assessment purposes?"
