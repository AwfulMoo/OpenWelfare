This document outlines how to process Out of Home Care (OOHC) requests
for Immunisation History Statements (IHS), COVID-19 digital certificates
and Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) enquiries for children under
the age of 14 years.

Children in OOHC

The AIR receives requests from organisations for IHS and COVID-19
digital certificates for individuals up to 18 years of age in OOHC.

Individuals placed in OOHC are in the legal care or guardianship of a
child protection agency. These agencies include:

-   state or territory Departments of Child Protection
-   contracted Non-Government Organisations, such as (but not limited
    to) Anglicare, Wesley Mission, Catholic Care, Barnardos etc.

A child protection agency, who have legal custody of an individual in
OOHC, must provide the appropriate documentation before the AIR can
consider a request to release a child’s IHS or COVID-19 digital
certificate. Appropriate documentation includes:

-   interim, subsequent interim or final court orders
-   letter on department/agency letterhead, fax with department/agency
    letterhead or email with department/agency signature block, stating
    the child protection agency’s legal responsibility. See the
    Resources page for approved statements of responsibility
-   Medicare card that the child is registered on with the responsible
    department; a child protection agency, guardian or foster carer
