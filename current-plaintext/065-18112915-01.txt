This document contains information on the management of providers'
details in the Aged Care Management Payment System (ACMPS).

Provider registration and management

A provider is a person or body approved by the Department of Health and
Aged Care to operate Commonwealth funded aged care services. Providers
must meet specified criteria to be approved as a provider. The provider
registration and creation process is handled by Department of Health and
Aged Care in the National Approved Providers System (NAPS). Each
provider gets its unique ID generated by NAPS.

Providers are increasingly being managed by one organisation, such as a
management company. This arrangement is normally outsourced in order to
achieve administrative efficiencies. This means a user who works at an
organisational level as well as the provider or service level can
perform transactions, including for multiple services across multiple
providers.

Note: some of the processes within this document require authorised
levels of ACMPS user access.
