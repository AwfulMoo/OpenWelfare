This document outlines how to reprint aged care system issued letters.

Viewing, reprinting or reissuing aged care letters

The process to view, reprint or reissue an aged care letter depend on
which system was used to create and send the original. Letters may be
issued by an aged care system, created manually and uploaded to Customer
First or Aged Care Management Payment System (ACMPS), or triggered by
manual letter generation in ACMPS.

Aged care letters are found in:

-   Aged Care Staff Portal (ACSP)
-   Aged Care Management Payment System (ACMPS)
-   Customer First, or
-   System for the Payment of Aged Residential Care (SPARC) for letters
    sent before 15 July 2022. See the aged care letter codes and
    descriptions table on the Resources page

Aged care letters can be reprinted when:

-   a copy of a letter is requested
-   a letter is not received

A reprint of an aged care letter can be requested by the:

-   care recipient
-   nominee, and/or
-   service provider

If a care recipient, nominee or service requests a copy of their
correspondence that is being reprinted from Customer First or ACMPS, but
has changed postal address, post it to the new address, handwritten on a
plain envelope.

Note: letters reissued in SPARC (where they are not available in ACMPS)
are printed as a manual letter.

The Resources page contains links to the aged care letter codes and
descriptions table, a letter checking task card and letter and email
templates.
