Desktop fax

Location:

Customer First/Documents & Correspondence/Desktop Fax

Description:

The Desktop Fax workflow allows users to select and fax various forms
within Customer First.

Desktop faxing is a method of transferring information that combines the
traditional facsimile (fax) machine and digital storage on a computer.
The term 'desktop fax' refers to the digital image once it has been
received through this channel. The term 'desktop faxing' refers to the
process of sending and receiving an image through this channel.

In this process, a fax machine is connected to a computer instead of a
telephone line. This computer creates an image of the original document
and saves it as a file. There is no paper copy produced at the sender's
end.
