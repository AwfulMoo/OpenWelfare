|                                   | Karen is 20 years old and has     |
|                                   | applied for Youth Allowance (YA)  |
|                                   | as a job seeker after recently    |
|                                   | becoming unemployed. The reason   |
|                                   | that Karen has become unemployed  |
|                                   | is because the law firm where     |
|                                   | Karen was working as a legal      |
|                                   | secretary has closed down. As     |

|                                   | workflow the JSCI has been        |
|                                   | completed and Karen's response to |
|                                   | one of the questions has          |
|                                   | triggered that an ESAt referral   |
|                                   | is required.                      |

|                                   | flagged. The Service Officer      |
|                                   | checks all the responses to the   |
|                                   | JSCI to see what has triggered    |
|                                   | the ESAt flag and notices Karen   |
|                                   | has answered No to the question:  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | At least one of my parents or     |
|                                   | legal guardians was regularly in  |
|                                   | paid employment when I was in my  |
|                                   | early teens' and this is the only |
|                                   | response that would have          |
|                                   | triggered the ESAt flag.          |

|                                   | During the course of the          |
|                                   | appointment the Service Officer   |
|                                   | has already learned that Karen    |
|                                   | had completed Year 12 and had a   |
|                                   | Certificate III level             |
|                                   | qualification in legal studies,   |
|                                   | which was how Karen was able to   |
|                                   | get work as a legal secretary.    |
|                                   | Karen had been in full time       |
|                                   | employment since completing the   |
|                                   | qualification and had already     |
|                                   | organised 2 job interviews in the |
|                                   | coming week and is confident of   |
|                                   | getting employment within a short |
|                                   | time period.                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | In this case, the Service Officer |
|                                   | has decided that the ESAt         |
|                                   | referral is not required as it is |
|                                   | apparent that Karen does not have |
|                                   | significant barriers to           |
|                                   | employment. The Service Officer   |
|                                   | withdraws the ESAt flag and then  |
|                                   | documents on Karen's record the   |
|                                   | reasons for the decision. The     |
|                                   | Service Officer then refers Karen |
|                                   | to jobactive.                     |

|                                   | record.                           |

|                                   | The Service Officer assessing the |
|                                   | new claim application checks      |
|                                   | Andrew's record and sees an ESAt  |
|                                   | has been conducted in the past 18 |
|                                   | months. The Service Officer opens |
|                                   | the ESAt report to look at the    |
|                                   | issues that were covered in this  |
|                                   | report. All the issues identified |
|                                   | in Andrew's most recent JSCI were |
|                                   | assessed in the ESAt report. The  |
|                                   | Service Officer makes a decision  |
|                                   | the ESAt is current and valid and |
|                                   | a new ESAt referral is not        |
|                                   | warranted in this instance.       |

|                                   | As there has been no change since |
|                                   | the ESAt was conducted the        |
|                                   | Service Officer copies the        |
|                                   | existing ESAt report onto         |
|                                   | Andrew's record so the JSCI is    |
|                                   | finalised. The Service Officer    |
|                                   | documents Andrew's record with    |
|                                   | this action and then refers       |
|                                   | Andrew to a jobactive             |

|                                   | JSP less than 12 months ago, an   |
|                                   | ESAt/ JCA was triggered by Tom's  |
|                                   | earlier time in prison. Tom has   |
|                                   | not been to prison again since    |

|                                   | circumstances to trigger an ESAt. |

|                                   | ESAt/JCA is not required. The     |

|                                   | work. Brendan advises that the    |
|                                   | condition is episodic. Brendan    |
|                                   | completed a Disability Employment |

|                                   | current ESAt report to see if it  |
|                                   | should be reapplied to enable the |
|                                   | JSCI to be finalised. The         |

|                                   | to DES. The Service Officer does  |
|                                   | not feel that Brendan requires    |

|                                   | ESAt is not required. The Service |
|                                   | Officer sends a request to        |
