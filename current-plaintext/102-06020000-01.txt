This document outlines the procedures associated with changes in the
official date of birth/age of a person's dependent(s) or child care
receiver, which may have an effect on any income support or
supplementary payment received by the person. As a result, a customer
may no longer be entitled to the payment they are currently receiving or
they may now be entitled to a different payment. They could also be
entitled to a different rate of their current payment, due to age
disqualification.
