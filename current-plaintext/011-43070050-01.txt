enquiry FHEI screen and provides a list of modifiers that can be used on
the FHEI screen.

FHEI screen

The FHEI screen displays the latest adjustment lines for any previously
adjusted items and patient’s history within the claim, and reason codes
will be displayed.

The FHEI screen is an enquiry screen where all items displayed will be
write protected, i.e. displayed for enquiry purposes only.

The default display order for the FHEI screen is as follows:

-   Items are displayed in card number order.
-   Patient/provider segments written to history are to be kept together
    when retrieved on the enquiry screen. Where multiple patients are
    recalled for the same card number, display in card reference number
    order with sub-numerate 1 being first, sub-numerate 2 second and so
    on.
-   Items will be sorted in Date of Service chronological order.
-   Rejected lines are to be recalled in the order they are written to
    history within the patient/provider segment as per current history
    sort order rules.
-   Patients will only display reinstated line using the purpose the
    reason codes was updated or adjusted.

The Resources page contains a list of modifiers including shortened
modifiers used to display information on the FHEI screen.
