| Item                              | Example                           |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Point of agreement - percentage   |
|                                   | of care                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Nelly and Trent are the parents   |
|                                   | of Ron. Ron lives mainly with     |
|                                   | Nelly. Trent has care of Ron      |
|                                   | every second Saturday night and   |
|                                   | some holiday care, totalling 42   |
|                                   | nights or 11%.                    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Trent calls Child Support to      |
|                                   | advise that Ron’s care has        |
|                                   | changed. Trent expects that Ron   |
|                                   | will be in Trent’s own care for 2 |
|                                   | nights per week during school     |
|                                   | terms and at least 3 nights per   |
|                                   | week during school holidays. This |
|                                   | would be a care percentage of 31% |
|                                   | (40 × 2 = 80 and 12 × 3 = 36, a   |
|                                   | total of 116 nights).             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Nelly confirms the care has       |
|                                   | changed and that Ron is now       |
|                                   | spending more time with Trent.    |
|                                   | However, Nelly advises that Ron   |
|                                   | will be working and staying with  |
|                                   | Trent 2 nights per week during    |
|                                   | school terms and 2 nights every   |
|                                   | second week of the school         |
|                                   | holidays. This is a care          |
|                                   | percentage of 25% (40 × 2 = 80    |
|                                   | and 6 × 2 = 12, a total of 92     |
|                                   | nights).                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | As the new care pattern has only  |
|                                   | recently commenced, there is no   |
|                                   | established pattern of care for   |
|                                   | the school holidays. Both parents |
|                                   | agree that Ron will spend at      |
|                                   | least 92 nights with Trent. Based |
|                                   | on that 'point of agreement',     |
|                                   | Trent will have a care percentage |
|                                   | of 25% and Nelly 75% for Ron.     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Note: always perform the point of |
|                                   | agreement test on the person who  |
|                                   | is gaining care by comparing      |
|                                   | their previous care percentage to |
|                                   | their new care percentage working |
|                                   | upwards. In the above example,    |
|                                   | the person gaining care is        |
|                                   | 'Trent'. Trent’s previous care    |
|                                   | percentage is 11%. Working        |
|                                   | upwards from 11%, this means the  |
|                                   | point of agreement is 25%. The    |
|                                   | net care decision would therefore |
|                                   | be 25% care to Trent (and 75%     |
|                                   | care to Nelly).                   |
