|                                   | ATO system. When processing a New |

|                                   | valid address. If it is a postal  |
|                                   | address that is available, check  |
|                                   | ICP to ensure it is not a tax     |
|                                   | agent's address. When in doubt    |
|                                   | check the tax return itself for   |
|                                   | the latest address. Note: New ATO |
|                                   | address intrays will often        |
|                                   | generate when a person lodges     |
|                                   | their tax return. Therefore, do   |
