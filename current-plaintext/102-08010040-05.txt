|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Death in traditional Aboriginal   |
|                                   | society is seen as part of the    |
|                                   | spiritual cycle, a transition     |
|                                   | from one existence to another.    |
|                                   | Time and existence is cyclical    |
|                                   | with the past and future          |
|                                   | revolving around the present.     |
|                                   | Death and funerals are therefore  |
|                                   | part of the movement to another   |
|                                   | phase of being. There is no       |
|                                   | beginning or end to existence,    |
|                                   | just being.                       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | People will travel long distances |
|                                   | to attend the funeral of a        |
|                                   | relative, and the closeness of    |
|                                   | the relationship is immaterial.   |
|                                   | Closer relatives will have more   |
|                                   | work and preparation to do in     |
|                                   | regard to the funeral and this    |
|                                   | may take them from their home for |
|                                   | long periods. If a death occurs   |
|                                   | whilst in a community,            |
|                                   | ritualistic self-punishment and   |
|                                   | keening may be observed. This is  |
|                                   | part of the traditional grieving  |
|                                   | process. If asked to leave the    |
|                                   | community this request must be    |
|                                   | observed immediately.             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | After death and during the period |
|                                   | of sorry business outsiders are   |
|                                   | not permitted into the area where |
|                                   | sorry business is taking place.   |
|                                   | Staff may be able to visit the    |
|                                   | community. On some communities,   |
|                                   | especially in Central Australia,  |
|                                   | Sorry Camps are situated on the   |
|                                   | outskirts of a community. If a    |
|                                   | customer is in a Sorry Camp,      |
|                                   | other avenues can be used to      |
|                                   | obtain information from that      |
|                                   | customer.                         |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Aboriginal and Torres Strait      |
|                                   | Islander people have              |
|                                   | traditionally named children      |
|                                   | after relatives, however this is  |
|                                   | slowly starting to change. In     |
|                                   | both cultures there are strict    |
|                                   | rules regarding the use of the    |
|                                   | names of a deceased person. The   |
|                                   | conventions and time frames vary  |
|                                   | from place to place but generally |
|                                   | the name of a deceased person is  |
|                                   | not spoken in communities, and    |
|                                   | all community members who carry   |
|                                   | the deceased person's name must   |
|                                   | change their name. The use of     |
|                                   | names similar to that deceased    |
|                                   | person's name will also be        |
|                                   | stopped even if it is the name of |
|                                   | an everyday item.                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | For example, on one community a   |
|                                   | Field Operative asked, quite      |
|                                   | innocently, "Who's going to put   |
|                                   | on the billy?" only to be met     |
|                                   | with an uneasy silence. It was    |
|                                   | later explained that a community  |
|                                   | member named Billy had recently   |
|                                   | been killed on the community. A   |
|                                   | call to the community prior to    |
|                                   | the visit may have avoided the    |
|                                   | embarrassment, or 'shame' for the |
|                                   | community members.                |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A further example is in the       |
|                                   | Kimberley area where an           |
|                                   | individual by the name of 'Jack'  |
|                                   | died and the community could not  |
|                                   | even refer to the vehicle lifting |
|                                   | device as a 'jack'.               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The period of mourning and        |
|                                   | non-use of a name varies in       |
|                                   | different communities and under   |
|                                   | different traditions. There are   |
|                                   | protocols and rules regarding the |
|                                   | deceased person. References to    |
|                                   | the person can be made using      |
|                                   | other names such as 'Kumunji' as  |
|                                   | used in various parts of the      |
|                                   | Northern Territory, or 'Kumanoo'  |
|                                   | as used in the Kalgoorlie area in |
|                                   | Western Australia. Only use the   |
|                                   | other names if it is appropriate  |
|                                   | to that particular area. If this  |
|                                   | is not the case the person will   |
|                                   | not be familiar with that word.   |

|                                   | Aboriginal communities include    |
|                                   | the use of more than one name.    |
|                                   | There are skin names which give   |
|                                   | the individual a place in the     |
|                                   | social structure and family names |
|                                   | which are usually only used by    |
|                                   | family members. There are also    |
|                                   | western names used for            |
|                                   | bureaucratic purposes. Customers  |
|                                   | may only be known by these names  |
|                                   | for official purposes and on      |
|                                   | their community they are likely   |
|                                   | to have a skin or family name     |
|                                   | which differs greatly from their  |
|                                   | western name. Most community      |
|                                   | members will refer to an          |
|                                   | individual by their Aboriginal    |
|                                   | name.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | It is also important to be        |
|                                   | somewhat circumspect when asking  |
|                                   | about individuals on communities  |
|                                   | as the person being spoken to may |
|                                   | not be able to answer the enquiry |
|                                   | due to communication taboos.      |
