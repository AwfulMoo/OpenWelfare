This document outlines the Transition Care Programme.

Transition care

Transition care provides short-term support and active management for
care recipients after a hospital stay. It allows them to return home
rather than prematurely enter residential care.

Transition care provides time-limited, goal-oriented and therapy-focused
packages of services to care recipients after a hospital stay.

These packages include low intensity therapy - such as physiotherapy and
occupational therapy - social work and nursing support or personal care.

Transition care provides short term care of up to 12 weeks. Care can be
provided at home, a ‘live-in’ setting or a combination of both. Live in
settings can be part of an existing aged care home or a health facility
such as a separate wing of a hospital.

Transition care can only be accessed directly from hospital for up to 12
weeks. Transition care can be extended to 18 weeks if a care recipient
is assessed as needing more help whilst in transition care.

Eligible care recipients

The care recipient must be:

-   an admitted patient of a private or public hospital, and
-   assessed in hospital by My Aged Care. Hospital staff or an Aged Care
    Specialist Officer (ACSO) can arrange this assessment through My
    Aged Care

The 4 week entry period for a care recipient to enter transition care
starts the day after the approval is signed.

The approval to enter transitional care is valid for 4 weeks from date
of signing.

Transition care extension

In exceptional circumstances, a care recipient may require an extension
to a Transition care episode where their care will need to exceed the 12
week maximum. Care recipients are entitled to have only 1 extension for
an episode of care which cannot exceed 42 days.

Services Australia receives the extension requests via 2 channels:

-   mail (paper based or faxed), and
-   emails from My Aged Care

The application for the extension must be completed within the initial
12 week episode of transition care.

The Resources page contains links to the Aged care application for an
extension of Transition care form (AC012) and external websites.
