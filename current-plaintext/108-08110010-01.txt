Telstra Access for Everyone Program

The Telstra Access for Everyone Program is a service which provides
access to telephone services to Australians who are homeless,
experiencing financial hardship or in crisis. The basic eligibility
criteria are that the customer:

-   depends/relies on public payphones from time to time for their
    communications, or doesn't have access to a working phone
-   is homeless/transient, experiencing financial hardship or in crisis,
    and
-   is a holder of a Health Care Card, Pension Concession Card, or a
    Department of Veterans' Affairs Pension Concession Card

The component of the program Centrelink participates in is Telstra Phone
cards - a prepaid calling card which allows the holder to make local,
national long distance, international or calls to mobiles from Telstra
payphones in Australia.

Distribution of cards

Service Centres wishing to participate in this service can contact their
local social work service or the Social Work Services Branch for
information, guidelines and cards. Distribution of the cards is
coordinated through the Social Work Service and Community Engagement
Officers. Availability of the Telstra cards will depend on the
customer's local service centre participating in the service.
