This document provides information about the Employment Separation
Certificate (SU1) (also known as an ESC) and other equivalent documents
or evidence that provide information about leave and termination details
when a customer ceases employment.

When to get an SU1

Customers must get an SU1, completed by an employer, when they have
ceased paid work within the last 12 months and are claiming, or
currently in receipt of any of the following payments:

-   Austudy
-   Disability Support Pension (DSP) (except customers who are
    permanently blind)
-   Farm Household Allowance (FHA)
-   JobSeeker Payment (JSP)
-   Parenting Payment Partnered (PPP)
-   Parenting Payment Single (PPS)
-   Special Benefit (SpB)
-   Youth Allowance (YA)

If a customer’s partner ceases employment, an SU1 may be required to
determine the correct entitlements of the customer and partner.

SU1 content

An SU1 collects information to assess applicable waiting periods or
non-payment periods, for example Income Maintenance Period (IMP) and
Unemployment Non-Payment Periods (UNPP).

Evidence collected in the SU1 includes:

the date the person ceased work

the amount and period covered of any leave or redundancy payment paid at
termination of employment

the amount of the person's final payment

the amount of any moneys still owed by the employer to the person

reasons for ceasing employment, including if a person left work:

-   as a result of industrial action or
-   voluntarily

any personal injury compensation details

Note: if a Service Officer believes an SU1 provided by a customer is
false or misleading, incomplete or is altered in anyway, contact the
employer to confirm the details.

How to provide an SU1

The employer can provide the SU1 by:

-   giving it to the ex-employee
-   uploading it directly to the National Business Gateway (NBG) where
    it is automatically attached to the customer's record. NBG is
    responsible for making sure it attaches to the correct record.
-   registering to use the Business Hub to provide an electronic SU1
-   faxing to Services Australia where the Scanning and Digitisation
    Team make sure the document/s correctly attaches to the customer’s
    record

If the employer is not in Australia see Overseas Employers below.

Equivalent documents or evidence

If a customer is unable to get an SU1 from their employer, consider
other options for getting the information from the employer (not the
customer), include:

-   a verbal SU1 from the employer
-   in a letter written on business letterhead
-   a copy of an email from the employer providing the information, or
-   written form or statement from the employer such as payslips showing
    termination payments

Employment cessation details via Single Touch Payroll (STP)

Employers registered with STP report employment income, leave and
termination payments and employment cessation details to the Australian
Taxation Office. Services Australia can access this data for mutual
clients.

Customers who cease work for an STP employer may have cessation details,
leave and termination payments paid in the past 12 months pre-filled
when making:

-   an online claim for
    certain income support payments
-   staff assisted claims
-   reporting employment income online

Customers are able to check, confirm or change the employer reported
data. If the customer confirms cessation, leave and termination details
via STP, they may not need to provide an SU1. They will need an SU1 if

-   changes are made to amounts paid or
-   there is doubt about the number of days covered by the leave or
    termination payment

For employment cessation information, the data collected via STP is
different to that collected on the SU1 form. It aligns better to what
appears on an employee's payslip.

Customers with mutual obligation requirements need to provide additional
information if the reason for ceasing work is voluntary cessation or
dismissal.

Verbal SU1s from an employer

If the SU1 is not available at the time of the customer's new claim
interview, Service Officers must make one genuine attempt to contact the
employer(s) to get a verbal Employment Separation Certificate
information. If this is unsuccessful, an SU1 or equivalent is required.

Q267 letter

A Q267 First/Second request to employer, refuses to issue ESC (SU1)
letter is a formal notice, issued to the employer under Social Security
Law. The letter advises them they are required to provide an SU1 for
their ex-employee. The employer has 14 days from the date of request to
provide the SU1 to Services Australia.

Issue the first Q267 letter to an employer if they do not reply explore
alternative options for getting the information, see SU1 not yet
provided by employer.

Service Officers can request equivalent documents or evidence from the
customer, such as a payslip, at the same time they send the Q267. This
means when the held activity expires, if the employer has not responded,
the claim may be able to be processed without further interaction.

Note: only send Q267 letters to Australian-based employers. For
processes for overseas employers - see Overseas Employers below.

SU1 not yet provided by employer

Service Officers must:

first check if there are circumstances where an SU1 is not required, see
Table 1 Step 2 on the Process page, if an SU1 is required, check if the:

-   information been provided in another format
-   employer been contacted by a Service Officer to provide a verbal SU1
-   Q267 letter been sent

then try all avenues to get the required information:

-   contact the employer to source a verbal SU1
-   send a Q267
-   request equivalent documentation

Customer does not have SU1 - cannot submit Online Claim

If a person advises they are experiencing difficulties obtaining an SU1
and are in crisis, suffering financial hardship, or has certain
vulnerabilities (see Circumstance Change Monitor (CCM)), the claim can
be submitted with a request for the outstanding supporting documents to
be provided within 14 days.

If a customer contacts to advise they cannot submit their claim as they
cannot get an SU1 or alternative, and do not satisfy any of the reasons
mentioned above, Service Officers should determine:

-   has the customer attempted to get the information
-   why they cannot get the information from the employer
-   do they have anything else that may provide the same information
    included in the SU1

Overseas employers

There are no provisions in Social Security Law exempting a customer from
providing an SU1 for overseas employers.

While Social Security Law authorises Services Australia to request
relevant information from persons or entities based outside Australia,
requesting a written or verbal SU1 from an overseas employer is
generally impractical.

Single Touch Payroll data is not available from overseas employers.

Attempts to call the employer and/or issuing letters to overseas
employers is not appropriate. Service Officers should source the
required information using the alternative methods - including other
written letters the customer may have, or accepting the information from
the customer directly.

SU1 forms for employers

If the Service Officer is aware an employer will have large numbers of
staff leaving, suggest the employer registers for the Business Hub to
provide SU1 information online or contact the National Business Gateway
(NBG), and have a third party portal user code and password activated.
This will allow the employer to complete future SU1 details online.

The Resources page contains common questions and answers and links to
the online version of the SU1; Seasonal, Contract and Intermittent Work
Details (SU496); and Module F - Business details (MOD F), information on
how to complete Q267 letter fields and contact details for National
Business Gateway (NBG).
