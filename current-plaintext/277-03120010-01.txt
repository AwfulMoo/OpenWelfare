This is a Family and Domestic Violence Interaction Point. If the
customer is with another person, on speakerphone, or already identified
with family and domestic violence concerns, continue with the current
business conversation. Otherwise, go to the Family and domestic violence
procedure to conduct the risk identification and referral process.

This document outlines the process for managing general customer
enquires relating to change of assessment (COA) applications including
contact with Decision Makers (DMs). It also provides details on how to
manage Customer Management Approach (CMA) issues and intrays when an
application is in progress.

Change of Assessment enquiries

Service Officers with a Specialised Assessment Services skill respond to
and take subsequent action on inbound COA enquiries and requests from
customers about:

-   a general or new COA enquiry
-   an explanation of the COA process
-   administrative options
-   a previous COA decision

Intray management when an application is in progress

Decision Makers do not undertake common activities other than minimum
collection.

If the customer is:

-   locked to an Internal Decision Maker (IDM), common activity related
    intrays are referred to Mainstream Services
-   managed by a Contract Decision Maker (CDM), common activity related
    intrays are referred to CDM Support
