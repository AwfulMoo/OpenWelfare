This document outlines information on the Data Integrity Enquiry (DIE)
System.

Data Integrity error detection enhancements

In 1992, Centrelink introduced a suite of programs to detect Data
Integrity (DI) errors within its Centrelink system, which contains
Centrelink's customer income security information. Automated DI error
checks are run against customer records and the results are displayed
via the Data Integrity Enquiry (DIE) screens and the Data Integrity
Management Information Reporting System (DIMIRS).

System enhancements to address ANAO Audit recommendations

As part of Centrelink's approach to address the recommendations in the
ANAO Audit Report No. 29 2005-06 - 'Integrity of Electronic Customer
Records' and Centrelink's internal Data Management audit report, a
'Framework to address Data Quality issues within Centrelink' was
developed. The objective of the Framework was to facilitate the delivery
of long term Data Quality and Data Integrity benefits to Centrelink,
through improving current content, tools, skills, processes and
procedures. Some of the resultant activities were the redevelopment of
the DIE screens, management information and checking functions. The
Framework has now been replaced by several other documents.

Centrelink's Data Integrity checking limitations

-   Timing - checks are not completed in real-time, so there is a lag in
    reporting new and fixed errors
-   Scope - checks do not cover all business rules and circumstances
-   Platform - checks are only on the system data
