This procedure contains instruction for WA Ex-nuptial child support
cases only.

This document outlines the process for dealing with a Child Support
terminating event.

Terminating events

When Child Support becomes aware that a terminating event has occurred,
immediately steps must be taken to vary or end a child support
assessment to reflect this event on Cuba from the date that the event
occurred.

If an election to end application is received from a payee, see Ending a
Child Support assessment.

The Resources page contains additional details on individual terminating
events.
