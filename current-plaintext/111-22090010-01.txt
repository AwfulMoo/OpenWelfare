This document outlines the quality checking process for Medicare bulk
billing.

On this Page:

Objectives

The Quality Control System (QCS) is used to select Medicare patient
claim transactions and patient claim online transmissions, bulk bill
vouchers and bulk bill online transmissions and public eligibility for
quality checking and to record the results.

For more information about how to interpret quality checking information
on the QBBI screen, see The Quality Control System (QCS) for Medicare in
Resources.

Quality checking enables managers or their delegates to identify the
weaknesses and strengths in business processes and highlights
opportunities for continuous business improvement.

These procedures will assist staff to complete the quality checks.

Roles and responsibilities

Managers/Team Leaders are responsible for ensuring:

-   quality checking is performed on a daily basis for every processing
    day available on QBBI
-   checkers have completed the appropriate training
-   quality checks are undertaken as outlined in this procedure
-   results of quality checks are recorded appropriately
-   issues are addressed and corrections made immediately (see the
    Feedback section below)

Quality checkers must ensure that:

-   bulk bill claims processing business rules have been applied
    correctly
-   quality checking is performed on the specified sample size
-   feedback is given to the processing Service Officer
-   quality checking errors are recorded and reported using the online
    Error Explanation Sheet

Where source documents are hard copies, they must be held in the section
until the quality check is finalised. If the documents have been
archived, it is the responsibility of the Manager/Team Leader to recall
the documents.

Note: at the end of each month, quality checks (post checking) must be
completed by close of business (COB) on the first working day of the new
month.

Quality checking of own work

Quality checkers must not quality check their own work. If a quality
checker's own work is selected, it must be passed to an accredited staff
member to conduct quality checks.

See also Quality Checking Own Work Policy in Resources.

Accreditation of Quality Checkers

Before undertaking quality checking, selected staff members must:

-   have knowledge of the relevant policies and procedures and where to
    source them
-   complete the mandatory eLearning training MCA00802 - Claims and
    Eligibility Quality Checker
-   complete and pass the Learning Portal assessment MCA00835 - Claims
    and Eligibility QC
-   have reviewed the quality checking procedure and emailed the Manager
    advising they have been reviewed and understood
-   undergo refresher training every 12 months

Only accredited Quality Checkers can undertake quality checking.

Types of quality checks

Pre-checks

New starters

New starters will have their work reviewed and corrected on the day the
work is performed until they are deemed proficient.

Errors detected during this process are not reported for quality
checking purposes.

Any errors identified for a new starter in transactions selected for
post-checking must be recorded as errors.

Pre-checks capability standards

-   100% checked for four weeks or nil errors for three consecutive days
-   50% checked for two weeks or nil errors for three consecutive days
-   25% checked for two weeks or nil errors for three consecutive days

Post-checks

Post-checks (QBBI) involve checking a statistically valid, random
selection of work processed the previous day. The results are reported
to executives and relevant stakeholders each month.

Targeted checks

In addition to the pre and post-checks, targeted checks provide an
opportunity to look at other areas of the process.

Targeted checks for Medicare bulk bill processing may be:

-   staff members with identified quality issues
-   Aim for Accuracy (separate procedure)

Sampling plan

The Quality Control System (QCS) randomly selects transactions for
quality checking (QBBI). These transactions:

-   are work processed the previous day
-   have been process by a selection of Service Officers from difference
    source office codes

Scanned bulk bill vouchers and online bulk bill transmissions can be
selected by QCS when a Service Officer has manually intervened.

Note: in the online claiming environment, paperwork is replaced with:

-   text (indicated by a 'T' in the service line on the history screen
-   DQRI bulk bill pend:
-   DAPI
-   DASI
-   DEAI
-   bulk bill latter day adjustment:
-   DLAI
-   DHAI

Note: where a bulk bill claim or online transmission is partially
processed by one Service Officer and finalised by another, the QCS will
display the vouchers or transmissions to be checked under the source
code of the Service Officer who finalised the claim.

Process for undertaking checks

Scanned bulk bill vouchers and online bulk bill transmissions can be
selected by the Quality Control System (QCS) when a Service Officer has
manually intervened. This is to ensure compliance with business rules.

Note: in the online claiming environment, paperwork is replaced with:

-   text (indicated by a 'T' in the service line on the history screen)
-   DQRI control line (raw data for bulk bill)

Time frames

If quality checking for QBBI is not performed for a particular day, the
work must be checked within two working days.

Resources

Bulk bill processing selected for quality checking may have been
actioned from bulk bill vouchers, online claims or latter day
adjustments.

Quality checks enquiries

Quality Checkers may need to contact the Quality Management Section for
clarification of the quality checking process. For example:

-   confirmation of the appropriate error status code
-   informing of delays in forwarding error documents
-   Quality Control System (QCS) faults (for example, an error code
    cannot be entered)
-   quality business rules

The Quality Management Section is only responsible for the management of
the Quality Checking Procedures. They can be contacted using the
applicable quality checking contact on the Quality Processes page. See
Resources for a link.

Quality Checkers requiring clarification on processing business rules
should contact the relevant service delivery contact, that is Tier 2 or
Tier 3.

Errors

Errors must be recorded and any follow-up action sent to the Service
Officer for correction.

Document and processing errors

For the purposes of quality checking, a:

-   document error is defined when a Service Officer has processed the
    transaction and has not detected that the original paperwork was
    incomplete or contained insufficient information to support the
    action taken
-   processing error is defined when a Service Officer has processed or
    entered information incorrectly which does not match the original
    paperwork submitted

Recording and reporting results

Errors should be identified during the quality checking process (post
checks) by following the steps outlined in the program quality checking
procedure.

Quality Checkers are required to record the following:

-   QBBI - only the error that is deemed to have the greatest impact
-   Error Explanation Sheet - all errors

All quality checking results (post checks) are reported to executives
and relevant stakeholders each month.

Post checking results recorded by each program are measured against
respective, endorsed key performance measures. Each program is expected
to meet or exceed their endorsed key performance measure.

Feedback

After performing the quality check (post check) on selected
transactions, the quality checker must provide feedback to the
processing Service Officer. This feedback should be:

-   positive for transactions identified as error free
-   given the same day or as soon as possible after the quality check is
    completed

Analysing errors

In consultation with the processing Service Officer, the Quality Checker
is to:

-   determine the reason(s) for the error (underlying factors)
-   identify any possible weaknesses in processing, gaps in business
    rules, issues relating to environmental factors and system faults
    and limitations
-   complete an online Error Explanation Sheet (EES). See the Guide to
    completing the online Error Explanation Sheet in Resources

See also Undertake Root Cause Analysis in Resources.

Correction of errors

Appropriate action must be taken to correct the error(s).

Recurring errors must be brought to the attention of the:

-   Manager/Team Leader of the processing area, and
-   Service Officer concerned

Remedial action (such as training) needed to reduce the occurrence of
errors should be planned by the Manager/Team Leader and undertaken as a
matter of priority.

Change Management

Quality checking procedures are regularly reviewed and updated by the
respective programs in consultation with the Quality Management Section.
This incorporates endorsed changes to program business policy and
procedures and ensures that error codes are current and appropriate.

the non-error code), attachments concerning DQRI, the online Error
Explanation Sheet and The Quality Control System for Medicare, and a
