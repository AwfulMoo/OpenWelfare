General qualifications

A student qualifies for ABSTUDY PES if they meet the general ABSTUDY
eligibility criteria, receive one of the certain income support payments
that attract Pensioner Education Supplement (PES) and also qualify for
either, the Schooling B Award, Tertiary Award or a Masters or Doctorate
Award.

A student qualifies for AIC PES where they meet one of the AIC isolation
conditions, are boarding away from home, undertaking distance education
or similar study or lives in a second family home to have access to
local schooling. They are eligible for AIC PES instead of the normal AIC
Allowance where they:

-   receive Disability Support Pension (DSP) or Parenting Payment Single
    (PPS)
-   are aged under 21 years, and
-   are studying at primary level or the equivalent ungraded level

Rates of ABSTUDY Pensioner Education Supplement

The rate of payment of ABSTUDY PES depends on the student's study load
and qualifying payment.

A student receiving a qualifying income support payment and undertaking
at least 50% of the normal full-time study load may be entitled to
receive the normal rate of ABSTUDY Pensioner Education Supplement (PES).

A student receiving a qualifying income support payment who has been
granted either:

-   a disability study load concession, or
-   a pensioner study load concession, and
-   who undertakes between 25% and 49% of the normal full-time study
    load, may be paid half the normal rate of ABSTUDY PES

However, students in receipt of certain pensions, Disability Support
Pension (DSP), Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA), Invalidity Support
Pension or DVA War Widow/er Pension in some circumstances) will be
exempt from this reduction.

Note: students undertaking a studyload of less than 25% do not qualify
for ABSTUDY PES, but may qualify for the ABSTUDY Part-time Award.

Refer to Claiming ABSTUDY.
