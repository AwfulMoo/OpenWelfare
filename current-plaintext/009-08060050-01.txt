This document outlines information on reviewing the income and assets of
non-customer care receivers.

Review process

Where a care receiver does not qualify for a pension/benefit a
non-customer Care Receiver Income and Assets (CRIA) review may be
applied to determine a carer's entitlement to CP.

The review process will only be applied to adult care receivers when the
recorded income is within $5,000 of the applicable income threshold
and/or assets are recorded in the medium or high assets value range on
the CRIA screen.

Adult non-customer care receivers will not be reviewed if they are:

-   a higher Adult Disability Assessment Tool (ADAT) score adult who is
    receiving a social security pension, social security benefit, a
    Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) Service Pension or Veteran
    Payment, or
-   eligible to receive social security pension, or a Department of
    Veterans' Affairs (DVA) income tested payment except for the sole
    reason that they have not been an Australian resident for the
    qualifying period

Where a care receiver is selected for review, the CRIA test is applied
to determine a carer's entitlement to CP. These care receivers will be
selected for review if the care receiver is:

-   a higher ADAT score adult
-   a lower ADAT score adult
-   a child with a severe disability or severe medical condition, or
-   2 or more children with a disability or medical condition (who
    together require care at a level at least equivalent to that
    required by one child with a severe disability or severe medical
    condition)

The income and assets used to assess entitlement will be determined by
the circumstances of the care receiver(s).

Care receiver is a higher ADAT score adult

If selected for a review, when the care receiver is a higher ADAT score
adult, the income and assets of the care receiver and the care
receiver's partner (if they have one) are taken into account.

Care receiver is a lower ADAT score adult with a dependent child

When the care receiver is a lower ADAT score adult with a dependent
child, include the income and assets of:

-   the lower ADAT score adult
-   the lower ADAT score adult's partner (if applicable)
-   the dependent child
-   any other Family Tax Benefit (FTB) child or children (except the
    other care receiver) of the lower ADAT score adult

Care receiver is a lower ADAT score adult with a qualifying child/children

When the care receiver is a lower ADAT score adult with a qualifying
child/children, include the income and assets of:

-   the lower ADAT score adult
-   the lower ADAT score adult's partner (if applicable)
-   any FTB children (except the other care receiver(s)) of the lower
    ADAT score adult
-   the child or children with a disability or medical condition

Also, if the lower ADAT score adult is not the parent or guardian of the
qualifying child/children, include:

-   the parent and the parent's partner (if applicable) of each
    qualifying child, and
-   any other FTB children of each parent and their partner (where
    applicable)
-   where the child (or children) does/do not live with their parent,
    only the income and assets of the child(ren) are assessable for the
    CRIA tests

Care receiver is a child with a severe disability or severe medical
condition

When the care receiver is a child with a severe disability or severe
medical condition, living with his/her parent, the care receiver's
income includes the taxable income of the parent, the parent's partner
(if applicable), and any other FTB children of the parent and the
parent's partner (if applicable).

Satisfying the Means Test

A non-customer care receiver satisfies the assets tests if their
assessable assets are below the limit defined in the Social Security
Act. Exemptions from this test may apply depending on the value of their
assessable assets, their current liquid assets and/or their taxable
income for the current tax year. The current pension Means Test is still
applied to the carer to establish their rate of CP, unless the customer
is entitled to a pension rate calculated using the transitional rules.

Annual reviews mature 1 November

The payability of CP to those caring for a non-customer care receiver
will still depend on the care receiver achieving a qualifying medical
score and the carer personally providing constant care.

If the care receiver is selected for review, the activity will mature on
1 November each year. By this time the care receiver should have
received their Notice of Assessment (NOA) for the previous financial
year. The system will automatically issue the form Carer Payment -
Income and assets details of the person being cared for - 16 years and
over (SA304 (a)) or the Carer Payment Income and assets details - child
being cared for - under 16 years (SA304(c)). If no reassessment has
taken place within 28 days, a reminder will be issued.

Review applied to child care receivers

An income and assets review is only applied to child care receivers when
the recorded income is within $5,000 of the applicable income threshold
and/or assets are recorded in the medium or high assets value range on
the CRIA screen.

Funds received from the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS)

NDIS funds paid by the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA),
whether received periodically or as a lump sum (including interest
accrued), deposited into an account specifically for the purpose of
managing the customer's NDIS plan, are exempt from the income and assets
tests and deeming. They are not required to be reported or if reported
should not be taken into account in the income and asset assessment.

Wife Pension transfers to CP (XWP)

CRIA reviews do not apply to CP (XWP) - CP that is paid under
grandfathering provisions for ceased Wife Pension carers. This means
carers receiving CP (XWP) who get CA for an adult care receiver who is
not receiving an income support payment or for a child care receiver
whose income is recorded within the CRIA income threshold or in the
medium to high assets value range will not be selected for a CRIA
review. See Transfer from Wife Pension (WP) to Carer Payment (CP).

and SA304(c).
