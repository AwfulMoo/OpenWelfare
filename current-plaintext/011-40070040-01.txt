This document outlines the quality assurance procedures that staff must
comply with when preparing external mail.

Incoming correspondence

In all instances where a letter contains any type of complaint,
compliment or suggestion it must be recorded in the Customer Feedback
Tool. The Resources page contains a link to the Customer Feedback Tool.

Preparing outgoing correspondence

The following steps must be undertaken by all staff when preparing
correspondence to:

-   members of the public, or
-   health care providers

Requirements for letters

Make sure the correct nationally endorsed Standard Letter Template is
used. See Using Standard Letter Templates (SLT) for more details.

All correspondence prepared by staff must include:

-   Date on the letter
-   Recipient's name and address as per relevant database, for example,
    Consumer Directory Maintenance System (CDMS) or Provider Directory
    System (PDS)
-   Our Reference:
    PaNDA work ID or Source Code and Logon ID where work type is not
    completed in PaNDA
-   Appropriate documentation that is associated with the claim or
    application, as required. For example, ensure another customer’s
    documentation has not been attached in error
-   Signature of the staff member responsible for preparing the
    correspondence may be required as directed by business line
    processes. The Resources page contains a link to the Mandatory
    standards - agency signature blocks
-   No personal information unless it is relevant to the transaction.
    For example, a date of birth should not be displayed on an itemised
    claim statement sent to a customer
-   The letter should be attached to the originating PaNDA activity
    where appropriate

Note: all letters generated during the course of general telephony and
processing duties will be Quality Assured.

Update Customer Directory Maintenance System (CDMS) - CDMS users only

The staff member preparing the correspondence must enter a comment in
CDMS with a brief description of the reason for the letter.

Comments are entered under the Comments tab of the Personal section for
the customer.

Addresses

If a windowless envelope is used and address details are available on
outgoing correspondence, ensure the address on the envelope matches that
of the correspondence. Before enveloping, refer the letter to the
appropriate quality assurance delegate.

Some databases are set to produce all capital addresses. This is an
accepted style from Australia Post. Addresses that do not meet Australia
Post standards require intervention to be sent and increase mailing
costs.

The Writing Guide and the Mandatory Standards contain information on
addressing envelopes. See the Resources page for links.

Note: staff must use Secure print when printing letters and supporting
documentation.

Important peer to peer letter privacy checking information

The process steps for Health Service Delivery Division to follow when
performing peer to peer letter privacy checking can be found on the
Process page.

Note: this process is not to be used for Lifetime Health Cover,
Statement of Benefit or Estimate letters. These are sent to the Services
Delivery Quality and Support Team for quality checking. The Resources
page also provides contact details.

Exception for face to face staff only

If the customer is in a service centre, the letters (including Lifetime
Health Cover, Statement of Benefit or Estimate) should be quality
checked by a peer, before it is given to the customer.

The Resources page contains intranet links and contact details.
