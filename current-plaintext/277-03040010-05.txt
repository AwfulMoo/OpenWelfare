| 1                                 | Marge and George have 1 child who |
|                                   | is in George’s 100% care. On 1    |
|                                   | July 2019, Marge notifies of 2    |
|                                   | changes in care for the child     |
|                                   | that occurred the previous year:  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   1 August 2018, Marge started  |
|                                   |     having 2 nights care per      |
|                                   |     fortnight (14%), and          |
|                                   | -   1 December 2018, Marge        |
|                                   |     started having 4 nights care  |
|                                   |     per fortnight (28%)           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The care percentage for the first |
|                                   | event (1 August 2018) is          |
|                                   | calculated over 12 months from    |
|                                   | that event date as though the     |
|                                   | second event had not occurred.    |
|                                   | That is, 2 nights per fortnight   |
|                                   | is 14% care (52 nights over 12    |
|                                   | months). The care percentage for  |
|                                   | the second event (1 December      |
|                                   | 2018) is calculated over 12       |
|                                   | months from that event date. That |
|                                   | is, 4 nights per fortnight is 28% |
|                                   | care (104 nights over 12 months). |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | As both decisions were notified   |
|                                   | outside of 28 days, both          |

|                                   | and then will increase care of    |

|                                   | every 2 months until full time    |

|                                   | period, it would be appropriate   |
|                                   | to use a care period of 2 months  |

|                                   | Marcia is due to increase the     |
|                                   | care of Emerson. This ensures the |
