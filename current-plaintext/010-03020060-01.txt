This document outlines how the Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC)
Application for Short Term Boarding Allowance (SY068) is assessed by AIC
Smart Centre staff.

The SY068 form

The SY068 is used to apply for Short Term Boarding Allowance for any
additional periods of short term boarding in the same year of study
after the initial period.

The initial claim for Boarding Allowance must be made by completing the
Claim for Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) (SY040).

If the SY068 is lodged at a Service Centre, it should be forwarded to
the appropriate AIC Smart Centre after checking the form is complete.

The applicant who completed the SY040 must also complete the SY068.

Time limit for claims

A SY068 can be accepted for a period of short term boarding in a given
year of study as long as the initial or original claim (SY040) has been
lodged by 31 December in the year of study to which the board relates.

Applicants can register their intent to claim for the initial period by
contacting Services Australia on 13 2318 or in person, post or by fax.

A SY040 will not be accepted under any circumstances if it has not been
lodged by 31 December of the year of study. A SY068 for that same year
of study can be lodged at any time (after the SY040) and can be accepted
as long as the SY040 was lodged by the relevant time limit.
