For Services Australia social workers only

If a child is in immediate danger or risk of harm you must act, and a
delegate must call 000.

This document outlines the different categories and fields used by
Services Australia Social Workers to record under 18 and over 80 carer
referrals in the Social Work Information System (SWIS).

Child safe framework

In line with a zero tolerance approach to harm of children, if a staff
member in the course of their duties observes behaviour, which raises
concerns about a child or young person's safety, Services Australia sets
out specific steps that must be taken. Follow the agency's Risk
Identification and Reporting model when identifying and responding to
child safety concerns. See Risk identification and management of threats
to the safety or welfare of a child for more information regarding this
model and the agency's commitment to the safety of children and young
people.

Integrity of data

Social Workers are required to follow this procedure to ensure the
integrity of the data collected via SWIS for under 18 and over 80 carer
referrals. Social workers must record all contacts with the customer and
any other relevant parties, for example, Treating Health Professionals
(THP).

The Resources page contains a link to the template for CP/CA social work
assessment and to the task card on attaching social work reports if
required to customer records.
