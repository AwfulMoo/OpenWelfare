Third party debts

Third party debts may be raised on a customer's record for payments
and/or benefits the customer did not receive. These appear as a negative
amount on the payment summary.

In relation to multiple identity and fraud debts, debt staff must:

investigate errors

examine DOCs related to the case on:

-   the customer's record, and
-   the records of other Customer Reference Numbers (CRN)

Action MFU tax activities

The MFU tax activity:

flags that the payment summary is prevented from being issued

must be actioned to:

-   correct the negative amount
-   issue a payment summary to the customer

Compliance and Debt Operations (CDO) processes ABSTUDY third party debts
when manual correction using the 'Change' function on the Tax Payment
Summary (TXGS) screen is required.
