This document outlines the Resolution of Status Visa Class CD, Subclass
851 (CD 851). It also discusses possible entitlement to income support
payments and other services provided by Services Australia.

Creation of the CD 851 visa

This visa was created as a result of the abolition of the 447 Secondary
Movement Offshore Entry Visa, 451 Secondary Movement Relocation Visa,
695 Return Pending Visa and 785 Temporary Protection Visa (TPV), all of
which were repealed in August 2008.

Note: 785 visas granted from October 2013 onwards are not eligible to
apply for the 851 resolution of Status (Permanent) (Class CD) Visa.

Note: there was a BL851 visa that ceased to be issued from 9 August
2008. This was an 'ordinary' permanent visa. Customers who hold this
visa granted prior to 9 August 2008 will continue to be assessed as a
normal permanent resident visa with no refugee conditions.

CD 851 visa issued after 9 August 2008 to refugee customers

Before 9 August 2008, asylum seekers who arrived in Australia unlawfully
and were found to be in need of protection under the Refugees Convention
were issued a TPV. These visas gave customers access to a limited number
of payments such as Special Benefit (SpB), Family Tax Benefit (FTB) and
ancillary payments. After 9 August 2008, customers who held one of the
following visa were eligible to apply for the CD 851 Permanent Visa:

-   447 Secondary Movement Offshore Entry
-   451 Secondary Movement Relocation
-   785 Temporary Protection
-   695 Return Pending Visa

Note: 785 visas granted from October 2013 onwards are not eligible to
apply for the 851 Resolution of Status (Permanent) (Class CD) Visa.

There is no closing date to apply for the CD 851 visa class. Customers
issued with a Resolution of Status Visa CD 851 are recognised as
refugees for Services Australia purposes. From the grant of their CD 851
visa, former TPV holders were able to immediately access all other
applicable income support payments or benefits and associated services
as if they had been granted an onshore permanent protection visa. As
this is an onshore visa, customers will not be entitled to Crisis
Payment for Humanitarian Entrants.

Note: customers must have applied for and been granted the CD 851 visa
before their residence status for Services Australia purposes changes.
They continued to hold their TPV until they were granted the CD 851 or
their TPV expired.

Details on system

As the Centrelink system only recognises the sub-class 851, the system
is able to distinguish which type of Visa 851 the customer has been
issued by using the date of issue:

-   Prior to 9 August 2008, BL 851 visas were issued to some migrants.
    These are not a refugee visa
-   After 9 August 2008, the CD 851 visa issued is a refugee visa

Income support payments

Once the new CD 851 visa was granted, customers needed to have their
records reassessed and be transferred to another payment. They should
always be treated as refugees while they hold the CD 851 visa. No
waiting periods or qualifying residence periods apply to these
customers, they are eligible to claim all available Services Australia
pensions, benefits and allowances once their permanent resident visa was
granted. This would include JobSeeker Payment (JSP), Parenting Payment
(PP), Youth Allowance (YA), Disability Support Pension (DSP), Carer
Payment (CP), Carer Allowance (CA), Age Pension etc. Customers ceased to
qualify for SpB once they were qualified and become payable for another
income support payment.

Employment services and approved activities

Previously, as holders of a TPV etc these customers only had access to
limited services from Employment Services Providers. 851 Visa holders
are a Fully Eligible Participant (FEP) and eligible for a full range of
services and approved activities such as Adult Migrant English Program
(AMEP).

Exemptions from mutual obligation requirements

A refugee exemption from mutual obligation requirements will not be
automatically applied to customers on the grant of an 851 visa. This is
because they have been in the community for some time and an exemption
from mutual obligation requirements would unnecessarily delay their
access to employment services. However, a temporary exemption from their
mutual obligation requirements can be considered where it is appropriate
to assist with adjustment to changed circumstances.
