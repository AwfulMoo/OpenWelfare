This document outlines how to assess and record a student or Australian
Apprentice's independence for ABSTUDY on the grounds of having the care
or custody of another person's child.

Independence criteria

Students or Australian Apprentices applying for ABSTUDY are considered
independent if:

-   they have the care or custody of another person's child, and
-   the child is dependent on the student or Australian Apprentice

This category of independence is reviewable. This means a student or
Australian Apprentice who ceases to have the care or custody of another
person's child would no longer meet the independent criteria. Students
or Australian Apprentices must notify any changes to their circumstances
within 14 days of the change.
