Example

A common error occurs when a customer with a debt incurs a third party
debt of the same type. See example below for steps to take.
Note: Age Pension is an example only. This applies to all payment types.
This includes third party ABSTUDY debts where the parent/guardian may
also be receiving ABSTUDY.
