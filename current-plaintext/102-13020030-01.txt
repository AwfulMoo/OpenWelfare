For Data Quality Unit (DQU) staff only

This document outlines how Data Quality Unit (DQU) staff action the
deletion or end date of child to parent (CHI/PAR) links from intertwined
Centrelink records.

Comprehensive assessment of the records

DQU staff have access to delete or end date CHI/PAR links to resolve
intertwined records where the link has been incorrectly coded, or where
a record has been used extensively by another customer and will be
retained by that customer.

Before a CHI/PAR link is actioned, an assessment of the use of the
records needs to be done. For children in foster care, contact must be
made with the Child Care Team in the New Parents, Child Care and
Programme Improvement Branch, to request their advice on child care
related impacts.

If customer service staff find an incorrect CHI/PAR link to an unrelated
person, use the Intertwined Referral form to advise the Data Quality
Unit. A link is available on the Resources page.

Effect of deletion or end dating

When the CHI/PAR link is deleted, the CHI record will not be:

-   displayed on the parent(s)/guardian(s) record
-   included in future correspondence
-   shown on concession cards

When a CHI/PAR link is end dated, the CHI record will not display on the
Child Selection (CHS) screen, but will continue to display on the Links
Summary (LS) screen when all links are displayed.

The Resources page contains a link to the Intertwined Referral form.
