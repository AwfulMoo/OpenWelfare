This document outlines the process for recording fees and charges.

Fees and charges overview

Staff can give this information to customers. Refer customers to the
aged care means assessment line or if there is an Aged Care Specialist
Officer (ACSO) in their area offer to book the customer in for a
face-to-face appointment if more information is required.

The Australian Government may subsidise a care recipient’s cost of care.
If they can afford to, the care recipient also contributes depending on
their income and assets. Services Australia or Department of Veterans’
Affairs (DVA) complete a means assessment to determine the amount.

Cost of care is the amount of subsidies and primary supplements the
government pays to the aged care provider for providing care to the care
recipient. The subsidy is reduced by the amount of the income or means
tested fee the care recipient pays directly to the provider.

See Resources for Fees and Subsidies by Scheme and Resident Status.

Care recipients dissatisfied with their means assessment can have the
assessment reviewed by Services Australia or DVA, see Initial contact
about a decision and the review of decision process.

status

Income tested fees are paid when the total assessable income is in
excess of the relevant aged care total assessable income free area, plus

An accommodation component, either:

    recipient's assets on the date of entry into permanent residential

status

Means tested care fees are an additional contribution. The amount is
determined by the means assessment

An Accommodation payment, is paid as either a:

-   Refundable Accommodation Deposit (RAD), or
-   Daily Accommodation Contribution (DAC)
-   The amount is based on the care recipient’s income and assets

Extra service fees are paid by care recipients in an extra service
facility

Home care

Entered care pre 1 July 2014:

-   Basic daily fees are paid at different rates depending on the home
    care package level
-   Income tested fees are paid where the service provider has asked a
    care recipient to pay an income tested fee. Note: under pre 1 July
    2014 schemes the Department of Health and Aged Care is responsible
    for home care means assessments

Entered care on or after 1 July 2014:

-   Basic daily fees are paid at different rates depending on the home
    care package level
-   Income tested fees may be paid in addition to the basic daily fee.
    The amount is based on the care recipient’s income

Home care

Basic daily fee (BDF)

-   paid by the care recipient
-   paid daily from the date they enter home care
-   calculated daily
-   indexed on 20 March and 20 September each year, in line with
    increases to the Age Pension
-   not payable while on leave from home care (in transition care or
    residential respite care)
-   payable while on social leave or hospital leave

Before 1 July 2019, BDF was 17.5% of the single basic Age Pension for
all care levels. This also applied to members of a couple.

From 1 July 2019, four levels of BDF align to home care package levels
1, 2, 3 and 4, replacing the previous single BDF.

If a care recipient lodges an application for financial hardship
assistance prior to an assignment of a home care package, their highest
approved care level is used to calculate any BDF hardship assistance.

Income tested fee (ITF)

A care recipient pays ITF if their income is over the maximum income
threshold for a full pensioner.

Entered care before 1 July 2014:

-   the fee can be up to 50% of the care recipient’s income above the
    Age Pension amount
-   the Department of Health and Aged Care is responsible for the means
    assessment

Entered care on or after 1 July 2014:

-   the fee is different for everyone because it is based on their means
    assessment
-   Services Australia or Department of Veterans’ Affairs are
    responsible for the means assessment

Care’s Schedule of Fees and Charges.

indexation of annual and lifetime caps occurs on 20 March and 20

providers when the cap is reached

Accommodation payments

An accommodation payment is a contribution towards, or full payment for
the care recipient’s room that they may have to pay depending on their
assessed income and assets.

Each provider sets its own pricing, depending on factors such as
facility location and room size. The amount a care recipient pays for
their accommodation depends on their eligibility for government help.

The type of accommodation payments payable is dependent on the date the
care recipient entered permanent residential care and their available
means to pay the accommodation cost.

Entered care pre 1 July 2014:

-   Accommodation charge
-   Accommodation bond

See Aged Care means assessment - Residential Care pre 1 July 2014 -
assets assessment for further detail.

Entered care on or after 1 July 2014:

resident is eligible for government assistance with their accommodation
costs and pays either:

-   a Refundable Accommodation Contribution (RAC)
-   a Daily Accommodation Contribution (DAC) or
-   a combination of these two

resident is not eligible for government assistance with their
accommodation costs and pays either:

-   a Refundable Accommodation Deposit (RAD)
-   a Daily Accommodation Payment (DAP) or
-   a combination of these two

See Aged care fees and charges - accommodation payments for further
detail.

Note: if a care recipient chooses to pay a lump sum, any unused money is
refundable when they depart aged care.

Extra service fees in residential care

Care recipients residing in extra service facilities pay extra service
fees. Extra service facilities provide a higher standard of
accommodation not extra care.

A care recipient negotiates the extra service fee amount with their
service provider. Services Australia is not involved in determining
extra service fees. Extra service fees are not based on either an asset
or income assessment. There is no maximum limit for extra service fees.

Extra service fees are regulated for care recipients who entered care on
or after 1 July 2014. Aged care providers with dedicated extra service
places must publish their extra service fees on the My Aged Care
website, their own website and in other relevant materials provided to
prospective care recipients.

On the day a resident permanently leaves a service, they can be charged:

-   a basic daily fee
-   an accommodation payment (If applicable)
