|                                   | customer must be the primary      |

|                                   |     if their child is born or     |
|                                   |     entrusted to their primary    |
|                                   |     care on or after 1 July 2020  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The other person must claim, have |
|                                   | primary care of the child and be  |
|                                   | an eligible secondary/tertiary    |
|                                   | claimant.                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Most often, the primary claimant  |
|                                   | will be the birth mother or the   |
|                                   | initial primary carer of an       |
|                                   | adopted child. Another person may |
|                                   | be eligible as a primary claimant |
|                                   | only if exceptional circumstances |
|                                   | eligibility criteria are met. For |
|                                   | example, the birth mother is      |
|                                   | incapable of caring for the       |
|                                   | child.                            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Note: primary claimants in        |
|                                   | exceptional circumstances can     |
|                                   | claim up to the full amount of    |
|                                   | PPL if they are eligible.         |
|                                   | Secondary claimants who become    |
|                                   | the primary carer in exceptional  |
|                                   | circumstances are only eligible   |
|                                   | for up to the remainder of the    |
|                                   | PPL that is not claimed by the    |
|                                   | primary claimant. It will depend  |
|                                   | on how much PPL was paid to the   |
|                                   | primary claimant.                 |
