|                                   | July 2019, the customer would be  |

|                                   | 2019, the customer would be       |

|                                   | and JobSeeker Payment (JSP) on 25 |

|                                   | They applied for a 309 visa on 5  |

|                                   | December 2018. The customer is    |
|                                   | also granted a 100 spouse/partner |
|                                   | permanent resident visa on 10     |
|                                   | February 2019.                    |

|                                   | A 309 visa allows qualification   |
|                                   | for a LIC. The customer is        |
|                                   | required to serve the 4 year (208 |
|                                   | week) NARWP to qualify for LIC. A |
|                                   | 4 year (208 week) NARWP applies   |
|                                   | because the customer was granted  |
|                                   | a permanent resident visa after 1 |
|                                   | January 2019. The NARWP can still |
|                                   | start from the application date   |
|                                   | of the 309 visa if the customer   |
|                                   | is present in Australia on that   |
|                                   | date.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The 309 visa does not allow       |
|                                   | qualification for JSP. However,   |
|                                   | the customer was subsequently     |
|                                   | granted a permanent resident visa |
|                                   | on 10 February 2019 that does     |
|                                   | allow qualification for JSP. As   |
|                                   | the first qualifying visa for JSP |
|                                   | was granted after 1 January 2019, |
|                                   | the customer is required to serve |
|                                   | a 4 year (208 week) NARWP for     |
|                                   | JSP. The NARWP for JSP can start  |
|                                   | from the grant date of the 100    |
|                                   | visa if the customer is present   |
|                                   | and residing in Australia on that |
|                                   | date.                             |
