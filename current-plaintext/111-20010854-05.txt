| 1                                 | What if I do not agree with the   |
|                                   | decision of a QOL Checker/ QMO?   |

|                                   | created to help with the QMA      |

|                                   | with clarification on the QMA     |
|                                   | tool functionality. Quality       |
|                                   | Management cannot provide advice  |

| 2                                 | Can I contact the quality checker |
|                                   | directly if I disagree with their |
|                                   | decision?                         |

|                                   | No, the staff member should       |
|                                   | discuss with the Team Leader or   |
|                                   | technical support person.         |

| 3                                 | If I add comments to my QMO       |
|                                   | feedback, will this trigger a     |
|                                   | review of the decision?           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | No, the Staff comments field is   |
|                                   | so staff members can provide a    |
|                                   | reason behind an error, for       |
|                                   | example, Operational Blueprint    |

|                                   | in conversations with staff on    |

|                                   | available in your location, seek  |

|                                   | review a QMA under dispute. How   |
|                                   | do I view the errors and QMO      |
|                                   | comments?                         |

|                                   | If staff wish to dispute a QMA    |
|                                   | outcome, they must provide        |
|                                   | details of the error and original |
|                                   | QMO feedback with their request   |
|                                   | for review, e.g. via screenshot   |

|                                   | use existing resources, including |
