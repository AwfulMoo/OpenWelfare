This document outlines information about which additional costs may be
approved for ABSTUDY Fares Allowance (FAA).

Approved additional costs

Students and non-student travellers undertaking a journey approved for
ABSTUDY Fares Allowance (FAA) may incur costs associated with their
travel in addition to the cost of their economy rail, bus or other means
of transport for the journey.

Approved additional costs may include:

-   transport terminal transfers
-   excess baggage
-   overnight accommodation and meals
-   credit or debit card costs associated with booking travel
-   travel booking service fees, and
-   quarantine or self-isolation costs

Any additional costs not listed above, are the responsibility of the
traveller.

Claiming approved additional costs

Approved additional costs can be authorised in advance of travel for a
student or non-student traveller.

A student or non-student traveller can also claim for the approved
additional costs associated with their travel by completing an ABSTUDY
Fares Allowance Claim (SY032). If the additional costs are approved,
they will be reimbursed after the journey.

The Resources page contains examples of circumstances where additional
costs are paid, including calculations; Australian Taxation Office (ATO)
travel allowance information; links to the ABSTUDY Fares Allowance Claim
(SY032), ATO information and a travel allowance calculator.
