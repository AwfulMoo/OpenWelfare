|                                   | University. Alimah instead        |

|                                   | the BA course.                    |

|                                   | The agency will be able to count  |
|                                   | the study at both institutions    |

|                                   | Interior Design at the same TAFE. |

|                                   | study load Wayne is not full-time |
|                                   | in either course.                 |

|                                   | the TAFE for the early classes on |

|                                   | This institution is not approved  |

|                                   | the TAFE will count the study at  |
|                                   | DSC towards her Diploma           |
|                                   | requirements.                     |

|                                   | Kathleen has provided proof of    |
|                                   | this to the agency. In Semester 1 |
|                                   | Kathleen will do 24% of the study |
|                                   | load at DSC and 76% of the study  |
|                                   | at TAFE. In Semester 2, the study |
|                                   | load at DSC will account for 26%  |
|                                   | and 74% of TAFE.                  |

|                                   | Kathleen will be eligible for     |
|                                   | student payment assistance as a   |
|                                   | full-time student in Semester 1   |
|                                   | but not in Semester 2.            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Although the TAFE will count the  |
|                                   | study at DSC, the agency will not |
|                                   | as it is not an approved          |
|                                   | institution. In Semester 1 this   |
|                                   | is not an issue as Kathleen is    |
|                                   | undertaking 76% of the studies at |
|                                   | the TAFE but in Semester 2 the    |
|                                   | TAFE study load will fall below   |
|                                   | 75%. Kathleen would not be        |
|                                   | considered to be full-time in     |
|                                   | Semester 2.                       |
