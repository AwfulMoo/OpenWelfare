|                                   | Assessment (ESAt) or Job Capacity |
|                                   | Assessment (JCA) assesses work    |
|                                   | capacity according to one of the  |
|                                   | following bandwidth hours. Mutual |
|                                   | obligation requirements are       |
|                                   | determined based on this:         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   0-7 hours per week            |
|                                   | -   8-14 hours per week           |
|                                   | -   15-22 hours per week          |
|                                   | -   23-29 hours per week          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Note: requirements for a customer |
|                                   | with a PCW must take into account |
|                                   | the customer's baseline and 'with |
|                                   | intervention' work capacity.      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | For example, a customer has a PCW |
|                                   | of 15-22 hours per week if their  |
|                                   | ESAt shows that they have a       |
|                                   | baseline work capacity of 8-14    |
|                                   | hours per week but work capacity  |
|                                   | (with intervention) of 15-22      |
|                                   | hours per week. This shows that,  |
|                                   | with intervention (such as        |
|                                   | participation in DES) in the next |
|                                   | 2 years, they will have a work    |

|                                   | hours per week. The Employment    |

|                                   | -   work with the customer to     |
|                                   |     attain their work capacity    |
|                                   |     (with intervention)           |
|                                   | -   update their Job Plan to      |
