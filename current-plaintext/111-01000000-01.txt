This document outlines information supporting the use of an extensive
range of system tools and other resources available online. These tools
and resources improve decision making and service delivery to customers.

Other support material

There are various guides and handbooks, as well as specialist manuals
that provide background and other general information, as well as
specific instructions on how to proceed in particular circumstances.
Where unusual situations may occur, these will often be described in
scenario form, or warnings given to exercise caution.

Other tools are of a more technical nature and are designed to aid the
step by step performance of certain tasks. These include the use of
scripts, screens to access and protocols that may apply. The aim is to
maximise the use of technology in order to increase overall efficiency.
