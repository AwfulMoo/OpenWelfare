Considering if a customer is a MoC - 5 factors

Table 1: Further help for staff to guide staff in determining if a
person is a MoC/SUOR or not.

Not all factors need to be present and a customer’s holistic
circumstances need to be considered after assessing the five factors

In determining that customer is a MoC, assessors must be satisfied that
indicators of a relationship outweigh the indicators that no
relationship exists

It is also important to remember that the presence of family and
domestic violence may indicate a customer is not a MoC

An interview may be required to give the customer and the other
person/ex-partner to provide additional information, their perspective
on the relationship and any other supporting information they may have.
For example, where:

-   the customer and other person/ex-partner have provided conflicting
    information in forms, or
-   there is doubt about the validity of information received if the
    same handwriting has been used on both forms

|                                   |     here if direct debit from an  |

|                                   |     demonstrate transfer of funds |
|                                   |     between two people; if funds  |
|                                   |     are being transferred, why is |
|                                   |     this occurring                |
|                                   | -   Is there evidence of sharing  |
|                                   |     or splitting bills. For       |
|                                   |     example, mortgage repayments, |
|                                   |     rent, utility bills, food.    |

|                                   |     would be reasonable to expect |
|                                   |     the other person is paying    |
|                                   |     for board and/or lodgings; if |
|                                   |     it’s a joint mortgage, it’s   |
|                                   |     reasonable to expect the      |
|                                   |     repayments are equally split. |

|                                   |     the relationship.             |
|                                   | -   If joint assets were          |
|                                   |     purchased, why did this       |
|                                   |     occur. Is this a reasonable   |
|                                   |     expectation or is the         |
|                                   |     purchase indicative of a MoC  |
|                                   |     relationship.                 |

|                                   | -   If joint insurance policies   |
|                                   |     exist, why does the customer  |
|                                   |     share the insurance policies. |
|                                   |     Are there plans to cancel or  |

|                                   |     demonstrate the customer is   |

|                                   |     reasonable. For example,      |
|                                   |     affordability or is there     |
|                                   |     indications there may be a    |

|                                   | -   Consider if the length they   |

|                                   |     ‘reasonable’. For example, if |
|                                   |     the customer indicates intent |
|                                   |     to share accommodation until  |
|                                   |     the end of lease however the  |
|                                   |     lease term is less than the   |
|                                   |     length noted, this may need   |
|                                   |     to investigation. Or it may   |
|                                   |     be reasonable to continue     |
|                                   |     sharing because they can’t    |
|                                   |     afford to move out; they may  |
|                                   |     continue to share for         |
|                                   |     extended periods due to       |

|                                   | -   If interviewing the customer, |
|                                   |     ask how long the parties have |
|                                   |     known each other              |

|                                   |     is the explanation            |
|                                   |     reasonable. For example,      |
|                                   |     there may be no one else      |
|                                   |     available locally             |

|                                   | -   Is there evidence of          |
|                                   |     companionship and emotional   |
|                                   |     support for each other? This  |

|                                   | -   Is there evidence that either |

|                                   | lodged an Application for Payment |

|                                   | that Rodney stays over most       |
|                                   | nights to see the kids. Rodney's  |
|                                   | name is still on the lease        |
|                                   | because it is too hard to change  |

|                                   | school and watches them play      |
|                                   | sport on the weekends. When       |
|                                   | staying over, Rodney sleeps in    |
|                                   | Jenny's bed as it is only a 2     |
|                                   | bedroom house.                    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Jenny does not consider they are  |
|                                   | living as a member of a couple as |
