This document outlines Services Australia’s self service platforms and
staff self service expectations.

Government intent

Self service is the preferred way for customers to do business with the
agency. Self service platforms are private and secure. For the majority
of customers self service is the quickest and easiest option.

Staff expectation

All staff are expected to:

-   transition customers to self service at every opportunity unless an
    Exception applies
-   educate customers about self service options and how to use these
-   troubleshoot instances where a customer has dropped out of self
    service, rectify and transition the customer back to self service to
    complete their business
-   escalate self service issues unable to be resolved through
    troubleshooting
