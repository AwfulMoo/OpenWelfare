Combined rent payable and total rent payable

When claiming RA, the combined rent payable by each member of the
household cannot exceed the total rent amount paid for the dwelling.

A primary tenant's rent may reduce for RA purposes by the amount they
charge another tenant. For example, the rent for the property is $180
per week. The primary tenant charges the other tenant in the house $80
per week for lodging. The primary tenant will receive RA based on $100
per week.

This applies regardless of who is sharing the accommodation, including:

-   other family members, or
-   a person who is not a Services Australia customer

The income from boarders and lodgers may be assessable if the other
person is not an immediate family member.
