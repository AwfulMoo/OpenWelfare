Combine services

Table 3: this table describes how to combine services for home care and
flexible care in the Aged Care Management Payment System (ACMPS).

Note: there is no combine functionality for residential care services in
the Aged Care Staff Portal (ACSP). All service combine requests from the
Department of Health and Aged Care and elsewhere will need to be
escalated to the Aged Care Programmes Branch’s Operations (Residential
Care) Team. See Team Leader for the escalation process.
