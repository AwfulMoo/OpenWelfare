This document outlines how to action Priority Transfer of phone calls to
other queues.

Priority transfers

Calls that are transferred to other customer segments (queues) are
treated as either priority or non-priority calls. Priority Transfers are
used where:

-   the call is of an urgent nature, or
-   the caller is advising of a death, or
-   the caller is in a distressed state

Priority calls are transferred by using the Priority Transfer option;
non-priority calls are transferred by using the National Transfer
option.

The Resources page contains a link to internal transfer numbers for the
various customer segments (queues) within Smart Centre Call. The link is
not available to the public.
