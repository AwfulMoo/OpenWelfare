|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Scenario: In 2017, Imal was       |
|                                   | removed from parental care and    |
|                                   | placed in the care of the         |
|                                   | Minister under a court order      |
|                                   | until Imal turns 18. Imal was     |
|                                   | placed in long term formal foster |
|                                   | care. The service uploads the     |
|                                   | court order as evidence which     |
|                                   | commenced in 2017.                |

|                                   | Outcome: As this order is more    |
|                                   | than 6 months old, a letter from  |
|                                   | a support agency / organisation   |
|                                   | to validate the care orders are   |
|                                   | still in place is needed. As Imal |
|                                   | is in formal foster care, no      |
|                                   | additional information is needed  |
|                                   | to show Imal is ‘at risk’.        |

|                                   | Outcome: As this service is       |
|                                   | listed as an approved early       |
|                                   | intervention program for NSW      |
|                                   | within Table 2, no additional     |

|                                   | Outcome: As this is an informal   |
|                                   | arrangement, the service will     |
|                                   | need to supply evidence of the    |
|                                   | type of harm, abuse or neglect    |
|                                   | Kungawo is experiencing, to       |

|                                   | is being processed by Dharanish.  |
|                                   | The letter does not mention       |
|                                   | Michelle by name, but Dharanish   |
|                                   | notices there is reference to ‘3  |
|                                   | year old child’ and Michelle is   |

|                                   | Michelle. This is similar where   |
|                                   | evidence names 2 children but not |
|                                   | a third, which can often be the   |
|                                   | case for siblings.                |

|                                   | based on a statutory declaration  |
|                                   | as evidence. The Service lodges a |
|                                   | further determination and uploads |
|                                   | another statutory declaration.    |

|                                   | the subsequent determination. A   |
|                                   | child care provider can submit a  |
|                                   | statutory declaration for initial |
|                                   | determinations only where they    |
|                                   | are of the reasonable belief a    |
|                                   | child meets the definition of 'at |
|                                   | risk' for ACCS (child wellbeing). |

|                                   | Scenario: A court order is in     |
|                                   | place since 2 January because     |
|                                   | Logan is in need of protection    |
|                                   | under state law. It is now August |
|                                   | and the service has uploaded the  |
|                                   | court order for evidence that     |
|                                   | Logan is ‘at risk’.               |

|                                   | is older than six months, the     |
|                                   | provider is required to supply a  |
|                                   | letter from a supporting agency   |
|                                   | stipulating the court order       |
|                                   | continue to be in place. The      |
|                                   | court order itself is not         |
|                                   | sufficient.                       |

Early intervention programs

-   Early intervention programs are for families who are at high risk of
    entering or escalating within the child protection system.
-   State and territory government agencies play a key role in referring
    families to these programs, or authorising access to the programs
-   Evidence of a family’s current participation in a program listed can
    be sufficient evidence for the purpose of ACCS (child wellbeing)
