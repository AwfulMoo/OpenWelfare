This document outlines information on raising ABSTUDY debts where the
payment of the benefit was made to a parent/guardian or institution.

Third party ABSTUDY debts

Payment of benefits to students under 18 years of age under the ABSTUDY
Scheme can go to:

-   the student,
-   his/her parent/guardian, or
-   the institution at which they reside

When an overpayment occurs, the person responsible for any overpaid
amount is usually whoever received the ABSTUDY payment. Exceptions to
this are where:

-   a parent/guardian becomes responsible after redirecting payments to
    a private board provider for an approved boarding student
-   the applicant for ABSTUDY becomes responsible after obtaining
    payments fraudulently. This is whether the ABSTUDY payments go to
    the applicant, another person or to an institution

Debts arise under the Student Assistance Act 1973.

Taxation

ABSTUDY payments are part of the student's taxable income for taxation
purposes if the student is over 16 years of age. Adjust the student's
taxation record (either automatically by the system or manually) if an
overpayment occurs.
