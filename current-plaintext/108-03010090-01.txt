This document outlines how the Assets Test and the Income Test are used
to establish the level of income support required by a person. The
Assets Test establishes the level of a person's assessable assets and
then, based on those assessable assets, calculates the person's
entitlement.

Rates of pension payments based on asset test limits

From 1 January 2017, the rate of pension payable is reduced by $3.00 per
fortnight for every $1,000 of assessable assets above the pensions
assets free area. Prior to this this date, the taper was $1.50, but was
previously $3.00 per $1,000 prior to 20 September 2007. For the pensions
assets free area , see Pensions Asset Free Areas and disqualifying
limits link on the Rates and thresholds page.

A potential pension rate is calculated under both the Income Test and
Assets Test. The lowest rate calculated is the rate payable to the
customer.

Different Assets Test rules apply to Parenting Payment Single (PPS)
customers.

The procedure, Exempt income, provides information about assessing
income that is exempt from the Income Test.

The Resources page contains links Pension Assets Test rates, payment
rates, an example of an assets test calculation, and historical
information prior to 20 September 2007.
