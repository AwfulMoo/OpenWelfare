Determination 2020 - DRA and ex-gratia DRA average weekly income

Based on the Rate Calculator Determination 2020.

from 1 January of the next year, for the duration of that calendar year:

-   From 1 January 2019 the figure is: $1,586.20
-   From 1 January 2020 the figure is: $1,633.80

To annualise the AWOTE, multiple the weekly amount by 52:

-   From 1 January 2019 the annualised figure is: $82,482.40
-   From 1 January 2020 the annualised figure is: $84.957.60
