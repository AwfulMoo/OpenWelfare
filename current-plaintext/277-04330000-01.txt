Child Support stay orders

Stay orders affect the operation of the Child Support (Assessment) Act
1989 (CSA Act) or the Child Support (Registration & Collection) Act 1988
(CSRC Act).

Stay orders are made under s111C of the CSRC Act. Stay orders under
s111C can only be made if there are current proceedings under child
support legislation. Stay orders should not be made when there are
current proceedings under other legislation such as when a variation to
a registered overseas maintenance liability is being sought under
regulation 36 of the Family Law Regulations 1984 or the parents are in
court seeking parenting orders or property settlement.

In particular instances, stay orders can also be made under s41 and s44A
of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (AAT Act).

Prior to 21 June 2007 stay orders could have been made under s140 CSA
Act 1989.
