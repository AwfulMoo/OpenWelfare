+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Purchase of an investment         |
|                                   | property                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Tom bought an investment unit for |
|                                   | $400,000. The property was        |
|                                   | negatively geared. That is, the   |
|                                   | interest on the mortgage Tom took |
|                                   | out to buy the property ($20,000  |
|                                   | per annum) exceeded the rental    |
|                                   | income ($15,600 per annum). In    |
|                                   | addition to the mortgage          |
|                                   | payments, Tom also had to pay     |
|                                   | $4,000 per annum in other         |
|                                   | expenses (rates, management fees  |
|                                   | and body corporate).              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Sometime later, Tom was           |
|                                   | retrenched and was forced to sell |
|                                   | the property for $350,000 because |
|                                   | he couldn't keep up with the      |
|                                   | mortgage payments.                |

| 2                                 | What was Tom's net rental         |
|                                   | property income?                  |

|                                   | $15,600 - ($20,000 + $4,000) =    |
|                                   | -$8,400                           |

|                                   | is a loss of $8,400.              |

|                                   | $400,000 - $350,000 = $50,000     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Tom's capital loss is $50,000.    |
|                                   | For Commonwealth Seniors Health   |
|                                   | Card (CSHC) purposes, a capital   |
|                                   | gain or loss is a component of    |
|                                   | taxable income. This means Tom's  |
|                                   | capital loss is not shown         |
|                                   | separately to his taxable income. |

|                                   | basket, Tom had also borrowed     |
|                                   | $150,000 to invest in shares. The |
|                                   | interest on Tom's loan was        |
|                                   | $10,500 per annum. Tom's shares   |
|                                   | paid dividend income of $6,000.   |

|                                   | retrenchment had also caused      |
|                                   | share prices to tumble. Tom was   |
|                                   | forced to sell his shares at a    |
|                                   | loss. They sold for a total of    |
|                                   | $135,000.                         |

|                                   | For CSHC purposes, a capital gain |
