This document outlines how a care recipient may move to an aged care
service on a permanent basis or for temporary respite care. A care
recipient may also move out of an aged care service for more suitable
accommodation. Rent Assistance (RA) may not be available for care
recipients in an aged care service.

Rent Assistance

From 1 October 1997, care recipients are not entitled to RA if they
receive an income support benefit and have entered a residential aged
care service. Instead, a Pensioner Supplement subsidy is paid directly
to the aged care service.

Respite care fees do not meet the definition of rent under the Social
Security Act 1991, (irrespective if it is paid to an approved service or
not).

Respite care

A care recipient may enter an aged care service for respite care. To
access respite care the care recipient must be assessed by an Aged Care
Assessment Team (ACAT). A person may have up to 63 days approved respite
care in a financial year. Additional periods of up to 21 days may be
possible if the ACAT considers additional time is needed.

Separated from partner

Care recipients who are unable to live with their partner due to ill
health may be entitled to a single payment while they are living
separately, even during periods of respite care.
