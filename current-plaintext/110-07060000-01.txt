This document outlines the process for the annual PIT for ABSTUDY.

PIT

The rate of payment of a dependent recipient’s ABSTUDY is based on the
combined parental income in the appropriate tax year. As this figure may
change each year, Services Australia requires updated parental income
after the end of each financial year to ensure that the correct rate of
ABSTUDY is paid.

Base tax year

Normally, when the PIT is applied, ABSTUDY recipients are assessed using
income from the base tax year. This is the financial year that ended
immediately prior to the current calendar year (for example, for the
2018 calendar year, the 2016/2017 financial year would be considered).
In most circumstances, this enables an accurate assessment of the rate
of payment since the financial year has been completed and actual
combined parental income figures are generally available.

Annual review action to be undertaken

All dependent ABSTUDY recipients, except those who:

-   are PIT exempt,
-   their parent(s)/guardian(s) received Family Tax Benefit, Child Care
    Benefit or Child Care Subsidy for the appropriate tax year and a PIT
    Copy has occurred by the second Monday of September

will be sent a PIT review letter with a One Time Access Code (OTAC) to
request their parent(s)/guardian(s) provide the necessary information
using the [] Advise parental income online service. See Completing
Parent(s)/Guardian(s) details for the Base Tax Year and Current Tax Year
(MOD JY) for details.

Information to be provided by parent/guardian(s)

The parent(s)/guardian(s) are required to provide:

-   actual or estimated income figures for the most recently completed
    financial year for all components of combined parental income that
    form part of the Parental Income Test (PIT)
-   the date of issue of their Notice of Assessment (NOA) from the
    Australian Taxation Office or an estimated date it will be available

Some parent(s)/guardian(s) will also be required to provide current
income assessment information.
