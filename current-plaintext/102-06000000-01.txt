This document contains topics associated with changes in the official
date of birth or age of a customer, their dependant(s) or care
receiver(s) which may have an effect on the income support payment
received. As a result, a customer may no longer be entitled to the
payment they are receiving, due to age disqualification, or they may now
be entitled to a payment that they were not entitled to previously. An
example of this is Age Pension.
