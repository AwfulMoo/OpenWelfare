This document outlines how the Unified Government Gateway (UGG) is used
for Income Management purposes.

On this Page:

Secure communication channel

The Unified Government Gateway (UGG) is a framework for exchanging
secure electronic communications between Services Australia and external
parties. It is accessed via Business online services on the agency's
website.

For the purpose of Income Management, the UGG is utilised as a secure
communication channel between the agency and Income Management referring
authorities for:

-   Child Protection Income Management
-   Supporting People at Risk (SPaR) Income Management
-   Vulnerable Welfare Payment Recipients, and
-   Voluntary Income Management (VIM)

For information on Income Management under the Cape York Initiative, see
Cape York Initiative in Business Hub

Income Management referring authorities

Income Management referring authorities are determined by legislation.
The following referring authorities may make a decision to income manage
a customer’s payments where it is beneficial to the customer:

-   A State or Territory Child Protection Authority - Income Management
    is a tool for Child Protection Authorities to help protect children
    who are experiencing abuse or neglect
-   An approved referring authority - Income Management provides another
    tool for these authorities to assist individuals and/or families
-   State/Territory Housing Authorities - Housing Authorities can refer
    suitable customers for an assessment by a social worker for the
    Vulnerable Welfare Payment Recipient measure. The decision to income
    manage a customer’s payment rests with the social worker

UGG interactions

The following interactions are available to Income Management referring
authorities:

-   Mutual Customer - Customer Search for Income Management
-   Disclosure of Information (DOI)
-   Notice to Commence Income Management
-   Revocation of Income Management or Cashless Debit Card
-   Expense allocation requests
-   Unrestricted Cash Payment (UCP) service offer
-   Referrals for Voluntary Income Management
-   Requests for Further Information
-   Vulnerable referrals (State/Territory Housing Authorities only)

Daily Reports

Daily Reports provide the referring authority with a copy of all the
interactions completed in the UGG the previous business day.

All referring authorities (excluding State/Territory Housing
Authorities) are automatically notified via a Daily Report when an
Income Management customer has had a change in circumstances actioned on
their record. This can include things such as a change of address,
payment suspension etc.

Voluntary Income Management

Customers may be referred to Services Australia to participate in
Voluntary Income Management via the UGG by:

-   a State or Territory Child Protection Authority
-   an approved referring authority

When a referral is received via the UGG, an Income Management Contact
Officer (IMCO) will book an Initial Assessment interview for the
customer to discuss Voluntary Income Management. The option to enter
into a Voluntary Income Management Agreement is voluntary, and no
penalty is applied if they do not attend an appointment or decide not to
enter into an Agreement.

If a Voluntary Income Management referral is made via the UGG and the
customer has provided consent, information exchange provided in daily
reports to the referring authorities is limited to:

-   customer has been placed on Voluntary Income Management
-   customer has exited from Voluntary Income Management, and
-   customer has withdrawn their consent

The Resources page contains a link the Income Management Contact
Officers on the intranet.
