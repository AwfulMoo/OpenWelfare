|                                   | All provisional incomes should be |

|                                   | A customer has not yet lodged     |
|                                   | their tax return, but has instead |
|                                   | provided an ITD specifying their  |
|                                   | ATI for the LRYI. The Service     |
|                                   | Officer may be satisfied the ITD  |
|                                   | is a reasonable approximation of  |
|                                   | their ATI because the amount of   |
|                                   | the ITD was similar to the        |
|                                   | customer's last ATO assessed      |
|                                   | income and the customer's         |
|                                   | circumstances have not changed.   |
|                                   | If the customer does not have an  |
|                                   | ATO assessed income history, or   |
|                                   | the Service Officer is aware      |
|                                   | their employment circumstances    |
|                                   | have substantially changed, the   |
|                                   | Service Officer may request       |
|                                   | evidence from the customer, for   |
|                                   | example a payment summary or a    |
|                                   | payslip with a year to date       |
|                                   | amount. If still not satisfied    |
|                                   | the ITD provided by the customer  |
|                                   | is a reasonable approximation of  |
|                                   | their ATI, the Service Officer    |
|                                   | may decide it is not appropriate  |
|                                   | to use the amount specified in    |
|                                   | the customer's ITD to calculate   |
|                                   | the child support assessment. The |
|                                   | Service Officer may then consider |
|                                   | whether there is information      |
|                                   | available that would allow a      |
|                                   | manually derived ATI to be        |
|                                   | determined.                       |
