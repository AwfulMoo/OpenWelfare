This document outlines recovery action for non-compliance with a
garnishee order.

Non-compliance with garnishee notice

Employer/third parties must implement garnishees. Failure to do so is an
offence, and a fine or imprisonment may be imposed.

An employer/third party become mutually liable (with the customer) for
the debt. Employer/third party liability is restricted to the lesser of:

-   the portion of the garnishee amount they are able to pay, or
-   the balance of the debt when the notice was sent

A garnishee debtor’s mutual liability can only be recovered by garnishee
or legal action.

Contacting the employer/third party

Discuss the reason for non-compliance of a garnishee via phone. Make a
reasonable effort to contact the employer/third party. If they can’t be
contacted, or continue non-compliance:

-   document the customer record, and
-   discuss the file with Program Litigation Review Branch (PLRB). Civil
    recovery action can be considered

Privacy

A garnishee debtor's information held on the customer's record (that is:
primary debtor) is protected and must not be given to the customer. If a
garnishee debtor contacts, do not give them any information about the
customer.

The debt on the garnishee debtor's record is a mirror image of the
primary debtor's (customer's) debt. Any repayments (made by either
party) are recorded on the primary debtor's record and are mirrored on
the garnishee debtor's record.
