| Example                           | Description                       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Child is a foster child of the    |
|                                   | customer                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Fees are paid by the foster carer |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Georgia is a foster carer and     |
|                                   | claims CCB and Child Care Rebate  |
|                                   | (CCR) for foster child Max.       |
|                                   | Georgina's gap fee (after CCB and |
|                                   | CCR is applied) is $200. Georgia  |
|                                   | pays $200 and the child care      |
|                                   | service issues accounts/receipts  |
|                                   | in Georgia's name. The NSW        |
|                                   | Department of Community Services  |
|                                   | (DoCS) then reimburses Georgia    |
|                                   | for the $200. Georgia is deemed   |
|                                   | liable for the child care fees,   |
|                                   | as the child care service has     |
|                                   | issued the accounts/receipts in   |
|                                   | Georgia's name. This makes        |
|                                   | Georgia liable for the fees and   |
|                                   | as a result, the reimbursement of |
|                                   | the gap fee by DoCS does not      |
|                                   | change that liability.            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Fees are paid by DoCS             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If DoCS paid all of the child     |
|                                   | care fees ($300), Georgia would   |
|                                   | not be deemed liable for the      |
|                                   | child care fees and would be      |
|                                   | unable to claim CCB and CCR. The  |
|                                   | child care service will issue the |
|                                   | receipts in DoCS name.            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Fees are paid by both DoCS and    |
|                                   | foster carer                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Fees are $50 per day. Georgia     |
|                                   | pays $100 (2 days) and DoCS pays  |
|                                   | $100 (2 days), Georgia would only |
|                                   | be deemed liable for the child    |
|                                   | care fees for the 2 days ($100)   |
|                                   | paid and would be eligible for    |
|                                   | CCB/CCR for those 2 days. The     |
|                                   | child care service will issue 2   |
|                                   | receipts, 1 tor Georgia for $100  |
|                                   | for 2 days and 1 to DoCS for $100 |
|                                   | for 2 days. The child care        |
|                                   | service will only submit the      |
|                                   | attendance for the 2 days Georgia |
|                                   | is liable for.                    |

|                                   | is the registered carer who both  |

|                                   | same household that Mary and the  |
|                                   | child reside. Some hours of care  |
|                                   | are provided whilst Mary is       |
|                                   | present in the household.         |

|                                   | reside, is considered acceptable  |
|                                   | care. It is also irrelevant that  |

|                                   | whilst Mary is present in the     |
|                                   | household, as this care is deemed |
|                                   | acceptable for the purposes of    |
