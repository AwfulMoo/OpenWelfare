Students or Australian Apprentices can submit via:

-   the ABSTUDY Claiming Tool or
-   a Claim for ABSTUDY form (SY019)

Students must lodge an invoice to be paid or receipt to claim
reimbursement of school fees if they:

-   are attending a school and living with a private boarder or
-   are living at home and attending a non-government school because
    there is none locally or
-   were a student who was a boarder but now is a day student due to
    parents moving locally

Rate

The income tested component of SFA (Group 2) will be reduced by The
Parental Means Test.

The Personal Income Test does not affect the rate of SFA (Group 2).
