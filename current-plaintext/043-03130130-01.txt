This procedure outlines how to assess if a recoverable debt exists where
a customer has an increase in business income (either estimated or
actual) which decreases the rate of their social security payment. This
includes when a customer commences self-employment.

Business income

For self-employed customers, actual business income is assessed from
completed tax returns. Australian Taxation Office (ATO) regulations
require all businesses to lodge a tax return for any year they operate.

To calculate the ongoing social security payment, the best available
estimate of the self-employment income is used. This estimate is based
on the most recent completed tax returns, however can also be based on
an interim Profit and Loss Statement (SU580).

When a business first commences, and the customers' notification
obligations have not been met, a profit and loss statement is acceptable
evidence to raise a self-employment debt.

If the customer refuses to give actual income details their social
security payment should be cancelled under section 80 of the Social
Security (Administration) Act.

The Resources page contains scenarios of debt calculations for customers
with income from self-employment.
