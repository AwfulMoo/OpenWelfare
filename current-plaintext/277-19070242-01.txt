This document outlines the steps for processing an initial estimate in
Pluto.

Types of estimates

There are 2 types of estimate processes in Pluto:

The standalone estimate process is used when the:

-   customer does not have all the information available at the time
-   integrated estimate process may hold up the finalisation of an
    application for assessment
-   customer is electing to estimate for more than 1 case

The integrated estimate process is part of an application for assessment
process and used when the:

-   customer is electing to estimate on a single case
-   estimate will be completed in full. For example if the customer is
    unsure if they will proceed, the integrated process is not used
-   estimate decision will be made at, or prior to the time, the
    application for assessment will be finalised

If the customer elects to estimate for both the current and the new
financial year, 2 separate estimate processes are completed. The
integrated estimate process is used for the current financial year and
the standalone estimate process for the new financial year.
