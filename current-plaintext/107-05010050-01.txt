Privacy protection

Customers provide Services Australia with personal information. Staff
must treat confidential information in an appropriate manner. Privacy is
integral to the Service Commitment made by the agency. For more
information, see the Privacy intranet page.

The objectives of the agency's Privacy Guidelines include:

-   recognising that the agency has a special responsibility to protect
    privacy. It manages and maintains information across a range of
    programs and services
-   maintaining a level of privacy protection for our customers in
    accordance with the Privacy Act 1988 and other relevant legislation
-   providing an efficient and effective delivery of services for the
    agency's partner agencies, through the better linking of Government
    services
-   ensuring that privacy issues are addressed correctly

Confirm contact details before issuing a debt notice

Before issuing any form of debt notice to a customer, check the address
on the customer's record. The agency must only use the most accurate
information, to protect the customer's privacy.

The Resources page contains responsibilities when provisioning access to
Online Search Facility (OLS), a link to the agency's Privacy intranet
page, and to the website of the Office of the Australian Information
Commissioner.
