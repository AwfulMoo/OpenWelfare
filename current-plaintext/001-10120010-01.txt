This document outlines the reconnection failure period and penalties
that apply as a result of a reconnection failure being applied under the
Job Seeker Compliance Model for Community Development Program (CDP) job
seekers.

Applied reconnection failures

The Job Seeker Compliance Model focuses on encouraging CDP job seekers
to remain engaged with their provider and to comply with their mutual
obligation requirements. Financial penalties are only imposed for
failures within a CDP job seeker's control that is, as a result of
wilful, negligent, deliberate or persistent non-compliance.

An applied reconnection failure displays a status of:

-   'Applied with penalty' where the failure attracts a financial
    penalty, or
-   'Applied without penalty' where the failure is by legislative
    definition a connection failure which cannot attract a penalty

Where a reconnection failure is 'Applied' with penalty, the CDP job
seeker enters into a reconnection failure period. A penalty amount will
be calculated for each business day of the reconnection failure period.

A reconnection failure is applied without penalty if there is no basis
for the reconnection requirement to have been issued. For example, where
it was issued a result of an applied connection or No Show, No Pay
failure and that failure is revoked, or if it was issued by a provider
but it is established that the CDP job seeker had not failed to attend
an appointment with them. Where a reconnection failure is applied
without penalty the CDP job seeker has not entered a reconnection
failure period and, therefore, a reconnection failure penalty is not
calculated.

Reconnection failure period

A reconnection failure period commences from the reconnection failure
event date and continues until the day before:

-   the CDP job seeker complies with the further reconnection
    requirement including situations where the CDP job seeker is deemed
    to have self re-engaged
-   the Services Australia determines the CDP job seeker is no longer
    required to comply with the further reconnection requirement
-   the CDP job seeker is formally notified of a requirement to attend a
    Comprehensive Compliance Assessment (CCA)
-   the event date of a reconnection failure rejected in the same
    sequence for reasons not related to the existence of an outstanding
    CCA or due to payment cancellation
-   it is determined the CDP job seeker cannot be re-engaged in within
    the next 2 working days excluding public holidays (providing the CDP
    job seeker has agreed to re-engage)
-   the CDP job seeker's re-engagement appointment is
    rescheduled/cancelled via the Reschedule Participation Appointment
    workflow
-   the CDP job seeker's re-engagement appointment is
    rescheduled/cancelled by their provider
-   the CDP job seeker's participation payment is cancelled to grant a
    non-participation payment
-   the CDP job seeker's participation payment is cancelled for at least
    10 weeks or re-granted with a break in payment, or
-   the CDP job seeker commences a serious failure period or
    Unemployment Non-Payment Period (UNPP)

Reconnection failure period may recommence after it has ended

The reconnection failure period will end however the CDP job seeker will
generally still be required to re-engage if the CDP job seeker is
currently serving a reconnection failure period and:

-   a reconnection failure (in the same sequence) is rejected for
    reasons other than notification of a CCA requirement or cancellation
    of payment
-   they are willing to re-engage but a new appointment cannot be
    arranged within 2 working days, or
-   a re-engagement appointment is rescheduled (due to a reasonable
    excuse) by either the of Services Australia or the CDP job seeker's
    provider

If they do not re-engage, a further reconnection failure may be
generated and applied resulting in the reconnection failure period
recommencing from the new reconnection failure event date.

Penalty calculation

Reconnection failure penalties are based on a 'business day'
calculation. This means that the CDP job seeker will generally accrue a
daily penalty equal to one tenth of their fortnightly payment for each
day the penalty applies. Saturdays and Sundays falling in a reconnection
failure period will not accrue a penalty.

The reconnection failure penalty is calculated based on the CDP job
seeker's basic benefit and certain supplementary payments. The
reconnection failure penalty is calculated after the income and assets
test has been applied to the CDP job seeker's basic benefit but before
any withholdings of penalty amounts for previous failures or
withholdings are deducted for debts or advance payments.

Supplementary payments included in the penalty calculation

The following participation related supplements are included in the
calculation of the reconnection failure penalty:

-   Approved Programme of Work Supplement (APWS) - paid to participants
    in Work for the Dole, National Work Experience Programme (NWEP),
    Community Development Program (CDP) Structured Activities, and
    Drought Force
-   Language, Literacy and Numeracy Supplement (LLNS)
-   Energy Supplement paid on a fortnightly basis. Note: the Energy
    Supplement is not included in the penalty calculation if it is paid
    on a quarterly basis

Mutual obligation requirements during a reconnection failure period

CDP job seekers are required to continue to meet their regular reporting
requirements during a reconnection failure period.

Further connection, non-attendance failures and No Show, No Pay failures
cannot be applied where the failure event occurred during a period the
CDP job seeker was in a reconnection failure period.

While further reconnection failures in the same sequence of failures can
be applied during a reconnection failure period, a reconnection failure
relating to a different sequence of failures, that is, linked to a
different Non-Attendance Report sequence, connection, non-attendance or
No Show, No Pay (disengagement) failure cannot be applied during a
reconnection failure period.

The Resources page contains a sample reconnection and No Show, No Pay
failure penalty calculation and explains how reconnection failure
penalties were calculated prior to 1 July 2012.
