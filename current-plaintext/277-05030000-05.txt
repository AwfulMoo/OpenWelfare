|                                   | Answer: No. The election for a    |
|                                   | non-care non-enforcement period   |
|                                   | must be made during the 'overall  |
|                                   | non-care period'. This period     |
|                                   | ends when the child returns to    |
|                                   | the payee's care and the          |
|                                   | administrative option is no       |
|                                   | longer available.                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The payer may have the option to  |
|                                   | apply to a court to vary the      |
|                                   | order for the period that the     |
|                                   | child was not in the payee’s      |
|                                   | care. Advise the payer to seek    |
|                                   | legal advice if they are          |
|                                   | interested in this option. Warn   |
|                                   | the payer that costs may be       |
|                                   | incurred and there is no          |
|                                   | guarantee of any particular       |
|                                   | outcome.                          |

| 2                                 | Question: On 1 April a payee      |
|                                   | advises that the child left care  |
|                                   | on 17 March, and elects to start  |
|                                   | a non-care non-enforcement        |
|                                   | period. The payer is successfully |
|                                   | contacted on 28 April, and also   |
|                                   | makes an election. When does the  |
|                                   | non-care non-enforcement period   |
|                                   | start? + Read more                |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: On 28 April, because the  |
|                                   | joint election became complete on |
|                                   | this day, and the date is not     |
|                                   | within 28 days of the date that   |
|                                   | the payee ceased to provide       |
|                                   | ongoing daily care for the child. |
|                                   | If the payer had made the         |
|                                   | election on any day up to 17      |
|                                   | April, then the non-enforcement   |
|                                   | period would commence on 17 March |
|                                   | because the joint election would  |
|                                   | be made within 28 days of the     |
|                                   | non-care period starting.         |
