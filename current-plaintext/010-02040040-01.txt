This document outlines how to assess and record a student or Australian
Apprentice's independence for ABSTUDY on the grounds of being an orphan.

Independence criteria

Students and Australian Apprentices applying for ABSTUDY are considered
independent if they are 15 years of age or older and an orphan.

This category of independence is permanent. Once granted, the student or
Australian Apprentice remains eligible for independent status for this
claim and any other claims for ABSTUDY.

Living with someone other than natural or adoptive parents

Students or Australian Apprentices who meet the conditions as an orphan
can qualify as independent even though living with someone other than
their natural or adoptive parents. This includes where another person is
or has been, in receipt of an allowance intended for their upkeep, for
example Family Tax Benefit.
