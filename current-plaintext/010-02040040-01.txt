This document outlines how to assess and record a student or Australian
Apprentice's independence for ABSTUDY on the grounds of being an orphan.

Independence criteria

Students and Australian Apprentices applying for ABSTUDY are considered
independent if they are 15 years of age or older and an orphan.

A student or Australian Apprentice is considered to be an orphan where
their parent/s are either:

-   deceased or
-   missing and presumed deceased

This category of independence is permanent. Once granted, the student or
Australian Apprentice remains eligible for independent status for this
claim and any other claims for ABSTUDY.

Living with someone other than natural, adoptive or relationship parent/s

Students or Australian Apprentices who meet the conditions as an orphan
can qualify as independent even when living with someone other than
their natural, adoptive or relationship parent/s. This includes where
another person is or has been, in receipt of an allowance intended for
their upkeep, for example Family Tax Benefit.
