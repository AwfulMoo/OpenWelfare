For staff delegated to release customer information only.

This document outlines how to disclose information to child protection
agencies.

Requests from child protection agencies

Services Australia gets requests for information from child protection
agencies that relate to investigations. Liaison points with child
protection agencies have been set up so that all requests:

-   come through one central point within that agency, and
-   are received by the Information Release Team

All requests must come through the child protection agency’s central
liaison office. If an officer asks for information, tell them to contact
the assigned point of contact in their agency.

After-hours emergency

In an after-hours emergency situation, send requests to the Geelong
Emergency Smart Centre.

Only direct child protection officers here if:

-   the request is urgent, and
-   it is outside business hours

Delegated officers

Delegated officers may disclose information in the public interest if:

-   there is an emergency, and
-   the disclosure is necessary to prevent or lessen a threat to the
    life, health and welfare of a person

The Resources page has links to delegations and authorisations, the
online release of information form, intranet pages and contact details.
