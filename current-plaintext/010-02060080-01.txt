This document outlines the definition of a special course for a
dependent student who is claiming the living away from home rate due to
needing to attend a special course.

Special course qualifications

To qualify as a special course, the course must be one of the following:

-   a full-time secondary course where the student receives a formal
    specialising qualification on completion
-   formal specialising qualification for mature age students
-   a secondary course which is a prerequisite for entry to a specific
    post-secondary course
-   a secondary course containing agricultural subjects
-   specialist secondary studies in drama, music, art, ballet, sport or
    technology
-   a secondary course containing Indigenous studies

Away from Home rate

Students receiving ABSTUDY are normally expected to live at home while
studying. But they may be paid a higher rate of assistance if they need
to live away from home to study.

The away from home rate may be approved if:

-   government schools within reasonable travelling time are unable to
    cater for a secondary student's educational needs because of their
    special course requirements, and
-   the student needs to attend a school away from home

Students may not be approved for the away from home rate if an
applicable special course is available at a local government school
within reasonable travelling time or distance.

Away from Home rate can be claimed:

-   for new customers, as part of their ABSTUDY claim, or
-   for existing customers, via a statement (verbal or written)
    indicating the criteria under which they are seeking approval

Note: dependent schooling students studying a qualifying special course
by distance education/correspondence are not eligible for the away from
home rate under the special course provision.

Unfavourable decisions

When making an unfavourable decision, speak to the customer:

-   explain the decision
-   give them a chance to provide more information, and
-   advise their review and appeal rights

The Resources page contains a list of schools with special programs
approved for the away from home rate of ABSTUDY.
