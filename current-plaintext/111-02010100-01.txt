This document outlines the process of accessing archived Low Income
Health Care Card (LIC) data using the Archiving and Culling Engine (ACE)
application.

General rules for archiving

The general rules for archiving LIC records are:

-   The record must have been cancelled for 3 or more years
-   The record must not have recent or unfinalised Debt, Appeal,
    Prosecution or Compensation activity

The only LIC service reason to be archived is LIC.

Not all data for a 3 year old cancelled record is archived. Only
Assessment and Summary data relevant to LIC is archived. No Person data
or common Circumstance data is archived, and this data is retained in
the system for use by other Common Platform Systems.

The Resources page contains a link to the Archiving and Culling Engine
(ACE).
