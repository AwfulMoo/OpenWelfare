exceptional payments that Centrelink is able to make:

-   Crisis Payment (CrP)
-   Special Benefit (SpB)

Alternatively, the customer may be referred to a specialist officer
within the organisation, or an external agency, to provide the specific
assistance required to help the customer through their difficulties.

-   determine whether the customer is 'in crisis or needing special
    help'

    needs
