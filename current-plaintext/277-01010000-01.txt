Risks to a customer's privacy have been identified. See Separating
Safely - protecting personal details to make sure the customer's
personal details are safe before progressing.

This document explains expectations about phone contact with customers.
It does not apply to Personalised Services customers.

Preferred contact method

Contact by phone is the preferred way of interacting with customers when
Services Australia needs to get, confirm or provide information.

Contact by National Relay Service (NRS) or Teletypewriter (TTY) is an
alternative communication option of interacting for people who are deaf,
have hearing loss, or a speech disability.

This provides excellent service in line with Child Support’s Customer
Management Principles and the Customer Management Approach.

See Resources for links to additional customer contact resources.
