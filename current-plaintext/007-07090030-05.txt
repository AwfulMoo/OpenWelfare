|                                   | This can be confirmed by checking |

|                                   | in the FAO system.                |

|                                   | As FTB was cancelled on 24 May    |
|                                   | 2019 (2018-19 financial year), it |
|                                   | cannot be restored as the         |
|                                   | cancellation DOV is before 01     |
|                                   | July 2019 and the customer has    |
|                                   | not contacted until the 2020-21   |
|                                   | financial year. Therefore, the    |
|                                   | customer must lodge a new claim   |
|                                   | to start receiving FTB via        |

|                                   | case is 24 May 2019 as the        |

|                                   | Megan and Tom are in receipt of   |
|                                   | FTB. On 7 July 2020, an uplift is |
|                                   | applied to their estimate,        |
|                                   | increasing it to $60,000 each, a  |
|                                   | combined total of $120,000. This  |
|                                   | results in FTB CAN-INC (cancelled |
|                                   | income).                          |

|                                   | Megan provides an income estimate |
|                                   | of $70,000 in the FTB new claim   |

|                                   | As Megan's FTB is CAN-INC in the  |
|                                   | current financial year, the new   |
|                                   | claim is considered a request for |

|                                   | been recorded, the FTB can be     |
