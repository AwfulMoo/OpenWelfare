This document outlines the procedures in obtaining identity documents
for customers who have a guardianship order that shows a public trustee
body to have control of the customer's affairs.

Public trustees

Where the public trustee is acting on the customer's behalf, it may be
difficult to obtain satisfactory Identity documents. This does not
automatically exempt the customer from providing identity documents;
however staff may need to look at other options.

Trustee organisations are not considered to be a Centrelink agent for
identity purposes. Documents certified by trustees must not be coded
using the Identity Confirmation Dashboard in Process Direct. See,
Sighting, recording and returning original documents.

If Centrelink staff make contact with the trustee organisation, staff
may copy and certify identity documents for the customer. Local
arrangements should be made if this is to occur.

For contact details for the various State Public Trustee Offices, see
Public Trustee offices.

The Resources page contains contact details for Public Trustee offices.
