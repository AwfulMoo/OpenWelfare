This document outlines details on the types of circumstances that will
trigger a match which will initiate a record to be selected for an
Accelerated Claimant Matching (ACM) review.

Changes/criteria that will trigger match

ACM selections are created by comparing new claim or change of
circumstance data electronically against current Centrelink data
(including data kept on the Debt Management and Information System
(DMIS)).

Data is compared based upon the various criteria for each ACM review
type. Listed below are examples of changes to a customer record that
will trigger the matching process:

change of name

change of address

change of bank account details

change of allowance/pension/benefit status, including the following:

-   new claims for Centrelink administered payments
-   transfer of payment between system environments
-   restoration of payments
-   updates on lapsed cases
-   cancellation of payments

During the matching process, criteria which will trigger a match
include:

-   identical Tax File Numbers (TFNs)
-   similar address details
-   identical bank account details
-   similar identity details, for example, surname, forename, date of
    birth and gender
-   Family assistance vs Income Support Child matching
-   Member of a Couple (MOC) matching
-   customers who are residing at the same address as an ex-partner with
    whom they have an identified Child Support relationship

A match will be created when at least one trigger is identified on 2 or
more Centrelink records.
