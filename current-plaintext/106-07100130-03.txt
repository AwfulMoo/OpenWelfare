|                                   | Mod R. The Q454 is not needed for |
|                                   | smaller properties such as hobby  |
|                                   | farms with minimal farm           |

|                                   | exempt because it is the          |
|                                   | principal home, or it is an       |
|                                   | exempt farm asset, do not issue a |
|                                   | Q454 for that property.           |
