This document outlines the policy on conducting a visual comparison of a
customer who wears a facial covering against the photographs on their
identity documents.

Requirement to compare a customer to their photo identification

Customers are required to confirm their identity when applying for a
payment or service or authenticate their identity when collecting an
urgent payment from a service centre.

Identity confirmation requires a customer to attend a service centre,
Agent or access point to provide photo identification to establish their
identity. The Service Officer/Agent is required to compare the photo
identification with the customer and confirm the linkage between the
customer and their identity.

Considerations when conducting a visual comparison

When conducting a visual comparison the following steps should be
adhered to:

-   The reason for the request should be explained to the person
-   A person may choose not to have a visual comparison conducted, but
    in doing so may be denied access to services or benefits. This risk
    must be communicated to the person
-   Health, safety, cultural and religious considerations should be
    taken into account before requesting someone to remove a face
    covering such as helmet, mask, scarf, veil, niqab, burka, balaclava
    or other similar items
-   Only a person with the authority to establish identity should
    request to make a visual comparison
-   The request should only be to view the face for the period of time
    needed, and to the extent necessary, to establish identity
-   A person should not be requested to remove garments or equipment
    that covers the person’s hair if their face is otherwise visible
-   Where operationally feasible, a face covering worn for reasons of
    modesty should only be removed in the presence of persons of the
    same gender, preferably in a place where only the identifier can
    view the face of the person to be identified
-   Where appropriate other means of identification should be considered
