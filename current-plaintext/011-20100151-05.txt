| Non-compliance with the Health    | To make sure we are using our     |
| and Other Services (Compensation) | time in the most efficient way    |
| Act.                              | and to improve our customer       |
|                                   | service, we are focusing our      |
|                                   | effort in a slightly different    |
|                                   | way.                              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Until recently we have processed  |
|                                   | each request in order of date     |
|                                   | received, to ensure procedural    |
|                                   | fairness. Moving forward we will  |
|                                   | be focusing on claims that have   |
|                                   | reached judgment or settlement.   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This change will enable more      |
|                                   | staff to be re-directed to work   |
|                                   | on new registrations and cases    |
|                                   | that have reached settlement.     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | In a practical sense this means   |
|                                   | the below:                        |

|                                   | -   Any initial requests for      |

|                                   |     and associated Notices of     |
|                                   |     past benefits will be         |
|                                   |     processed                     |
|                                   | -   Any subsequent requests for   |
|                                   |     Medicare history statements   |

|                                   |     cases will be processed when  |
|                                   |     the notifiable party has      |
|                                   |     formally advised us of        |

|                                   | -   We will consider requests to  |
|                                   |     process otherwise if          |
|                                   |     exceptional circumstances     |
