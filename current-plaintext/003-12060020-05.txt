Social Work Report

A Social Work Report is needed for

-   CSAT assessments for child care receivers
-   Child Terminal Reviews
-   Carers under 18

Other matters may need a social worker report if warranted by the
particular circumstances of the referral. Any matter resulting in an
adverse recommendation should have a social worker report completed. If
it is unclear if a social work report is needed, consult with a Social
Work Support Manager or a CSAT social worker for further guidance.
