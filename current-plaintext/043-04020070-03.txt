|                                   | If a customer states that they    |
|                                   | have resigned as appointor,       |
|                                   | establish in what other ways they |
|                                   | remain involved in the trust.     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | For example, they may still be    |
|                                   | included among the categories of  |
|                                   | beneficiaries, may still be a     |
|                                   | creditor, and still expect the    |
|                                   | newly appointed appointor, an     |
|                                   | associate, to act in accordance   |
|                                   | with their own wishes.            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If a Complex Assessment Officer   |
|                                   | (CAO) has previously determined   |
|                                   | that a customer has made a        |
|                                   | genuine relinquishment of control |
|                                   | from this trust, an assessment of |
|                                   | the trust may not be required at  |
|                                   | this stage.                       |

|                                   | A settlor or creator generally    |
|                                   | contributes an amount (usually a  |
|                                   | nominal amount of $10-$50) to     |
|                                   | start the trust. The settlor may  |
|                                   | have no further involvement in    |
|                                   | the trust after it is set up.     |

|                                   | Trusts may be established in a    |
|                                   | will after death. The maker of a  |
|                                   | will is called a 'testator'. A    |
|                                   | will is the document which        |
|                                   | describes how the person wishes   |
|                                   | their property to be distributed  |
|                                   | after their death. A will does    |
|                                   | not operate until the testator's  |
|                                   | death, and, as it is merely a     |
|                                   | declaration made during the       |
|                                   | testator's lifetime, it can       |
|                                   | freely be revoked or altered by   |
|                                   | the testator.                     |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | trustee(s), this customer may be  |

|                                   | when they have realised the       |
