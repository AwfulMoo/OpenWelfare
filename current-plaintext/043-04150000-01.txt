For Complex Assessment Officer (CAO) use only

This document outlines procedures that advise Complex Assessment
Officers (CAO) how to create and remove links from organisations to
customers and between two or more organisations.

Links between customers and organisations

Links between customers and organisations are required in order for the
information regarding attributed income and assets to be used in
assessing the correct entitlements for affected customers. It is also
important how these links are set up, because if the links do not go in
the right direction, the assessment will be incorrect.

To link in the direction of attribution, a link between an organisation
and a customer must always start on the organisation's Customer
Reference Number (CRN), for example, the organisation must be in the
header to create a link to the person.

When assessing complex multiple-entity cases, CAOs may find it useful to
compose a diagram to illustrate the lines of control between
organisations and ultimately to a customer.
