Customer phones with a digital self service claim enquiry

When a customer contacts the agency by phone about their claim, suitably
skilled Service Officers must attempt first contact resolution.

Note: process all financial hardship and vulnerable customer claims at
first point of contact. Service Officers not skilled in this work type,
must escalate to a Medicare and Aged Care – Local Peer Support (LPS) for
help.
