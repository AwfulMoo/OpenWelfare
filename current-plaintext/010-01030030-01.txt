This document outlines the responsibility Services Australia has in
providing information about education and training opportunities to the
public.

Services Australia's role

Services Australia's role is to provide customers with access to
information about education and training opportunities to customers to
maximise their abilities. Under duty of care, staff should not discuss
the relative merits of one school over another. It is the responsibility
of the customer to find an appropriate school and to arrange their
enrolment.

The Resources page contains information about how to access information
about schools in all states of Australia, including distance education
and course approval.
