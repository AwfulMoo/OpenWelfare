| 1                                 | Determining the date a claim is   |
|                                   | 'made' and start day              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | To be paid an Australian social   |
|                                   | security payment, a person must   |
|                                   | generally make a claim. A claim   |
|                                   | is 'made' by being 'lodged' (that |
|                                   | is, received) but may be deemed   |
|                                   | or 'taken to be made' on a        |
|                                   | different date, for example,      |
|                                   | early claims.                     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | For claims made after 1 July      |
|                                   | 2018, the 'intent to claim'       |
|                                   | provisions apply only to          |
|                                   | customers in vulnerable           |
|                                   | circumstances. See Intent to      |
|                                   | claim and vulnerable customers.   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Policy advice is that a person    |
|                                   | may meet the residence rules for  |
|                                   | claims on either the date the     |
|                                   | claim is 'made' or the date the   |
|                                   | claim is 'taken to be made'       |
|                                   | taking into account CCD, DOCs or  |
|                                   | early claim, as well as any other |
|                                   | backdated Start Day rules. For    |
|                                   | example, lodged within 14 days of |
|                                   | their partner or within 4 weeks   |
|                                   | of childbirth.                    |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | Act 1999 allows a delegate at the |
|                                   | appropriate level to determine    |

|                                   | another way.                      |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | -   All agreements allow the date |
|                                   |     a claim is lodged with the    |
|                                   |     agreement authority in the    |
|                                   |     agreement country to be used  |
