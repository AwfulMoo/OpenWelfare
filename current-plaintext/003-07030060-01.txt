This document outlines how to confirm entry and release for customers in
custody including prisons, police cells/watch houses and youth justice
centres. This information is needed when determining a customer's
entitlement to payment.

On this Page:

Prison discharge documents

In some cases, customers will have discharge documents.

A customer's discharge/release document or letter from the place of
detention can confirm their entry and release dates.

This can be used to confirm the period in custody unless the document is
illegible or if there is doubt about its validity.

Identity Confirmation

If an original prison discharge/release certificate has a photo or
signature of the customer, it can be used as an identity document.

Confirming details with prison/institution

If the customer does not have prison discharge documents, the period in
custody must be confirmed by contacting the Prison Liaison Officer for
that prison, or the prison/institution directly.

Service Officers can confirm details with the responsible Prison Liaison
Officer or prison/institution over the phone.

The Resources page has a link to contact details.

Important payment consideration

Income support payments are not payable during periods in custody

-   Staff must ensure that payments are not restored/started from the
    original suspension or cancellation date
-   Payments that are incorrectly restored from the
    suspension/cancellation date will cause an overpayment and result in
    the customer incurring a debt

Customers admitted to custody should have their payments
suspended/cancelled from the first full day after entry into custody

-   See Admission process for incarcerated customers

Customers released from custody may have their payments restored or
started from the date of release

-   See Intent to claim and vulnerable customers

If eligible for a Crisis Payment, this should be paid on the date of
claim

-   A claim for a crisis payment must be lodged within 7 calendar days
    of the date of release from prison
-   The customer may need to provide evidence of release from prison if
    in custody for 14 days or more
-   See New claim for Crisis Payment after customer released from prison
    or psychiatric confinement

Australia's prison release services including Crisis Payment - Prison
