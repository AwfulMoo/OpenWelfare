Historical - FFA voucher before 11 June 2020

If the FFA was completed by a prescribed adviser before 11 June 2020,
evidence of the prescribed adviser's qualification and membership of a
professional institution must also be scanned to the customer's record.

Before 11 June 2020 the assessment was completed by a qualified
prescribed adviser.

If the service was provided before 11 June 2020 evidence of the
prescribed adviser's relevant financial qualification and current
membership of a professional institution.

The documents to be submitted for voucher processing depend on when the
FFA was completed:

-   completed voucher (A2554m) signed by the customer and the prescribed
    adviser
-   itemised invoice
-   evidence of the prescribed adviser's relevant financial
    qualifications, and
-   current membership of a professional institution

All of the above documents are needed, even if the voucher and invoice
was submitted after 11 June 2020.
