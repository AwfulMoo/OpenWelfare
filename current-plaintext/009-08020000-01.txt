This document outlines information about creating a Carer Payment (CP)
and/or Carer Allowance (CA) link between the carer and the care receiver
within a review activity where the care receiver link has been broken.

Ensure links between carer and care receiver exist

When a carer on CP and/or CA is reviewed, it is necessary to check that
the records of the carer and the care receiver are 'linked'. This
generally occurs at grant.

The Service Officer will need to check the Care Receiver Summary (CRS)
screen on the carer's record to see if the current care receiver's name
appears and if a link needs to be re-established. If not already
established, or if the link has been broken and needs to be
re-established, the link must be created by the Service Officer when the
CP and/or CA review is processed.
