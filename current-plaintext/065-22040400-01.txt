Aged Care Staff Portal (ACSP) - Care Recipient in Context (CRiC)

Service Officers can use the Aged Care Staff Portal (ACSP) via the Care
Recipient in Context (CRiC) view. This view provides Service Officers a
more holistic view from a care recipient’s perspective compared to the
Service in Context. That is, they are presented with care recipient
information across their journey within various aged care services.

The Process page describes how Service Officers can use the ACSP via the
CRiC view.

The Resources page contains a link to the ACSP.
