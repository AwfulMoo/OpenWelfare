This document outlines how to conduct an Initial Assessment interview to
place a customer onto Income Management under the Vulnerable Welfare
Payment Recipient (VWPR) measure.

Initial Assessment interview

An Initial Assessment interview will be conducted to place a customer on
Income Management under the Vulnerable Welfare Payment Recipients (VWPR)
measure. This is conducted with the customer and, if applicable, their
payment nominee, to determine how their income managed funds can be best
used to meet their priority needs.

The interview can be conducted face-to-face or over the phone. Service
Officers will explain to the customer the benefits of Income Management
and provide information about other services which may assist them,
including Centrepay.

Automatically triggered VWPR Youth Income Management customers may be
eligible for an exclusion from Income Management. Only social workers
can determine if a customer is eligible for an exclusion. At the Initial
Assessment interview, Service Officers will assess if the customer
should be referred to a social worker for an exclusion assessment.
Customers can also request an exclusion, which must be referred to a
social worker.

Failure to attend interview

If a customer does not attend an Initial Assessment interview within
their Income Management engagement period. Income management will be
automatically applied to their payments.

If a customer still does not attend an Initial Assessment interview 28
days after Auto Income Management commences their payments may be
suspended.

Preparing for an Initial Assessment interview

To prepare for an Initial Assessment interview, Service Officers must:

-   Check whether the customer requires an interpreter, and book
    interpreter if required
-   Check whether the customer has an excluded payment nominee for
    Income Management purposes. If they do not have an excluded payment
    nominee, they are eligible for Income Management. However the
    payment nominee must attend the Initial Assessment interview as they
    are responsible for managing the customer's payments
-   Check the record for any vulnerability indicators
-   Check the customer's current rate of payment and any regular income
-   Check whether the customer has any current Centrepay deductions or
    Rent Deduction Scheme payments
-   Have relevant Income Management and self service communication
    products available for the customer
