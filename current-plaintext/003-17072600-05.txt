Template - social casework

This template has been developed to give social workers a way of
documenting social casework which meets the Social Casework and Social
Work Practice Standards.

A hard copy of this plan can be used to guide conversations and may be
an effective resource for the customer. Contents of the case plan must
be documented in the Social Work Information System (SWIS).

Copy and paste the template into SWIS case notes.

Note:

-   use only upper or lower case letters and numbers
-   only full stops or commas will successfully copy and paste
-   dashes, slashes, colons, apostrophes or similar will prevent the
    document from copying and pasting into SWIS case notes. These
    symbols can be added directly into SWIS case notes, do not copy and
    paste
