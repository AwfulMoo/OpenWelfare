This document outlines how FTB Part A instalments are affected when
Child Support reassesses the amount of child support a customer is
entitled to receive from a date in the past.

Child Support advises Centrelink of retrospective change

When Child Support advises Centrelink of a retrospective change in a
child support assessment for an FTB customer, the information is treated
differently depending on what period the change relates to.

Prior to 1 July 2011

From 1 July 2006 to 30 June 2011, it was assumed that the customer was
collecting their new child support assessment amount from their date
paid to plus one, and that they did not collect or repay child support
in relation to the retrospective assessment.

A letter was sent to the customer asking them to advise Centrelink if
they:

Collected any owed child support arrears or repaid any child support

-   If the customer advised they had received arrears or repaid child
    support in relation to the past period, the adjusted amount
    calculated by the system could be updated to reflect the amount
    received or paid so that the customer's maintenance income for the
    period was adjusted

Wanted to request a review of their FTB entitlement (as a result of
having to repay child support due to the backdated assessment)

-   If the customer is required to repay child support due to a
    backdated reassessment, they may be able to receive arrears of FTB.
    For full arrears to be payable, the customer must request a review
    within the specified timeframe. The time limit for customers to
    request a review is the later of 13 weeks after they receive
    notification of the review by Child Support, or 52 weeks after the
    original decision was made

1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012

The reassessed child support assessment is applied from the later of the
date of event (DOV) or 1 July 2011.

-   If the customer is private collect, they are assumed to have
    collected the new assessment amount from the actual event date (or 1
    July 2011, whichever is later)
-   The customer's ongoing FTB Part A rate may be adjusted from the
    start of their next fortnightly payment (date paid to plus one) as
    the new child support assessment amount is used to estimate their
    annual maintenance income under the Entitlement Method from that
    date
-   If a potential FTB overpayment is identified, the customer's ongoing
    FTB rate will be automatically adjusted for the remainder of the
    financial year to offset the potential overpayment under mandatory
    continuous adjustment
-   If potential FTB arrears are identified as a result of a
    retrospective change in a Child Support assessment, the arrears will
    be deferred and included in the reconciliation result
-   If the customer advises they did not collect the child support
    arrears, the non-paid arrears may be taken out of the FTB assessment
    so that the customer's maintenance income is adjusted
-   If a customer is required to repay child support due to a backdated
    reassessment, the customer may be able to receive arrears of FTB. In
    order for full arrears to be payable, customers must request a
    review within the specified timeframe. The time limit for customers
    to request a review is the later of 13 weeks after the person
    receives notification of the review by Child Support, or 52 weeks
    after the original decision was made

On or after 1 July 2012

The reassessed child support assessment is applied from the later of the
date of event (DOV) or 1 July 2012:

-   if the customer is private collect, they are assumed to have
    collected the new assessment amount from the actual event date (or 1
    July 2012, whichever is later)
-   the customer's ongoing FTB Part A rate may be adjusted from the
    start of their next fortnightly payment (date paid to plus one) as
    the new child support assessment amount is used to estimate their
    annual maintenance income under the Entitlement Method from that
    date
-   if a potential FTB overpayment is identified, the customer's ongoing
    FTB rate will be automatically adjusted for the remainder of the
    financial year to offset the potential overpayment under mandatory
    continuous adjustment
-   if potential FTB arrears are identified as a result of a
    retrospective change in a Child Support assessment, the arrears will
    be deferred and included in the reconciliation result
-   if the customer advises they are unable to privately collect arrears
    owing to them as a result of a retrospective increase to the child
    support assessment, they should be advised to seek legal advice as
    the amount cannot be adjusted (unlike periods between 1 July 2011
    and 30 June 2012)

If a private collect customer has already been reconciled for a
financial year and a retrospective:

-   decrease to their child support assessment is received, the customer
    may receive FTB arrears
-   increase to their child support assessment is received, the customer
    may incur an FTB debt. Customers who incur an FTB debt as a result
    of an increased retrospective assessment can apply for a formal
    review of the FTB reconciliation debt with Centrelink. If the
    customer is unable to collect the arrears owed due to the
    retrospective assessment, it may be appropriate for the customer to
    seek legal advice about enforcing the unpaid child support arrears.
    If the customer provides a letter from their legal representative
    that advises they cannot assist, as it would not be cost effective
    to do so, refer the customer to a Social Worker to discuss a partial
    maintenance exemption for the relevant financial year
-   if the customer wants to discuss or apply for a formal review of the
    retrospective change to their child support assessment, refer them
    to Child Support

First child support assessments

If it is the first child support assessment, FTB Part A arrears may be
issued as a result of the customer now satisfying the Maintenance Action
Test (MAT) from the start date of the child support assessment. The
maintenance income is not applied to the FTB arrears for periods prior
to 1 July 2011.

In the current financial year

The reassessed child support assessment is applied from the later of the
date of event (DOV) or 1 July of the current income year:

-   If the customer is private collect, they are assumed to have
    collected the new assessment amount from the actual event date (or 1
    July of the current financial year, whichever is later)
-   The customer's ongoing FTB Part A rate may be adjusted from the
    start of their next fortnightly payment (date paid to plus one) as
    the new child support assessment amount is used to estimate their
    annual maintenance income under the Entitlement Method from that
    date
-   If a potential FTB overpayment is identified, the customer's ongoing
    FTB rate will be automatically adjusted for the remainder of the
    financial year to offset the potential overpayment under mandatory
    continuous adjustment
-   If potential FTB arrears are identified as a result of a
    retrospective change in a Child Support assessment, the arrears will
    be deferred and included in the reconciliation result
-   If the customer advises they are unable to privately collect arrears
    owing to them as a result of a retrospective increase to the child
    support assessment, they should be advised to seek legal advice as
    the amount cannot be adjusted (unlike periods between 1 July 2011
    and 30 June 2012)

Child Support collect customers

Child support arrears may be collected by Child Support and included in
the disbursements notified electronically. Arrears of child support are
assessable in the financial year they are received, not in the financial
year for which they were due.

If child support is assessed using the Modified Entitlement Method, the
amount assessed will be recalculated whenever Child Support advises new
disbursement details or a change in the assessment amount. Annual
maintenance income will be calculated using the Entitlement Method and
the Disbursement Method and the method that results in the higher amount
will be used to work out the customer's ongoing FTB Part A rate.

If a projected reconciliation overpayment is identified, the customer's
ongoing FTB rate may be reduced to offset the potential overpayment
under mandatory continuous adjustment.

Where a retrospective decrease in a child support assessment has
occurred for a Child Support collect customer, Child Support may reduce
the ongoing disbursements to recover the overpaid amount.

When a child/case end is transferred by Child Support for a Child
Support Collect customer on the Disbursement method, the system
retrospectively changes the case to Private Collect and applies the full
maintenance entitlement amount.

This retrospective change in assessment results in the customer having
their annualised maintenance income assessed under the Entitlement
Method. In the majority of cases, this will result in a decrease in the
customer's ongoing rate of FTB Part A. This change in annualised
maintenance income can also invoke Mandatory Continuous Adjustment,
causing a further reduction to the customer's ongoing rate of FTB.

Note: this is not caused by incorrectly entered/ended case data or a
system problem, however it can lead to an unintended and unexpected
reduction to the customer's ongoing rate. Occurrences of this issue must
be reported to the Level 2 Policy Helpdesk for escalation to the Policy
(Advice) Assessment Team for a workaround to be considered. See the
Resources page for a link.

Information incorrect or not present on a customer's record

If a customer contacts to advise that the retrospective child support
assessment information on their Centrelink record is incorrect or not
present see Child Support data has not loaded onto or is incorrectly
affecting customer's record for further details.

The Resources page contains links to the Child Support Unit (CSU) Income
Estimate Excel template, the Services Australia website, the Level 2
Policy Helpdesk, and scenarios showing the effect of a retrospective
Child Support assessment on an FTB instalment customer collecting child
support privately.
