Methods of depreciation

There are 2 methods of depreciation:

-   prime cost depreciation method (also known as straight line)
-   diminishing value depreciation method (also known as reducing
    balance)

Under the prime cost method, each year the amount claimed as an expense
is based on the cost of the asset whereas under the diminishing value
method, the amount claimed is based on the written down value (WDV) of
the asset. The WDV is the cost of the asset less all previous
depreciation amounts. Businesses can choose either method of
depreciation, but because of the ability to claim greater expense, and
therefore a larger tax deduction, in the earlier years, most choose the
diminishing value method.
