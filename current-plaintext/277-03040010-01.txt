Care changes notified up to 30 June 2018 (14 May 2019 for WA Ex-nuptial
child support cases) must be managed under the legislation that was in
place prior to the amendments effective 1 July 2018 and 15 May 2019
respectively. See Notification of change in child support care before 1
July 2018 (15 May 2019 for WA Ex-nuptial cases).

This document outlines information on the process for notification of
change in child support care from 1 July 2018 (15 May 2019 for WA
Ex-nuptial child support cases).

Care date of effect

When a care change occurs:

-   on or after 1 July 2018, or
-   before 1 July 2018 but notified on or after 30 December 2018, or
-   that is notified on or after 15 May 2019 for WA Ex-nuptial child
    support cases

and we are notified more than 28 days after it occurred, the new care
determination will be used for child support in the assessment from the
date:

-   the care changed, if a person’s care has decreased
-   notified to Services Australia, if a person’s care has increased

A single care change for a child, if advised outside of 28 days, will
take effect in the assessment on different days for each
parent/non-parent carer.

If the care changed before 1 July 2018 and we are notified more than 28
days after the change but before 30 December 2018, or was notified
before 15 May 2019 for WA Ex-nuptial cases, the new care determination
will be used in the child support assessment from the date we are
notified for all parents/non-parent carers.

Anyone can be at risk of vulnerability. It is not linked to a specific
customer group or characteristic. Everyone experiences vulnerability
differently.
