This document outlines how Pharmaceutical Allowance (PhA) is paid. PhA
cannot be claimed as a separate payment and is paid fortnightly as a
supplement to eligible customers' income support payments.

Pension supplement

From 20 September 2009, Pharmaceutical Allowance (PhA) was replaced by
the Pension Supplement for some customers.

Bereavement period

If a person on JobSeeker Payment (JSP) or Youth Allowance (job seeker)
is a single principal carer of a dependent child who dies, PhA continues
to be payable for the bereavement period of 14 weeks.

Advance payment of PhA

Customers in receipt of Disability Support Pension (DSP) and under 21
with no dependent children or Parenting Payment Single (PPS) customers
with high prescription usage and very limited means may be entitled to
receive PhA in advance. A maximum of seven fortnightly instalments can
be paid in advance.

Rate of PhA

The rate of PhA depends on the customer's relationship status. Select P
in Rates and Thresholds.
