|                                   | A partnership is the relationship |
|                                   | that exists between two or more   |
|                                   | people who are carrying on a      |
|                                   | business in common with a view to |
|                                   | profit.                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | In this situation, two or more    |
|                                   | people ‘together’ are the         |
|                                   | business. A partnership is not a  |
|                                   | legal entity.                     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Essentially, all partners are     |
|                                   | jointly in direct control of the  |
|                                   | business and the money the        |
|                                   | business makes belongs to all     |
|                                   | partners jointly, although this   |
|                                   | can be modified through the use   |
|                                   | of a partnership agreement.       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The rights and interests of       |
|                                   | members of a partnership are      |
|                                   | defined in a partnership          |
|                                   | agreement between the persons in  |
|                                   | the partnership, but there is no  |
|                                   | requirement for a written         |
|                                   | agreement. Partnership agreements |
|                                   | can be written, oral, or inferred |
|                                   | from the conduct of the parties.  |
|                                   | Partners can be individuals or    |
|                                   | artificial legal entities, such   |
|                                   | as companies.                     |

|                                   |     listed and this enables the   |
|                                   |     company to raise funds by     |

|                                   |     public, for example Telstra   |

|                                   |     (usually by taking out loans) |
|                                   |     or borrowing from individuals |

|                                   |     For example, a director       |

|                                   | The primary feature of this trust |
|                                   | is that the trustee has           |
|                                   | discretion to determine which     |
|                                   | beneficiaries receive             |
|                                   | income/assets, and when and how.  |
|                                   | Therefore, there is no fixed      |
|                                   | entitlement for each and every    |
|                                   | beneficiary.                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Generally, the immediate family   |
|                                   | members of the trustee are the    |
|                                   | beneficiaries of a discretionary  |
|                                   | trust. The trustee will           |
|                                   | ordinarily consider which of the  |
|                                   | beneficiaries will receive the    |
|                                   | most benefit from the income, and |
|                                   | is usually undertaken with a view |
|                                   | to minimising the tax implication |
|                                   | of the family members.            |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | The trustee must distribute       |
|                                   | assets / income to the            |
|                                   | beneficiaries strictly in         |
|                                   | accordance with the terms of the  |
|                                   | trust deed. The trustee has no    |
|                                   | discretion to alter the           |
|                                   | distribution of the assets and or |
|                                   | income.                           |

|                                   | pre-determined value, so those    |
|                                   | beneficiaries who hold more units |
|                                   | are entitled to a greater share   |
|                                   | of the assets and income.         |
