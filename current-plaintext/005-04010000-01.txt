This document outlines the services available for customers who have
limited English proficiency or who are deaf or hard of hearing.

Interpreting services during COVID-19

Services Australia introduced changes to interpreting services during
the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. These services continue to be
available for customers with limited English language proficiency:

Interpreter Connect service (on-demand telephone interpreters): connects
staff immediately to a telephone interpreter via an automated service

Booked telephone appointments: staff can book a telephone interpreter
for future appointments

Booked on-site appointments: only available by exception, for example
Auslan and sign language appointments

Rostered interpreter service (sessional):

-   provides staff with rostered on-site interpreters at service centres
    with high language needs. Restrictions to the service are dependent
    on the service centre’s COVID status level
-   Indigenous rostered interpreters are available at Broome, Kununurra
    and Halls Creek Service Centres

Interpreter services

Interpreters help customers who speak a language other than English
conduct their business.

The benefits of using an interpreter include:

-   improved customer and staff experience
-   greater accuracy in the information recorded
-   fewer customer debts or compliance issues
-   less re-work or time resolving issues

Using qualified interpreters

Services Australia prefers the use of qualified interpreters. The use of
a customer's friend or relative as the interpreter is actively
discouraged. This avoids potential problems with language competency,
impartiality, content integrity and confidentiality.

Providing feedback

Staff are encouraged to provide feedback about their experience using
interpreters. Feedback helps identify how services can be improved.

To provide feedback, contact Language Services and include the following
information:

-   Service Officer’s name
-   Time and date of appointment or the on-demand phone call
-   Language
-   Vendor number of interpreter
-   Compliment/complaint

Consider the following questions when providing feedback:

-   Was the interpreter professionally presented and punctual?
-   Was the interpreter’s language clear and easy to understand?
-   Did the conversation proceed smoothly?
-   Did the interpreter elaborate, advocate or provide advice to the
    customer?
-   Did the interpreter behave in a professional, honest and courteous
    manner?
