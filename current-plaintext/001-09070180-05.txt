| Item                              | Scenario                          |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Does meet requirements            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Michael has a partial capacity to |
|                                   | work of between 15 - 22 hours per |
|                                   | week and is currently working 20  |
|                                   | hours a week at the national      |
|                                   | minimum wage rate. This fully     |
|                                   | satisfies the sufficient work     |
|                                   | test. Michael takes leave at full |
|                                   | pay for 4 weeks and is regarded   |
|                                   | as still working for 20 hours a   |
|                                   | week during this period and       |
|                                   | therefore fully satisfies the     |
|                                   | sufficient work test.             |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 2                                 | Does not meet requirements        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Indira has a 15 hour per week     |
|                                   | requirement and has been assessed |
|                                   | as having a partial capacity to   |
|                                   | work between 15 - 22 hours per    |
|                                   | week. Indira works for 10 hours a |
|                                   | week, earning $32 an hour, or     |
|                                   | $320 a week. The applicable       |
|                                   | hourly rate for the national      |
|                                   | minimum wage is $20.33 an hour,   |
|                                   | so Indira must earn at least      |
|                                   | $304.95 a week. As Indira earns   |
|                                   | more than this, the remuneration  |
|                                   | test is satisfied. However,       |
|                                   | Indira is not working the minimum |
|                                   | number or hours required, so the  |
|                                   | sufficient work test is not met.  |
|                                   | Indira will need to undertake or  |
|                                   | look for at least 5 more hours a  |
|                                   | week.                             |
