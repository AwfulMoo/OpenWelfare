PCW job seeker scenarios

This table describes the types of mutual obligation requirements that
should be added to a Job Plan, and how customers with a PCW can meet
their mutual obligation requirements through sufficient work, including
paid leave. Note: these scenarios are based on the national minimum wage
as at 1 July 2022 of $21.38 per hour.

| Item                              | Scenario                          |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Does meet requirements            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Michael has a PCW of between      |
|                                   | 15-22 hours per week and is       |
|                                   | currently working 20 hours per    |
|                                   | week at the national minimum wage |
|                                   | rate. This fully satisfies the    |
|                                   | sufficient work test. Michael     |
|                                   | takes leave at full pay for 4     |
|                                   | weeks and is regarded as still    |
|                                   | working for 20 hours per week     |
|                                   | during this period and therefore, |
|                                   | fully satisfies the sufficient    |
|                                   | work test.                        |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 2                                 | Does not meet requirements        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Indira has a 15 hour per week     |
|                                   | requirement and has been assessed |
|                                   | as having a PCW between 15-22     |
|                                   | hours per week. Indira works for  |
|                                   | 10 hours per week, earning $35 an |
|                                   | hour, or $350 per week. The       |
|                                   | applicable hourly rate for the    |
|                                   | national minimum wage is $21.38   |
|                                   | an hour, so Indira must earn at   |
|                                   | least $320.70 per week. As Indira |
|                                   | earns more than this, the         |
|                                   | remuneration test is satisfied.   |
|                                   | However, Indira is not working    |
|                                   | the minimum number or hours       |
|                                   | required, so the sufficient work  |
|                                   | test is not met. Indira will need |
|                                   | to undertake or look for at least |
|                                   | 5 more hours of work per week.    |
