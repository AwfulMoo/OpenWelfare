P24845 problem and workaround

The P24845 system issue may impact in the following scenarios:

-   Where a step parent is claiming Family Tax Benefit (FTB) that has
    been transferred to them from a biological parent, and the other
    biological parent also becomes entitled to receive FTB, for example
    their percentage of care increases to above 35%, and they make a
    claim
-   Where the biological parent transfers their FTB to a step parent and
    they later separate. Care details for the child will not be
    transferred correctly to Child Support if a past period care refresh
    is requested
-   The care may transfer to the step parent's child support record
    (with incorrect child relationship details) causing inaccurate child
    support assessments and impacting multiple parties

As a result, where FTB is transferred out to partner ('TOP' is coded on
the Child Override/Claim (CHOC) screen - from parent to step parent) and
the customer is a Centrelink and Child Support mutual customer, these
records are to be referred for investigation. See the Process page of
Notification and assessment of shared care arrangements for Family Tax
Benefit (FTB) for further information

FTB reconciliation debts for previous financial years raised due to the incorrect deletion of care information (PM69793/PM72350)

Identifying if PM69793/PM72350 has occurred

Impacted records can be identified by checking the re-reconciliation
result, which will incorrectly display 'less than 10% care' for the
period the debt was created, using the following steps:

-   navigate to the FAO Reconciliation and Claim Summary (FRCS) screen
    for the year the debt was created
-   on FRCS, select the re-reconciled line where the debt is displaying
-   the system will navigate to the FTB Calculation Results (FACRF)
    screen, select a period to navigate to the FTB Calculation Period
    Assessment (FCVPA) screen and then select the Child Details Display
    field
-   the FTB Child Eligibility Summary (FCES) screen will display that
    the customer had 'less than 10% care' for at least one child, note
    the name(s) of the child(ren) and the debt period
-   navigate to the Child Selection (CHS) screen by typing this in the
    Next field and select the record of the child(ren) noted
-   navigate to the FTB Shared Care (FSC) screen. FSC will display the
    correct care percentage for the corresponding period

Note: this issue may have impacted multiple financial years and other
customer records currently/previously linked to the affected customer.
Please complete the above steps to identify all impacted
re-reconciliation results for all impacted records currently/previously
linked to the customer.

Staff not fully trained in Families:

Where a customer contacts due to a previous financial year FTB
re-reconciliation debt (i.e. where the previous reconciliation result
unexpectedly changed), transfer the customer to the Families and
Parenting queue, ensuring that a DOC has been created stating that the
reconciliation result may be impacted by PM69793/PM72350. Ensure the DOC
includes which financial year(s) appear to be impacted.

Staff fully trained in Families:

Where the care percentage in the re-reconciliation does not match the
care percentage on FSC for the impacted periods, the record will need to
be corrected.

-   Code a reassessment activity on the Benefit Action (BA) screen using
    'FTB' as the service reason and REA in the Action field, with an
    effect date of 1 July of the earliest relevant financial year – the
    relevant financial year will be the year in which the problem has
    first impacted (i.e. if the problem impacted the 2002-2003,
    2003-2004 and 2004-2005 financial years, the effect date would be 1
    July 2002 as this is the earliest relevant financial year)
-   Before completing the activity, the result needs to be checked
    carefully to ensure the correct shared care percentage is being
    applied in the relevant year’s re-reconciliation result (this may
    involve checking multiple financial years)
-   If the reassessment results in arrears for a period prior to 1 July
    2015, or if arrears are incorrect for a period after 1 July 2015,
    the arrears are not payable. Do not finalise the activity. See Step
    1 in the Required system checks table in Reconciliation of Family
    Tax Benefit (FTB), for instructions on how to refer the record to
    have the arrears suppressed
-   Unexpected outcomes will need to be investigated further prior to
    the completion of the activity. Contact Technical Peer Support (TPS)
    to seek further assistance if required

For Technical Peer Support (TPS) staff:

Where the re-reconciliation result is investigated and the outcome can
be explained:

-   If the reassessment results in arrears for a period prior to 1 July
    2015, or if arrears are incorrect for a period after 1 July 2015,
    the arrears are not payable. Do not finalise the activity. See Step
    1 in the Required system checks table in Reconciliation of Family
    Tax Benefit (FTB), for instructions on how to refer the record to
    have the arrears suppressed
-   If the outcome is as expected and debt/arrears (if generated) are
    correct, finalise the activity

If the BA reassessment does not correct the re-reconciliation result, or
the results are not as expected, do not finalise the activity

Escalate the impacted record to a Service Support Officer (SSO) with a
detailed explanation of the investigation, quoting PM69793/PM72350

If it is identified there is a debt as a result of the problem, the debt
can be temporarily written-off until corrective action is applied. See
Temporary write off of Centrelink debts

For Service Support Officer (SSO) staff:

investigate the re-reconciliation results of the impacted record

where the re-reconciliation outcome is investigated and the outcome can
be explained:

-   If the reassessment results in arrears for a period prior to 1 July
    2015, or if arrears are incorrect for a period after 1 July 2015,
    the arrears are not payable. Do not finalise the activity. See Step
    1 in the Required system checks table in Reconciliation of Family
    Tax Benefit (FTB), for instructions on how to refer the record to
    have the arrears suppressed
-   If the outcome is as expected and debt/arrears (if generated) are
    correct, finalise the activity

If the BA reassessment:

-   Does not correct the re-reconciliation result, escalate the impacted
    record to the National ICT Referral Officer (NIRO) via the ICT
    Referral Request webform with a detailed explanation of the
    investigation completed, quoting PM69793/PM72350
-   Corrects the 'less than 10% care' issue, however the
    re-reconciliation results are not as expected and the outcome is
    unexplainable, do not finalise the activity. Escalate the record for
    a Complex FTB reco explanation of the re-reconciliation result, see
    Claim pending or finalised or the customer requires more information
    about the reconciliation or lump sum claim result. Note: NFP cannot
    resolve PM69793/PM72350 where the workaround is unsuccessful
