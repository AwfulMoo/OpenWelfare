For Intelligence and Investigations Branch only

This document outlines the responsibilities of investigators in
reporting and recording the progress of cases referred to the
Commonwealth Director of Prosecutions (CDPP) where media attention
criteria are met.

Liaison with the media

This procedure satisfies the Australian Government Investigation
Standards (AGIS) requirement regarding liaison with the media and
release of media statements. It also maximises opportunities for
enhancing the deterrence impact of significant prosecutions by
increasing the level of media attention associated with these matters.

If criteria for media attention are met, the investigator will:

-   complete and seek approval of a Prosecution Case Summary that is
    used to provide information to the Media Section and/or Minister's
    Office
-   provide assistance to the Media Section or Minister's Office if
    requested
-   provide the Prosecution Case Summary to the Fraud Investigation
    Coordination mailbox as part of the weekly 'next in court' report
-   be present on the day of sentencing if possible, and seek a verbal
    result of proceedings from the CDPP so that the Minister and
    executive staff can be briefed
-   record details on the investigation record as events occur

Media protocols

It is not appropriate for investigators to speak to the media on behalf
of Services Australia. However, staff should be familiar with the media
protocols to help deal with the situation calmly, professionally and
with positive outcomes.
