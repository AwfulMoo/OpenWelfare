|                                   | Greg is 15 years of age and       |
|                                   | sleeping rough. Greg enquires at  |
|                                   | his local office about applying   |
|                                   | for Youth Allowance (YA) at the   |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Two weeks later, Greg attends     |

|                                   | about 50 years of age. The adult  |
|                                   | claims Family Tax Benefit (FTB)   |
|                                   | for Greg, stating that they are   |
|                                   | Greg’s guardian and are now       |
|                                   | supporting Greg. The adult is not |
|                                   | registered as a foster carer with |

|                                   | This case should be referred back |
|                                   | to the social worker for a        |

|                                   | not wish to live at home due to   |
|                                   | parental rules about not drinking |
|                                   | alcohol and attending school.     |

|                                   | Mike will eventually return home. |
|                                   | Mike has repeatedly run away and  |
|                                   | moves in with a person who        |
|                                   | provides basic needs and is more  |

|                                   | The adult applies for FTB for     |
|                                   | assistance with providing for     |
|                                   | Mike’s material needs. Allowing   |
