| Item                              | Example                           |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | A customer has been receiving the |
|                                   | Age Pension since 24 June 2012    |
|                                   | and it was payable on 19          |
|                                   | September 2016. On 26 May 2017,   |
|                                   | the customer's Age Pension is     |
|                                   | cancelled. They apply and are     |
|                                   | granted the CSHC from 30 June     |
|                                   | 2017. This customer is            |
|                                   | grandfathered for Energy          |
|                                   | Supplement.                       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The customer is grandfathered for |
|                                   | Energy Supplement because they    |
|                                   | were in receipt of an ISP on the  |
|                                   | grandfathering test date of 19    |
|                                   | September 2016 and they made the  |
|                                   | claim for the CSHC within the     |
|                                   | allowable period of 42 days from  |
|                                   | the Age Pension cancellation      |
|                                   | date.                             |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 2                                 | A customer has been receiving DVA |
|                                   | Service Pension which was payable |
|                                   | on 19 September 2016. On 30 June  |
|                                   | 2017 their DVA Service Pension is |
|                                   | cancelled for income test         |
|                                   | reasons. On 23 August 2017 they   |
|                                   | apply for CSHC and are granted    |
|                                   | from 23 August 2017.              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | They will not get Energy          |
|                                   | Supplement with their CSHC        |
|                                   | because the gap between           |
|                                   | cancellation of their DVA service |
|                                   | pension and claiming the CSHC was |
|                                   | greater than 42 days.             |

| 3                                 | A customer was receiving Newstart |
|                                   | Allowance continuously from 23    |
|                                   | August 2016 until their payment   |
|                                   | was cancelled on 5 February 2017. |
|                                   | The customer is then granted Age  |
|                                   | Pension from 12 March 2017. In    |
|                                   | May 2017, their income increases  |
|                                   | and their entitlement to the Age  |
|                                   | Pension is cancelled on 20 May    |
|                                   | 2017. The customer then applies   |
|                                   | for the CSHC on 10 June 2017 and  |
|                                   | the card is granted from this     |
|                                   | date.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The customer is grandfathered for |
|                                   | Energy Supplement because they    |
|                                   | were in receipt of an ISP on the  |
|                                   | grandfathering test date of 19    |
|                                   | September 2016. They did not have |
|                                   | a gap in Services Australia /DVA  |
|                                   | qualifying ISP from 20 March 2017 |
|                                   | and they made the claim for the   |
|                                   | CSHC within the allowable period  |
|                                   | of 42 days from the Age Pension   |
|                                   | cancellation date.                |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The gap between payments before   |
|                                   | 20 March 2017 is disregarded      |
|                                   | under the Energy Supplement       |
|                                   | grandfathering rules.             |

| 4                                 | A customer was receiving          |
|                                   | Parenting Payment Partnered       |
|                                   | continuously from 15 April 2016   |
|                                   | until their payment was cancelled |
|                                   | on 10 April 2017. In July 2017,   |
|                                   | the customer applies for Newstart |
|                                   | Allowance and is granted from 13  |
|                                   | July 2017.                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This customer will not be         |
|                                   | grandfathered for Energy          |
|                                   | Supplement because there was a    |
|                                   | gap between their payments from   |
|                                   | 20 March 2017. If this customer   |
|                                   | claims CSHC at any future point   |
|                                   | they will not get Energy          |
|                                   | Supplement with their CSHC.       |
