This document outlines when an applicant or student for Assistance for
Isolated Children (AIC) receives other Australian Government assistance
and how it may affect their eligibility for certain AIC allowances or
their rate of payment.

Effect of other payments on AIC

If the applicant or their partner receives or has received:

-   an income-tested pension, payment, benefit or allowance, or holds a
    valid Health Care Card (HCC), AIC is payable. Waving of the parental
    income test may occur when calculating the rate of Additional
    Boarding Allowance (ABA)
-   Family Tax Benefit for the student, Carer Allowance or Double Orphan
    Pension, AIC is payable
-   Rent Assistance or Second Home Allowance is generally not payable.
    This includes if another dependent child of the applicant and/or
    partner (that is, an older sibling of the student who is looking
    after the student in the second home) receives Rent Assistance. See
    Eligibility for Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) Scheme Second
    Home Allowance (SHA) for details of the options available for
    families in these circumstances
-   a First Home Owners Grant, or state-based first home owner
    assistance, in respect of the second family home. Second Home
    Allowance is not payable. This also applies to another dependent
    child of the applicant and/or partner (that is, an older sibling of
    the student looking after the student in the second home)

If the student receives or if the applicant or their partner receives on
the student's behalf:

-   assistance provided by a state or territory government, AIC is
    payable
-   another Australian Government income support payment, AIC is not
    payable
-   other Australian Government education or training assistance, AIC is
    not payable
