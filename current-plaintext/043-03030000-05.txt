Decision Support Tool (DST) questions

The DST is an optional tool to help staff work out if a customer is
self-employed or an employee. Customers do not complete the DST.

It uses questions to help staff weigh up all the facts and decide each
case on its own merit. It can be used to provide a written history of
staff decisions.

It is included in the Self-Employment workflow in Process Direct.

DST questions

Table 1: This table contains the questions asked on the DST. The
questions help Service Officers to work out if a customer is an employee
or self-employed.
