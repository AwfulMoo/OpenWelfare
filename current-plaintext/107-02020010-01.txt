This document outlines information regarding debts which may arise when
a customer's Centrelink payment type changes, or from transfer between
Commonwealth departments or agencies.

Benefit transfers

Benefit transfers occur when:

-   customers transfer between payments (including payments made by
    other Commonwealth departments or agencies)
-   the partner of a benefit, allowance or pension customer commences
    receiving a payment in their own right
-   benefit, allowance or pension customers commence living together as
    a couple

A debt occurs, as specified in section 90 of the Social Security
(Administration) Act 1999 when:

-   a customer's original payment continues beyond the automatic
    termination date following a transfer to another payment

Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA)

Many pensioners receive payments from DVA. Transfers from Centrelink
payments to DVA payments come under:

-   the automatic termination provision in section 90 and
-   the multiple entitlement exclusion provisions in section 47(1) and
    47(3) of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999

The transfer will result in a recoverable social security debt.

Note: this procedure is not to be used in the following cases:

-   for assessments that do not involve a transfer
-   to record an adjustment to arrears for benefit transfers from one
    payment type to another in the same system

The Resources page contains information on automatic termination debts
and clearances between Centrelink and the DVA.
