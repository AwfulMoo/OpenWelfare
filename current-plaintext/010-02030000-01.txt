This document outlines the basic eligibility criteria to qualify for
ABSTUDY.

Overview

ABSTUDY is the Aboriginal Study Assistance Scheme for Australian
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders undertaking approved study. The
ABSTUDY scheme is administered and delivered by Services Australia and
is the responsibility of the Department of Social Services (DSS).

ABSTUDY eligibility criteria

To be eligible for any ABSTUDY assistance, a student or Australian
Apprentice must meet the primary eligibility criteria:

-   an Australian citizen, who normally lives in Australia, and
-   an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, and
-   studying an approved course at an approved education institution, or
-   an Australian Apprentice, or
-   planning to study and undertaking an approved Testing and Assessment
    activity, and
-   not receiving or will not receive any other government assistance to
    study

If the applicant is aged 16-19 years, dependent, living at home and in
full-time secondary study, check if Family Tax Benefit (FTB) may be more
beneficial for the applicant's family.

From 1 January 2020, customers aged 16-19 years receiving a means tested
ABSTUDY payment (such as Living Allowance and/or School Fees Allowance
(Group 2)) can still be considered an FTB child if they are:

-   a full time secondary student
-   approved to live away from home to study, and
-   boarding to attend secondary school

Australian Apprentice

An Australian Apprentice will need a current Commonwealth Registration
number in relation to a full-time apprenticeship/traineeship or trainee
apprenticeship under the Australian Apprenticeships Scheme.

Note: the person does not need to provide proof of their status as an
Australian Apprentice. Services Australia will obtain the Australian
Apprenticeship details from the Department of Employment and Workplace
Relations.

There are seven Awards available under the ABSTUDY scheme. The
eligibility of a student or Australian Apprentice for a particular Award
will depend on their study, training and personal circumstances:

-   Part-time Award (students only)
-   Testing and Assessment Award (students only)
