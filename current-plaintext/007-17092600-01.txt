This document outlines manual processing information for family
assistance claims in Customer First when Assisted Customer Claim (ACC)
cannot be used. This process is only to be used if the claim workflow
cannot be used after the initial claim checks have been completed.

Refer system issues

System issues preventing use of workflows must be escalated for
investigation and manual processing of claims applied only when advised
to do so by ICT or National ICT Referral Officers (NIRO).

The Resources page contains suggested Q999 text when potential
entitlement to another Centrelink payment exists, Q777 request for
information text, additional information on coding instructions for
post-birth or entry into care claims for family assistance and an
example.
