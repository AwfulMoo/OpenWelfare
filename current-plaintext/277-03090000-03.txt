|                                   | multiple rental properties, one   |
|                                   | could be sold and the funds used  |

|                                   | a payment to cover their expenses |

|                                   | For example, if a customer's      |
|                                   | entire mortgage repayments are    |
|                                   | paid by their business, it is not |
|                                   | unjust and inequitable for them   |
|                                   | to be assessed on the FAR because |
|                                   | their reported income does not    |
|                                   | reflect the benefit they receive  |
|                                   | by structuring their affairs      |
|                                   | through their business. Another   |
|                                   | example could be where a          |
|                                   | customer's business pays 10% of   |
|                                   | their electricity bill because    |
|                                   | they operate a home office 5 days |
|                                   | a week.                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Farmers will usually have a link  |
|                                   | to a company or ABN, and should   |
|                                   | be treated in the same way as     |
|                                   | other small businesses. However,  |
|                                   | farmers may be drawing on         |
|                                   | different forms of income         |
|                                   | assistance that indicate they     |
|                                   | have genuinely limited resources. |
|                                   | For example, they may be in       |
|                                   | receipt of Drought Relief or may  |
|                                   | be drawing on a Farm Management   |

|                                   | an Income Equalisation Deposit).  |
|                                   | A farmer may also be supported by |
|                                   | their partner or may be           |

|                                   | Generally, a parent who meets the |

|                                   | to them will contact Child        |

|                                   | than paying the FAR. This is      |
|                                   | because they are unlikely to have |
|                                   | sufficient income. Determining a  |
|                                   | date in the past for FAR to cease |
|                                   | to apply will rarely create an    |
|                                   | overpayment.                      |

|                                   | However, in some cases the parent |
|                                   | may not have been aware they      |
|                                   | could apply for the FAR not to    |
|                                   | apply, and/or enforcement action  |
|                                   | may have been taken to collect    |
|                                   | the amounts. For example, a       |
|                                   | parent may not have received      |
|                                   | income support in the last        |
|                                   | relevant year of income, but they |
|                                   | now receive Centrelink benefits.  |
|                                   | Child Support may have been       |
|                                   | collecting up to 3 times the      |
|                                   | minimum payment from the parent's |
|                                   | Centrelink benefits. This may     |
|                                   | occur if the parent was assessed  |
|                                   | to pay the FAR, and the parent    |
|                                   | may not have known to apply for   |
