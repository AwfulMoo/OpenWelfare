This document outlines the policy to manage duplicate IHIs.

Duplicate IHI records

Duplicate IHIs occur when more than 1 record is created for the same
person, often with slight differences in the name formatting

The Digital Health Data Integrity team manage duplicate IHI records

Duplicate IHIs can include the following:

-   one consumer record is a Medicare record and the other has an IHI
    and no other program entitlements, or
-   both consumer records have an IHI and no other program entitlements

If Service Officers discover a duplicate cluster (2 or more records for
the same person) with the above characteristics, send a referral to the
Digital Health Data Integrity team.
