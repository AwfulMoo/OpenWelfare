|                                   | No. It is important not to make   |
|                                   | assumptions about a customer's    |
|                                   | accommodation status without      |
|                                   | clarifying this with the          |
|                                   | customer. Sometimes there will be |

|                                   | is homeless and sometimes these   |
|                                   | will be more hidden, so if        |
|                                   | unsure, ask. In summary, only     |
|                                   | code a Homelessness Indicator     |
|                                   | where a customer is actually      |
