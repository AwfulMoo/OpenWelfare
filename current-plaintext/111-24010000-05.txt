If details do not automatically populate in the Receiving Office or Your
Office fields, use this tool to look up the required detail.

The tool requires the Harman Flash-Enabled Browser. To check if the
browser is installed, search for the Harman Flash-Enabled Browser in the
Windows search box. This is beside the Windows logo at the bottom left
of the screen.

If the browser is installed, it will appear in the search results and
can be opened.

If it is not installed, go to MySupport and search for Adobe Flash
player error. Follow the instructions to install the browser.

When the Harman Flash Enabled Browser is installed:

-   Open the browser. The browser’s home page appears. The middle of the
    page contains the Harman logo and an address bar
-   Copy the following URL:
