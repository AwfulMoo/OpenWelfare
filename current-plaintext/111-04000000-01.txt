This document outlines Services Australia protocols for staff to follow
when a customer advises they have been a victim of a scam or their
personal information has been lost/stolen and is being misused (or at
risk of being misused).

Services Australia protocols

Services Australia plays an important role in supporting customers who
have provided personal information because of a scam, or their personal
information was stolen/lost and is being misused (or is at risk of
misuse) to commit identity fraud against the agency or in the community.

It is important all staff help the customer and refer them to the Scams
and Identity Theft Helpdesk if appropriate.

Reporting scams

Scams are defined as 'a fraudulent invitation, request, notification or
offer, designed to obtain personal information or money or otherwise
obtain a financial benefit by deceptive means'.

Scams are constantly evolving as technology gives scammers more
opportunities to trick people into giving away their personal
information or pay money. The method of deception could be via a phone
call, SMS message, email, or social media platform. Scams often:

-   impersonate our Brands, other Government or well-known organisations
-   request urgent action
-   threaten life, arrest or other
-   offer technical assistance to gain access to a computer or device
-   promise a financial reward or rebate
-   guarantee a financial return on investments
-   impersonate prospective companions for dating and romance

If a customer is effected by a scam, and has not provided personal
information, a referral to the Scams and Identity Theft Helpdesk is not
required.

The customer should be encourage to report the scam to:

-   General scams to Scamwatch
-   Cyber-related scams to the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC)

Electronic messages and other agency notifications

Notifications from Services Australia, such as SMS messages, emails and
in some cases letters, can be incorrectly perceived as a scam when the
person was not expecting it, or it was sent to an unintended person.
Notifications can also be an indication of unauthorised activity.

It is important that Service Officers determine why the notification was
sent, and in appropriate circumstances, transfer the customer to the
Scams and Identity Theft Helpdesk. See:

Reporting identity crime or lost/stolen personal information

Scammers or cyber criminals structure their dishonest activity to steal
personal information. This, which often includes documents used to
establish or confirm a person's identity (often digital copies) in order
to commit identity fraud.

Once a person's identity has been stolen, it can be difficult to
recover, and it may cause problems for years to come. The financial and
emotional consequences can be devastating. Stolen or lost personal
information can result in various forms of unauthorised activity, for
example:

-   access to government records
-   access and drain bank accounts
-   opening new bank accounts and taking out loans or credit
-   taking out phone plans and other contracts
-   accessing email and social media accounts
-   impersonating genuine people to scam others

If a customer is affected by the loss/theft of their personal
information (outside of what is publicly available), and this is being
misused or at risk of being misused, refer the customer they should be
referred to the Scams and Identity Theft Helpdesk.

Payment destination has been changed without consent

If a customer contacts to advise they have not received their payment,
Service Officers are to refer to Identity fraud for advice on correcting
the customer's record and reissuing payments (if applicable).
