This document outlines information for Program Support Managers on
adding, removing or changing a service reason for a business for
Centrelink Confirmation eServices (CCeS) or Income Management.

Service reason requests and updates

If an Income Management business or the Program Support Manager has
identified an additional service reason or a change is appropriate, the
request must be submitted in writing by the business with a supporting
statement.

In reviewing this request this request, if it is established the
business no longer meets the eligibility criteria, the Program Support
Manager should consider withdrawing approval. See Withdrawing a
business’s approval to use a deduction and confirmation service.

If a business is requesting a new Centrelink Confirmation eServices
Service Reason, they must be advised to complete a new Business
Application. See Registration for Income Management deductions,
Electronic Verification of Rent (EVoR) or Centrelink Confirmation
eServices (CCeS).

Staff can add or remove characteristics to and from an exiting CCeS
service reason. Refer to Table 5 on the Process page.

This file relates specifically to a change in services only. If there
have been further changes to the business such as legal entity changes,
a new Business Application (BA) will be required and this process should
not be followed.
