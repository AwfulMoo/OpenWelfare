This document outlines qualification requirements for ABSTUDY Pensioner
Education Supplement (PES). ABSTUDY PES is an additional payment for
Australian Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander customers receiving
certain pensions or benefits who are undertaking full-time study or are
eligible for a study load concession.

Eligibility for ABSTUDY PES

A student is eligible for ABSTUDY PES if they:

-   meet the criteria for Schooling B, Tertiary or Masters and Doctorate
    Award
-   are receiving 1 of the qualifying payments for Pensioner Education
    Supplement (PES) and ABSTUDY PES
-   meet the general eligibility criteria for ABSTUDY

Note: full time Australian Apprentices are not entitled to ABSTUDY PES.
Part-time Australian Apprentices who are undertaking qualifying study
may qualify for ABSTUDY PES based on their course, as they can be
assessed as a student and not an Australian Apprentice.

ABSTUDY PES customers are required to undertake full-time studies,
unless one of the following study load concessions apply:

-   disability study load concession
-   pensioner study load concession or
-   two-thirds study load concession for ABSTUDY

Note: those students who are undertaking a workload of less than 25% do
not qualify for ABSTUDY PES, but may qualify for the ABSTUDY part-time
award.

Other assistance

Other PES payments are available to students who qualify for assistance
under either Pensioner Education Supplement (PES) qualifications or
Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) Scheme Pensioner Education
Supplement (PES) qualifications.

Customers can choose which PES payment to apply for, however care should
be exercised in offering customers a choice between the PES schemes as
there are differences in additional payments available:

ABSTUDY PES recipients

-   Incidentals Allowance
-   Additional Incidentals Allowance
-   School Fees Allowance (Group 2) including the redistribution of fees
    to support boarding fees
-   Away from Base Assistance
-   Residential Costs Option

PES recipients

-   Education Entry Payment

Individual customer’s circumstances should be considered and sufficient
information given to ensure customers can make an informed decision.

Transfers to JobSeeker Payment or Youth Allowance

Customers who have transferred to JobSeeker Payment (JSP) or Youth
Allowance (YA) who were:

-   in receipt of Disability Support Pension and have been assessed as
    having a partial capacity to work or
-   who are no longer in receipt of Parenting Payment Single (PPS) due
    to their youngest child turning 8 years of age, and

who were in receipt of ABSTUDY Pensioner Education Supplement (PES)
immediately before they transferred to JSP or YA will only remain
eligible for ABSTUDY PES while they:

-   remain in the same category (i.e. partial capacity to work or single
    principal carer), and
-   are still completing the same course of education or study for which
    they were receiving PES while receiving DSP or PPS

Partner agency
