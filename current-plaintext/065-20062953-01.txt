This document outlines information on aged care quarterly reviews.

Note: this Operational Blueprint will be updated prior to the next
Quarterly Review on 20th September 2022, when the procedures of the new
aged care system are finalised.

Historical SPARC process

The System for the Payment of Aged Residential Care (SPARC) is the
legacy aged care payment system for residential care. SPARC is a view
only system from 20 August 2022.

To view the legacy SPARC process, see the historical version.

Quarterly Review (QR)

The quarterly review is a reconciliation process which:

-   aligns the fees a care recipient pays with the fees related with
    their care needs and changes to their financial circumstances
-   incorporates any indexation (generally March and September each
    year) into the fees care recipients are asked to pay
-   includes any changes made during the quarter that relate to an
    historical event. For example, the sale of an asset within a
    previous quarter that Services Australia is not notified of until a
    later date. See Resources tab for examples
-   reviews fees to the end of the month for the last completed service
    provider claim

The assessment:

-   determines whether the fees applied over the previous period were
    correct
-   identifies if the care recipient has overpaid fees and calculates a
    refund (if required)
-   adjusts the subsidy payment payable to the provider as a result of
    this change
-   sets the care recipient’s ongoing fees

If a refund is due, the service provider receives a refund payment after
QR when their next monthly claim is finalised. The service provider
reconciles the fees paid by the care recipient and pays any refund due
to the care recipient.

Updates to income and assets need to be received in SPARC 2 to 3 weeks
prior to the QR effective date for inclusion in the reconciliation
process. Updated income and assets details received later will be
included in the following QR.

Example of reconciliation using updated data:

-   QR effective date is 20 March
-   March QR run 27 March – setting new fees effective from 20 March
-   The provider has completed claims up to and including February
-   The end date for QR reconciliations and refund calculations will be
    28 February
-   Refunds will be paid to the provider when their March Monthly claim
    is lodged and certified by Services Australia
-   If there is any refund owing for a period in March, it will be
    calculated in the July QR

The effective dates of the 4 QR’s are:

-   1 January
-   20 March
-   1 July
-   20 September

QR is completed in:

-   ACMPS (Aged Care Management Payment System) for home care recipients
-   SPARC (System for the Payment of Aged Residential Care) for
    permanent residential care recipients

Note: QR completed after the date of effect does not alter the date of
effect of the QR. See the Resources page for recent QR dates.

Quarterly review phases

The QR process is undertaken in 3 separate phases:

Phase 1 - Dry run/simulation

Both ACPB and SC complete Quarterly Review Phase 1 using SPARC and ACMPS
programming updates via Pre-Production systems:

-   Residential care checks are completed using SPARC Prototype (PTYP)
-   Home care checks are completed using excel reports extracted from
    ACMPS

There are 2 types of checks completed during Phase 1.

Fee changes – a sample of records will undergo a quality check to ensure
the rates (the changed fee amounts) has been applied as expected:

-   Aged Care Programmes Branch (ACPB) send Smart Centres (SC) samples
    to check
-   ACPB and SC will undertake a check on 40 records per letter series
    for both home and residential care

Refunds – amounts over the agreed thresholds will undergo a quality
check to ensure the refunds have been calculated correctly. See
Quarterly review refunds below for threshold amounts:

Home Care

-   ACPB will sample check 20 refunds, and
-   SC will sample check refunds allocated from ACPB

Residential Care

-   ACPB will sample check 10 refunds of each letter series/type, and
-   SC will check the remaining refunds over the applicable review
    threshold. Note: all refunds associated with accommodation
    contributions (MTC) require checking (including those under
    $10,000). A MTC refund may occur because of a correction to a care
    recipient’s resident status from Low Means to Not Low Means. See
    Resources - Change of Resident Status

When a refund is incorrect or requires further investigation:

-   SC advise ACPB which residential care refunds to hold
-   ACPB may add further refunds to be stopped to the list
-   Each case is referred for further investigation/remediation

The Phase 1 quality checks determine whether the Quarterly Review
production release can go ahead as scheduled, and allows identified
issues to be investigated and resolved.

Phase 2 - QR release

ICT implement programming updates into production.

Home and Residential care – ACPB:

-   download letters from SPARC Production/receive the home care data
    files, and
-   compare the Phase 1 – Dry Run results against the Phase 2 – QR
    Release results to ensure accuracy

This will determine the success of the Production release with:

-   ACPB removing Phase 1 identified held refunds from letter files
-   ACPB quality checking the letter files
-   SC updating held refund details in SPARC (screens 2.13 and 2.20)
    using the identified held refunds from Phase 1
-   ACPB forward the stopped refunds list to the Aged Care Payments team
    in the Aged Care and Allied Health Branch
-   SC action home care refunds (approve or reject)

Phase 3 – SC Manual remediation / adjustment

Where refunds are incorrect:

SC completes:

-   an investigation of income and assets, and
-   full calculations of correct fees

Outcome of remediation:

-   Original refund and letters released
-   Refund stopped and manual letters sent, or
-   Manual refund completed and manual letters sent

Change in ITCF/MTCF letters are released

Quarterly review refunds

Pre 1 July 2014

Residential care:

Care recipients who entered permanent residential care prior to 1 July
2014 are only eligible for a refund of their income tested fees (ITF)
where applicable

An accommodation charge cannot attract a refund as the accommodation
charge is based on assessable assets at the time of entry to care and
does not change. If assessable assets change, the care recipient’s
Accommodation Charge remains fixed

The system automatically releases refunds under $10,000

-   These are considered correct
-   ACPB completes a sample check of these refunds

Refunds over $10,000 have an initial check

The refund threshold increased from $5,000 to $10,000 effective from the
March 2021 Quarterly Review.

Home care:

Care recipients who commenced Home Care prior to 1 July 2014 are not
managed by Services Australia unless:

-   they have changed home care service providers on or after 1 July
    2014, and
-   opted in to the post 1 July 2014 scheme

The Department of Health and Aged Care is responsible for Pre 1 July
2014 Home Care means assessments

Services Australia is responsible for the payment of subsidies and
supplements to service providers for care recipients receiving care
under the Pre 1 July 2014 scheme

Post 1 July 2014

For Residential Care:

-   Care recipients who entered permanent Residential Care on or after 1
    July 2014 may be eligible for a refund of the means tested care fee
    (MTCF) and/or the accommodation contribution where applicable
-   Refunds under $10,000 are considered to be correct and will be
    automatically released

-   The refund threshold increased from $5,000 to $10,000 effective from
    the March 2021 Quarterly Review.

-   Care recipients who commenced receiving Home Care services on or
    after 1 July 2014 will only be eligible for a refund of their ITCF
    where applicable

    automatically released
-   Refunds over $1,000 have an initial check
