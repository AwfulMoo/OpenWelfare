  Scenario                                                                                                                                                  Answer
  Customer has reporting period 1-14 of the month. Customer contacts on the 7th by phone/in person and requests cancellation of payment.                    Code cancellation from date of receipt (DOR) i.e. date customer contacted on the 7th.
  Customer is due to report however they have not met their mutual obligation requirements. They request to cancel their payment on their reporting date.   As customer has not met their mutual obligation requirements, they have no entitlement to payment for their reporting period (EPED). Code the cancellation from the start date of their entitlement period (DPT + 1 or EPSD).
  Customer has successfully reported online 3 days ago. They contact today to advise they want to cancel their payment.                                     Code the cancellation via the BA screen using date of effect (DOE) from DPT + 1 (EPED + 1 day).
