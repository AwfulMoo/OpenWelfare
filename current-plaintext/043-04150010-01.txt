For Complex Assessment Officer (CAO) use only

This document outlines the steps required for Complex Assessment
Officers (CAO) to create links between customers and organisations to
assess the income and assets from a private trust or private company.

Creating links

These links are created so that the income and assets of a trust or
company are correctly attributed to the customer.

To link in the direction of attribution, a link between an organisation
and a customer must always start on the organisation's Customer
Reference Number (CRN), that is, the organisation must be in the header
to create a link to the customer.

Links between 2 CRNs have to be unique. The links need a Type and 2
Service Reasons (From and To).

For links between organisations and customers, the link Type is 'TAC'
(Trust and Company).

The Service Reasons are:

-   'TRF' - Trust or Company. This is recorded on organisations. TRF is
    the link from the controlled organisation
-   'TRP' – Linked Person. This is the person linked to the
    organisation, that is, the person to which assets and/or income are
    attributed

Links Summary screen

The Links Summary (LS) screen displays all links created on a customer
or organisation record. Note: links can only be made to an existing
person or entity, that is, a new customer or organisation must be added
before the linking process begins.

Trust and company organisations will only have TAC type links on their
LS screen, however customers can have other types of links, for example,
CHI - child, PYI - Centrepay.
