This document outlines information and procedures for conducting a
compliance investigation when a job seeker or ParentsNext participant
has failed to comply with compulsory requirements.

Initiating compliance investigations

For job seekers managed under the Targeted Compliance Framework,
compliance investigations may be initiated to determine if:

-   an unemployment failure or work refusal failure has been committed
-   a financial penalty will be applied where a job seeker in the
    penalty zone commits a mutual obligation failure

Dependant on the failure type, providers are required to speak with the
job seeker before they submit or confirm the compliance penalty
investigation is required. Compliance investigations focus on
determining whether a financial penalty will be applied.

For Community Development Program (CDP) job seekers managed under the
Job Seeker Compliance Framework, compliance investigations may be
initiated to determine if:

-   an Unemployment Non-Payment Period (UNPP) will be applied
-   a connection, non-attendance, reconnection, No Show, No Pay or
    serious failure has occurred

Services Australia may also generate compliance investigations when an
unemployment failure or work refusal failure has been identified.

Service Officers must gather enough evidence to establish a
non-compliance event may have occurred before generating the compliance
investigation.

Responsibility for compliance investigation

Services Australia is responsible for conducting a compliance
investigation and if required, making a determination under Social
Security legislation relating to non-compliance.

Staff members responsible for job seeker compliance decisions are
referred to as Participation Solutions Team (PST)-skilled Service
Officers or service centre Service Officers with UNPP security resource.

Service Officers conducting compliance investigations:

-   investigate voluntary unemployment or dismissal due to misconduct at
    new claim
-   determine if a financial penalty or non-compliance cancellation will
    be applied as a result of a mutual obligation, unemployment or work
    refusal failure for job seekers managed under the Targeted
    Compliance Framework
-   determine if a connection, non-attendance, reconnection, No Show, No
    Pay or serious failure will be applied for job seekers managed under
    the Job Seeker Compliance Framework

Focus of a compliance investigation

The reported non-compliance event is the starting point for all
compliance investigations.

In conducting a compliance investigation, Services Australia must:

-   ensure job seekers clearly understand expectations, as well as the
    consequences of not meeting requirements
-   provide opportunity for job seekers to explain their reason for
    non-compliance and any matters they'd like considered as part of the
    investigation and decision making process
-   collect and consider all relevant evidence to establish the facts
-   record and review any job seeker circumstances that are impacting
    the job seeker's compliance and may affect future servicing or
    require discussion with their provider

Note: a PST skilled Service Officer must consult with a PST-skilled
social worker where the job seeker presents with family and domestic
violence or has a current Family relationships/Domestic violence
circumstance recorded. See Accessing a PST-skilled social worker.

All compliance investigations are recorded in the Participation
compliance hub.
