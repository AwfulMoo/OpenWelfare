This document outlines information and procedures for conducting a
compliance investigation when a job seeker or ParentsNext participant
has failed to comply with compulsory requirements.

Initiating compliance investigations

Most compliance investigations relate to non-compliance events that have
been reported by the job seeker's provider.

For job seekers managed under the Targeted Compliance Framework,
providers may submit a compliance investigation when:

-   an unemployment failure or work refusal failure has been committed
-   a mutual obligation failure has been committed while the job seeker
    is in the financial penalty zone

Dependant on the failure type, providers are required to speak with the
job seeker either before they submit or confirm the compliance penalty
investigation is required. These compliance investigations focus on
determining whether a financial penalty will be applied.

For Community Development Program (CDP) job seekers managed under the
Job Seeker Compliance Model, compliance investigations may be initiated
to determine if:

-   an Unemployment Non-Payment Period (UNPP) will be applied
-   a connection, non-attendance, reconnection, No Show, No Pay or
    serious failure has occurred

Providers must attempt to contact the job seeker before they submit a
compliance investigation. Before submitting a Provider Appointment
Report (PAR) for non-attendance or reconnection failures, providers must
speak with the job seeker.

Services Australia also generate compliance investigations; following
voluntary unemployment, unemployment due to misconduct or refusing
suitable work. Service Officers must gather enough evidence to establish
a non-compliance event may have occurred before generating the
compliance investigation.

Responsibility for compliance investigation

Services Australia is responsible for conducting a compliance
investigation and if required, making a determination under Social
Security legislation relating to non-compliance.

Staff members responsible for job seeker compliance decisions are
referred to as Participation Solutions Team (PST)-skilled Service
Officers or service centre Service Officers with UNPP security resource.

These Service Officers conducting compliance investigations:

-   investigate voluntary unemployment or dismissal due to misconduct at
    new claim
-   determine if a financial penalty or non-compliance cancellation will
    be applied as a result of a mutual obligation, unemployment or work
    refusal failure for job seekers managed under the Targeted
    Compliance Framework
-   determine if a connection, non-attendance, reconnection, No Show, No
    Pay or serious failure will be applied for job seekers managed under
    the Job Seeker Compliance Model

Focus of a compliance investigation

The reported non-compliance event is the starting point for all
compliance investigations.

In conducting a compliance investigation, Services Australia must:

-   ensure job seekers clearly understand expectations, as well as the
    consequences of not meeting requirements
-   provide opportunity for job seekers to explain their reason for
    non-compliance and any matters they'd like considered as part of the
    investigation and decision making process
-   collect and consider all relevant evidence to establish the facts
-   record and review any job seeker circumstances that are impacting
    the job seeker's compliance and may affect future servicing or
    require discussion with their provider

Note: a PST skilled Service Officer must consult with a PST-skilled
social worker where the job seeker presents with family and domestic
violence or has a current Family relationships/Domestic violence
circumstance recorded. See Accessing a PST-skilled social worker.

All compliance investigations are recorded in the Participation
Compliance workflow.
