|                                   | EAT is a spreadsheet that         |
|                                   | determines the amount of one-off  |
|                                   | (ONE or IOP) employment income to |

|                                   | period. It uses verified          |

|                                   | tool. It helps with data entry    |
|                                   | and processes. Staff must decide  |
|                                   | if they should apply the earnings |
|                                   | assessment and adjustments.       |

|                                   | EAT can also determine if there   |

|                                   | would mean there is no need to    |
|                                   | run MultiCal. Common cases would  |

|                                   | The main function of EAT is to    |
|                                   | fit periods of employment income  |
|                                   | into the entitlement periods.     |

|                                   | entitlement period, assess the    |

|                                   | pay period. For example, if a     |
|                                   | customer is paid monthly, assess  |
|                                   | the income for the same number of |
|                                   | days (such as 30 or 31 days).     |
