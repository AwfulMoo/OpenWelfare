Action MFU tax activities

The MFU tax activity:

flags that the payment summary is prevented from being issued

must be actioned to:

-   correct the negative amount, and
-   issue a payment summary to the customer

Compliance and Debt Operations (CDO) Service Officers will:

-   investigate the errors
-   correct the debt component amounts in the customer's record
-   determine when a MFU tax activity needs to be reassigned to a
    non-CDO team for corrective action
-   send a TAXMFU Referral Fast Note with the action required

MFU tax activities that do not require access to the 'Change' function
on the TXGS screen will be reallocated.
