Definition of home

There is no set definition of what is or is not an adequate parental
home. A situation that is intolerable to one person will seem normal (or
even luxurious) to another. No 2 cases will be the same so each must be
decided separately. Precedents can be considered but should not be
considered binding.

A distinction also needs to be made between students, Australian
Apprentices and job seekers. Many students do the majority of their
study at home, Australian Apprentices would spend much of their time at
work, but may need to spend time studying at home as well. Therefore,
conditions that would be impossible for a student may sometimes be a
problem for an Australian Apprentice, but not a problem for job seekers.
Therefore, the adequacy or inadequacy of the parental home would also
depend on the customer's activity type.

Factors to consider when assessing the parental home as inadequate for study, work (including an Australian Apprenticeship) or job search

|                                   | It is not unacceptable to expect  |
|                                   | a customer to share a bedroom. It |
|                                   | is, in fact, quite a common       |
|                                   | occurrence in larger families     |
|                                   | and/or smaller houses. The nature |
|                                   | of the situation that needs to be |
|                                   | examined.                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Factors that would need to        |
|                                   | considered include:               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   The number of people sharing  |
|                                   |     versus the size of the room - |
|                                   |     2 people in a bedroom or 10   |
|                                   |     in a dormitory may be         |
|                                   |     acceptable but perhaps not    |
|                                   |     vice versa                    |
|                                   | -   The relative ages of the      |
|                                   |     people sharing - 2 teenagers  |
|                                   |     may be expected to get along  |
|                                   |     together but a teenager and a |
|                                   |     toddler or a teenager and an  |
|                                   |     elderly person may be another |
|                                   |     matter. The nature of their   |
|                                   |     interaction would also have   |
|                                   |     to be taken into account      |
|                                   | -   The gender of the people      |
|                                   |     sharing - it would not        |
|                                   |     generally be considered       |
|                                   |     acceptable for a customer to  |
|                                   |     have to share a bedroom with  |
|                                   |     someone of a different gender |
|                                   |     (with the possible exception  |
|                                   |     of a very young child)        |
|                                   | -   The daily routine of the      |
|                                   |     other person - the customer's |
|                                   |     roommate may be a             |
|                                   |     shift-worker, a sleepwalker,  |
|                                   |     an insomniac or just          |
|                                   |     generally irritating. The     |
|                                   |     extent of the problem this    |
|                                   |     causes would have to be       |
|                                   |     considered                    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The customer's sleeping area may  |
|                                   | serve another purpose (such as    |
|                                   | also being the laundry or the     |
|                                   | lounge) and so the customer's     |
|                                   | access to it would be limited.    |
|                                   | The effect this has on them may   |
|                                   | be significant or may be          |
|                                   | negligible.                       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Evidence would be needed to       |
|                                   | support any claim under this      |
|                                   | criteria. The customer should     |
|                                   | supply a written statement about  |
|                                   | the situation (the parent/s       |
|                                   | should as well) and a sketch plan |
|                                   | of the house indicating the       |
|                                   | function of each room and who     |
|                                   | sleeps where. Dimensions of the   |
|                                   | rooms would be necessary. Service |
|                                   | Officers will also check to       |
|                                   | ensure that all floors of a       |
|                                   | multilevel building are included. |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The Service Officer should        |
|                                   | consider not just the size and    |
|                                   | number of occupants of the        |
|                                   | customer's bedroom but also the   |
|                                   | availability of other rooms. For  |
|                                   | example, a vacant 'guest bedroom' |
|                                   | would tend to count against the   |
|                                   | customer's claim. Other rooms may |
|                                   | also be able to be converted into |
|                                   | a bedroom or at least be used as  |
|                                   | a study to alleviate some of the  |
|                                   | problems. Not all vacant or       |
|                                   | under-utilised rooms, however,    |
|                                   | are suitable as a bedroom and     |
|                                   | this needs to be taken into       |
|                                   | account.                          |

| 2                                 | Lack of physical facilities       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Physical facilities that are      |
|                                   | suitable for general family life  |
|                                   | would normally be expected to be  |
|                                   | suitable for a student or job     |
|                                   | seeker. For example, students     |
|                                   | usually do not need a desk but    |
|                                   | can make do with a table (unless  |
|                                   | that table is in constant use for |
|                                   | other things or is in a busy      |
|                                   | area); inadequate laundry         |
|                                   | facilities may make it very       |
|                                   | difficult for an Australian       |
|                                   | Apprentice to attend work or a    |
|                                   | job seeker to attend interviews   |
|                                   | appropriately dressed. Each case  |
|                                   | will be examined on its merits.   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The customer would need to        |
|                                   | provide a written statement about |
|                                   | the situation. The parent/s       |
|                                   | should also provide a statement.  |

|                                   | manner. Great care will be taken. |
|                                   | A statement such as 'My parents   |
|                                   | and I don't get along' could mean |

|                                   | involve the customer. Conflict    |
|                                   | between the parents may make it   |
|                                   | necessary for the customer to     |
|                                   | move out, particularly if         |
|                                   | alcoholism or family and domestic |
|                                   | violence is a factor.             |

|                                   | Services Australia cannot make an |
|                                   | informed decision without the     |
|                                   | relevant information. This can    |
|                                   | happen where the customer will    |
|                                   | not discuss their circumstances   |
|                                   | in any detail. It is worth        |
|                                   | remembering that all information  |
|                                   | they give to the agency will be   |
|                                   | treated as confidential. An       |
