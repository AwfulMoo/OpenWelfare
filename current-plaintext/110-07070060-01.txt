This document outlines information about assessing Assistance for
Isolated Children (AIC) End of Year (EOY) review forms where additional
information has been requested.

Return of incomplete EOY review form

In some cases, applicants for AIC return their EOY review form to AIC
Smart Centre without fully completing the questionnaire or not supplying
all necessary documentation. Instances also occur where they wish to
apply for Additional Boarding Allowance (ABA) and were not sent, or did
not complete an income review form. In these cases the applicant is
asked to provide the required information either by phone or by sending
them a Q999 letter requesting the missing information and/or documents.
