This document outlines information about assessing Assistance for
Isolated Children (AIC) End of Year (EOY) review forms where additional
information has been requested.

Return of incomplete EOY review form

In some cases, applicants for AIC return their EOY review form without
fully completing the questionnaire or not supplying all necessary
documentation. Instances also occur where they wish to apply for
Additional Boarding Allowance (ABA) and were not sent, or did not
complete an income review form. In these cases the applicant is asked to
provide the required information either by phone or by sending them a
Q999 or Q790 letter requesting the missing information and/or documents.
