| 1                                 | Rental property with bank loan    |
|                                   | secured against principal home    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A customer purchases a $200,000   |
|                                   | rental property and finances the  |
|                                   | purchase with a loan from their   |
|                                   | bank. The bank loan is secured    |
|                                   | only against their principal      |
|                                   | home, which is an exempt asset.   |
|                                   | None of the liability can reduce  |
|                                   | the value of the rental property. |

|                                   | rental property is therefore      |
|                                   | $200,000.                         |

|                                   | A customer borrows money to buy a |
|                                   | block of land. The lender secures |
|                                   | the borrowing by a charge over    |
|                                   | the land. In addition, the lender |
|                                   | secures the borrowing against an  |
|                                   | insurance policy owned by the     |
|                                   | customer. The charge over the     |
|                                   | insurance policy is a collateral  |

|                                   | called an excluded security. A    |
|                                   | collateral security is a          |
|                                   | secondary agreement, supported by |
|                                   | money or property, which is       |
|                                   | additional to the principal       |
|                                   | security for the same loan.       |

|                                   | The value of the insurance policy |
|                                   | is not reduced by the amount of   |
|                                   | the charge. The value of the      |
|                                   | block of land is reduced by the   |
|                                   | value of the charge.              |
