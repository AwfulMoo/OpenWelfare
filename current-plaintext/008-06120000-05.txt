|                                   | A customer is assessed as having  |
|                                   | a TRWC if they have been assessed |
|                                   | by an Assessor as being           |
|                                   | temporarily unable to work for at |
|                                   | least 30 hours per week because   |
|                                   | of a medical condition. The       |
|                                   | Assessor will use information     |

|                                   | A PCW is decided based on         |

|                                   | conditions. The customer is       |
|                                   | assessed as having a PCW if both  |
|                                   | 'baseline work capacity' and      |
