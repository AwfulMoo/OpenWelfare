|                                   | Val (a Parenting Payment (PP)     |
|                                   | Partnered customer) and partner   |
|                                   | Bob, live in a remote area that   |
|                                   | is approximately 150 kilometres   |
|                                   | from their nearest hospital. Bob  |
|                                   | has recently suffered from a rare |
|                                   | blood disorder and requires       |
|                                   | regular life-saving transfusions. |
|                                   | Because of this medical           |
|                                   | condition, Bob has been admitted  |
|                                   | to the hospital as an aged care   |
|                                   | facility patient type patient and |
|                                   | Val is still living at their      |
|                                   | homestead. Val drives in to see   |
|                                   | Bob almost daily with their       |
|                                   | child, Tammy to make sure that    |
|                                   | Bob is comfortable.               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Val and Bob are still a member of |
|                                   | a couple and would therefore, be  |
|                                   | classed as an illness separated   |
|                                   | couple. Val's PP Partnered        |
|                                   | payment can now be paid at the    |
|                                   | illness separated rate. While     |
|                                   | Val's Family Tax Benefit (FTB)    |
|                                   | Part A does not require an income |
|                                   | test as Val is receiving an       |
|                                   | income support payment, the       |
|                                   | entitlement to FTB Part B is      |
|                                   | still assessed on the lower       |
|                                   | earner's income.                  |

|                                   | take into account factors such as |

|                                   | own a home together. Glen has     |
|                                   | advanced stages of Alzheimer's    |
|                                   | disease and must now move into a  |
|                                   | care situation. Due to Glen's     |
|                                   | specific type of neurological     |
|                                   | disorder, once entering care Glen |
|                                   | and Tanya could be entitled to be |
|                                   | assessed as living separately and |
|                                   | apart.                            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If Glen and Tanya want to be      |

|                                   | Tanya's income of $80,000 per     |
|                                   | year would affect Glen's pension. |
|                                   | As Tanya is now responsible for   |
|                                   | the mortgage, Tanya would find it |
|                                   | difficult to assist Glen in       |
|                                   | paying for the care facility.     |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | income and assets would not be    |
|                                   | taken into consideration when     |
|                                   | assessing Glen's pension. The     |
|                                   | income tested fees of Glen's care |
|                                   | residence would be based on       |
|                                   | Glen's income and assets alone.   |
|                                   | After the 2 years exemption on    |

|                                   | Glen's portion of the principal   |
|                                   | home would then be considered an  |
|                                   | asset for pension purposes and    |
|                                   | the higher non-homeowner asset    |
|                                   | threshold applies. Where the      |
|                                   | value of Glen's assets affects    |
|                                   | the rate of pension, Glen may     |

|                                   | As Bert no longer has a partner   |
|                                   | and has been in care for more     |
|                                   | than 2 years, the half share of   |
|                                   | the former principal home would   |
|                                   | now be counted as an asset for    |
|                                   | pension purposes unless another   |
|                                   | exemption was applicable.         |

|                                   | For example, if either an         |
|                                   | accommodation charge or periodic  |
|                                   | accommodation bond payments were  |
|                                   | being paid by Bert to the aged    |
|                                   | care service provider and Bert    |
|                                   | was at the same time receiving    |
|                                   | rental income from the home.      |

|                                   | non-homeowner asset threshold for |
|                                   | pension purposes, the rate of     |
|                                   | income support payment could be   |
|                                   | affected depending on the half    |
|                                   | share of the asset value of the   |
|                                   | former principal home. Where the  |
|                                   | value of Bert's assets affects    |
|                                   | the rate of pension, Bert may     |

|                                   | classification did not affect     |
|                                   | Bert's rate of pension. Under     |

|                                   | Elsie remains in the former       |

|                                   | while Elsie lives there. The 2    |

|                                   | when the remaining partner later  |

|                                   | enter care or dies. Should Bert   |
