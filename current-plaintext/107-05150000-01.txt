Repayments not on the customer's record

ESSentials receipt all payments received except for payments made with
withholdings. ESSentials will transfer details of repayments received to
the customer's record each night. Payments made by mail or through an
external collection agency can take several days to display on the
customer's record.

Payments that are in ESSentials but not on the customer's record must:

-   have the payment corrected through ESSentials
-   not be manually added to a customer's record

Reasons for debt repayments not showing on the customer's record
include:

-   processing time for payments to show on the customer's record
-   customer used an incorrect biller code or customer reference number
-   the customer does not have a debt or intended to pay out an advance
    loan
-   the External Collection Agent (ECA) collecting the payment of the
    debt may have receipted it incorrectly
-   a system problem results in the payment not showing on the
    customer's record
-   an employer has remitted a garnishee payment with an incorrect
    reference number
