the customer's record.

-   Withholdings
-   an Australia Post outlet
-   mail (cheque or money order)

Repayments not on the customer's record

ESSentials receipt all payments received except for payments made with
withholdings. ESSentials will transfer details of repayments received to
the customer's record each night. Payments made by mail or BPAY can take
several days to display on the customer's record.

include:

-   processing time for payments to show on the customer's record
-   customer used an incorrect biller code or customer reference number
-   the customer does not have a debt or intended to pay out an advance
    loan
-   a system problem results in the payment not showing on the
    customer's record
-   an employer has remitted a garnishee payment with an incorrect
    reference number
