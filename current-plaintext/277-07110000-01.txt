This document outlines changes to the Child Support relationship with
the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). Links on this page may be
unavailable to external audiences.

On this Page:

Why the relationship has changed

The Child Support relationship with the ATO changed as a result of:

-   the intention of both organisations to disengage from each other
    (Child Support is now part of Services Australia and as of late
    2008, has separated from the ATO infrastructure), and
-   the ATO's Easier Cheaper More Personalised Change Program, which
    will replace all its current business systems with a single new
    system, called Integrated Core Processing (ICP)

Legislation review

The ATO and Child Support have reviewed the legislation that permits
Child Support to request data from the ATO and for the ATO to provide it
through direct access to ATO systems.

As a result, it has been agreed to issue the ATO with a legal notice
requesting ATO data and prior to accessing ATO systems for that purpose,
and the Commissioner has agreed that Child Support may continue to
directly access ATO systems for specific and relevant information only
after a legal notice has been issued.

Staff must be aware that when requesting information from the ATO or
accessing ATO systems directly for specific and relevant information
they are exercising legal powers of the Registrar and that they will:

-   be causing a legal notice to issue to the ATO at the time of the
    request, or
-   be required to issue a legal notice prior to accessing ATO systems
    directly for specific and relevant information
