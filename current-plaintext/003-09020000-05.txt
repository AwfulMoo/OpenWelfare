Current Zero Rate (CZR) and the 14 day rule

Periods of Current Zero Rate (CZR) are a break in payment of income
support. The only exception is when the customer is CZR because of the
inclusion of an Adjusted Disability Pension from the Department of
Veterans’ Affairs in the income test (CZR-DFISA) before 1 January 2022.

This is because CZR generally means the customer has income over the
income threshold in that fortnight.

A customer's income support payment may have been suspended, and then
restored from a later date. In these cases, if the resulting gap is 14
days or less, the gap can be disregarded when assessing a continuous
period.

If a payment is cancelled and a new payment granting with gap between
them of more than 1 day, the continuous payment will be broken.
