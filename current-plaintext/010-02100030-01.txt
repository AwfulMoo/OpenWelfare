This document outlines how to assess payment of ABSTUDY FAA after a
student has died.

Eligibility for ABSTUDY FAA

ABSTUDY FAA is payable to eligible ABSTUDY students who have to live
away from their permanent home to study or are participating in an
approved Away From Base activity.

Reimbursement of FAA after death of a student

FAA can be reimbursed after the death of a student who had incurred
travel costs related to their study.

To be eligible, an applicant needs to lodge an ABSTUDY Fares Allowance
Claim (SY032) form:

-   by 1 April in the year after the year of study, and
-   within 6 months of the student’s death

Amount payable

The amount of FAA payable depends on the mode of transport that was
available to the student. Generally, fares are reimbursed at the rate of
the cheapest and most practical mode of transport available for that
journey.

An Australian Apprentice (apprentice or trainee) is not entitled to FAA
for the Australian Apprenticeship.

The Resources page contains a link to the SY032 form.
