This document outlines the process for YA customers who are independent
and require entitlement verification for RSS reviews.

Independent criteria

Customers who do not qualify under any of the Independent criteria may
need a Parent(s)/Guardian(s) details - for the BASE tax year and CURRENT
tax year for dependent Youth Allowance or ABSTUDY customers form (MOD
JY).

A MOD JY is not required if the customer is exempt from the Parental
Income Test (PIT). See: Parental Income Test (PIT)

Customers who are currently assessed as independent at the time of
selection for Random Sample Surveys Review, do not need to re-verify
their circumstances, as long as nothing has changed

If the customer’s circumstances have changed or if the customer is being
assessed for independence for the first time, verification will be
required. See Process page
