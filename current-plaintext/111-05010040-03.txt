|                                   | -   silences during phone calls   |
|                                   |     are seldom interpreted        |
|                                   |     positively. If the silence is |
|                                   |     for concentration, advise the |
|                                   |     caller appropriately          |
|                                   | -   use the caller's name during  |
|                                   |     the conversation. Most people |
|                                   |     will prefer the respect       |
|                                   |     implied by the use of a title |
|                                   |     such as 'Mr', 'Mrs' or 'Ms'   |
|                                   |     and will generally be easier  |
|                                   |     to deal with as a result. An  |
|                                   |     exception to this could be if |
|                                   |     the family name is difficult  |
|                                   |     to pronounce. In this case,   |
|                                   |     use of the caller's first     |
|                                   |     name may be more appropriate. |
|                                   | -   use positive language         |
|                                   |     whenever possible and         |
|                                   |     concentrate on what           |
|                                   |     Centrelink can do to assist   |
|                                   |     the caller, rather than what  |
|                                   |     they cannot do                |
|                                   | -   avoid use of the word         |
|                                   |     'unfortunately' as an         |

|                                   |     to be said, as it predisposes |
|                                   |     the caller to think           |
