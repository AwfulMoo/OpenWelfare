Identifying the related degrees for individual units of study

Service Officers can search the OUA website to determine whether the
units they are enrolled in are contributing to the same
course/qualification.

From the home page, use the search function to search for the subject
code (available on the statement of enrolment). The subject code for
Introduction to Legal Studies at the University of New England is
UNE-LSU100. See Open Universities Partner and Codes.

For example, when using the code UNE-LSU100 in the search function, the
results indicated (at the time of the search), the subject was linked to
16 degrees.

Normal and concession study loads

The normal study load for an OUA study period at university level is
only 2 units (for courses offered over 4 standard study periods per
year), which leaves little scope for concessional study loads.

Units and the percentage of study period workload

Table 3: This table describes how units would count towards this type of
study period full-time workload.

  ------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------
  Type of unit                                Percentage of study period workload
  A single unit                               50%
  A double unit completed in 1 study period   100%
  ------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------

A student will usually be considered as full-time if s/he is undertaking
at least 75% of the full-time workload.

Note: whilst some students may undertake more than 1 study period or
session, many do not undertake their entire course at Open Universities
Australia and a significant number only do 1 study period or session. It
is important to only code study details for 1 study period or session at
a time in these cases to avoid customers getting overpayments. However,
if a customer provides proof of enrolling in more than 1 study period or
session, code the full period of enrolment.
