This document outlines who can apply for the Assistance for Isolated
Children (AIC) Scheme claims. A person or an organisation can apply for
AIC for a student.

Eligibility for AIC

To be eligible for AIC, the applicant must satisfy all of the following:

-   be an approved applicant
-   meet residence requirements
-   not be receiving certain other Australian Government assistance

Approved applicant requirements

An approved applicant must be the person having prime or joint
responsibility for the student's care and will be one of the following:

-   the natural or adoptive parent
-   the legal guardian of the student
-   the person with whom the student normally lives
-   in some cases, a non-government organisation or institution may be
    the applicant

While there may be more than one approved applicant for a student, only
one claim may be accepted for a student for a particular period. Where
the person who is an approved applicant for a student has changed, a new
claim must be lodged.
