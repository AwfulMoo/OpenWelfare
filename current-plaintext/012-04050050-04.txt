Joint Application Archiving Policy

Regardless if the application is received as a joint application or
HI/My Health Record only, the application is to be saved separately for
auditing and privacy purposes. The Process between HI (Part A) and My
Health Record (Part B) registration for combined Application to Register
a Seed Organisation (HW018) further explains separating joint
applications.

Joint Applications are to be archived as followed:

Application to Register a Seed Organisation

Part A (HI), Part C (if required) and any supporting documentation is to
be sent to Tier 3 for quality checking and archiving.

Part B (My Health Record) and the Participation Agreement (PA) will be
archived by Tier 2 once assessed and completed.

If Part C is received in a joint application, it is to be sent to T3 and
saved with Part A.

The Resources page contains a table of naming conventions and storage
locations for PCEHR Provider application types.

Note: both the HI and My Health Record TRIM (HP Records Manager)
reference IDs are to be recorded in the eHealth Application Tracker.
