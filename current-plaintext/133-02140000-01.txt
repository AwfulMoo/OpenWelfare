    Monday to Friday) and

Services available for employers

Due to current system stability issues CSBOS must not be actively

    messaging facility

    want to report using the report deductions functionality

Employers can use CSBOS to:

-   send and receive secure electronic messages
-   view and print most Child Support letters and notices
-   manage sub-users
-   submit employee deductions
-   view previous pay date details sent in and use them as a record of
    the information already provided if submitted via CSBOS
-   tell Services Australia of any variation between the scheduled
    deduction and the actual amount deducted and the reason for those
    differences
-   complete a Confirmation of a Person's Employment (EF1) form

Note: Employers must have a linked customer to enrol in CSBOS, but once
they have a linked customer, can continue using CSBOS, even if all the
customers are delinked.
