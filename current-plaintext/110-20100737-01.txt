For staff trained in income compliance refunds

This document outlines the process for contacting customers and
processing income compliance refunds.

Customers with multiple records

Some customers have generated a new Customer Reference Number (CRN) when
registering online for JobSeeker Payment. This resulted in some
customers having more than one CRN.

Affected records will be referred to the Data Quality Unit (DQU) to
unlink the records so that staff can process the refund.

Customers with international bank accounts

Some current and former customers living overseas may have a payment
destination outside Australia. The automated refund process cannot be
used to pay these customers, so manual processing is required.

Compliance Officers will try to call these customers to confirm their
payment destination before progressing the refund manually.

Third party withholdings

Sometimes the customer may have third party withholdings set up to repay
their debt. This is where the repayments are withheld from a third
party’s Centrelink payment, usually a parent or partner.

If the customer has third party withholdings, a refund will be issued
via direct credit to the third party.

Deceased customers

Services Australia will locate the executor or administrator of the
deceased estate and make outbound contact. They will be informed of the
refund reason, the process and the value of the refund. Refund payments
can be made to them via direct credit or cheque.

The Resources page contains links to contact details, forms and DOC
templates.
