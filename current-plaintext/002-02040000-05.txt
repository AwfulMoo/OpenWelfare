|                                   | include:                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | beekeeper (apiarist) who sells    |
|                                   | honey, either retail or wholesale |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   Apiarists may demonstrate a   |
|                                   |     right or interest in the land |
|                                   |     where they keep their hives   |
|                                   |     if they have an arrangement   |
|                                   |     to keep the hives in a        |
|                                   |     particular area. This may be  |
|                                   |     a verbal arrangement and      |
|                                   |     evidence (usually in the form |
|                                   |     of a Statutory Declaration or |
|                                   |     a letter signed by the land   |
|                                   |     owner) must be provided       |
|                                   | -   If their hives are located in |
|                                   |     a State forest, a permit is   |
|                                   |     issued by the relevant State  |
|                                   |     authority.                    |
|                                   |     Note: it is common place in   |
|                                   |     the industry for apiarists to |
|                                   |     place hives owned by one      |
|                                   |     another in the area covered   |
|                                   |     by the permit. In these cases |
|                                   |     it is only necessary for the  |
|                                   |     apiarist to demonstrate they  |
|                                   |     have an agreement with the    |
|                                   |     permit holder. This may take  |
|                                   |     the form of a Statutory       |

|                                   |     farming because this is not   |

|                                   | farming period. Eligibility may   |
|                                   | need to be assessed over several  |
|                                   | financial years if the latest ITR |
|                                   | shows primarily agistment income. |

|                                   | purposes. This is because the     |
|                                   | agistment business cannot exist   |
|                                   | without the farm enterprise.      |

|                                   | criteria. If the farmer qualifies |
|                                   | for FHA, income from the          |
|                                   | agistment enterprise is taken     |
|                                   | into account and assessed as farm |
|                                   | related business income.          |

|                                   | Types of agistment include:       |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | If an agister leases their farm   |
|                                   | land to another for their use     |
|                                   | with their livestock, the agister |
|                                   | is considered to be operating a   |
|                                   | farm business.                    |

|                                   | If a farmer also agists their     |
|                                   | land and is paid a fixed price    |
|                                   | per head per week to allow        |
|                                   | another person's stock to graze   |
|                                   | their property, they are          |
|                                   | considered to have a source of    |
|                                   | farm related business, as the     |
|                                   | agistment income could not exist  |
|                                   | without the farm enterprise land. |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Although contracts can vary from  |
|                                   | enterprise to enterprise,         |
|                                   | generally the risk is carried by  |
|                                   | the owner of the stock and the    |
|                                   | price received by the agister is  |
|                                   | usually unaffected by the         |
|                                   | management decisions (if any)     |
|                                   | that they make.                   |

|                                   | Note: agistment income alone does |
|                                   | not meet the qualification        |
|                                   | requirements for FHA              |

|                                   | This is quite similar to          |
|                                   | agistment, although there is      |
|                                   | usually a higher workload         |
|                                   | associated with earning the       |
|                                   | income. The agister is provided   |

|                                   | on how to care for them, and in   |
|                                   | many cases the feed. They are     |
|                                   | paid in a similar way to a        |
|                                   | salary, generally based on time   |
|                                   | to take the animals from one      |
|                                   | phase of growth to another. This  |
|                                   | arrangement is not very common,   |
|                                   | but is in place for pig           |
|                                   | contractors and can also happen   |
|                                   | in the meat-bird industry and     |

Contributor of significant labour and capital scenarios

contribution of significant labour and capital and scenarios where
famers do and do not meet these tests.

|                                   | investment and leases the land to |
|                                   | Susan who uses it for dairy       |
|                                   | farming. Susan works on the farm  |
|                                   | full-time. As the farm becomes    |
|                                   | more successful, Peter is hired   |
|                                   | to assist with day-to-day running |
