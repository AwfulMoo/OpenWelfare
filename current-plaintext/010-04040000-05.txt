Approximate calculation

The legislation lays down strict figures for the period on income
support and the final decision must be correct, but in most cases the
outcome will be clear cut, one way or the other. Instead of calculating
the exact period, which may be time-consuming for each case, use this
method to make an approximation before deciding whether a more precise
count is required.

|                                   | To calculate the time in receipt  |
|                                   | of an income support payment      |
|                                   | requirement, the 39 week period   |
|                                   | needs to be identified, before    |
|                                   | the 26 weeks in receipt of a      |
|                                   | qualifying payment can be         |
|                                   | counted.                          |

|                                   | Note: The unit of 'weeks' is      |
|                                   | legislated and therefore if a     |
|                                   | customer does not meet the 26     |
|                                   | week requirement by one day, they |
|                                   | may not be eligible. The 26 week  |
|                                   | period is accumulative and is not |
|                                   | required to be continuous, within |
|                                   | the 39 week period.               |
