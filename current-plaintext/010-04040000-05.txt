Approximate calculation

The legislation lays down strict figures for the period on income
support and the final decision must be correct, but in most cases the
outcome will be clear cut, one way or the other. Instead of calculating
the exact period, which may be time-consuming for each case, use this
method to make an approximation before deciding whether a more precise
count is required.

Calculating method for an approximate 26 week requirement period

This table describes the steps to take to do an approximate calculation
for a customer to be granted the higher income support rate of Austudy.

|                                   | -   Determine the date of the day |
|                                   |     immediately before the        |
|                                   |     student or Australian         |
|                                   |     Apprentice                    |
|                                   |     commences/recommences         |
|                                   |     qualifying for payment        |
|                                   | -   Subtract nine months from     |
|                                   |     this date (alternatively add  |
|                                   |     three months and subtract one |
|                                   |     year, whichever is easier) -  |
|                                   |     this gives a date             |
|                                   |     approximately 39 weeks before |
|                                   |     the course started            |
|                                   | -   Work backwards from the       |
|                                   |     course start/ restart date,   |
|                                   |     counting periods when the     |
|                                   |     customer was not receiving a  |
|                                   |     payment and periods the       |
|                                   |     customer was receiving LTIS   |
|                                   |     for a previous course. This   |
|                                   |     count can be approximate      |
|                                   | -   If the count of periods off   |
|                                   |     payments reaches 13 weeks     |
|                                   |     before the date nine months   |
|                                   |     earlier is reached then the   |
|                                   |     customer is most likely not   |
|                                   |     eligible for the higher rate  |
|                                   | -   If the date is reached before |
|                                   |     the count reaches 13 weeks    |
|                                   |     then the customer is most     |
|                                   |     likely eligible for the       |
|                                   |     higher rate                   |
|                                   | -   If the count reaches 13 weeks |
|                                   |     around the same time as the   |
|                                   |     date is reached then a more   |
|                                   |     accurate count will be        |
|                                   |     required                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Note: if LTIS was payable for     |
|                                   | more than 13 weeks for the        |
|                                   | previous course in the past 39    |
|                                   | weeks, the customer is no longer  |
|                                   | eligible to continue to receive   |
|                                   | the higher rate.                  |
