|                                   | and is critically injured. The    |
|                                   | Department of Foreign Affairs and |
|                                   | Trade (DFaT) have contacted the   |
|                                   | customer advising the child is in |
|                                   | a critical state.                 |

|                                   | travelled overseas for 3 weeks in |
|                                   | a rolling 12 month period. There  |
|                                   | is only 1 week of general         |
|                                   | portability remaining. The script |
|                                   | will ask the user why the person  |
|                                   | is travelling, and the user can   |
|                                   | advise it is due to an 'acute     |
|                                   | family crisis'.                   |

|                                   | As a result, the script advises   |
|                                   | to refer the customer to CIS to   |

|                                   | Upon receiving the referral, CIS  |
|                                   | Service Officer has heard about   |
|                                   | this situation on the news, or    |
|                                   | calls DFaT to confirm and         |
|                                   | approves portability for 2 weeks  |

|                                   | due to accessing the remaining    |

|                                   | portability rules, the payment    |
|                                   | will cease after 13 weeks absence |
|                                   | from Australia.                   |

|                                   | the first 13 weeks. If Peter      |

|                                   | returning to Australia. However,  |
|                                   | if Peter was receiving a          |

|                                   | entitlement to this rate will be  |
|                                   | lost and Peter will be paid under |

|                                   | period, Peter will have to        |
|                                   | reapply for DSP pension on        |
|                                   | returning to Australia. Note: if  |
|                                   | Peter is a grandfathered case,    |
|                                   | the savings provision will be     |
|                                   | lost if the payment is cancelled. |
|                                   | When considering the medical      |

|                                   | Tables, it may mean Peter is no   |
|                                   | longer qualified for DSP and must |
|                                   | claim another payment type.       |

|                                   | Elizabeth was born in Canada and  |
|                                   | arrived in Australia to live in   |
|                                   | 1987. Elizabeth was in a car      |
|                                   | accident and badly injures in     |
|                                   | 1992, while travelling home from  |
|                                   | work (the DSP qualifying event).  |
|                                   | Elizabeth was granted DSP in 1997 |
|                                   | after the compensation preclusion |
|                                   | period and is unable to work      |
|                                   | again. The medical review         |
|                                   | indicated Elizabeth is severely   |
|                                   | disabled. Elizabeth went to       |
|                                   | Canada to live (ceased Australian |
|                                   | residence) in December 2003 and   |
|                                   | has not returned to Australia as  |
|                                   | a resident since. At that time,   |
|                                   | the DSP was portable indefinitely |
|                                   | due to Elizabeth being considered |
|                                   | severely disabled.                |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Elizabeth finally returned to     |
|                                   | Australia in 2007 for a short     |
|                                   | holiday. DSP continues to be      |
|                                   | portable indefinitely because     |
|                                   | Elizabeth was outside Australia   |
|                                   | on 1 July 2004 and is therefore   |
|                                   | paid under the pre 1 July 2004    |
|                                   | portability rules.                |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Note: if Elizabeth returned to    |
|                                   | Australia for residence,          |
|                                   | Elizabeth would lose the savings  |
|                                   | provision. If Elizabeth then left |
|                                   | Australia to live in Canada, the  |
|                                   | pension would only be portable    |
|                                   | for a temporary absence up to the |
|                                   | maximum portability period (from  |
|                                   | 1 January 2015, 28 days in a      |
|                                   | rolling 12 month period) unless   |

|                                   | portability provisions are        |
|                                   | satisfied. However, Elizabeth     |
|                                   | would be able to transfer to the  |
|                                   | Canadian Agreement if remaining   |
|                                   | severely disabled.                |

|                                   | and arrived in Australia in 1975. |
|                                   | Marco lived and worked in         |
|                                   | Australia for 10 years then       |
|                                   | returned to Italy in 1985. Marco  |
|                                   | worked in Italy for 4 years       |
|                                   | before ceasing work because of an |
|                                   | accident (the DSP qualifying      |
|                                   | event) and returned to live in    |
|                                   | Australia in 1989. In 1990, Marco |
|                                   | was granted DSP with add-ons,     |
|                                   | Rent Assistance, Pharmaceutical   |
|                                   | Allowance and Telephone           |
|                                   | Allowance. In November 2012,      |
|                                   | Marco advised of the intention to |
|                                   | return to live in Italy (ceased   |
|                                   | Australian residence).            |

|                                   | Marco is neither terminally ill,  |
|                                   | nor satisfies the 'no future work |
|                                   | capacity' portability provisions, |
|                                   | so the pension will cease         |

|                                   | disabled. Therefore, Marco can be |
|                                   | transferred to a pension under    |

|                                   | agreement rate according to the   |
