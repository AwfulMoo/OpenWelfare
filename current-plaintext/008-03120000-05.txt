|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A DSP customer attends a service  |
|                                   | centre to advise their child was  |
|                                   | in a tuk-tuk accident in Thailand |
|                                   | and is critically injured. The    |
|                                   | Department of Foreign Affairs and |
|                                   | Trade (DFaT) have contacted the   |
|                                   | customer advising the child is in |
|                                   | a critical state.                 |

|                                   | The Service Officer runs the      |
|                                   | Portability Script - Departures   |
|                                   | and Returns, which identifies the |
|                                   | DSP customer has already          |
|                                   | travelled overseas for 3 weeks in |
|                                   | a rolling 12 month period. There  |
|                                   | is only 1 week of general         |
|                                   | portability remaining. The script |
|                                   | will ask the user why the person  |
|                                   | is travelling, and the user can   |
|                                   | advise it is due to an 'acute     |
|                                   | family crisis'.                   |

|                                   | As a result, the script advises   |
|                                   | to refer the customer to CIS to   |
|                                   | make the decision on the          |
|                                   | customer's eligibility for        |
|                                   | ongoing payments while overseas.  |

|                                   | Upon receiving the referral, CIS  |
|                                   | Service Officer has heard about   |
|                                   | this situation on the news, or    |
|                                   | calls DFaT to confirm and         |
|                                   | approves portability for 2 weeks  |
|                                   | for the customer to travel to     |
|                                   | Thailand and visit the child. DSP |

|                                   | the Approved Temporary Absence,   |
|                                   | and may be paid for 1 more week   |
|                                   | due to accessing the remaining    |
|                                   | general portability period while  |

|                                   | with parents for an indefinite    |
|                                   | period.                           |

|                                   | 2004                              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Elizabeth was born in Canada and  |
|                                   | arrived in Australia to live in   |
|                                   | 1987. Elizabeth was in a car      |
|                                   | accident and badly injured in     |
|                                   | 1992, while travelling home from  |
|                                   | work (the DSP qualifying event).  |
|                                   | Elizabeth was granted DSP in 1997 |
|                                   | after the compensation preclusion |
|                                   | period and is unable to work      |
|                                   | again. The medical review         |
|                                   | indicated Elizabeth is severely   |
|                                   | disabled. Elizabeth went to       |
|                                   | Canada to live (ceased Australian |
|                                   | residence) in December 2003 and   |
|                                   | has not returned to Australia as  |
|                                   | a resident since. At that time,   |
|                                   | the DSP was portable indefinitely |
|                                   | due to Elizabeth being considered |
|                                   | severely disabled.                |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Since 2008, Elizabeth has         |
|                                   | returned to Australia every three |
|                                   | years for a short holiday. DSP    |
|                                   | continues to be portable          |
|                                   | indefinitely because Elizabeth    |
|                                   | was outside Australia on 1 July   |
|                                   | 2004 and is therefore paid under  |
|                                   | the pre 1 July 2004 portability   |
|                                   | rules.                            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Note: if Elizabeth returned to    |
|                                   | Australia for residence,          |
|                                   | Elizabeth would lose the savings  |
|                                   | provision. If Elizabeth then left |
|                                   | Australia to live in Canada, the  |
|                                   | pension would only be portable    |
|                                   | for a temporary absence up to the |
|                                   | maximum portability period unless |
|                                   | the 'no future work capacity'     |
|                                   | portability provisions are        |
|                                   | satisfied. However, Elizabeth     |
|                                   | would be able to transfer to the  |
|                                   | Canadian Agreement if remaining   |
|                                   | severely disabled.                |

|                                   | Marco was born in Italy in 1950   |
|                                   | and arrived in Australia in 1975. |
|                                   | Marco lived and worked in         |
|                                   | Australia for 10 years then       |
|                                   | returned to Italy in 1985. Marco  |
|                                   | worked in Italy for 4 years       |
|                                   | before ceasing work because of an |
|                                   | accident (the DSP qualifying      |
|                                   | event) and returned to live in    |
|                                   | Australia in 1989. In 1990, Marco |
|                                   | was granted DSP with add-ons,     |
|                                   | Rent Assistance, Pharmaceutical   |
|                                   | Allowance and Telephone           |
|                                   | Allowance. In November 2012,      |
|                                   | Marco advised of the intention to |
|                                   | return to live in Italy (ceased   |
|                                   | Australian residence).            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Marco is neither terminally ill,  |
|                                   | nor satisfies the 'no future work |
|                                   | capacity' portability provisions, |
|                                   | so the pension will cease         |
|                                   | immediately on departing          |
|                                   | Australia.                        |

|                                   | Marco is returning to Italy and   |
|                                   | has been assessed as severely     |
|                                   | disabled. Therefore, Marco can be |
|                                   | transferred to a pension under    |
|                                   | the Italian Agreement on the      |
|                                   | departure from Australia. Marco's |
|                                   | pension will be paid the          |
|                                   | agreement rate according to the   |
|                                   | Australian working life           |
