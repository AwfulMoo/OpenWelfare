This document outlines information for Service Officers relating to
Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) services.

Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) overview

Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is a treatment
option for patients when medication-based approaches to treating
depression are not working.

rTMS therapy involves using magnetic pulses to target specific areas of
the brain. These services are available to eligible adult patients (18
years old or older), who:

-   have not previously received a rTMS service in the public or private
    setting, and
-   have trialled at least 2 different classes of antidepressant
    medicines but have not responded to this course of treatment

While it is expected that the majority of rTMS services will be provided
as out-of-hospital treatment, there will be circumstances where some
patients may require hospital treatment.
