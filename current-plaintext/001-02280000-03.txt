All coding for the National Work Experience Programme will be completed
by jobactive organisations or DES Providers.

A new approved activity code of NWEP has been created for use by
Providers in Job Plans.

The approved activity will automatically appear on the Activity and
Exemption summary screen as NEW and include start and expected end
dates.

The NWEP attracts the Approved Program of Work Supplement and payment of
this supplement can be viewed on the Other Government Payments (OGP)
screen.
