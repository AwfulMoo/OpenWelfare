All coding for the National Work Experience Programme was completed by
Workforce Australia or DES providers.

A new approved activity code of NWEP was created for use by Providers in
Job Plans.

The approved activity automatically appeared on the Activity and
Exemption summary screen as NWE and included start and expected end
dates.

The NWEP attracted the Approved Program of Work Supplement. Payment of
this supplement can be viewed on the Other Government Payments (OGP)
screen.
