This document explains when and how to refer customers to external
support services.

If a child is in immediate danger or risk of harm you must act, and a
delegate must call 000. If you have concerns about a child’s safety,
conduct the risk and referral process.

Helping customers

Customers facing complex or multiple life circumstances may need extra
help or support. When Services Australia cannot help, it is important to
consider a referral to external support services.

External services can include:

-   community or welfare agencies, for example Salvation Army
-   local government or state government services
-   other programmes or services

For information about internal referral options, see Specialist officers
and other internal supports for customers.

The Resources page has links to service finders, contact details for
state and territory governments, and an email referral template.
