This document outlines the definition and assessment of a couple
separated due to illness. Customers who advise they are no longer able
to live in their home with their partner due to illness, but who still
consider themselves to be partnered or in a member of a couple
relationship with that person, are treated as an illness separated
couple.

On this page:

Definition of separation due to illness

Although the definition of an illness separated couple applies if 1 or
both members of the couple are no longer able to live in their home, a
couple may only be considered an illness separated couple if they are
not residing together, or are residing together in a care facility.

Members of a couple who permanently live in an aged care facility that
provides low (hostel type) or high level (nursing home type) residential
care will be considered illness separated. This will apply regardless of
whether they are sharing the same room or different rooms in the care
facility.

Payments for a couple separated by illness

An illness separated couple may be eligible to receive the following
extra assistance:

-   a higher rate of payment. Certain allowance and pension customers
    may receive the equivalent of the single rate of payment. Parenting
    Payment (PP) and other allowance customers may be eligible for a
    special rate, which is above the member of a couple rate of payment
    but less than the single rate. Similarly, a respite care couple are
    entitled to the single rate of payment, however their rate of Rent
    Assistance may be affected differently
-   single rate of Pharmaceutical Allowance (PhA), where applicable
-   single rate of Pension Supplement, where applicable
-   as the illness separated rate is higher than the member of a couple
    rate, the couple can have a higher level of income before their
    payment is reduced to nil by application of the partnered income
    test. A pensioner couple can also have a higher level of assets
    before their payment is reduced to nil by application of the
    partnered assets test
-   increased rate of Rent Assistance (RA)

Note: although illness separated couples may be paid a higher rate of
payment, equivalent to the single rate of payment, the assessment will
still take into account the combined income and assets as if they were a
regular member of a couple.

After entering the appropriate 'illness separated' code on the Marital
Status (MS) screen, the records of the customer and their partner will
stay linked and correctly display as 'member of a couple'.

Illness Separated provisions

Members of a couple are considered to be in a care type similar to an
aged care facility if they are residing in a:

-   retirement village or Supported Residential Service (SRS) that is
    providing a low level (hostel type), or
-   high level (nursing home type) of care

The facility must be providing the care. If an external source, such as
Home and Community care, provide the care, which the couple could
receive in their own home, the agency would not consider the:

-   SRS or Retirement village an aged care facility
-   couple illness separated

A customer can be treated as a member of an illness separated couple if:

-   the customer is unable to live at home due to illness or infirmity,
    and
-   have increased, or likely to have increased expenses because of the
    separation (it would be unlikely that a couple separated in this
    manner would not have increased expenses), and
-   the inability to live together is likely to continue indefinitely

The agency does not consider a couple separated due to 1 or both members
of the couple accessing approved respite care to be an illness separated
couple. This is because approved respite care is for a temporary but
definite period.

A couple that does not meet the Illness Separated criteria might meet
the criteria for a Respite Care couple and receive the higher single
rate of payment if they are accessing approved respite care for a period
of at least 14 days.

Assessment of inability to live at home due to illness or infirmity

It is not the intention that medical evidence is required for the
majority of assessments. A couple, who have left their home due to
illness or infirmity, will be accepted as illness separated in
situations where:

it is apparent to Services Australia that the illness or infirmity of 1
or both members of a couple prevents them from living together, and/or

there is supporting evidence of illness or infirmity, for example, where
the ill or infirm member of the couple:

-   permanently lives in an aged care facility that provides low
    (hostel) or high level (nursing home) residential care, or
-   is a patient in a normal hospital ward and has been classified as a
    nursing home type patient, or
-   is residing in a psychiatric facility, or
-   has had an Aged Care Assessment Teams (ACAT) assessment that
    indicates care is needed on an ongoing basis, or
-   has current care needs that indicate that the couple cannot live
    together (this could be based on information the agency already
    holds on care needs provided to assess entitlement of a carer to
    receive Carer Allowance (CA) or Carer Payment (CP) in respect of the
    ill or infirm member of the couple)

The agency may ask the customer to provide supporting evidence from a
treating doctor or relevant health professional where:

-   the illness or infirmity preventing the couple living together is
    not apparent, and
-   no other supporting evidence is available

Note: it is not necessary for a care situation to exist for the illness
separated rate to be paid. An illness separated couple should not be
confused with former members of a couple whose relationship has ceased
because of ill health.

Financial hardship assistance for fees and charges in Residential Aged Care

The Aged Care Act 1997 has 'financial hardship' provisions for people
who have difficulty in paying their residential care payments and
relevant ongoing expenses. Financial hardship assistance may be
available to residents who do not have the income or assets to use to
pay their costs of care. Each case is considered individually, based on
a resident's financial circumstances. Financial hardship provisions let
the agency provide financial assistance for fees and accommodation
payments on application.

See Aged Care Financial Hardship Assistance - Overview for further
information.

Assessment of living expenses

It is likely most couples separated due to illness will have, or be
likely to have, an increase in their living expenses. In the residential
aged care situation, where 1 or both members of the couple move to
residential aged care, the aged care resident would be subject to a
number of residential aged care fees. For further information on aged
care fees, the Resources page has an external link to the myagedcare
website.

The requirement for customers to pay residential aged care fees is
likely to mean their expenses will increase. The illness separated
provisions should apply, as the couple would not have the benefit of
sharing expenses when living together. For example, for a pensioner
couple in receipt of the maximum rate of payment and with no assets, the
person moving into aged care would be subject to the basic daily fee.
This is a fee they would not have had if the couple had remained
together. Their capacity to share expenses is reduced, which the illness
separated provisions is intended to recognise. Therefore, where 1 or
both members of a couple are in aged care, illness separated provisions
should be applied without further investigation of the couple's
financial circumstances.

For all other situations, the assessment of living expenses should only
be applied on a very selective case-by-case basis. When assessing if the
customer's living expenses have increased, or are likely to increase,
due to illness separation, take into account factors such as:

-   transportation
-   medication, and
-   the loss of ability to pool resources

For example, where the customer or their partner have moved to hospital
indefinitely or with family for care purposes. It may not be appropriate
to apply an illness separated assessment, as this may not result in an
increase in living expenses.

Assessment of indefinite separation

'Likely to continue indefinitely' generally means it is highly probable,
based on available evidence that the term of the separation is for a
period of time that is unknown or unstated. However, in some
circumstances it may be difficult to determine whether a situation is
likely to continue indefinitely when first making an assessment.

For example, in the case of a partnered customer who has entered a
rehabilitation centre, in many situations the treatment will be for a
specified period, such as 3 months. Where evidence is given about the
length of time the separation is known or stated to be, the partner does
not qualify for illness separated.

However, where it is not possible for the centre to determine a specific
or defined period of treatment, a Service Officer should look at the
full circumstances of each case and may exercise their discretion to pay
the customer and partner at the illness separated rate.

This can include psychiatric care, aged care facility, community based
care and hospitalisation as a 'nursing home type' patient.

Assessment of Illness Separated prior to 8 February 2005

On 8 February 2005, the agency issued a Network News Update explaining
customers who reside in serviced units or hostel units in Retirement
Villages no longer automatically qualify for the illness separated rate.

From 20 September 2004, customers are required to qualify according to
the above criteria.

However, as updated policy advice was not issued to the network until 8
February 2005, customers who entered serviced units or hostel units
before 8 February 2005 will not be re-assessed unless their
accommodation changes. No overpayments are to be raised on the
difference between the illness separated rate and the combined member of
a couple rate for customers who entered serviced units or hostel units
in Retirement Villages before 8 February 2005.

Rent Assistance (RA)

The RA thresholds and maximum rate payable will depend on a customer's
circumstances. Customers who are partnered and have to live apart due to
ill health or respite care can each be paid the full rate of single RA
instead of half of the member of a couple rate.

If a couple do not qualify as an illness separated couple or a respite
care couple, they may qualify for RA as a temporarily separated couple.

Note: where couples qualify for RA as a temporarily separated couple,
the coding of the relevant temporary relationship qualifier code 'Tmp
Sep/Both Left Home' (TEB), 'Tmp Sep/Left Home' (TEC) or 'Tmp Sep/Ptnr
Left Home' (TEP) will not adjust their income support payments to the
single rate.

Carer Allowance (CA)

Members of a couple who reside together in a Hostel can be regarded as
illness separated. When the agency introduced the Carer Allowance (CA)
income test on 20 September 2018, it became compulsory to capture the
current partner details of a CA claimant/recipient. Illness separated
provisions do not affect the rate of payment of CA where the care
receiver is their partner. CA is paid at a fixed rate regardless of
relationship status.

This type of accommodation can meet the definition of a 'private
residence' for CA, providing:

-   commercial care arrangements are not in place for the provision of
    personal care for the care receiver in the Hostel, and
-   as long as the carer continues to provide daily personal care

If assessed as a temporarily separated couple, Services Australia will
be required to update the couple's relationship status and address
details.

Rehabilitation and probation

Customers claiming or receiving a Centrelink payment would generally not
be regarded as an illness separated couple where:

-   they are attending a rehabilitation program for a set period, or
-   customers who are on probation and have restrictions on where they
    can reside as part of their parole requirements

They may however be considered as not being a member of a couple under
Section 24 of the Social Security Act 1991 and therefore eligible for
the single rate of payment. The decision would still be based on
individual's circumstances taking into account a lack of ability to pool
resources resulting in financial difficulty. See Treatment of a
partnered person as single under Section 24 new determinations.

Living separately and apart - 1 member of a couple institutionalised due to a severe and debilitating illness

One member of a couple lives in an approved institution on a permanent
or indefinite basis due to a severe and debilitating illness

They may be considered to be living separately and apart where:

the incapacity of the institutionalised partner is:

-   severe
-   debilitating, and
-   of a permanent nature (such as Huntington's disease or the advanced
    stages of Alzheimer's disease), and

the institutionalised partner is totally and permanently incapable of
providing their partner with such things as:

-   companionship
-   comfort
-   physical
-   intellectual, or
-   emotional support

In these circumstances, they do not meet the 5 factors that determine a
member of a couple as per Social Security legislation. See References
for a link to Social Security Guide, 1.1.M.120, Member of a couple.

Under these circumstances, a couple may be assessed as single (paid the
single rate and assessed under the single income and assets test). This
is opposed to being assessed as illness separated (paid the single rate
but the partnered income and assets test apply).

Assessment of living separately and apart

Under the provisions of living separately and apart, the relationship is
considered to have ceased due to ill health. The individuals are deemed
single and paid a single rate of income support payment. The single
income and assets test provisions will apply to individuals assessed as
living separately and apart.

If the customer entering care is considered to be living separately and
apart and, regardless of whether the partner remains in the former
principal home, the incapacitated person's share (as either
tenant-in-common or joint tenants) of the principal home continues to be
an exempt asset for up to 2 years (longer if further exemptions are
met). The incapacitated customer's exemption of the principal home will
cease after 2 years in care unless another exemption applies.

Consider the customer's individual circumstances when making a
determination.

The application of the living separately and apart - 1 member of a
couple institutionalised due to a severe and debilitating illness
assessment can be a sensitive topic for customers. Particularly elderly
couples, who may not be able to disconnect emotionally from their
partner, regardless of the financial impacts. Making this assessment
will separate the customers' records as if they were single. If a
customer still strongly believes and states that they are a member of a
couple with their partner, the records are not to be unlinked. In these
situations, the customer and partner will be considered an illness
separated couple.

Living separately and apart should not generally be accepted if the
couple are living apart solely because of ill health, employment and/or
economic reasons. All other options should be explored before a
determination is made that a couple are living separately and apart.

members of a couple that are living separately and apart. See the
References page for links to the Social Security Guide.
