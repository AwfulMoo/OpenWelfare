This document outlines how to help customers request an urgent payment
using phone self service or Centrelink online accounts.

Access the service

Customers need to register online and have an active online account or
access to phone self service.

Customers cannot use the Express Plus Centrelink mobile app to request
an urgent payment.

Customer is not eligible

The service rejects requests if the customer:

-   has had 2 or more urgent payments in the last 12 months. The
    services will only look for urgent payments that have been issued to
    the customer due to exceptional and unforeseen circumstances or
    extraordinary circumstances
-   has no available funds
-   selects a reason that is ineligible for an urgent payment

If a customer is not eligible for an urgent payment and they are using:

-   phone self service, the IVR tells them why they are not eligible.
    Depending on the reason, the customer may be transferred to the
    relevant phone queue (in business hours)
-   their online account, the service will advise the customer to
    contact Centrelink

When customers cannot use this service

Customers will not be able to use this self service option in the
following circumstances. They will need to contact a Service Officer to
request an urgent payment:

Requests for an urgent payment due to:

-   Centrelink delay
-   expenses due to funeral costs of an immediate family member
-   extraordinary circumstances (third or subsequent request)

Phone self service and Centrelink online accounts:

-   Income Managed customers
-   weekly payment customers
-   customers who live overseas
-   customers who have a nominee
-   customers who have already applied on the same day
-   customers who have already received 2 urgent payments in a 12 month
    period
-   customers receiving an ineligible payment
-   Farm Household Allowance (FHA) customers

Self service transaction streaming

Encourage customers who can use self service to request an urgent
payment online or through phone self service, unless:

-   self service channels are unavailable (confirmed by a Network News
    Update (NNU) Newsflash and Bulletins), or
-   the Service Officer determines the transaction is not appropriate to
    be self managed in this instance

Consider the customer's ability to self manage each transaction on a
case by case basis.
