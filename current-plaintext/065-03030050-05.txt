Age Pension New Claim (Submit and DOC) script workaround

Table 2

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Item                              | Description                       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Details                           | The Age Pension New Claim (Submit |
|                                   | and DOC) script is run from       |
|                                   | Customer Record when an Age       |
|                                   | Pension claim is ready to be      |
|                                   | submitted. The script will submit |
|                                   | the activity and create a DOC     |
|                                   | containing relevant information   |
|                                   | from the record, including income |
|                                   | and assets. A DOC will also be    |
|                                   | recorded on the partner's record  |
|                                   | if the partner is also claiming   |
|                                   | Age Pension. Note: the script     |
|                                   | does not DOC any information      |
|                                   | about employment income that has  |
|                                   | been coded on the record -        |
|                                   | annotate the DOC accordingly      |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Issue                             | Upon completion of the script, a  |

|                                   | Assets data' will present. Staff  |
|                                   | must select 'Cancel: Do not       |
|                                   | proceed with this step', to       |
|                                   | ensure that a 'Risk based claim   |
|                                   | management' DOC is not created on |
|                                   | the record, as this Trial has     |
|                                   | ceased. Removal of this DOC is    |
|                                   | mandatory to ensure customer      |
|                                   | records accurately reflect the    |
|                                   | assessment method used and meet   |

| Action Required                   | Staff must apply the following    |

|                                   | occurred” displays.               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Both customer and partner are     |
|                                   | claiming (combined claim) - Do    |
|                                   | not cancel the script until it    |
|                                   | has created the Grant/Reject docs |
|                                   | on both records. Once the script  |
|                                   | has created the 2nd Grant/Reject  |
|                                   | doc on the partner record, the    |

|                                   | on the customer's record which    |
