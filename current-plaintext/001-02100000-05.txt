Extension of 13 Week NEIS Pre-Training and development

There may be occasions where the job seeker needs more than 13 weeks of
NEIS Pre-Training approved activity because they are still seeking
council approval or are requiring some business licensing before they
can commence their business under Department of Employment and Workplace
Relations (DEWR) NEIS/Self-Employment Assistance Agreement.

For these job seekers, an extension of the 13 weeks NEIS Pre-Training
activity can be arranged until they are able to commence in
NEIS/Self-Employment Assistance.

The NEIS/Self-Employment Assistance Panel Members updates the expected
end date of the NEIS/Self-Employment Assistance training in DEWR systems
and this information is then reflected on the Activity and Exemption
(AEX) screen.

The job seeker has to advise their Workforce Australia or Disability
Employment Services provider in person of the extension and the provider
is required to update their Job Plan.

The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR) Workforce
Australia helpline will assist with general NEIS/Self-Employment
Assistance enquiries and advise the job seeker of any local
