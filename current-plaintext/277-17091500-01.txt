This document outlines the process for the External Complaints - Child
Support (ExCCS) team to manage complaints from customers and others who
write directly to the Services Australia Chief Executive Officer (CEO)
or other Senior Executive Staff (SES) of Child Support Smart Centres
(CSSC).

Executive correspondence to ExCCS

The ExCCS team manages complaints from customers and others who write
about child support-related issues to the CEO and SES of Services
Australia. These complaints are Executive correspondence.

The ExCCS team receives:

-   CEO correspondence via External Complaints - Child Support and the
    Parliamentary Document Management System (PDMS)
-   SES correspondence via External Complaints - Child Support (ExCCS)

The ExCCS Program Support Officer adds Correspondence received via the
External Complaints - Child Support (ExCCS) mailbox to PDMS.

Responding to Executive correspondence

A response to an Executive complaint is required as follows:

-   CEO correspondence within 10 working days (an acknowledgement letter
    must be sent to the correspondent within 48 hours)
-   SES correspondence within 15 working days

Providing feedback to the business

Compliments and complaints provide the agency with a valuable source of
information to:

-   assess performance
-   identify systemic issues, and
-   assist in the training, development and support of staff

The ExCCS team provides written feedback on all staff compliments and
upheld and partially upheld complaints using the Staff Feedback tool.

The Resources page contains links to macros and intranet pages, guides
to preparing written responses and Child Support forms and facts sheets.
