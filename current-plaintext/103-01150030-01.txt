This document outlines the processes required when the Family
Responsibilities Commission (FRC) contacts the Services Australia to
obtain information on a person who may be in receipt of an income
support payment and is identified as suitable to participate in the
Cashless Debit Card (CDC) program.

Identifying eligible customers

The FRC will provide the agency with details of a person to identify if
the person meets the requirements to be considered to participate in the
CDC. This is known as a Personal Information Disclosure (PID). PID
requests are completed by the FRC case managers through the Business
Hub.

Business Hub's role

Business Hub will advise the case manager (in real time):

-   if the referred person is currently in receipt of an income support
    payment
-   the customer's current address details
-   the customer's eligibility results for Cape York Cashless Debit Card
-   if the customer is already participating in the Cashless Debit Card
-   any partner and child (Family Tax Benefit (FTB) only) details
-   payment history, including payment category

Income Management Contact Officer’s (IMCO) role

The Income Management Contact Officer (IMCO) has a role in checking the
Business Hub for any 'unprocessed' PID activities. These will occur when
an FRC case manager cannot match the customer to a record or the
eligibility result is 'no'. These requests are actioned via the Business
Hub. For more information, see Actioning Business Hub requests.
