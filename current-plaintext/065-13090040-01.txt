This document outlines the information and steps for residential care
held events in the Aged Care Staff Portal (ACPP). This process only
applies to the Aged Care Payments Team (Aged Care and Allied Health
Branch).

Historical SPARC process

The System for the Payment of Aged Residential Care (SPARC) is the
legacy aged care payment system for residential care. SPARC is a view
only system from 20 August 2022.

To view the legacy SPARC process, see the historical version.

Aged Care Staff Portal (ACSP)

Aged care services use the Aged Care Provider Portal (ACPP) to make
claims for aged care subsidies and supplements. See the Aged Care
Provider Portal for more information about using the ACPP.

Held events:

are events that have been submitted (created/registered) by an aged care
service which require manual intervention

-   manual intervention means a Service Officer must investigate the
    reasons why the event is held and action the held event by either
    approving or rejecting the event

will remain in a held status if they are not actioned and this may
prevent the payment of the correct amount of aged care subsidies and/or
supplements

For residential care services, an ACPP submitted event may result in an
ACSP held event where they are:

    Oxygen and/or Enteral Feeding Supplement (AC011) form and supporting
