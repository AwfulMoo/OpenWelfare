From 17 March 2021, Income Management (IM) customers based in the
Northern Territory (NT) can permanently transition to the Cashless Debit
Card (CDC) program. Customers on an income support payment who are
living in the NT and are not currently on IM, will be able to volunteer
for the Cashless Debit Card (CDC) from this date.
For more information on this process or to initiate an IM to CDC
transition, see Income Management (IM) to Cashless Debit Card (CDC)
Transition in the Northern Territory, which also contains staff
resources and links to the transition overview Intranet page for
additional information.

This document outlines the process to conduct an Initial Assessment
interview to place a customer onto Income Management, under Voluntary
Income Management.

Initial Assessment interview

An Initial Assessment interview is required to place a customer on
Income Management when they enter into a Voluntary Income Management
Agreement. The interview:

-   explains the terms and conditions of Voluntary Income Management
-   explains how Income Management works
-   determines how the customer's income managed funds can be best used
    to meet the priority needs of the customer and their family, and
-   provides information about other services which may assist them,
    including Centrepay

The interview is held face-to-face for customers entering a Voluntary
Income Management Agreement.

As this is a voluntary action there are no sanctions applicable to the
customer's payments if they do not attend the interview.

Preparing for an Initial Assessment interview

To prepare for an Initial Assessment interview, Service Officers must:

-   Confirm the customer is eligible for Voluntary Income Management
-   Check whether the customer requires an interpreter, and book
    interpreter
-   Investigate the record to determine whether the customer is likely
    to become eligible for a compulsory measure of Income Management in
    the near future
-   Check whether the customer has an excluded payment nominee for
    Income Management purposes. If they do not have an excluded payment
    nominee, ensure they are aware their payment nominee must attend the
    Initial Assessment interview as they are responsible for managing
    their payments
-   Check the record for any vulnerability indicators
-   Check the customer's current rate of payment and any regular income
-   Check whether the customer has any current Centrepay deductions or
    Rent Deduction Scheme payments
-   Have relevant Income Management and self-service communication
    products available for the customer

Role of a correspondence nominee

Correspondence nominees can, where there is no payment nominee,
generally act in place of, or on behalf of, the customer in the
application of Income Management.

A correspondence nominee can:

-   enter into a Voluntary Income Management agreement, and
-   terminate a Voluntary Income Management

If a correspondence nominee requests to enter or exit Voluntary Income
Management on behalf of the customer, the Service Officer must confirm
this request with the customer. Confirmation from the customer that they
agree with the instructions of the correspondence nominee must be
obtained prior to entering or ending a Voluntary Income Management
Agreement.

In some circumstances, a correspondence nominee can act in place of a
customer.
