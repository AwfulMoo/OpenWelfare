| Item                              | Type of order                     |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Parenting order                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Unless there is evidence or       |
|                                   | explicit consideration by the     |
|                                   | court as to who the biological    |
|                                   | parents are, a parenting order    |
|                                   | will not be sufficient to satisfy |
|                                   | PoP.                              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | These orders usually refer to the |
|                                   | parties as the ‘applicant father’ |
|                                   | or ‘applicant mother’. This type  |
|                                   | of casual reference is not an     |
|                                   | express finding                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   within the meaning of         |
|                                   |     s29(2)(c)(i), or              |
|                                   | -   that could only have been     |
|                                   |     made if the person was a      |
|                                   |     parent, as per s29(2)(c)(ii)  |
|                                   |     because parenting orders can  |
|                                   |     be made in relation to        |
|                                   |     parents and non-parent carers |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Note: an initiating application   |
|                                   | for parenting orders may satisfy  |
|                                   | s29(2)(d) as an executed          |
|                                   | instrument, if a person           |
|                                   | acknowledges parentage of the     |
|                                   | child in the application and      |
|                                   | accompanying affidavit.           |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 2                                 | Care and protection order         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A care and protection order can   |
|                                   | allocate specific aspects of      |
|                                   | parental responsibility for a     |
|                                   | child to:                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   one parent to the exclusion   |
|                                   |     of the other, or              |
|                                   | -   both parents jointly, or      |
|                                   | -   the Minister and other        |
|                                   |     suitable persons              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If a care and protection order    |
|                                   | states all aspects of parental    |
|                                   | responsibility for a child are    |
|                                   | allocated solely to the mother,   |
|                                   | to the exclusion of the father    |
|                                   | (and the father is named), this   |
|                                   | satisfies PoP for the father. The |
|                                   | court has made a finding that     |
|                                   | could not have been made unless   |
|                                   | the excluded person was a parent  |
|                                   | of the child (s29(2)(c)(ii)).     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Note: the same principle does not |
|                                   | apply to the mother in this       |
|                                   | example, because allocation of    |
|                                   | parental responsibility can be to |
|                                   | a person who is not a parent such |
|                                   | as the Minister or other suitable |
|                                   | person.                           |
