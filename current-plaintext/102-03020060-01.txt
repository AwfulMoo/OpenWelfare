This document outlines how to monitor started Inter-environment Change
of Address (ICoA) activities. The ICoA facility is a suite of programs
and screens used to transfer customer records between environments. The
ICoA facility allows a user to start and schedule an inter-environment
transfer and to monitor the status of the transfer.

Monitoring transfers

After a transfer has completed, the customer record will be located in
the new environment. For this reason, there is a need to monitor
transfers to ensure all required action is taken so that the record is
transferred to allow ongoing payments for the customer.

Importance of monitoring transfers

Situations which prevent a scheduled transfer from occurring are listed
on edit screens. Once the edits are fixed by the user or cease to exist
(some edits cannot be actioned by the user as they finalise
automatically), then the customer is transferred.
