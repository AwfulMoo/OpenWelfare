Q999 letter text

Q999 letter text to invite the customer to claim FTB:

About your claim for Double Orphan Pension.

Before a claim for Double Orphan Pension can be assessed, we need to
determine if {Child’s name} would be your Family Tax Benefit child and
the easiest way to do this is to make a claim.

You do not need to be paid Family Tax Benefit to receive Double Orphan
Pension, however the information obtained through the claim assists us
in determining eligibility and the amount of Double Orphan Pension you
may be entitled to.

To make a claim for Family Tax Benefit, sign into my.gov.au then select
Centrelink from your service list. If you do not have a myGov account or
a Centrelink online account, you will need to create one and then link
them.

If you can’t claim online you can print and complete a claim form and
take it to a service centre.

Please make sure you have your bank account details (including BSB and
account number), you and your partner’s tax file numbers and income
details as these will be required to complete your claim.

If you need help to complete your online claim or to request a paper
copy of the form, please call us on 136 150

Rejection letter

The below information is for staff processing DOP claims and is to be
used when the Guided Procedure is not available.

DOP rejection letter text

We are writing to advise you that your claim for Double Orphan Pension
has been rejected.

This is because based on the information you provided in your claim,
[child's name]'s parent is not a patient in a nursing home/psychiatric
hospital long term or for an indefinite period.

Long term and indefinite period

The below information is for staff processing DOP claims only and should
be referred to when making decisions regarding a parent who is in long
term imprisonment.

Clarification on 'long term' and 'indefinite period'

For the purpose of DOP:

-   'long term' refers to the period of time that the Secretary is
    satisfied that a parent who is a patient in a psychiatric hospital,
    nursing home or similar institution requires care and treatment for
    an 'indefinite period'
-   'indefinite period' is not clearly defined in the Social Security
    Act, it is without a fixed or specified time limit

The open ended nature of the term 'indefinite period' is to allow for
the uncertain and undefined timeframe for a person to be a patient of a
psychiatric hospital, nursing home or similar institution. Unlike
prison, a person is not 'sentenced' to a period of time in either
institution. While medical personnel may have opinions regarding how
long the person will be in care, there is no specified period of care
predetermined to create a definition.

This makes the determination of 'long term' and 'indefinite' a policy
decision. The decision, mostly, is dependent on the judgement of the
decision maker on a case by case basis.

Level 2 Policy Helpdesk Online Query form. See the Resources page for a

Sentenced or awaiting sentencing

Clarification

An anomaly in the Social Security Act 1991 has been identified affecting
Double Orphan Pension. Current legislation does not support the
circumstance when a parent is in custody and has been charged and
convicted of an offence but not sentenced.

The anomaly occurs when:

A DOP claim is received after a parent has been charged and convicted,
awaiting sentence for an offence that carries a term of imprisonment for
life or for a term of at least 10 years or more

-   Where a parent has been convicted, an individual's qualification is
    determined by the duration of the parent's prison sentence. If the
    parent has been charged with an offence but not convicted, an
    individual's qualification is determined by the maximum penalty that
    the offence carries

Whilst these cases are not common, each claim will need to be assessed
on a case by case basis to determine an individual's qualification to
DOP.

Staff processing DOP claims

-   If a case where a parent is in custody and has been charged and
    convicted, but not sentenced, do not reject the claim
-   Complete the Families and Child Care Level 2 Policy Helpdesk Online
    Query form
-   Include the CRN and reason for the referral
-   Record a progress DOC and place the New Claim activity on hold for
    14 days

|                                   | listed, they do not know who they |
