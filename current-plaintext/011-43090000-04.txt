Under the Cheques Act 1986, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has the
discretion not to pay a stale cheque that is more than 15 months old
from the date it was drawn.

Services Australia is liable to pay a cheque up to the limitation period
of six years. This policy is in line with each State's Limitation Act.
