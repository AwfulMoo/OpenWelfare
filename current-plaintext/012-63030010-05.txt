| 7                                 | Question: Why does a prescriber   |
|                                   | have to provide the biological    |
|                                   | sex if the patient’s gender has   |
|                                   | been provided through the         |
|                                   | Medicare Card details?            |

|                                   | Answer: Eligibility under the GH  |
|                                   | Program is based on the patient’s |
|                                   | biological sex and not their      |
|                                   | identified gender.                |

|                                   | It is clinically inappropriate to |
|                                   | provide a patient with GH         |

|                                   | to their biological sex because   |
|                                   | of the effect of biological sex   |
|                                   | on growth plates. Patient health  |

|                                   | supports assessment on biological |
|                                   | sex.                              |

|                                   | Answer: The date of prescribing   |
|                                   | is the date the GH authority      |
|                                   | application is requested. The     |
|                                   | date of the prescription must be  |
|                                   | the same date the application is  |

|                                   | it has been created in Online PBS |
|                                   | Authorities (OPA) system?         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: Yes. The prescriber can   |

|                                   | An authority application can only |
|                                   | be amended if the prescription    |
|                                   | has not previously been supplied, |
|                                   | cancelled or re-issued.           |

|                                   | Answer: No. Due to GH date driven |

|                                   | Answer: No. The quantity is       |
|                                   | determined using the ‘paediatric  |

|                                   | repeats. For GH, this is set at   |

|                                   | Answer: No. GH policy advice is   |
|                                   | that each GH authority            |
|                                   | application is assessed as a      |
