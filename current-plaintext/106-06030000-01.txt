This document outlines Australian Working Life Residence (WLR), and the
effect that WLR has on a customer's entitlement to Centrelink payments.

How WLR is calculated

Australian WLR refers to any period from the age of 16 years to Age
Pension age when a person was an Australian resident as defined in the
Social Security Act 1991. It is a measure of a person's potential
working life and does not mean that a person has to have actually worked
or paid taxes.

WLR is calculated by assessing the total number of years, months and
days a person has been an Australian resident, as follows:

-   The number of years is multiplied by 12 to give the appropriate
    number of months
-   Each month obviously equals one month
-   30 days equal one month, and any remaining days (including zero) are
    rounded up to a month

Multiple periods of residence

When multiple periods of residence are assessed, each component (years,
months, days) are added together first before the calculation is
performed. See the Resources page for an example.

The datalink with Department of Home Affairs will automatically populate
visa subclass details for customers from 1 September 1994 to date. The
datalink will also automatically update any change in visa for any
customer who has already been identified as a mutual customer. Where
available, the datalink will also advise citizenship and movement
information for the customer. This will allow a Service Officer to
assess residence periods for the customer and assist in calculating the
customers WLR.

Generally, the minimum WLR required to allow a full income and asset
rate of payment is 420 months (35 years). Customers paid using the
Agreement with Greece or the Republic of North Macedonia may be paid
according to a working life residence of 528 months (44 years). For
further information, see:

-   Greece Agreement and foreign pension information
-   North Macedonia Agreement and foreign pension information

Customers who were either outside Australia, or inside Australia
temporarily, at the implementation of the 1 July 2014 AWLR changes may
continue to be saved (grandfathered) from the changes and assessed under
the rules in place prior to 1 July 2014. Customers assessed under the
pre 1 July 2014 Australian Working Life Residence (AWLR) rules contains
further information.

Customers affected by WLR

WLR affects customers:

-   who are overseas for more than 26 weeks and entitled to a
    proportional rate of pension
-   who are paid under an International Agreement, and
-   who apply for a pension from an Agreement country

Customers paid under the New Zealand (NZ) Agreement or who are living in
NZ long term are paid according to Working Age Residence (WAR) rather
than WLR. The following rules do not apply to either of these customers.

WLR affected payments

WLR may affect the following payments:

-   Age Pension
-   Parenting Payment (Single) (PPS)
-   Disability Support Pension (DSP)
-   Carer Payment (CP)
-   Pension Supplement Basic Amount

WLR and Portability

A person's portability period starts on the day they leave Australia,
the day of departure is included as part of their absence regardless of
the time of departure.

The day a person returns to Australia is not included as part of their
absence, they are considered to be inside Australia on that day and
therefore no longer affected by portability.

After a customer has been absent from Australia for 26 weeks, their
payment will be based on their WLR in Australia unless they are saved
under certain portability rules. For example, an autonomous Disability
Support Pension customer who became unable to work while an Australian
resident will not be affected by proportional portability but will be
paid the normal income and asset tested rate.

WLR and International Agreements

A minimum WLR may be required before a customer is entitled to payment
under an International Agreement. The minimum amount is generally twelve
months for customers who are residing outside Australia and who need to
totalise to qualify for payment. While the WLR is generally rounded up,
the minimum working life residence of 12 months for totalisation
purposes cannot be rounded up.

Customers residing in Australia generally do not require a minimum WLR
before they can totalise. Once entitlement under an Agreement is
established, WLR may be used (along with the normal income and asset
tests) to determine the rate of payment a customer outside Australia
will receive. Customers paid under some Agreements who are temporarily
or permanently in Australia may also receive the outside Australia rate.
Note: historical residence is used to determine qualification for
Centrelink payments, not WLR.

WLR can also affect the way certain types of income are treated. For
example, if a person is paid under an International Agreement (other
than Greece, Poland, Slovenia, Chile and Croatia), any pension from that
country is proportionalised before being added into the calculation.
However, a proportional rate limiter ceiling applies to these customers.

WLR and Foreign Pension entitlement

A person claiming a pension from an Agreement country may use their WLR
to add to contributions or residence in the Agreement country to meet
the minimum contribution amount required to qualify for a foreign
pension.

For example, to qualify for an Austrian pension a person requires 15
years of contributions. However, they may add five years of
contributions to 10 years of WLR and qualify for a part pension from
Austria.

Use of a partner's WLR

Most proportional rates are paid according to a person's own WLR,
however, the person may be paid according to their current or former
partner's WLR.

The Resources page has information on when the customer cannot give the
exact or precise dates for residence and an example of a calculation of
Australian WLR. It also contains a link to Old Arrival Records on the
National Archives, a link to the Passenger Card information and
International Services contact details.
