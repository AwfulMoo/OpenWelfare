This document outlines how Digital Assistants provide online support for
Services Australia customers and the myGov website.

Digital Assistants

Digital Assistants are an automated tool that require no staff
interaction.

Digital Assistants reduce demand on staff in service centres and Smart
Centres and the myGov Helpdesk by providing:

-   immediate responses to general enquiries, including links to related
    information when appropriate
-   an enhanced digital service available 24/7, and
-   a digital channel to assist in sourcing information, privately

The Digital Assistant provides online support for Services Australia
customers on:

-   Selected Services Australia website pages, assisting customers with
    pre-approved responses to general questions about payments and
    services, as well as how to do business with Services Australia
    online. The Digital Assistant is accessed via the Ask a question bar
    located in the bottom right hand corner on selected pages on the
    Services Australia website
-   Authenticated Centrelink online claims, assisting customers with
    pre-approved responses to general questions about payments and
    services as well as many payment specific questions relating to
    online claims. The Digital Assistant is accessed by selecting the
    Launch the digital assistant link within the online claim
-   The Express Plus Centrelink mobile app, assisting customers with
    pre-approved responses to app related functions as well as general
    questions about payments and services. The Digital Assistant is
    accessed via a button at the bottom of the app home screen

A fourth Digital Assistant is available to provide online support on the
myGov website:

-   myGov Digital Assistant assists customers with pre-approved
    responses to general questions such as setting up a myGov account,
    information about linking codes and linking Member Services, how to
    update name and/or gender etc, and basic information about the myGov
    Member Services. The Digital Assistant is accessed via the Ask a
    question bar located in the bottom right hand corner of the myGov
    webpage, in both unauthenticated and authenticated myGov pages

If staff receive queries about the Digital Assistants, see the Resources
page for responses to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) and links to
Digital Assistant-enabled pages on the Services Australia website.

The Digital Assistant Team analyse customers' questions, review, update
answers, and add new questions to improve the Digital Assistants,
weekly.
