This document outlines the process that needs to be followed when a
person advises Services Australia that a student has died.

Death of a student

Before it can be finalised on the record, the death must be confirmed.

If the student previously received a Financial Supplement Loan (FSL),
the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) must be advised of the student's
death.

To reissue a payment returned from a financial institution on the
deceased person's record, see Replacing direct credit, New Payments
Platform (NPP) or Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) payments returned
from financial institution.

Surviving partner

If the student was partnered, the surviving partner may be eligible for
the following bereavement assistance:

-   Lump Sum Bereavement Payment - if both the customer and partner were
    long term social security recipients or pensioners
-   Partner Bereavement Payment - if the surviving partner is claiming
    or receiving JobSeeker Payment or Youth Allowance
-   Bereavement exemption from activity test, mutual obligation or
    participation requirements - if the surviving partner is claiming or
    receiving JobSeeker Payment, Youth Allowance, Parenting Payment
    (youngest child aged 6 or 7) or Special Benefit under JSP or YA
    conditions
-   Bereavement exemption from some waiting periods - if the surviving
    partner is claiming JobSeeker Payment or Youth Allowance. Waiting
    periods exempted are Ordinary Waiting Period, Liquid Assets Waiting
    Period, Income Maintenance Period and Seasonal Work Preclusion
    Period

Nominee arrangements and Power of Attorney cease upon death

After a customer dies, Nominee and Power of Attorney (POA):

-   arrangements stop
-   can no longer get details about the deceased person
-   do not automatically become the executor or administrator

A statutory declaration cannot be used as authorisation for access to a
deceased person's details. Tell the third party to seek advice from a
lawyer, Probate Office or Public Trustee. See Requests for information
after someone has died.

Deceased customer on reporting at time of death

If employment income details for the period in which the customer passed
away:

-   are known, these must be recorded before stimulating the payment
-   are not known, the payment must still be stimulated

After the payment is stimulated, the customer should be taken off
reporting before recording the death action.

The Resources page contains links to the Services Australia website for
information on what to do when someone has died, the form Needing help
after someone has died? (HD001) and contact details for the Australian
Taxation Office.
