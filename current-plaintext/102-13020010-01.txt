This document outlines action required by a Service Officer when a
Centrelink customer has more than one Customer Reference Number (CRN).

Multiple CRNs

A multiple CRN is when a Centrelink customer has more than one CRN.

A potential multiple CRN can be identified by:

-   A CLI/MLC activity on the newly created record and/or
-   A previously recorded Fast Note on either record advising of a
    potential multiple and/or
-   A match on the Multiple Match List (MML) screen

Determine if the:

-   Data Quality Unit (DQU) has assessed the case by checking the
    Document List (DL) screen for a Display on Access (DOA) DOC by NA8
-   Where a record has not been assessed, refer for investigation to
    DQU, using the Multiple CRN Referral Fast Note

For immediate assistance with identifying and actioning potential
multiple CRNs, phone the DQU Helpdesk. The Resources page contains links
to DQU contact details.

Note: other records such as Unauthenticated Online Entity (UOE) or
records that have been previously deleted are not multiple CRNs and
should not be referred to DQU. DQU do not have responsibility for
multiple Organisation (ORG) records.

Multiple records should not be confused with intertwined records that
occur when the information belonging to one customer is incorrectly
placed on the record of another person. Intertwining often occurs when
the records have the same or similar names and dates of birth, and an
incorrect customer's record is selected and updated.

The Resources page contains links to the Office Locator Data Quality
Unit page and the Data Quality Unit home page.
