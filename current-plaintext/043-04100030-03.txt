|                                   | -   It is necessary to aggregate  |
|                                   |     the primary production assets |
|                                   |     and liabilities of private    |
|                                   |     trusts and companies          |
|                                   |     attributed to a customer with |
|                                   |     the other primary production  |
|                                   |     assets and liabilities of the |
|                                   |     customer. There is provision  |
|                                   |     for all assets and            |
|                                   |     liabilities to be identified  |
|                                   |     as either primary production  |
|                                   |     or non-primary production.    |
|                                   |     The primary production        |
|                                   |     aggregation rules apply       |
|                                   | -   When assets and liabilities   |
|                                   |     are passed to a customer or   |
|                                   |     to another organisation they  |
|                                   |     pass as primary production or |
|                                   |     non-primary production        |
|                                   |     assets. This allows the       |
|                                   |     primary production attributed |
|                                   |     assets and liabilities to be  |
|                                   |     aggregated with the           |
|                                   |     customer's other primary      |
|                                   |     production assets or          |
|                                   |     liabilities                   |
|                                   | -   The normal business rules     |
|                                   |     will apply in regard to       |
|                                   |     primary production assets,    |
|                                   |     that is, they can be a        |
|                                   |     negative amount when passed   |
|                                   |     from an organisation to       |
|                                   |     another organisation or       |
|                                   |     person. If it is a negative   |
|                                   |     primary production amount     |
|                                   |     passed across to another      |
|                                   |     organisation or person then   |
|                                   |     the negative amount can be    |
|                                   |     offset against other positive |
|                                   |     primary production assets.    |
|                                   |     The negative amount can       |
|                                   |     increase the negative amount  |
|                                   |     within the organisation and   |
|                                   |     this increased negative can   |
|                                   |     then be passed to another     |
|                                   |     organisation or person        |
