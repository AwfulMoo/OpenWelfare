Transfer customers calling about Coronavirus (COVID-19) to the

The Privacy Statement for emergency claims has been added to the IVR on
the Australian Government Emergency Information Line. Service Officers
do not need to read the Privacy statement to callers again. The only
time privacy statement needs to be read is when the customer hands their
phone over to another customer to make a claim in the same phone call.
