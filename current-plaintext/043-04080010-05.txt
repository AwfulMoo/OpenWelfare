| Item                              | Example                           |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Customer was a controller of an   |
|                                   | entity with net assets of         |
|                                   | $40,000. However, there was a     |
|                                   | liability of $40,000 secured      |
|                                   | against the controller's home     |
|                                   | which was disallowed as per Sec   |
|                                   | 1208G of the Act. Accordingly the |
|                                   | attributed assets were $80,000.   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The customer surrendered control  |
|                                   | after 1/4/02.                     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Department of Social Services     |
|                                   | (DSS) have advised gifting        |
|                                   | applies to the unadjusted amount  |
|                                   | that is $40,000.                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The same principal applies if a   |
|                                   | loan is disallowed because it is  |
|                                   | not documented and therefore      |
|                                   | increases the attributed entity   |
|                                   | assets. If the customer           |
|                                   | surrenders control gifting would  |
|                                   | be assessed based on the net      |
|                                   | amount before disallowing a non   |
|                                   | documented loan.                  |
