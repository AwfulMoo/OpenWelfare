This document outlines information about the collection of child support
via deduction from a person’s salary or wage. This is known as employer
withholding/linking.

About employer withholding (linking)

Employer withholding (EW) deductions from a person’s salary or wage is a
convenient payment method for customers who are:

-   salary or wage earners
-   receiving Parental Leave Payments (PLP) from an employer
-   contractors

It is also a convenient method for customers to repay a child support
debt, child support related debt and carer debt.

Customer can make an election for EW not to apply if they prefer to pay
the ongoing periodic liability themselves. However, an election cannot
be made when there is no ongoing periodic liability payable, and
deductions are only to repay a debt.
