This document outlines how to conduct the Service Offer Interview (SOI)
for Disability Support Pension (DSP) customers in Process Direct and
Customer First.

Service Offer Interview (SOI)

The SOI is an integral part of the DSP assessment and is an opportunity
to discuss the claim outcome and offer support options.

When a DSP claim is rejected it is vital the SOI is attempted in every
instance to ensure the customer understands the reason their claim was
rejected. The SOI must outline why the customer did not qualify for DSP.
In some circumstances, an SOI is also required when DSP is granted.

When an SOI is required

SOIs should be attempted in every circumstance when the customer's:

-   DSP claim has been rejected
-   DSP claim has been granted and customer or their partner has
    earnings, unless they meet either the Pension Monthly Exception Rule
    or the 1WE or 2WE exception. See Recording and correcting employment
    income details
-   DSP claim will be granted and an update to their Family Tax Benefit
    is required
-   Nominee has requested contact about the claim

When an SOI may not be required

In limited circumstances where DSP is rejected, an SOI is not required.
However, if a correspondence nominee or executor arrangement exists, an
SOI attempt should occur.

An SOI is not required where the customer:

-   is deceased
-   is in prison
-   is in psychiatric confinement
-   has no contact number on record
-   SOI is not appropriate. For example, the customer is overseas
-   is subject to restricted servicing and contact is deemed
    inappropriate

Note: if a customer has a Managed Service Plan, contact should first be
made with the One Main Contact (OMC), Back up Contact or Personalised
Services Service Officer (PSSO) if assigned, to discuss how to best
approach the SOI.

Conducting an SOI

All SOIs must:

tell the customer of the outcome of their claim

clearly explain the reason for the decision

discuss the customer's current circumstances and how Services Australia
can help including:

-   alternative income support payments, such as JobSeeker Payment (JSP)
-   appropriate employment services referrals, such as Disability
    Employment Services (DES)
-   reduced/temporary work capacity (if applicable), and
-   how participation in employment services and any periods of
    exemption may affect any future assessment of active participation
    in a Program of Support

offer a copy of the relevant medical assessments to help the customer
understand the decision

If the customer believes a decision Services Australia has made is
incorrect, even after a full explanation, then inform the customer of
their right of appeal.

SOI for DSP claims selected for QMA in Process Direct only

Quality Management Officers (QMO) must complete Service Offer Interviews
(SOI) for Disability Support Payment (DSP) claims selected for Quality
Management Application (QMA).

Exceptions to this include where the DSP claim is finalised by:

-   Service Officer who is undertaking consolidation training for
    Disability claim processing, or
-   Smart Centre Critical Response Team (SCCRT)

QMO must not action SOIs for claims finalised under consolidation
training or finalised by SCCRT.

Staff undertaking consolidation training will:

-   conduct SOI after the QMA has been completed
-   check QMA feedback tile in Process Direct

Staff from SCCRT will:

-   conduct the SOI before finalising the claim, and
-   run the SOI Workflow after the QMA check is finalised

QMA aims to improve efficiencies by finalising work items and customer
outcomes in a single process.

The QMO finds and fixes errors (if required) in real time and do not
refer the work back to the submitting Service Officer to fix.

As the QMO completes the DSP claim activity, they also deliver the SOI.

SOI for DSP claims selected for QOL in Customer First only

The Service Officer assessing the DSP claim in Customer First must
complete the SOI.

If the DSP claim has been submitted for QOL (Quality On Line) the claim
must be successfully passed before the SOI being completed by the
Service Officer.

QOL is a quality assurance program. It uses sampling to select
activities for checking based on the system, service reason, activity
type and proficiency levels of staff.

The QOL program contains a number of components including QOL tools, QOL
checkers, a quality-sampling regime, feedback mechanisms and QOL
Standards.

Assessment Services attempt SOI before DSP claim is rejected for Insufficient Medical Evidence (IME)

From 13 December 2021, Health and Allied Health Professionals from the
Assessment Services Medical Assessment Team (MAT) are undertaking a
trial to attempt the SOI before making a recommendation to reject a DSP
claim for reason IME.

MAT Assessors attempt the SOI and, if appropriate, give the customer
extra time (usually 5 days) to provide medical evidence for their claim.
Contact is recorded via the AssessServ Contact Completed Fast Note.

Where the MAT Assessor submits a recommendation to reject IME,
Disability Processing staff do not attempt a further SOI.

and the Payment and Service Finder on the Services Australia website.
