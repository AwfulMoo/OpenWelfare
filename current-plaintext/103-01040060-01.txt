This document outlines what a Service Officer is to do when an income
managed customer incurs a financial penalty as a result of a decision to
apply a failure under either the Targeted Compliance Framework or the
Job Seeker Compliance Framework.

Impact of compliance action

Customers subject to mutual obligation requirements can incur financial
penalties or cancellation of payment as a result of non-compliance.
Customers who are income managed are not exempt from incurring financial
penalties or cancellation, but a reduction in income managed funds
results in expenses failing to pay if there is not enough money
available in their Income Management account to absorb the reduction in
payment.

Review of IM

Service Officers are to discuss the impact any compliance action may
have on Income Management with a customer. Service Officers will review
a customer’s priority needs, and if necessary reduce or suspend regular
expenses during any rate reduction or non-payment period where there are
insufficient funds to cover expenses.

transfer numbers.
