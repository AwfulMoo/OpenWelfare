| 1                                 | Example 1                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A partner in a business offers    |
|                                   | his principal home (value         |
|                                   | $130,000) and a holiday home      |
|                                   | (value $90,000) as security for   |
|                                   | loans of $75,000 obtained in      |
|                                   | respect of a trucking business.   |
|                                   | The loans are secured by          |
|                                   | registered first mortgage on both |
|                                   | the real estate properties.       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Although not secured against      |
|                                   | business assets, under the        |
|                                   | modified application of section   |
|                                   | 1121(1) of the Social Security    |
|                                   | Act 1991, Effect of charge or     |
|                                   | encumbrances on value of assets   |
|                                   | to business liabilities, the      |
|                                   | amount of the loans would         |
|                                   | normally be deducted from the     |
|                                   | value of assets owned by the      |
|                                   | business. However, as the         |
|                                   | business loans are secured        |
|                                   | against both the customer's       |
|                                   | exempt principal residence and    |
|                                   | the assessable holiday home,      |
|                                   | section 1121(4), overrides this   |
|                                   | general rule. The amount of the   |
|                                   | loans for which the exempt        |
|                                   | principal home provides security  |
|                                   | cannot be deducted from the value |
|                                   | of assets owned by the business.  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | In this situation subsection      |
|                                   | 1121(4) of the Social Security    |
|                                   | Act 1991 provides for the amount  |
|                                   | of the business loans to be       |
|                                   | apportioned to determine the      |
|                                   | amount for which the holiday home |
|                                   | provides security. It is only     |
|                                   | this amount (for which the        |
|                                   | holiday home provides security)   |
|                                   | that can then be deducted from    |
|                                   | the value of the assets owned by  |
|                                   | the business.                     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Of the total secured liabilities  |
|                                   | of $75,000, the amount of the     |
|                                   | loan for which the holiday home   |
|                                   | provides security can be          |
|                                   | calculated as follows:            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | $75,000 (amount of the loan) x    |
|                                   | $90,000 (value of the assessable  |
|                                   | assets)                           |

|                                   | $130,000 + $90,000 (value of all  |
|                                   | assets providing security)        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | = $75,000 x $90,000 divided by    |
|                                   | $220,000                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | = $75,000 x 0.40909               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | = $30,681                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The amount of $30,681 is          |
|                                   | therefore the proportion of the   |
|                                   | secured liability of $75,000      |
|                                   | which can be deducted from the    |
|                                   | value of the holiday home.        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The proportion of the loans for   |
|                                   | which the customer's principal    |
|                                   | home provides security is         |
|                                   | therefore $44,319 ($75,000 -      |
|                                   | $30,681). As the principal home   |
|                                   | is exempt from assessment, the    |
|                                   | amount of the loans for which the |
|                                   | customer's home provides security |
|                                   | are effectively not taken into    |
|                                   | account when determining the      |
|                                   | value of the customer's total     |
|                                   | assessable assets.                |

|                                   | Note: although the amount of the  |
|                                   | liability secured against an      |
|                                   | asset exempt from assessment      |
|                                   | cannot be deducted from the value |
|                                   | of assets owned by the business,  |
|                                   | interest expense incurred in      |
|                                   | respect of the liability is an    |
|                                   | allowable deduction against       |
|                                   | business income if the loan has   |
|                                   | been taken out for business       |
|                                   | purposes.                         |

|                                   | Liabilities of private trusts and |
|                                   | companies are treated differently |
|                                   | to this example.                  |
