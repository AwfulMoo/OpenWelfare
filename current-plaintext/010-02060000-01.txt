This document outlines the away from home criteria for ABSTUDY.

The away from home rate

The away from home rate is a higher rate of ABSTUDY Living Allowance
intended to assist students and Australian Apprentices who live away
from the parental home:

-   in order to access a course of study or undertake an Australian
    Apprenticeship, or
-   where conditions at the parental home form a serious impediment to
    the student's educational or Australian Apprentice's training
    progress

The higher rate is not available simply because an ABSTUDY student or
Australian Apprentice chooses to live away from home.

The away from home rate is available to eligible dependent ABSTUDY
secondary or tertiary students who do not meet ABSTUDY independence.

Applicable means tests

ABSTUDY students and Australian Apprentices eligible for the away from
home rate are subject to the personal income test and Parental Means
Test.

Away from home rate criteria

Where a student or Australian Apprentice meets more than one criteria,
the assessment should reflect the most beneficial outcome. See the
Resources page for examples. Circumstances where the away from home rate
is paid can vary based on whether they are a secondary or tertiary
student, or an Australian Apprentice, see below:

Tertiary and secondary students and Australian Apprentices

-   Travelling time and access between the permanent home and the
    education institution or employment location make daily travel
    impossible or unreasonable
-   Home conditions are a serious impediment to educational progress

Secondary school students only

-   Special course requirements
-   Limited local school facilities do not offer a full school program
-   Student with a disability requires specialist education or
    facilities
-   Itinerant family prevents regular access to education
-   Student has been excluded from all local schools
-   Student is experiencing racial discrimination at the local education
    institution
-   It would be unreasonable to break a student's continuity of study at
    a school
-   Student is in receipt of an independent school scholarship from a
    qualifying school

Tertiary students only

-   The student's course of study requires compulsory residence at the
    institution

State Care

Students and Australian Apprentices under State Care arrangements, whose
foster parents do not receive a foster care or similar allowance, can
receive the away from home rate. To determine the rate of ABSTUDY paid
to students and Australian Apprentices in State Care, see Assessing
ABSTUDY student in State Care for the away from home rate.

Welfare reform designated trial sites

Since 1 January 2008, secondary students residing in 1 of the 5 welfare
designated Cape York trial sites are eligible for ABSTUDY away from home
rate to attend school at another location.

The 5 communities which are designated Cape York Trial sites, are:

-   Aurukun
-   Coen
-   Hope Vale
-   Mossman Gorge and
-   Doomadgee

A student will lose eligibility to away from home entitlements where:

-   their parental home changes to a location outside of a designated
    trial site, or
-   they return from boarding school to live permanently in the parental
    home

Repeating the final year of primary school at another location

Secondary school aged students may be approved for the away from home
rate for primary level study. The student must have completed the final
year of primary school and intends to study secondary level at a new
school but is lacking the skills to undertake secondary level study. The
student must meet the requirements of a student repeating the final year
of primary school at another location, see ABSTUDY allowances for
Primary Level study.

Assistance if only a non-government school is in the local area

Students in rural or remote areas may automatically qualify for the away
from home rate due to travel time and access or limited local school
facilities. These students have no access to a government school
offering the appropriate year of study however, they may have access to
a non-government school but cannot afford the fees.

In these cases, ABSTUDY may approve the Group 2 School Fee Allowance
(SFA) so they can attend the non-government school and remain living at
home. See ABSTUDY School Fees Allowance (SFA) (Group 2).

Living arrangements for away from home

The away from home rate is payable for the following types of student
accommodation:

Secondary school students

-   boarding school
-   student hostel
-   approved ABSTUDY Homestay arrangement
-   private board arrangement (family, friends)
-   private rental accommodation

Secondary non-schooling or tertiary students

-   residential college
-   student hostel
-   private board arrangement
-   private rental accommodation

Payee for away from home entitlements

The appropriate payee for the away from home entitlements is determined
by the student or Australian Apprentice's study level, age, living
arrangements and the allowance type to be paid. The away from home
entitlements can be paid to the:

-   student or Australian Apprentice
-   parent/guardian
-   private board provider
-   hostel or boarding school providing the accommodation

Entitlements if eligible for away from home rate

A student or Australian Apprentice who meets approval for the away from
home rate may be eligible for entitlements to assist with costs
associated with living away from the parental home. This includes:

-   Living Allowance at the higher away from home rate
-   Rent Assistance
-   Remote Area Allowance
-   School Fees Allowance (SFA) Group 2
-   Fares Allowance (FAA) for ABSTUDY
-   Residential Costs Option
-   Relocation Scholarship (RS)

Note: an Australian Apprentice is not entitled to SFA, FAA, Residential
Costs Option or RS.

Assessment of the away from home rate

An Assessment of the away from home rate is based on the circumstances
at the student or Australian Apprentice's parental home. If the location
or circumstances change, a reassessment is required. A secondary school
student may retain approval for the away from home rate where it is
deemed by the state or territory education authorities to be
unreasonable for the student to break continuity of study.

A student or Australian Apprentice ceases eligibility if they return
permanently to live at the parental home. The away from home rate is not
affected by a temporary return home, for example during weekend or
vacation periods.

Claiming away from home rate

Away from home rate can be claimed:

-   via the ABSTUDY Claim, or
-   for existing customers, via a statement (verbal or written)
    indicating the criteria they are seeking approval for

The Resources page contains examples where a student or Australian
Apprentice meets more than one away from home rate criteria.
