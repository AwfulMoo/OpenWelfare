|                                   | November 2007 and proceeded to    |

|                                   | rate of Age Pension. Arthur was   |
|                                   | granted Age Pension from 27       |
|                                   | November 2007 at a reduced rate   |
|                                   | of $210.15 per fortnight (per     |
|                                   | fortnight). This was increased to |
|                                   | $435.20 per fortnight from 16     |
|                                   | December 2007 due to John's new   |
|                                   | financial arrangements.           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Arthur was paid a bonus of        |
|                                   | $6,291. If Arthur had deferred    |
|                                   | the claim for Age Pension and PBP |
|                                   | until 16 December 2007, the bonus |
|                                   | would have been $13,029. Arthur   |
|                                   | could have sacrificed $285.20 in  |
|                                   | pension for the period by         |
|                                   | claiming later, and gained an     |
|                                   | additional $6,738 in bonus.       |

|                                   | after 1 January 2008 may be       |
|                                   | entitled to a Pension Bonus       |
|                                   | Top-up payment (PBTP) if their    |
|                                   | Age Pension entitlement changes   |
|                                   | to a higher rate within 13 weeks  |
|                                   | of being granted the Age Pension. |
|                                   | This only applies from grants of  |
|                                   | Age Pension and PBP after 1       |

|                                   | years of age (1 April 2004). On   |
|                                   | 31 March 2007 John has accrued 3  |
|                                   | bonus years. John works a 35 hour |
|                                   | week. By 14 October 2007 John had |
|                                   | worked in excess of 960 hours.    |

|                                   | counted in the PBP entitlement.   |
|                                   | John then has 13 weeks from 31    |
|                                   | March 2008 to claim Age Pension   |
|                                   | and PBP. If these claims are      |
|                                   | lodged between 1 April 2008 and   |
|                                   | 30 June 2008, the bonus period    |
|                                   | for PBP is 4 full years.          |

|                                   | John will need to determine if it |
|                                   | is better off to wait and claim   |
|                                   | PBP after the next anniversary    |

|                                   | This will depend on John's        |

|                                   | An interview with a FIS officer   |
|                                   | would raise Jane's awareness of   |
|                                   | the main issue which would affect |
|                                   | the bonus amount. That is, when   |
|                                   | did Jane fail to meet the work    |
|                                   | test and when is the best time to |
|                                   | claim?                            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Jane claims PBP on 1 April 2007.  |
|                                   | Because of the 780 hours already  |
|                                   | worked in the period 1 July 2006  |
|                                   | to 30 December 2006 Jane has      |
|                                   | actually met the work test for    |
|                                   | 42.4 weeks (297 days) of the      |
|                                   | 2006-07 bonus period. So when     |
|                                   | Jane claims on 1 April 2007 there |
|                                   | will be an accumulated period of  |
|                                   | 3 years plus 39 weeks (1 July     |
|                                   | 2006 to 31 March 2007), for the   |
|                                   | bonus calculation. If Jane        |
|                                   | delayed the claim until 27 April  |
|                                   | 2007, being the date from which   |
|                                   | Jane's situation actually fails   |
|                                   | to meet the work test, this would |
|                                   | give a bigger part year bonus     |
|                                   | period of a further 3.4 weeks.    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The date Jane ceased to meet the  |
|                                   | work test is the date Jane needs  |
|                                   | to specify on the claim to        |
|                                   | maximise the bonus.               |
