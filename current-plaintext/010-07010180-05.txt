Student Programme Resource Tool

The Student Programme Resource Tool contains useful reference
information and links. It includes:

-   Allowable Time Calculator
-   Distance Education & Private Provider Date Calculator
-   Long Term Income Support Calculator

The tool can only be used to assist with Allowable Time Assessments if
all study undertaken at the Institution is studied under the current
Term/Semester structure. If the student has studied at the same
institution under different structures the tool will not be able to
assist with the assessment for study within the previous structure. A
manual allowable time assessment is required.
