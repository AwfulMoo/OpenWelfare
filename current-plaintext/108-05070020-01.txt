This document outlines the assessment of lump sum withdrawals from
superannuation funds. This procedure is not for Family Tax Benefit (FTB)
or Child Care Subsidy (CCS) customers.

Lump sum withdrawals

Lump sum withdrawals from a superannuation fund are not assessed as
income. Depending on what the customer uses the withdrawn amount for,
further assessment may be necessary. If the withdrawn amount is used to
purchase an assessable asset, the relevant income and asset assessment
will apply. For example, if the money is placed in a bank account, the
account balance is an asset and subject to deeming. If the withdrawn
amount is spent, no further assessment is necessary.

Benefits released from superannuation

For FTB and CCS, benefits released from superannuation are generally
taxable income and must be included in the customer's estimate. Service
Officers should check if the customer needs to revise their current
family assistance income estimate and advise choices available to help
reduce the chance of an overpayment during the reconciliation process.
