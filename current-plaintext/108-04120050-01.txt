Before inviting a claim under assets hardship provisions, the case
should be discussed with a Complex Assessment Officer (CAO).

This document outlines the reasons that may be acceptable for an asset
to be disregarded because it may not be able to be sold. It also
provides examples of when it would be unreasonable to expect a pension
customer to sell or to borrow against the asset.

Claim for consideration under hardship form

Customers must complete a Claim for consideration under hardship form
(SA233). On the claim they must indicate which assets they wish to have
disregarded. Services Australia will consider the reasons why the asset
cannot be sold, or why it would be unreasonable to expect the customer
to sell or borrow against the asset.

If a customer asks for the asset value of a loan (that is, a loan made
by the customer) to be disregarded due to the inability of the debtor to
repay the loan, the circumstances should be examined to see if the loan
is irrecoverable.

If a customer questions the valuation of real estate and can provide
evidence that will affect the value of the property, they can apply for
a formal review of the valuation decision. Note: downturn in rural
economy is not adequate evidence if there has been a recent property
valuation, as this would have been taken into account.

Unreasonable or unable to sell an asset

It can be accepted that a customer is unable to sell or borrow against
an asset where:

-   the property/asset is on the market but cannot attract a buyer and
    the asking price is no more than 10% above the assessed current
    market value, or
-   the customer has been found eligible for Farm Household Allowance
    (FHA), or
-   there is a legal restriction or court order which prevents the
    property/asset from being sold or used as security for borrowing, or
    the property/asset is subject to a pending property settlement, or
-   the asset is a jointly owned home and the claimant has fled the home
    as a result of domestic violence, or
-   the property/asset is owned jointly with another person and that
    person refuses to agree to the sale of the property/asset, or
-   the property/asset is owned as tenants-in-common and the practical
    effect of the ownership is that the asset would be unsaleable

Pension claimants only

The hardship rules for pension claimants include a test of whether or
not it is unreasonable to expect the asset to be sold. It can be
accepted that it is unreasonable to expect the asset to be sold if:

-   the asset is a property, and the claimant has lived there for at
    least 20 years, and the property cannot be subdivided to allow the
    claimant to retain the portion their home is on, or
-   the asset is a farm, and the claimant has been a farmer for at least
    20 years (not necessarily on the same farm), and the claimant is
    working the farm, and they could not sell some of the land without
    affecting the viability of the farm and/or significantly affecting
    their income from the farm, or
-   the asset is a farm, and a family member is working the farm to
    capacity, and has been working the farm for at least 10 years (a
    slightly shorter period can be accepted if the family member has
    worked the farm continuously since leaving school), and the farm is
    the main source of the family member’s livelihood, or
-   the asset is a farm or some other business, and there is a temporary
    but substantial reduction in the business income due to
    circumstances beyond the claimant’s control, or
-   the asset is a house occupied by a near relative, and the near
    relative has lived in the house for at least 10 years, or the near
    relative has previously provided care for the claimant in the
    property (which was previously the claimant’s home), or the near
    relative is a handicapped child of the claimant and the claimant is
    providing the property to promote the child’s independent living, or
    the near relative has dependent children and the family income of
    the near relative does not exceed the Family Tax Benefit (FTB)
    income ceiling.

Note: in the first 2 scenarios, a period of less than 20 years can be
accepted if there are unforeseen circumstances.

Claimant in temporary hardship expected to borrow

Where an asset is considered unable to be sold and the claimant is in
temporary hardship (that is, their situation is likely to improve in the
foreseeable future), they may be able to borrow against their assets in
order to alleviate their hardship. When assessing a customer's ability
to borrow against particular assets, the following factors are taken
into account:

-   their ability to meet periodic repayments
-   the type of assets involved
-   whether their financial position is likely to improve in the future
