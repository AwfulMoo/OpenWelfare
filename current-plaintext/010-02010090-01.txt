This document outlines the process for Service Officers assisting
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students and Australian
Apprentices complete a paper Claim for ABSTUDY Allowances and Part-time
Award (SY021).

When to use this claim form

The Claim for ABSTUDY Allowances and Part-time Award (SY021) should be
completed by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander:

part-time students

full-time students claiming the non-means-tested ABSTUDY allowances only
(including Incidentals Allowance), for example the customer's income
will preclude payment of ABSTUDY Living Allowance

Australian Apprentices claiming Incidentals Allowance only, or

customers claiming assistance to travel away from home to:

-   attend a selection test or interview for entry into a tertiary,
    Masters or Doctorate level course, or
-   determine their suitability for the Indigenous Youth Mobility
    Programme

If an Australian Apprentice or full-time student is unsure what to claim
or wishes to test their eligibility for Living Allowance, they should
complete the Claim for ABSTUDY (SY019).

-   The claim must be completed in blue or black pen
-   All relevant questions on the claim should be answered. Many
