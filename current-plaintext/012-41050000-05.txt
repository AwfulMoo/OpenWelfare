Introduction of amended geographic eligibility script

Use the following script for any telephone enquiry regarding the new
geographic requirements for services under Telehealth Medicare Benefits
Schedule (MBS) item numbers.

Begin script:

'The measure amended the geographic boundaries for a patient (and
patient-end support practitioners) to be eligible to receive Medicare
benefits for a Telehealth service.

The new boundaries now align with the Australian Standard Geographical
Classification - Remoteness Area (ASGC-RA) classification system. Under
the ASGC-RA, patients who are located in Remoteness Area One - Major
Cities of Australia (RA1) at the time of a Telehealth service will now
be ineligible for benefits.

The new eligibility requirements will be implemented by amending
relevant Telehealth items in the 1 January 2013 Medicare Benefits
Schedule.

The primary objective of the Telehealth MBS items is to provide access
to specialist services for patients for whom distance is a genuine
barrier to receiving specialist care. The Australian Government is
moving to the ASGC-RA classification system in order to create a fairer
system for determining patient eligibility for Telehealth services. This
system defines remoteness areas based on access to population and
proximity to population centres.

Care recipients of an eligible aged care facility and patients of
eligible Aboriginal Medicare Services or eligible Aboriginal Community
Controlled Health Services will continue to be eligible regardless of
location.'

If caller is satisfied, end, else continue:

Introduction of short initial attendance items script

Any telephone enquiry regarding the introduction of 6 new Medicare
Benefits Schedule (MBS) items which provide for a short, initial
attendance by Telehealth (video conference) by a specialist, consultant
physician, neurosurgeon, consultant occupational physician, pain
medicine and palliative medicine where the service lasts 10 minutes or
less with the patient.

Begin script

'This measure will introduce 6 new MBS Telehealth items for initial
specialist, consultant physician and neurosurgeon, consultant physician,
pain medicine and palliative medicine where service lasts 10 minutes or
less with the patient.

Where an attendance is more than 10 minutes in duration, practitioners
should use existing item numbers consistent with the current
arrangements.

Normal restrictions which apply for initial consultations will also
apply for these items. For example, if a patient has an initial
consultation via Telehealth, they cannot also claim an initial
face-to-face consultation as part of the same course of treatment.

These new items were introduced from 1 January 2013.

The introduction of these new MBS items ensures that MBS funding for
Telehealth consultations appropriately reflects a financial benefit for
the time and complexity of the service being provided.'

If caller is satisfied, end, else continue

'Unfortunately I can't help you any further over the phone, but you may
wish to refer to the updated information on MBS Online.'
