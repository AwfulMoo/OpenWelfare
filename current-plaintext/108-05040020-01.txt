This document outlines the assessment of free board and lodging being
received by customers. If a customer is providing free board and
lodging, there is no effect on their payment (with the exception of
Special Benefit recipients).

Free accommodation

Is free board and lodging considered to be income?

When a person receives free accommodation or free board and lodging, the
value of the accommodation or board and lodging is not income for social
security purposes.

Is a person receiving free board and lodging regarded as paying rent?

If a customer receives free lodging, or free board and lodging, whether
in return for services or not, then the customer is not regarded as
paying rent. However, if it is accepted that amounts for lodging, or
board and lodging, will be paid when Rent Assistance is granted, a
customer will be regarded as paying rent.

If the customer is given the right of occupancy of a property (not being
a life interest or an equity in the property) in return for the payment
of rates, repairs or similar, then the customer may be regarded as
paying rent if both the following are established:

-   they are required to pay regular amounts (usually at least
    quarterly)
-   in the Centrelink's opinion, they should be regarded as paying rent

Special Benefit recipients receiving free board and lodging

Special Benefit recipients receiving free board and lodging will have a
reduced rate of payment. For these customers, free board and lodging is
taken into account when determining the rate of payment of Special
Benefit.
