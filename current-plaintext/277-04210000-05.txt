Privacy

Protect customers' personal information during information gathering
when third parties are contacted to provide information.
Do not reveal or volunteer any information about the customer to any
sources. Accidentally revealing personal information may constitute a
privacy breach and Service Officer must report it to a Team Leader.

When making contact by telephone, Service Officers must:

-   verify who they are speaking to
-   not reveal any personal information to the other person
-   not confirm, deny or comment on any third party questions about the
    customer that would breach that customer's privacy, and
-   confirm any information obtained

See the Australian Privacy Principles.
