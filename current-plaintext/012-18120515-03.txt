Removing a 3GA placement for 19AA only medical practitioners

Table 3. Note: where the removal request lists a specific location/s to
be removed, Service Officers should only remove the 3GA placement from
this location - any other placements should remain as is. A request to
close a location does not remove a 3GA placement from that location.
