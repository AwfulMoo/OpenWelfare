PDF version of Aged Care Funding Instrument (ACFI) â€“ residential aged care services

A PDF version of an Aged Care Funding Instrument (ACFI) for a
residential care recipient is not currently available through the Aged
Care Provider Portal (ACPP) and Aged Care Staff Portal (ACSP).

If a residential aged care service requires a PDF version of a care
recipientâ€™s ACFI, Service Officers are to instruct the aged care service
provider:

-   open the relevant page from the ACFI summary screen for the relevant
    care recipient in ACPP
-   press the control and P buttons on the keyboard (Ctrl + P)
-   under the â€˜printerâ€™ dropdown (for Microsoft Edge) or â€˜destinationâ€™
    dropdown (for Google Chrome, select â€˜save as PDFâ€™
-   select the â€˜saveâ€™ button at the bottom of the popup screen
-   save the relevant page of the ACFI on the desktop or in a folder
    that is easy to access

Repeat the above steps for any other pages of the ACFI and/or for other
care recipients.
