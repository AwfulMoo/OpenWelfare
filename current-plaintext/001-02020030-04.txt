Agreements and arrangements

Services Australia's relationship with other government departments are
bound by a high-level multilateral strategic partnership document and
several detailed Bilateral Management Arrangements (BMA), each between
Services Australia and individual departments.

BMAs specify Commonwealth services to be provided by Services Australia
and conditions applying to the provision of those services. They improve
assurance arrangements to provide greater transparency over Service
Australia performance in meeting service delivery outcomes, risk
management and accuracy targets.

See Government Relations, Information and Analytics Section.
