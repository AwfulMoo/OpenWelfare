This document outlines information on reinstating a Healthcare Provider
Identifier - Organisation (HPI-O) organisation in the Healthcare
Identifiers (HI) Service.

Reinstate HPI-O record

A HPI-O record that has been retired in error can only be reinstated by
a Service Officer.

The HPI-O record to be reinstated must have a current status of
‘Retired’.

If the organisation is a:

-   seed organisation, the Responsible Officer (RO) must request the
    reinstatement of the HPI-O record
-   network organisation, the Organisation Maintenance Officer (OMO)
    must request the reinstatement of the HPI-O record

The reinstated HPI-O record is updated to the status before the
incorrect retirement of either:

-   active
-   deactivated

Any child network organisations that were linked to the reinstated
organisation before retirement must be individually reinstated.

Any RO, OMO, Healthcare Provider Individual (HPI-I) or Contracted
Service Provider (CSP) organisations records linked before the incorrect
retirement are re-linked.

A seed organisation cannot be reinstated if the RO previously linked to
it is now retired.

A network organisation cannot be reinstated if the:

-   seed organisation it was previously linked to is now retired
-   parent organisation it was previously linked (seed or network) to
    has been moved to a different hierarchy (restructured)

When a HPI-O record is reinstated, its entry in the HI Provider
Directory is restored.

Relevant information is automatically sent to the Certificate Issuance
and Management System (CIMS) in order to restore HI Service Public Key
Infrastructure (PKI) certificate permissions.
