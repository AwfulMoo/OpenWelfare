This document outlines information for recording changes to a customer's
work details and issues surrounding this event.

Government intent - Changes that may affect entitlement

Changes in a customer's work activity may affect their entitlement to
receive a payment. For example, if a customer who is receiving JobSeeker
Payment (JSP) commences or returns to employment, this event may have an
effect on the customer’s entitlement to their current allowance amount.

Note: if, in the previous 12 months, a customer has left work or was
terminated from a job, check whether employment income and/or cessation
of employment were previously declared. Where employment income or
cessation of employment has not previously been advised, an Employment
Separation Certificate (SU1) must be requested to ascertain if a failure
needs to be investigated or an income maintenance period should be
applied.
