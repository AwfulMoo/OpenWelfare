This document outlines information required and impacts to income
support payments when there are changes to a customer's work
circumstances.

Government intent - Changes that may affect entitlement

Changes in a customer's work activity may affect their entitlement to
receive a payment. For example, if a customer who is receiving JobSeeker
Payment (JSP) commences or returns to employment, this event may have an
effect on the customer's entitlement to their current income support
payment or amount.

If a customer and/or their partner has left work or was terminated from
a job, check whether employment income was previously declared. Where
employment income was not previously advised, an Employment Separation
Certificate (SU1) must also be requested to ascertain if a failure needs
to be investigated or an income maintenance period should be applied.

Customer's whose employer reports payroll data via Single Touch Payroll
(STP) may have employment data (employer details, employment income and
cessation data) pre-filled when completing statement reporting or
lodging online claims. Customers must check, confirm or change the
pre-filled data for accuracy. If the customer confirms the data, no
verification is required. If the employer reported STP data presents
employment cessation details, and the reason is 'voluntary' or
'dismissal', additional questions are asked of the customer, to
streamline the unemployment failure investigation.
