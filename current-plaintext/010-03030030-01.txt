This document outlines the residence requirements for Assistance for
Isolated Children (AIC) Scheme.

Residence requirements

To qualify for payment under the AIC Scheme, both the applicant and the
student must meet residence requirements. This procedure explains these
requirements and how they are verified.

The approved applicant and student must be either:

-   an Australian citizen, or
-   an Australian permanent resident or
-   a New Zealand citizen permanently settled in Australia who has met
    the required residence (waiting) period. Note: a New Zealand citizen
    does not need to be a protected Special Category Visa (SCV) holder,
    as long as they meet the definition of permanently settled, and meet
    the New Zealand residence (waiting period) rules.

If the applicant and/or student are not Australian citizens, evidence
may need to be provided to confirm they are permanently settled in
Australia.

Applicant temporary absences

The applicant must normally live in Australia, but may be absent
temporarily (for work or holidays) and intend to return to Australia
within two years. The principal family home must be in Australia and
must continue to meet on of the geographical isolation rules (where
applicable).

Student temporary absences

The student must normally be living in Australia during the period of
study. Students may continue to be eligible for payment during temporary
absences overseas, where the student is:

-   participating in an international student exchange, or
-   receiving Distance Education Allowance (DED), and
-   continues to be enrolled in an Australian distance education
    provider, and
-   continues to undertake full time studies, and
-   the student is overseas for less than 12 months

See Eligibility for Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) Scheme
Distance Education Allowance.

International exchange students

Applicants can continue receiving an AIC allowance for a student who is
participating in an international student exchange if the student:

-   remains enrolled at an Australian education institution and the
    overseas study is credited to their Australian studies
-   is continuing to incur the costs in Australia for which the
    allowance is being paid (for example, boarding fees)
-   continues to meet all other eligibility criteria

AIC is not payable for the period of overseas study if a student needs
to repeat all, or part, of that study in Australia.
