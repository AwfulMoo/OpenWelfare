This document outlines information about Indigenous enrolments in
Medicare.

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people

Cultural and other special circumstances for Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander Australians can cause difficulty in identification.
Concessions have been afforded to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
people when enrolling in Medicare when needed.

Enrolment procedures for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people

Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people who cannot produce
identification documents can use the Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander Medicare enrolment and amendment form (MS018). The Resources
page has a link to the form.

Note: an Aboriginal Population Record (APR) is an acceptable identity
document for all Medicare enrolments.

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Medicare enrolment and amendment
form (MS018)

The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Medicare enrolment and
amendment form (MS018) has been specifically designed for, and can only
be used by, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who cannot
provide identification documents.

In these cases, a referee can complete the Proof of Identity section
(Section 2 on the form). A referee can be a:

-   community elder
-   school principal
-   permanent Commonwealth employee with five or more years of
    continuous service

Registering or amending the status of an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person

Initial enrolment

Refer to the standard Medicare enrolment application form or the
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Medicare enrolment and amendment
form (MS018).

Where an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person's status:

-   has been supplied, select appropriate indicator in CDMS
-   has not been supplied, select 'Not stated' in CDMS

Existing enrolment records

The following describes when the status of an Aboriginal or Torres
Strait Islander person must be updated on existing enrolment records:

-   Where the existing record has an Aboriginal or Torres Strait
    Islander status recorded and the form does not include an Aboriginal
    or Torres Strait Islander status, do not update the status
-   Where the existing record has an Aboriginal or Torres Strait
    Islander status recorded and the form includes a different
    Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander status, update record with the
    new status
-   Where the existing record has 'Not stated' for Aboriginal or Torres
    Strait Islander status and the form includes an Aboriginal or Torres
    Strait Islander status update record with the new status

Amend Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander status

This is a mandatory field. In cases where this information is not
available it is necessary to select 'not stated' in the status field.

Where this information is showing as 'not stated', the Service Officer
should ask customers whether they wish to identify their Aboriginal or
Torres Strait Islander status. Service Officers must advise customers
that responding to the question is voluntary and their status can be
updated at any time.

The Resources page contains a link to the voluntary Indigenous
identifier page on the Services Australia website, which contains FAQs
and further information.

The Process page describes how to amend the Aboriginal or Torres Strait
Islander status of a customer.

Voluntary Indigenous identifier

The voluntary Indigenous identifier is used to identify a person as
being of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander origin. The identifier is
specified as a question on all Medicare enrolment forms.

Service Officers must ask customers if they wish to identify their
Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander status when:

-   a new customer registers for Medicare services, or
-   at any touch point when a customer's Indigenous status has not been
    recorded

Service Officers must advise customers that:

-   responding to the question is voluntary
-   for Medicare, recording their status helps the government understand
    Indigenous health issues
-   their Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander status can be updated
    at any time

Note: Service Officers should not ask customers to provide proof of
their Indigenous status.

The voluntary Indigenous identifier is used to:

-   improve service delivery by providing culturally appropriate service
-   enable identification of Medicare usage and patterns of servicing
-   improve Indigenous access to health services
-   monitor and assess effectiveness of Indigenous specific items and
    Medicare initiatives
-   assist in planning and funding to ensure ongoing service improvement

The Resources page contains a link to the voluntary Indigenous
identifier page on the Services Australia website, which contains FAQs
and further information.

Identifier question

The voluntary Indigenous identifier question is included on all Medicare
enrolment forms.

Asking the question is mandatory, however note that responding to the
question by the customer is voluntary.

The following checkboxes are available:

-   Yes - Aboriginal
-   Yes - Torres Strait Islander
-   No

Note: for persons of both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander descent,
both checkboxes are marked 'Yes'.

Indigenous identifier values

If provided, the Indigenous status of a person is recorded on their
enrolment record in the voluntary INDIGENOUS STATUS field, using one of
the following values:

-   1 - Aboriginal
-   2 - Torres Strait Islander
-   3 - Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
-   4 - Non Indigenous
-   9 - Not stated

Remove identifier value

When a person wishes to remove their Indigenous identifier value from
their Medicare enrolment record, Service Officers are to key [9] (Not
stated) in the INDIGENOUS STATUS field.

The Resources page contains a link to contact details for Medicare
Liaison Officers, historical information about the introduction of
voluntary Indigenous identifier, and a link to the Attorney General's
Department website for information on statutory declarations.
