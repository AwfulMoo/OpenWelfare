|                                   | on their expected income from all |

|                                   | the Australian Financial Security |
|                                   | Authority (AFSA). It lists the    |

|                                   | all creditors.                    |

|                                   | Once accepted by AFSA, the debtor |
|                                   | has 28 days relief from recovery. |
|                                   | It gives them time to negotiate   |

|                                   | pending). This gives time for     |
|                                   | AFSA to notify about bankruptcy   |
|                                   |                                   |
