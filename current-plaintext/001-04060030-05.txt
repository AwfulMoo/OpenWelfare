|                                   | Peter cannot be considered to be  |

|                                   | having a dependent child. A       |
|                                   | customer who is in a de facto     |

|                                   | then Peter could be considered    |
|                                   | independent due to being aged     |
|                                   | between 18 and 20 and living away |

|                                   | eligible for independence as she  |
|                                   | was not the natural or adoptive   |
|                                   | parent of Kate.                   |
