This document outlines information on the process of classifying
Medicare images once they have been scanned.

General information

Processing work is scanned into Kofax at the department’s scanning
provider or through Multi-Function Devices (MFD) in Medicare smart
centres, Face to Face service centres and mobile service centres using a
Fuji Xerox IGA interface. This work is then manually categorised and
validated in the Kofax application and sent through to FileNet.
