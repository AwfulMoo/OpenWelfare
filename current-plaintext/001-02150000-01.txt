This document outlines historical information on Community Development
Employment Projects (CDEP). The CDEP Scheme ceased as of 30 June 2015.

Cessation of the CDEP

On 6 December 2014 the Minister for Indigenous Affairs, Senator the Hon.
Nigel Scullion, announced changes to the Remote Jobs and Communities
Programme (RJCP) to be introduced from 1 July 2015. Note: as part of the
Remote Jobs and Communities Programme (RJCP) reform, RJCP was replaced
by the Community Development Program (CDP).

As part of this reform, the CDEP Scheme ceased effective 30 June 2015
(brought forward from 30 June 2017). As a result, CDEP participants lost
eligibility to CDEP wages and the CDEP Participation Supplement (CPS).

CDEP wages

CDEP wages were paid until 30 June 2015 for eligible participants in
Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR) designated
remote servicing regions.

Up until 30 June 2015, eligible CDEP participants in designated remote
servicing regions who were registered in CDEP prior to 1 July 2009
(known as 'CDEP Scheme participants' or CDEP 'grandfathered'
participants) continued to be able to access CDEP wages under the RJCP.
CDEP wages were paid by RJCP providers in return for their participation
in activities under the RJCP.

Outside the designated remote servicing regions, CDEP wages continued to
be paid to eligible participants until 30 June 2014.

Note: as part of the Remote Jobs and Communities Programme (RJCP)
reform, RJCP was replaced by the Community Development Program (CDP).
