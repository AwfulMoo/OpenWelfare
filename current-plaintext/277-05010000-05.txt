|                                   | otherwise specified. Take care    |
|                                   | when there are orders discharging |
|                                   | parts of a number of previous     |

|                                   | For an order to be actioned, it   |

|                                   | where it has been validly made,   |
|                                   | and has not expired or ceased to  |
|                                   | be in force because of the        |
|                                   | happening of some event, such as  |
|                                   | the making of a later order.      |

|                                   | Carefully scrutinise the clauses  |
|                                   | and ensure they are administrable |
|                                   | and clarify any issues before     |
|                                   | actioning the court order. It may |
|                                   | be necessary to advise the        |
|                                   | parties to the order of our       |
|                                   | policy relating to these clauses. |

|                                   | include provision for child       |
