|                                   | is studying an approved           |
|                                   | scholarship course. His RS family |
|                                   | home is located in a regional     |
|                                   | area.                             |

|                                   | Angus will qualify for RS on 23   |
|                                   | November as he will be studying   |
|                                   | for more than 35 calendar days    |
|                                   | from the qualification date (QD). |

|                                   | However, if Angus was studying a  |
|                                   | course with an end date that is   |
|                                   | less than 35 days from 23         |
|                                   | November (e.g. 14 December) Angus |
|                                   | would not qualify for RS.         |

|                                   | from 23 November QD, Angus cannot |
|                                   | qualify for an RS payment again   |
|                                   | within 3 months of the 23         |
|                                   | November QD. This means that      |
|                                   | Angus cannot qualify for RS again |
|                                   | until at least 23 February the    |

|                                   | 2017. After enquiring about the   |
|                                   | RS, it is found the student also  |
|                                   | meets the Unreasonable to Live at |
|                                   | Home (UTLAH) criterion. The       |
|                                   | student may be assessed as UTLAH  |
|                                   | and paid the RS because a person  |
|                                   | who simultaneously meets multiple |
|                                   | independence criteria (except for |
|                                   | independence due to age) can be   |
|                                   | considered independent under the  |
|                                   | criterion that provides the       |
|                                   | greatest benefit.                 |

|                                   | RS it is found the student would  |
|                                   | have been eligible for the        |
|                                   | maximum rate of YA (and RS) under |
|                                   | the Parental Means Test. Because  |
|                                   | the student is independent under  |
|                                   | a non-reviewable (permanent)      |
|                                   | category, they may not be able to |
|                                   | be assessed as dependent and will |
|                                   | not receive the RS. If a student  |

|                                   | under a non-reviewable criterion  |
|                                   | they cannot choose to revert back |
|                                   | to a dependent status.            |

|                                   | eligible on 8 April 2017 and paid |
|                                   | the RS as a result. On 28 June    |
|                                   | 2017, the student gets married    |
|                                   | and can remain eligible for the   |
|                                   | RS if they continue to meet the   |
|                                   | UTLAH eligibility criteria.       |

|                                   | Before 2 December 2017, the RS    |
|                                   | family home for dependent         |
|                                   | students was assessed each year   |
|                                   | for qualification purposes. This  |
|                                   | was later identified as not       |
|                                   | aligning with the intention of    |
|                                   | the legislation and rectified as  |
|                                   | part of the 2 December 2017 ICT   |
|                                   | major release.                    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | To align with legislation, the RS |
|                                   | family home location is only      |
|                                   | assessed once for qualification   |
|                                   | purposes at the time of course    |
|                                   | commencement. A change of RS      |
|                                   | family home in a subsequent year  |
|                                   | of study will only be used to     |
|                                   | determine the rate of RS.         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This change will see some         |
|                                   | students who were not paid RS in  |
|                                   | subsequent year(s) of a course    |
|                                   | being paid RS in 2018 and         |
|                                   | onwards.                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Example: When Nikki commenced a   |
|                                   | course in 2016 Nikki's RS family  |
|                                   | home location was in a non-major  |
|                                   | city location and Nikki was paid  |
|                                   | RS for 2016. As at the 2017       |
|                                   | Qualification Date (QD), Nikkiâ€™s  |
|                                   | RS family home had changed to a   |
|                                   | major city area. This, coupled    |
|                                   | with the fact Nikki was studying  |
|                                   | in a major city location,         |
|                                   | resulted in qualification being   |
|                                   | reassessed and RS not being paid. |
|                                   | However, Nikki can be paid RS at  |
|                                   | QD 2018, due to the fact when     |
|                                   | Nikki commenced Nikki's course,   |
|                                   | the RS family home was in a       |
|                                   | non-major city area and this is   |
|                                   | assessed only once for            |
|                                   | qualification purposes.           |
|                                   | Therefore, Nikki remains          |
|                                   | qualified for RS for the entire   |
|                                   | course duration.                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A change of RS family home        |
|                                   | location in a subsequent year     |
|                                   | will only be used to determine    |
|                                   | the rate of RS. So, if in 2018    |
|                                   | Nikkiâ€™s RS family home and study  |
|                                   | locations are both located in     |
|                                   | major city areas, Nikki will      |
|                                   | receive the â€˜lowerâ€™ rate of RS.   |
|                                   | If in 2018, Nikkiâ€™s RS family     |
|                                   | home location is a non-major city |
|                                   | area, Nikki will receive the      |
|                                   | â€˜regionalâ€™ rate of RS.            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Alternatively, the change means   |
|                                   | some students who were paid RS in |
|                                   | subsequent year(s) of a course    |
|                                   | will not be paid RS in 2018 and   |
|                                   | beyond.                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Example: When Draymond commenced  |
|                                   | his course in 2016 Draymond's RS  |
|                                   | family home and study locations   |
|                                   | were both classed as major city.  |
|                                   | As a result, Draymond did not     |
|                                   | qualify for RS. As at the 2017    |
|                                   | QD, Draymond's RS family home had |
|                                   | changed to a non-major city area  |
|                                   | and the RS family home was        |
|                                   | reassessed for qualification      |
|                                   | purposes. This resulted in        |
|                                   | Draymond being paid RS for 2017.  |
|                                   | As at QD 2018, if Draymond is     |
|                                   | studying in a major city location |
|                                   | Draymond will not be paid RS for  |
|                                   | 2018. This is because Draymond's  |
|                                   | RS family home when Draymond      |
|                                   | started the course was in a major |
|                                   | city area and is assessed only    |
|                                   | once for qualification purposes.  |
|                                   | This is coupled with the fact     |
|                                   | that Draymond's current study     |
|                                   | location is also in a major city  |
|                                   | area. However, if Draymond's      |
|                                   | current study location is in a    |
|                                   | non-major city location Draymond  |
|                                   | may qualify for RS in 2018 if     |
|                                   | verification is provided of the   |
|                                   | study location. This is because   |
|                                   | the study location is still       |
|                                   | reassessed each QD for            |
|                                   | qualification purposes.           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Note: this change was not applied |
|                                   | retrospectively, and as a result, |
|                                   | no debts or arrears apply to      |
|                                   | historical subsequent year RS     |
|                                   | qualification assessments.        |

|                                   |     University and the overseas   |
|                                   |     study will contribute to the  |
|                                   |     Australian qualification. He  |
|                                   |     remains eligible for the away |
|                                   |     from home rate of YA for the  |

|                                   |     Singapore.                    |
|                                   |     Because Singapore does not    |
|                                   |     have any classification under |
|                                   |     the Australian Statistical    |
|                                   |     Geography Standard (ASGS), it |
|                                   |     is not classified as being in |
|                                   |     a 'major city' location. This |
|                                   |     means Milan will be eligible  |
|                                   |     for RS while studying in      |
|                                   |     Singapore.                    |
|                                   |     Because the RS family home is |
|                                   |     in a major city location,     |
|                                   |     Milan will not be eligible    |
|                                   |     for the regional rate of RS   |
|                                   |     and will receive the lower    |
|                                   |     rate of RS                    |

|                                   | Linh is in the second year of a   |
|                                   | Bachelor of Arts at James Cook    |
|                                   | University in Cairns, Queensland  |
|                                   | in 2018. Linh's parents live in   |
|                                   | Canada but Linh is an Australian  |
|                                   | resident. Linh qualifies for the  |
|                                   | away from home rate of YA. As the |
|                                   | study location (Cairns) is not    |
|                                   | classified as a major city        |
|                                   | location, Linh qualifies for RS   |
|                                   | in 2018. As the RS family home is |
|                                   | in Canada, it is not classified   |
|                                   | as inner regional, outer          |
|                                   | regional, remote or very remote   |
|                                   | Australia. Therefore, Linh is not |
|                                   | entitled to the regional rate of  |
|                                   | RS that applies to students from  |
|                                   | regional areas.                   |
