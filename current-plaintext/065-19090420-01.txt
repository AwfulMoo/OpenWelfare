This document outlines information on identifying and remediating
multiple or intertwined aged care records.

Historical SPARC process

The System for the Payment of Aged Residential Care (SPARC) is the
legacy aged care payment system for residential care. SPARC is a view
only system from 20 August 2022.

To view the legacy SPARC process, see the historical version.

Multiple records

Multiple aged care records occur when:

-   a care recipient already has a record, and
-   a new record for that care recipient is incorrectly created

Intertwined records

Intertwined records occur when the information belonging to one customer
is incorrectly placed on the record of another customer.

Intertwining often occurs when:

-   the records have the same or similar names and/or dates of birth,
    and/or
-   an incorrect customer's record is selected and updated

Remediation

Where multiple or intertwined aged care records exist, the correct
master record is determined and linked to all multiple records
identified.

Remediation is required to transfer all linked identification numbers,
including:

-   Centrelink customer reference numbers (CRN)
-   DVA unique identification numbers (UIN)
-   care recipient IDs, and
-   any means assessment data to the master record

The Aged Care Programmes Branch completes the transfer of approvals
(aged care assessment team (ACAT) and National Screening and Assessment
Form), Home Care Package ID, entry and associated leave and departure
events.

Further remediation may be required if:

-   a care recipient has commenced home or residential care
-   a means assessment is completed or currently in progress

The hierarchy for determining the master aged care record is:

-   ACAT ID and Package ID (with Entry Date)
-   CRN/DVA UIN
-   Care recipient ID
-   ACAT ID and Package ID (with no Entry Date)
-   ACAT ID only
-   No data

The Resources page contains email templates, task cards and contact
details.
