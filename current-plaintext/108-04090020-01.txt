This document outlines characteristics of a managed investment. It
explains how to record managed investments owned by a customer, or an
entity such as a private trust or private company.

Investment changes and customer's notification requirements

Unitised managed investment prices are automatically revalued every 6
months in March and September.

Customers must be advised they need to notify changes to the:

-   number of units they own
-   value of their account-based managed investment(s)
-   balance of their margin loan(s), or
-   changes in the investments held within a Personal Investment Fund
    portfolio or Master Trust

From 6 March 2010 all listed property trusts on an Australian stock
exchange are updated. See Updating shares and securities.

From December 2015, all timeshare investments are treated as managed
investments.

If there is a small change to asset values check if the customer needs
to notify.

The Resources page contains links to the Financial Industry and Network
Support (FINS) Bulletin and Shares Bulletin, and the form needed for CAO
assessment of managed investments held in trust for another person.
