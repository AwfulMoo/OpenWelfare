-   3.5.3, Payments that exclude eligibility

If a student is in primary, secondary or ungraded level studies

Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) Scheme is payable if they are
under 19 years on 1 January in the year of study.

Note: the maximum age limit may be extended by one year (to under 20
years as at 1 January) for students undertaking primary, secondary or
ungraded level studies if the student's progress through school has been
delayed by special circumstances, such as illness, English language
difficulties, transfer from a different education system or periods of
employment or training.

However, if students receive a Disability Support Pension (DSP) or
Parenting Payment single (PPS) and are studying full-time at primary or
equivalent ungraded level, they may receive the Pensioner Education
Supplement (PES) under AIC until they turn 21 years of age.

If students are tertiary students

They can be eligible for payment of AIC until they have met the minimum
age at which the state or territory requires them to participate in
education.
