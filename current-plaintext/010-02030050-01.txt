This document outlines how to determine eligibility for the ABSTUDY
Schooling A Award. To be eligible for the ABSTUDY Schooling A Award, the
student must meet the general ABSTUDY eligibility criteria. They must
also satisfy specific criteria for age, study, living with parents (or
in State Care) and residence.

Eligibility requirements for the ABSTUDY Schooling A Award

Once meeting the general ABSTUDY eligibility criteria, the student is
eligible for the ABSTUDY Schooling A Award if they:

-   are 15 years or younger and either living at home, or not approved
    for the living away from home or independent rates, and are studying
    a full-time secondary level course, or
-   are 15 years or younger and in State Care, and do not meet the
    criteria for away from home entitlements, and are studying a
    full-time secondary level course, or
-   are a full-time primary school student and 14 years of age or more
    at 1 January in the year of study, and living at home

A student must continue to study full-time in their approved course to
remain eligible for assistance under the ABSTUDY Schooling A Award
unless they meet the eligibility criteria for either a two-thirds study
load concession, a disability study load concession, or a pensioner
study load concession.

Applicants for the Schooling A Award Payment

For Schooling A Award the parent/guardian is the applicant for the
payment. There may also be cases where students in State Care are placed
directly into the care of a Boarding School or Hostel. When this does
occur an organisation can be an applicant under ABSTUDY Policy 6.1.2 and
an officer of that organisation should be able to sign the form. For
further information see ABSTUDY customers in State care.

Allowances and Benefits under the ABSTUDY Schooling A Award

A student approved for Schooling A Award may qualify for the following
benefits:

-   School Term Allowance
-   School Fees Allowance
-   Away from Base assistance with travel, meals and accommodation for
    distance education/correspondence students to attend residential
    schools

Note: some students on Schooling A Award can access School Fees
Allowance Group 2 where they would have otherwise met a criterion for
the away rate but for the presence of a local non-government school
which the student attends, instead of boarding away from home.
