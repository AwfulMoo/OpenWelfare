CCS percentages based on family income

Table 1: this table shows the Child Care Subsidy percentage a family is
entitled to received, based on their combined family income.

^ Income brackets are subject to CPI at the beginning of each financial
year.

These amounts may not be current. They are examples only. For current
payments, see Rates and thresholds.

The above percentages are Standard Rates. From 7 March 2022, families
with multiple children in care aged 5 or under may receive an increased
CCS rate up to 30% higher for eligible children, capped at 95%. This is
known as Multiple Child Subsidy.

Customers can still claim CCS even if their family income estimate is
equal to or above the higher income limit, only if they actually intend
to use child care. If their ATI ends up being under the higher income
limit, the subsidy they are entitled to receive is paid at
reconciliation.

Information for previous years is available on the Child Care Subsidy -
income thresholds, annual subsidy cap and hour rate page.

Higher rate of CCS - Multiple Child Subsidy

Table 2: this table shows examples of how the higher rate of CCS
(Multiple Child Subsidy) applies.

|                                   |     is because the CCS is capped  |

Subsidised hours of child care based on activity

Table 3: this table shows the maximum number of subsidised hours of
child care a customer is entitled to receive in a CCS fortnight, based
on their hours of activity.

Note: the table does not take into account any automatic Activity Test
results or Activity Test exemptions that may apply.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Hours of recognised activity per  | Maximum number of hours of        |
| fortnight                         | subsidised child care per CCS     |

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| More than 16 hours to 48 hours    | 72 hours                          |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| More than 48 hours                | 100 hours                         |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Note: where a customer is partnered, the number of subsidised hours is
based on the person with the lowest Activity Test result.

Subsidy) assessments for combined families.

|                                   |     five, and                     |

|                                   | of them would be eligible for     |
|                                   | higher CCS (multiple child        |
|                                   | subsidy) from the 7 March 2022    |

|                                   | be recognised by the system as a  |
|                                   | combined family. Robby the five   |
|                                   | year old would be identified as   |
|                                   | the Standard Rate Child so        |
|                                   | Robby's CCS% would stay at the    |
|                                   | same income-tested rate.          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Mindy would become a Higher Rate  |
|                                   | Child and would become entitled   |
|                                   | to the Standard Rate + 30%        |
|                                   | (capped at 95%). The date of      |
|                                   | effect for this increase would be |
|                                   | 7 March 2022, so any arrears      |
|                                   | owing from this date will be paid |
|                                   | to Carla in July.                 |

|                                   | If Mick and Carla do not want to  |
|                                   | wait for the arrears in July,     |
|                                   | they may access the increase      |
|                                   | earlier by having one parent      |
