|                                   | to lodge tax returns because      |

|                                   | This would allow Pamela’s CCS     |

|                                   | Pamela would not receive any CCS  |

Scenario: Annual cap

|                                   | $280,000. Therefore, during the   |
|                                   | 2021-22 CCS year they were        |
|                                   | subject to the annual cap. As     |

|                                   | regularly attend childcare, they  |
|                                   | reach the annual cap on 7 October |
|                                   | 2021 and are required to pay full |
|                                   | childcare fees from this date. On |
|                                   | 10 December 2021, the annual cap  |
|                                   | was removed for the full          |

|                                   | entitlement they were owed for    |
|                                   | the period 7 October to 10        |
|                                   | December 2021. They will receive  |
|                                   | this arrears payment              |
|                                   | automatically in December 2021.   |

|                                   | pushing the family’s income over  |
|                                   | the annual cap threshold for      |
|                                   | periods when they were together.  |
|                                   | But for periods where Allan was   |
|                                   | single, Allan is below the cap.   |

|                                   | cap threshold during their        |
|                                   | partnered period, any CCS         |

|                                   | during the partnered period is    |
|                                   | raised as a debt.                 |

|                                   | For the period after where        |
|                                   | Allan’s income was under the      |
|                                   | annual cap threshold, Allan can   |
|                                   | continue to receive CCS even when |
|                                   | the total amount received in the  |
|                                   | year exceeds the annual cap. This |
|                                   | is because Allan's individual     |
|                                   | income is under the annual cap    |
|                                   | income limit. Allan is only       |
|                                   | subject to assessment on his own  |
|                                   | income during single periods and  |
|                                   | is therefore entitled to the CCS  |
|                                   | received.                         |
