This document outlines information on when and how debts can be raising
debts when a customer has not providing a Tax File Number (TFN).

TFN requirements

Services Australia may request customers provide a tax file number (TFN)
for themselves and any relevant third party under the Social Security
(Administration) Act 1999. The customer will have 28 days in which to
provide these details. This period is the TFN grace period.

If a customer fails to provide the TFN within the grace period, their
payment will cancel on day 29.

Debts resulting from a failure to provide a TFN

If a customer has not provided their TFN a debt results for the payments
received after day 29. Do not raise debts for payments received within
the TFN grace period.

When the customer provides a TFN within 13 weeks of cancellation,
restore the payment and remove the debt.

The References page contains more information about recoverable debts if
no TFN is provided. This includes both the customer and their partner if
they have one.
