Cessation of the IWS

From 1 July 2015, the Indigenous Wage Subsidy (formerly administered by
the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet) is no longer available
as a discrete program. However, wage subsidies and other support for
employers of Indigenous job seekers will still be available.

The Resources page contains a link to information on the Department of
Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR) website about ongoing wage
subsidies and support for Indigenous job seekers.
