This document outlines the procedures for the treatment of Home Equity
Conversion loans (HEC) under the Income and the Assets tests.

Information on HEC

A Home Equity Conversion (HEC) loan agreement is a mechanism which
allows a homeowner to convert all or part of the equity locked up in
their home into cash or a stream of income. A key feature of a home
equity conversion agreement is that the loan (including interest) is
generally not repayable until the homeowner moves out of their home or
dies.

From 23 September 1999, HEC loans are no longer assessed under the
income test.

Customers with a HEC arrangement are still considered to be homeowners
for assessment purposes.

HEC loans are currently not available through the Services Australia.
