This document outlines information about how the notice of charge (NOC)
or notice of past benefits (NOPB) can be amended when disputed by the
injured person or compensation payer relating to Medicare Compensation
Recovery.

Extension of time to return a statement by claimant

An extension of time to return the statement by claimant (SBC) may be
granted if received before the due date on the statement. Requests
received after the due date must be rejected.

An extension request must be made in writing or via telephone by the:

-   injured person or claimant
-   authorised legal representative appointed to act on the injured
    person’s behalf (such as a Court Order, Power of Attorney or
    Executor), or
-   authorised third party (including a solicitor or an individual who
    is being authorised to act on behalf of the injured person, claimant
    or legal representative)

Services Australia will issue an Extension of period to give a statement
granted/refused letter (Z2804) when a decision has been made or when a
decision is internally reviewed.

Note: an extension may be granted by the agency even if a request was
not made. For example, if correspondence was unclaimed and returned to
the agency but the postal address was correct, it may be resent and an
extension granted as if the notice was issued today.

Granting an extension

An extension may be made for 28 days from the date the SBC was due.
Generally no more than 2 extensions of time will be granted. This
practice ensures that no more than 3 months of services after the date
of injury may be 'missed' when a Notice of past benefits (NOPB) is
issued. Each case is assessed independently.

An extension may be granted when a case has:

Not settled

-   the agency may grant an additional 28 days to return the Medicare
    history statement if the request is received before the current due
    date

Settled, and the compensation payer has chosen to make an advance
payment

-   an extension can be granted where the request is made within 12
    months of the original due date
-   for a period of up to 12 months

Requests for second or subsequent extensions must be escalated to
Programme Management.

See Escalations and case notes for more information on escalating claims
to Programme Management.

Do not grant an extension if:

-   The due date on the notice to claimant has passed
-   A claim has settled but no advance payment money has been received
    by the agency
-   Supporting documents such as a Last Will and Testament are missing,
    or
-   The claim has reached settlement and the Section 33D date has passed

See Process for steps on how to grant or refuse an extension request.

Notice of refusal

The decision to refuse to issue a new notice of past benefits or notice
of charge can be made by an APS3 (or above) under section 18 and 21 of
the Act.

A Notice of refusal Z2806 letter will be issued by an APS3 when:

-   A request to issue an notice of past benefits (NOPB) is received
    while there is already a valid NOPB on file
-   A statement by claimant is returned late and a valid ‘all services
    included’ NOPB is on file
-   Claimant has submitted a statement by claimant to amend the notice
    of charge or notice of past benefits – advance payment without
    sufficient evidence. This may apply to previously verified medical
    services or care costs
-   A request to amend a Notice of charge – all services included was
    received after 2 years from the date of judgment or settlement

See Resource for more information about reasons for issuing a notice of
refusal.

Review of decisions

In some circumstances the injured person, claimant or authorised third
party may apply for an internal review of a decision. A valid review
request must be made:

-   within 28 days of notification of the decision, and
-   in writing

The agency must reconsider the decision and make a determination to
affirm, vary or substitute the original decision within 28 days of
receiving the application.

Review of decision – Extensions

If the injured person, claimant or authorised third party does not agree
with the decision, they can ask for an internal review of that decision.
The application for an internal review may be due to:

-   the agency denying an extension, or
-   the claimant not being satisfied with the length of the extension
    period

An internal review of a decision must be completed by an APS4 (or above)
who did not make the primary decision. The reviewer must reconsider the
decision and make a determination to:

-   affirm the original decision
-   substitute the original decision with a new decision, or
-   vary the original decision with a longer due date

The reviewer will consider if processes and policies were correctly
applied in the original decision.

Once a decision has been made, the reviewer will process accordingly in
MCRS and issue an Extension – Review of decision Z2804 letter.

See Process for steps on how to review an extension decision.

Review of decision – Notice of refusal

The only refusal decision that contains review rights is where the
injured person/claimant/authorised third party did not lodge a request
to amend an ‘all services included’ NOC within 2 years.

As the 2 years is the maximum timeframe under legislation, this decision
will not be overturned on review unless the details of the claim led to
an incorrect decision being made. For example, an error was made on the
original decision.

When a decision is being reconsidered, the Service Officer who made the
initial decision cannot complete the reconsideration. The delegation to
do so is with an APS5 (or above).

A reconsideration of decision letter (Z2806) will be issued when all the
relevant evidence has been considered and an outcome reached. If the
decision is to accept the evidence and vary the original decision the
APS5 (or above) will need to re-process the statement by claimant.

If the claimant is unsatisfied with the reconsideration, they have the
right to apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) for a
review. This will be communicated via the reconsideration of decision
letter.

Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT)

Role of the AAT

The AAT provides an independent review on a range of administrative
decisions made by:

-   government departments
-   agencies, and
-   some non-government bodies

The AAT will only review a decision after the agency has completed an
internal review.

When an injured person or claimant disagrees with a decision

An injured person, claimant or authorised third party may disagree with
a decision about the reconsideration of refusal to issue a notice under
section 18.

In these cases, they may apply to the AAT for a ruling review. In
accordance with Section 27A of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act
1975, notice of a person’s right to have the decision reviewed is
included in the relevant letters.

Note: AAT reviews may incur an application fee.

Receiving notification of an AAT appeal

If a request is received about an AAT appeal:

-   escalate notification of an AAT appeal to Programme Management
-   include all documentation and previous decisions made about the
    disputed claim

Programme Management will send the required documents to the AAT. See
Escalations and case notes for more information on escalating these
cases to Programme management.

Formal AAT decisions

When an AAT decision is made in favour of the:

-   agency, the compensation claim will proceed and money will be
    recovered in accordance with that decision
-   injured person or claimant, the agency is bound by the terms of the
    decision and will proceed accordingly

Charges for lodging an application

The AAT will:

-   inform the injured person or claimant of any fees associated with
    lodging an application, or
-   if the injured person or claimant is exempt from paying any such
    fees

Contacting the AAT

The AAT website has the contact details for each State and Territory.

See Resources for a link to the AAT website.

Amended Notices

An amended NOCH or NOPB can be considered in certain circumstances.
Criteria for review will depend on whether the:

claim is pre or post settlement

notice is verified or all services included

notice was valid or expired at the date of:

-   review request, or
-   judgment or settlement (DOJS)

General circumstances for review of a notice include:

-   there is an identified processing error and services or costs have
    been incorrectly included
-   in response to a request from the compensation payer when they have
    already paid the account
-   a care cost amount (in full or in part) does not relate to the
    compensable injury or illness. Medical evidence is required to
    remove previously identified care costs and must be escalated to
    Programme Management
-   some or all of the identified services do not relate to the
    compensable injury or illness

Removing previously verified services

Where a request is received to amend a NOC or NOPB by processing a new
statement by claimant to remove previously verified services, the
statement must be clear. Either:

-   the services to be removed are ticked no, crossed out or have a line
    through them
-   some of the previously verified services are re-ticked ‘yes’ or
    ‘no’, or
-   it has a comment beside the service indicating it does not relate

Note: initials are not required when services are to be removed.

See Resources for more information about circumstances, evidence and
delegation to approve amendments.
