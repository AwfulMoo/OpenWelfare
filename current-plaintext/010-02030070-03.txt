|                                   |     at a later date, and          |
|                                   | -   the secondary school the      |
|                                   |     student has enrolled in, or   |

|                                   | and primary study will meet these |

|                                   | even though they are enrolled in  |

|                                   | home rate in this circumstance is |
|                                   | a letter from the new school      |
|                                   | stating that the student:         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   has been assessed as required |
|                                   |     to repeat the final year of   |
|                                   |     primary study to transition   |
|                                   |     to secondary study at a later |
|                                   |     date, and                     |
|                                   | -   the student is now enrolled   |
|                                   |     in primary level study        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The school does not need to       |
|                                   | advise the reasons why it has     |
|                                   | assessed the student as requiring |
|                                   | to repeat the last year of        |
|                                   | primary school. It does not       |
|                                   | matter which primary school the   |
|                                   | student attended before or if the |
|                                   | student passed or failed the      |
|                                   | previous attempt at primary       |
|                                   | study.                            |

|                                   | The main thing is that the new    |
|                                   | school needs them to repeat the   |
|                                   | final primary year to             |
|                                   | successfully progress to          |
|                                   | secondary level study at that     |
|                                   | school.                           |
