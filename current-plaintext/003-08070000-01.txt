This document outlines processes for reviewing entitlement to SpB for
all customers. These are 13 weekly reviews. Reviews are only processed
by SpB processing teams.

Purpose

The review process is to:

-   assess the customer's ongoing eligibility for SpB
-   make sure SpB is still the correct payment for the customer

Consider the customer

When completing these reviews, SpB Service Officers should consider the
following:

-   SpB is paid to customers who can be vulnerable and unable to receive
    any other income support. So it is important to take appropriate
    care and consideration and use discretion
-   If the customer is likely to stay entitled to SpB, take reasonable
    steps to avoid the customer having their payment cancelled and later
    restored
-   Accept the information the customer has declared or provided and
    process the review. This is preferable to putting the review on
    hold. Holding the review can lead to the customer's payment
    cancelling and needing to be restored

13 week reviews

The system will notify and remind customers of the need to complete
these reviews.

Customers can complete the review online or by completing the Special
Benefit review form (BC048).

The focus of the review is to confirm future entitlement to SpB:

-   SpB cannot be paid if another income support payment is payable. The
    conditions under which SpB is paid are more restrictive than other
    payments. It is not in the customer's best interest to get SpB if
    they can get another payment
-   The customer (and their partner) must continue to meet the hardship
    provisions for the payment

Manage risk when considering what information to request.

Customers may be considered:

-   low risk if their available funds are regularly below the available
    funds limit ($5,000) and they have no other income likely to put
    them over the limit. Staff can use discretion and complete the
    review using the information provided. Another example could be an
    Australian Citizen Child customer aged 0-5 years
-   high risk if their available funds are close to the limit or they
    have other income. Bank statements may be needed showing
    transactions for the last 13 weeks. But they may not be needed at
    every 13 week review. Staff must use discretion and consider each
    review based on the SpB category. The Resources page has examples

As part of the review, confirm if the customer is subject to mutual
obligation requirements for SpB and check their Employment Service
Provider registration.

Customer contacts or lodges review form

Service Officers can:

-   help the customer or their nominee complete the review online or
    complete the review form
-   re-issue the review form if necessary
-   check and scan review forms and supporting documents lodged by the
    customer or their nominee

For all other queries and updates related to the review, create an open

The Resources page has letter templates, examples to help staff identify
the level of risk, and links to the Policy Helpdesk and the review form.
