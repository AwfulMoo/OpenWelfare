Alternative Identity Assessment Questions

To authenticate a Medicare record, the system must confirm the following
information:

-   Full name
-   Date of birth

The Service Officer should have the caller answer any 4 questions from
the following list:

Can you please confirm your current address (as listed with Medicare)?

Can you please confirm your previous address (as listed with Medicare)?
Previous address can be accepted as the current CDMS address. This will
count as one correct answer

What is your Medicare card number and expiry date?

-   If the card is expired, the previous card number and the expiry date
    can be accepted as correct answer unless the previous card was
    reported lost or stolen

What is your partner’s full name and date of birth on the Medicare card?

What is your child/children’s name and date of birth on Medicare card?

What phone number do you have stored with Medicare?

Do you have Bank Details stored with Medicare? If so, please provide
bank details, e.g. BSB and account number

Do you have an email address stored with Medicare and what is it?

Have you been listed on a different Medicare card previously?

-   If yes, can you list the full names of another people enrolled on
    that card?

Have you been known by any other name(s) e.g. name at birth, name before
marriage, previous married name?

What is the name of a Medical practitioner you have attended in the last
6 months?

-   If there is no history and the customer states that they have not
    been to a doctor in the last 6 months, this is will count as one
    correct answer

What is the name of the last medical practice you attended?

-   This is evident on claims history

What is the location or address of the last medical practice you
attended?

What was the date of the last service you received with a Medical
practitioner?

What was the total cost of your last visit to a Medical practice (before
Medicare benefit)?

If customer is born overseas, correct answer to the following question
may be accepted:

-   Country of birth
-   Month/year of moving to Australia

If unable to be authenticated, go to the Unsuccessful authentication of
a Medicare record table in Perform public security check for Medicare.

The alternative identity must only be used for the vulnerable customers
where customers are unable to provide the identity documents due to the
genuine reason. The normal identity requirements must apply to the
customers who do not fall into this category.

Service Officers should select questions that fit the customer’s
circumstances. For example, if customer is the only person on the card
then questions like partner or children’s name must not be asked.

Transfer/copy a person or child to a new Medicare card - My Health Record script

Table 1: This table provides the script to follow when an individual
requests to have themselves and/or a child/ren transferred or copied to
a new or existing Medicare card. The scripts are designed to remind
individuals to consider their My Health Record when family circumstances
change.

|                                   | For example, a child originally   |

|                                   | on the card they transfer to. For |

|                                   | cards. For example, a parent or a |

|                                   | someone to their card online. If  |
|                                   | the link isn’t on your screen,    |

|                                   | Service Officers: Check the       |
|                                   | customer’s circumstances against  |

| 2                                 | Question: Do I need consent to    |
|                                   | invite someone to my card?        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: Yes. You can get consent  |
|                                   | by simply having a conversation   |
|                                   | with the person you want to       |
|                                   | invite. You’ll also need their    |
|                                   | consent to provide their Medicare |
|                                   | card details and date of birth    |
|                                   | online.                           |

| 3                                 | Question: How many people can I   |
|                                   | invite?                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: There’s no limit on the   |
|                                   | number of people you can invite   |
|                                   | but you can only have 9 people.   |
|                                   | This includes people currently or |
|                                   | previously on your card. If       |
|                                   | someone enters an invite code     |
|                                   | you’ve given to them and your     |
|                                   | card exceeds 9 people, they’ll    |
|                                   | see an error message.             |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 4                                 | Question: Can I give the same     |
|                                   | invite code to multiple people?   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: No. Invite codes are      |
|                                   | assigned to one person only. If   |
|                                   | someone tries to redeem an invite |
|                                   | code that isn’t assigned to them, |
|                                   | they’ll see an error message.     |

| 5                                 | Question: Why isn’t the invite    |
|                                   | code sent automatically to the    |
|                                   | person I’m inviting?              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: We don’t send invite      |
|                                   | codes to people to protect their  |
|                                   | privacy. Inviting and accepting   |
|                                   | an invite should be a mutual      |
|                                   | agreement between 2 people known  |
|                                   | to each other. Before you invite  |
|                                   | someone to your card, you will    |
|                                   | need their consent.               |

|                                   | Answer: An invite code expires    |
|                                   | after 7 days. If you don’t redeem |
|                                   | the invite code for any reason,   |
|                                   | we won’t add you to the Medicare  |
|                                   | card. We won’t notify the person  |

|                                   | but the app tells them the invite |
|                                   | can’t be completed online. What   |
|                                   | can I do?                         |

|                                   | Answer: The app checks your       |
|                                   | eligibility to be invited online. |
|                                   | If the invite can’t be completed  |
|                                   | online, you’ll need to complete   |

|                                   | customer’s circumstances against  |
|                                   | the eligibility criteria, then    |

|                                   | appropriate. For example, if the  |
|                                   | only reason for ineligibility is  |
|                                   | being active on 2 cards, they may |
|                                   | want to end their association on  |
|                                   | one. When the customer is only    |
|                                   | active on one card, the other     |
|                                   | person will be able to create an  |
