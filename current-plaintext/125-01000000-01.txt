This document outlines information relating to initial contact and
identification of services for Indigenous Australians.

Government intent

Customers who contact Services Australia may be facing situations where
they need extra assistance. The Service Officer by employing appropriate
questioning techniques encourages the customer to fully explain their
situation. This will assist in establishing what services would best
suit the customer's circumstances. The Service Officer identifies an
appropriate referral to the specialist officer.

There are two types of Indigenous specialist officers each having a
specific role in helping Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
customers.

Methods of initial contact

When a customer first contacts Services Australia and enquires about
certain payments and services, the Service Officer runs the First
Contact Service Offer (FCSO) workflow which guides the screening
process.

The focus is on identifying the customer's readiness, capability and
capacity to look for and accept work and highlights the important issues
that need consideration.

A customer may make an initial contact in writing, face-to-face or by
phone.

Identification of services

The Service Officer identifies if a referral is appropriate to the
specialist officer. Specialist Officers often act as a link between
Services Australia and the many community based support services
available to people requiring extra assistance and support.
