|                                   | A carer provides care on Tuesday  |
|                                   | morning and the care receiver     |
|                                   | enters respite that same day.     |
|                                   | They provide care again on the    |
|                                   | Friday afternoon that the care    |
|                                   | receiver returns home from        |
|                                   | respite. This would result in a   |
|                                   | total of 2 TCC (respite) dates    |
|                                   | being coded. The start date is    |
|                                   | Wednesday and the end date is     |
|                                   | Thursday.                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This is because the carer is      |
|                                   | taken to have provided care on    |
|                                   | the Tuesday and again on the      |
|                                   | Friday. There are only 2 full 24  |
|                                   | hour periods from midnight to     |
|                                   | midnight that the care receiver   |
|                                   | was absent.                       |

|                                   | Louise has 5 TCC days remaining   |
|                                   | in July when Michael leaves       |
|                                   | Louise's care.                    |

|                                   | Louise then cares for Michael's   |
|                                   | brother Jon in September. The     |
|                                   | system will not allocate 63 TCC   |
|                                   | days for Jon, but will instead    |
|                                   | allocate Michael's 5 remaining    |
|                                   | TCC days to Jon. If Louise        |
|                                   | requires respite for 6 days, the  |
|                                   | payment for Jon will cancel.      |
|                                   | Louise is, however, entitled to   |
|                                   | 63 TCC days for Jon, as Jon is a  |
|                                   | new care receiver.                |
