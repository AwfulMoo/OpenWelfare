This document outlines information that staff should discuss with a
Centrelink customer when a new CRN is requested.

New CRN request

Centrelink customers may request a new CRN due to concerns for their
privacy or safety. Advise the customer there is little or no advantage
in creating a new or multiple record as these records will be linked and
this creates the following problems:

-   information will be transferred from one record to the other
-   fragmented data across 2 records
-   potential consequences for interacting with other agencies, such as
    ATO

Reassure the customer that:

-   an authentication process occurs at every contact
-   every access to their record is logged by the Customer Record Access
    Monitor (CRAM)

Advise the customer of security options such as:

-   adding a password to their Centrelink record
-   enabling extra security options for a myGov account
-   Restricted Access record

Protecting your privacy

If a customer believes their personal information and identity
credentials may be at risk, advise them to contact the Scams and
Identity Theft helpdesk.

The Resources page contains links to contact details for the Witness
Protection help line and Identity Security and Verifications Section.
