|                                   | undertake the birth for a         |
|                                   | privately admitted patient of a   |

|                                   | Items 16590 and 16591 cannot both |
|                                   | be claimed for the same           |

| 3                                 | Question: What is the difference  |
|                                   | between a participating midwife   |
|                                   | and a practicing midwife working  |
|                                   | on behalf of a GP (that means the |
|                                   | GP bills for this service)?       |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | A practicing midwife may perform  |
|                                   | services on behalf of, or under   |
|                                   | the supervision of an eligible    |

| 4                                 | Question: Are Medicare benefits   |
|                                   | for obstetric services only       |
|                                   | payable for females?              |

|                                   | Answer: No. Obstetric items are   |

|                                   | sex/gender. However, a medical    |
|                                   | practitioner must determine       |
|                                   | whether their patient has the     |
|                                   | requisite anatomical feature to   |
|                                   | perform a particular Medicare     |
|                                   | service or procedure.             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | It is the responsibility of the   |
|                                   | treating practitioner to ensure   |
|                                   | that any service billed to        |
|                                   | Medicare meets the item           |
|                                   | descriptor in the MBS and any     |
|                                   | eligibility requirements in full. |

|                                   | This aims to ensure:              |
