This page contains conversation guides to assist Service Officers to
discuss the estimate process with customers. This includes assisting the
customer to decide if an estimate is the best option, discussing the
estimate processes and provisions, ensuring the estimate is and will
remain accurate, and provides answers to the more difficult questions
that customers may pose about components of the estimate.

|                                   | The purpose of this process is to |
|                                   | assist the customer to decide if  |
|                                   | an estimate is the best option in |
|                                   | their circumstances. It contains  |
|                                   | examples of how you can explain   |
|                                   | each point to the customer. This  |
|                                   | is a conversation guide only.     |

|                                   | conversation more natural. The    |
|                                   | most important thing is that the  |
|                                   | customer hears and understands    |
|                                   | the core technical information    |
|                                   | and the impacts associated with   |
