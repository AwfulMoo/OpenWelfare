This document explains how to report welfare, health, child support and
child care provider fraud and corruption.

Definition of Fraud

The Commonwealth Fraud Control Framework 2017 defines fraud as
'dishonestly obtaining a benefit, or causing a loss by deception or
other means'.

Definition of Corruption

The Commonwealth Fraud Control Framework 2017 defines corruption as 'the
abuse of public office for private gain'.

Corrupt activities within the agency may take the form of:

-   abuse of confidential or personal information for benefit
-   undeclared /unmanaged conflicts of interest—for example in
    procurement activities
-   payment or acceptance of a bribe to forego duties or obligations,
    show favouritism, or influence a process or decision, such as
    approving fraudulent claims for services
-   accessing agency systems and information for personal benefit, which
    may be as simple as gratification or more sinister, such as to
    control, threaten or manipulate a situation or person; and
-   a manager using their position of authority to influence the
    decision-making of a subordinate for personal benefit or to the
    benefit of another

Suspected fraud and corruption identified by staff

If a staff member identifies fraud and corruption, they must report it.
For the relevant process see:

-   Welfare
-   Health
-   Child Support

Note: check that the customer is receiving their correct rate of payment
when reporting suspected fraud and corruption.

See the Resources page for website and contact details.

Send any emails, photographs or other documents provided by a member of
the public to the Tip-off Operations team for processing and information
storage. See Documents on the Process page for the relevant programme.

Suspected internal fraud and corruption

The Report suspected fraud and corruption system can be used to report
suspected fraud and corruption by a staff member as a customer. For
internal fraud and corruption you can also:

-   phone the Internal Fraud Hotline, or
-   email the Internal Fraud positional mailbox

The internal fraud hotline and positional mailbox are for internal use
only - not to be provided to customers. See the Resources page for
website and contact details.

Privacy issues to be aware of when reporting suspected fraud and corruption

Reporting fraud and corruption against Services Australia:

-   Staff working in the Child Support, Centrelink or Medicare
    programmes can report suspected fraud and corruption across any of
    the agency's programmes
-   Include any information relevant to the suspected fraud and
    corruption in the report

Important points when reporting suspected fraud and corruption:

-   Staff reporting suspected fraud and corruption on behalf of an
    individual or third party must not access the records of the person
    the report is being made against
-   Staff that report suspected fraud discovered as part of their
    regular duties should not investigate, or access the record any
    further than is needed to complete their regular duties
-   When reporting suspected fraud and corruption do not search the
    system for customer information in order to complete the report
-   Because of the strict confidentiality provisions in the Acts under
    which the agency operates, timeframes, progress and outcomes of
    suspected fraud and corruption reports are never provided

Refer to the References page for the Australian Privacy Principles
(APP), the Privacy Act 1998, and the relevant secrecy provisions that
outline the privacy requirements relating to reporting suspected fraud
and corruption.
