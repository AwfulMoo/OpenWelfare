This document outlines information about Community Engagement Officers
and the Community Engagement Officer Programme, which are part of the
Community Outreach Specialist Programmes (COSP).

Community Engagement Officer (CEO) Programme

The CEO Programme delivers services outside the service centre
environment to people experiencing vulnerability or complex issues, who
find it difficult to access Services Australia's mainstream services.

The CEO Programme:

-   works collaboratively with Community and Third Party Organisations
    to identify people experiencing vulnerability and complex issues in
    need of the service
-   makes the service accessible to customers at appropriate external
    Community and Third Party Organisations
-   provides flexible service delivery
-   advocates internally and externally on behalf of people experiencing
    vulnerability and complex issues
-   supports people experiencing vulnerability and complex issues to
    increase their capacity for greater self-sufficiency

Services provided to Community and Third Party Organisations (CTPO)

Community Engagement Officers have established relationships with CTPOs
and:

-   help them to ensure members of the community experiencing
    vulnerability and complex issues understand their payments and
    obligations, and know about the agency’s services available
-   support them to increase their knowledge of the agency’s services,
    and
-   promote and demonstrate the agency’s self-managed and digital
    services

This is achieved through outreach activities, including:

-   education and information sessions on agency services and
    self-service options
-   participating in community events and meetings
-   conducting ‘Digi events’

Services provided to customers

Community Engagement Officers provide short term help to people
experiencing vulnerability and complex issues to address their needs
and/or link them with appropriate services. This may include providing:

-   information on services delivered by the agency
-   help with payment transactions
-   advocacy to address vulnerability issues
-   short-term follow up of issues relating to the agency, as well as
    additional needs
-   referrals to CTPOs and other agency staff to address additional
    needs

Community Engagement Officers and other specialist staff

Community Engagement Officers and other specialist staff provide an
integrated service through cross consultations and referrals. This may
include collaborative assessments.

When a customer is referred to the CEO Programme, the Community
Engagement Officer consults with relevant stakeholders and a joint
decision is made about who can best support them.

Customers who may be referred to the CEO Programme

Customers experiencing vulnerability and complex issues and unable to
access mainstream channels may be referred, including customers who are:

-   unable to consistently meet the agency’s payment and services needs
    through mainstream channels
-   unable to manage their circumstances independently
-   not adequately linked into appropriate formal and/or informal
    supports
-   not adequately having their needs met by the current level of
    service provision

Community Engagement officers mainly work away from Services Australia’s
premises. See Office Locator on Resources for their office locations.
