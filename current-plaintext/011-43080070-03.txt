Registering a child in an existing Medicare Safety Net and the threshold has been reached

If the child was not registered in the Medicare Safety Net family at the
time of enrolment and the family has reached the Medicare Safety net
threshold and claims for Medicare benefits have been processed for the
child prior to registering a safety net, an adjustment is required. This
table describes how to adjust service lines for a child where the
Medicare Safety Net threshold has been reached prior to registering the
child.
