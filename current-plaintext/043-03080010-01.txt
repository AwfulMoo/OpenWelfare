This document outlines what to do when a customer notifies that they
have become self-employed, either through the commencement of a new
business enterprise or the purchase of an ongoing business enterprise.

Type of business

The following forms are required depending on whether the customer will
operate the business as a sole trader, in a partnership, as a trust or
as a company:

-   Sole traders or partnerships require a completed Mod (F) - Business
    details
-   Private companies require a completed Mod (PC) - Private Company
-   Private trusts require a completed Mod (PT) - Private Trust

Estimate of income and assets

An estimate of the anticipated business income and assets should be
obtained from the customer in all cases. For a business conducted as a
partnership it is the customer's share of the profit, as specified in
the partnership agreement, that is maintained as assessable income. A
determination on how the business was funded and set up will be
required.

The estimate may take the form of:

-   documents provided by the previous owner in support of the sale
    which indicate the past performance of the business
-   documents predicting future performance
-   a projected profit and loss statement which incorporates the current
    financial position of the business
-   an analysis of income and expenses for a successful tender for a
    contract
-   an interim profit and loss statement, prepared by the customer or
    their accountant
-   an interim balance sheet, prepared by the customer or their
    accountant

The assessable income maintained following purchase of an ongoing
business enterprise must be reviewed as soon as possible after the end
of the financial year.

Trusts and companies

Under the trusts and companies legislation, the income of a company or
trust will become assessable, as with sole traders and partnerships.
Centrelink will need to obtain an estimate of the income of the company
or trust in which our customer is an attributable stakeholder.

The principle of striking the current rate of income applies and the
determination of these cases must be referred to the Complex Assessment
Officer (CAO). The CAO will determine the attribution of income and
assets to the customer from a controlled private trust or company.

The Resources page contains links to Business Details form (MOD F),
Private Company form (MOD PC), and Private Trust form (MOD PT).
