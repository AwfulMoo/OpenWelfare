This document outlines the Child Student/Income Circumstances (CHSI)
screen, which is used to assess child eligibility and rate payable for
some social security payments.

Information recorded on CHSI screen

Information on the CHSI screen includes:

-   CCB School - this field is no longer used. Child Care Subsidy (CCS)
    replaced CCB from 2 July 2018
-   Student code - for 16-19 year old children to assess whether the
    child is a dependant for the parent/guardians income support
    payment, including the additional income free area for PPS
-   Income over limit for FTB - this field had not been used since 1 May
    2014
-   Income over limit SSA under and over 16 - to assess dependent child
    status for parent/guardian’s income support payment

The CHSI screen was used before 1 May 2014 to record student/income
details for Family Tax Benefit and Child Care Benefit.

Health Care Card (HCC) and social security payment child income limits

Social security child income limits are used to determine qualification
as a dependent child/ Parenting Payment (PP) child. It can also affect:

-   the rate of social security pension/benefit paid to a customer
    caring for the child, and
-   the customer's additional income free area for single customers paid
    Parenting Payment Single (PPS) or paid under the pension
    Transitional Rate Income Test

Note: until September 2021 the pension system applied the additional
child income free area for children aged 16 to 18 without the student
code being updated. Some customers may receive a debt if a reassessment
occurs for a child where the student code field has not been updated and
the customer had income above the income free area. If this occurs and
the child is a full time student, updating the information on the CHSI
screen will remove the debt.

rates and income limits.
