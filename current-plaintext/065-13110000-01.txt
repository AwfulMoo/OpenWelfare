To view the legacy SPARC process, see the historical version.

Aged care systems

Data related to aged care is exchanged between a number of systems:

Aged Care Management Payment System (ACMPS):

-   is a Services Australia system
-   receives data from systems outlined below

    System)
-   for aged care purposes is used by Centrelink staff for home and
    residential care means assessments

-   receives claims processing data from PACE
-   produces Tableau reports

My Aged Care gateway:

-   is a Department of Health and Aged Care system
-   transmits the National Screening and Assessment Form (NSAF) and care
    approval details to ACMPS and then ACSP. This includes information
    about care recipients’ additional transition care and respite care
    days information for residential care purposes

National Approved Provider System (NAPS):

-   is a Department of Health and Aged Care system
-   transmits aged care provider/service details and service funding
    classification information to ACMPS and then ACSP. This includes
    information about aged care services’ approved places

Payment Assessment Calculation Engine (PACE):

-   is a Services Australia system
-   receives data from ACMPS and reference data from its own databases
    to determine eligibility, assess entitlement and calculate claims,
    advances and means assessment for residential care purposes
-   will return payment statement details, auto advances and entitlement
    summaries to ACMPS when calculations have been completed for
    residential care purposes

Payment Utility:

-   is a Services Australia system
-   receives data from ACMPS about service master data, advances and
    payment instructions
-   use data from ACMPS to compare the payment amount to the advance
    amount and then make payments to service providers

Home care data exchange process

When a care recipient starts care, the home care data exchange process
occurs in the following order:

A National Screening and Assessment Form (NSAF) is lodged and received
via the My Aged Care gateway following an assessment of care needs. This
assessment is completed by an Aged Care Assessment Team (ACAT) assessor

Details of the entry into home care is coded in the Aged Care Provider
Portal (ACPP) by the service provider. Note: entry into care is coded
after an NSAF has been completed

The entry event from ACPP will be transmitted into ACMPS

ACMPS will determine whether Services Australia or Department of
Veterans’ Affairs (DVA) hold current income information for that care
recipient. This is done by checking ISIS (Income security Integrated
System) for Services Australia and Aged Care System (ACS) for DVA:

-   Where current income information is present Customer First or ACS
    will automatically complete a means assessment and send means
    assessment data to ACMPS
-   Where no income information is found, a letter is sent to the care
    recipient requesting they complete a means assessment form. As the
    means assessment did not complete automatically it must be manually
    coded in Customer First for Services Australia or ACS for DVA when
    the form is provided

Once the means assessment is complete (including means not disclosed)
the data will transmit to ACMPS. It can take up to 24 hours following
transmission before it can be viewed in ACMPS

ACMPS will use the means assessment data to calculate fees and generate
letters advising of the means assessment result. Letters can take up to
5 working days to be issued

A care recipient may also request a means assessment prior to commencing
care:

-   A means assessment is completed in Customer First via a form being
    lodged or, if eligible, via a verbal assessment
-   Income details are sent to ACMPS and remain for 120 days
-   If the care recipient commences care within the valid period, entry
    event will be transmitted to ACMPS
-   ACMPS will use valid means assessment data to calculate fees and
    generate letters

Residential care data exchange process

When a care recipient starts care, the residential care data exchange
process occurs in the following order:

A National Screening and Assessment Form (NSAF) is lodged and received
via the My Aged Care gateway following an assessment of care needs. This
assessment is completed by an Aged Care Assessment Team (ACAT) assessor

Details of the entry into residential care is coded in Aged Care
Provider Portal (ACPP) by the service provider. Note: entry into care is
coded after an NSAF has been completed

The entry event from ACPP will be transmitted into:

-   ACSP for viewing
-   ACMPS for further determination

ACMPS determines whether Services Australia or Department of Veterans’
Affairs (DVA) hold current income and asset information for the care
recipient. This is done by checking ISIS (Income security Integrated
System) for Services Australia and Aged Care System (ACS) for DVA

-   Where current income and asset information is present Customer First
    or ACS completes a means assessment and send means assessment data
    to ACMPS for non-homeowners, or care recipients who have already
    completed an assessment prior to entry
-   Where no income and assets information is found, a letter is sent to
    the care recipient requesting they complete a means assessment form.
    As the means assessment did not complete automatically it must be
    manually coded in Customer First for Services Australia or ACS for
    DVA when the form is provided

Once the means assessment is complete (including means not disclosed)
the data will transmit to ACMPS. This can take up to 24 hours following
transmission

ACMPS transmits the means assessment data to PACE and ACSP

PACE will use the means assessment data to calculate fees and ACSP
generates letters advising of the means assessment result including a
summary of income and assets, Letters can take up to 5 working days to
be issued

A care recipient may also request a means assessment prior to commencing
care:

-   Means assessment is completed in Customer First via a form being
    lodged or, if eligible, via a verbal assessment
-   Income and asset details are sent to ACMPS and remain valid for 120
    days
-   If care recipient commences care within the valid period, entry
    event will be transmitted to ACSP and then ACMPS
-   ACMPS will use valid means assessment data and generate initial
    letters including a summary of income and assets
-   ACMPS will send income and asset information to PACE and ACSP
-   PACE will calculate fees and ACSP generates fee letters

Manual data matching

In order for aged care systems to be able to exchange information there
must be established links between the systems. The linking process
commences when one system seeks a matching care recipient record in
another system in order to transmit data. The link can be established in
one of the following ways:

automatically when the majority of data coded matches, or

manually when the systems cannot confirm a match. This may occur when:

-   multiple records exist
-   inconsistent data is present in different systems
-   no record exists for the care recipient

Once a care recipient is in care and the initial links have been
established, means assessment data and event information is exchanged
between systems. Any subsequent update to means assessment data or event
information is also exchanged between systems resulting in updates to
fees if required. Means assessment data can also be sent manually
between an aged care system by doing a refresh activity in Customer
First. All income, assets and dates of effect must be accurate and all
aged care system links established before a refresh activity is done.
