This document outlines the Wellbeing Exemption process for the Cashless
Debit Card (CDC).

Wellbeing Exemption

A Wellbeing Exemption should only be discussed and considered if the
participant presents at risk or with concerns regarding their mental,
physical or emotional wellbeing.

If the delegate is satisfied that being a CDC participant poses a
significant risk to a person's mental, physical or emotional wellbeing,
an exemption is granted.

Participant talks about suicide, self-harm and harm to others

If a participant talks about suicide, self-harm or harm to others, see
Customers talking about suicide or self-harm.

Risk assessment

If documentation supplied to the agency indicates a participant may be
at risk of harm, the Service Officer must contact the participant to
determine if immediate support and assistance is required.

Exceptional Circumstances

Exceptional Circumstance exemptions may be considered where a
participant, correspondence nominee or third party contacts regarding a
participant’s ability to participate in the CDC. These are considered on
a case by case basis.

Note: the same referral pathway outlined in Table 1, Wellbeing Exemption
Requests applies in this instance.

Review and Appeals

Participants may request an explanation or apply for a formal review of
the decision to not be exempt from the CDC.

If a participant wants to request an explanation or apply for a formal
review of the decision the usual review and appeal process applies.
