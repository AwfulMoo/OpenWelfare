Example

A customer is entitled to 72 hours of CCS per fortnight based on their
Activity Test Result.

Their child attends 2 child care services:

-   a Centre Based Day Care centre for 3 days a week, and
-   Family Day Care for 2 days a week

To maximise their CCS benefit, the customer apportions:

-   60 hours per fortnight to the Centre Based Day Care, and
-   12 hours to the Family Day Care

CCS will be paid for the days the child attends the Centre Based Day
Care where the customer’s out-of-pocket expenses are higher.

Staff can use the Centrelink Calendar to identify the start and end of a
CCS fortnight throughout the year.
