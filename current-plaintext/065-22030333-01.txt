This document outlines the procedure on RTS mail correspondence from
aged care services.

RTS mail

RTS mail is mail that has been returned from an aged care service as it:

-   cannot be delivered to the aged care service for any reason, or
-   was delivered to the incorrect aged care service’s address

When Services Australia receives RTS mail, it is normally marked as
either:

-   not at this address
-   not known at this address
-   address unknown
-   return to sender or RTS
-   insufficient address/incorrect address
-   damaged envelopes

RTS mail may include correspondence for:

-   advice of fees
-   review letters
-   forms that Services Australia has sent to an aged care service
-   payment statements (summaries)

The Scanning Operations Centre/Channel (SOC) scans the RTS mail via
PaNDA. SOC allocates the RTS mail to the Aged Care Payments Team (Aged
Care and Allied Health (ACAH) Branch) for actioning.
