This document outlines how to access and use Service Profiling screens,
and refers to Service Profiling which is used by Service Officers to
manage their customer contacts. The Service Profile is used to enhance
the conduct of these contacts and involves the Service Officer viewing
the customer's Service Profile and using the Service Strategy,
associated Service Actions and Service Details to better target their
discussions with the customer.

Service Profiling screens

Service Updates replaced most duration based reviews for Employment
Services, Disabilities, Retirements, Parenting Payment and Carer
customers. As a result, Service Officers need to know how to use the
following Service Profiling screens:

-   viewing Service Profiles and Service Strategies using the Profile
    Summary (PQS), Profile History (PQH), Profile Details (PQD),
    Predictor Details (PQPD) screens and Profiling Bulk Update Facility
    (PQBUF) screen
-   searching for customers based on Service Profiles using the Profile
    Search (PQSE) screen
-   searching for customers based on their Service Components using the
    Service Component search (PQCS) screen
-   updating Service Actions and Service Components when a Service
    Update is conducted, using the Service Strategy (PQSS) screen
-   refreshing Service Profiles using the PQS screen.
