Risks to a customer's privacy have been identified. See Separating
Safely - protecting personal details to make sure the customer's
personal details are safe before progressing.

This document outlines how customers can upload forms and documents
online. This saves customers from having to bring requested documents to
the office. It also reduces processing times.

Access the service

To upload documents, customers need to:

-   create a myGov account and link to Centrelink
-   access their Centrelink online account through myGov or the Express
    Plus Centrelink mobile app

Eligible Centrelink customers can use the service to upload copies of
documents using their:

-   desktop computer
-   smart phone, or
-   other device with internet access

The document should link to the relevant activity on a customer's
record. Where the image does not link to the activity, the system
creates an Image Notification Activity ('SCN' activity) for action.

There are some scannable document exceptions. Staff are not to use these
documents for processing if the customer submits them using the Upload
documents service.

The Resources page has links to the Services Australia website and the
Digital Support Products sub-site.
