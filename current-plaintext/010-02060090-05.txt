Limited program school lists

These schools do not offer a full program at the year or grade in which
the student is qualified to enrol. The away from home rate can be
approved for a student to bypass that school and attend another
institution offering an appropriate program as long as the student is
not within reasonable travelling time or distance of other government
schools at which the student is qualified to enrol.
