Reasons for Income management ending

A customer's Income Management may end for the following reasons:

-   The customer's eligible income support payment cancels
-   The end date for their Income Management measure is reached
-   The Voluntary Income Management Agreement is ended
-   They no longer meet the legislative requirements of the applicable
    Income Management measure
-   They are granted an exclusion or exemption from Income Management
-   They have an excluded payment nominee for Income Management purposes
-   The customer has passed away

Disbursement of remaining Income Management funds

When Income Management ends, any funds remaining in a customer's Income
Management account must be paid to them within 12 months of Income
Management ending. These funds can be paid:

In a lump sum
Note: this is only available to customers:

-   Where the residual balance is less than $210, or
-   The customer exits Voluntary Income Management

In fortnightly instalments (where the residual balance is $210 or more),
or

By transferring funds to BasicsCard or a Third Party Organisation (TPO)
to purchase non prohibited items

Note: funds will not be disbursed if it is likely the customer's
payments will be income managed again within 60 days.

Disbursement interview

When Income Management ends, customers are sent a letter inviting them
to contact Services Australia to discuss how any residual income managed
funds will be disbursed, and the options available to continue paying
their ongoing expenses. These interviews are voluntary and are only
conducted at the customer’s request

If a customer chooses not to attend a Disbursement interview, the Auto
Disbursement rules are applied.

The Resources page contains examples of the calculations used to
determine disbursement of Income Management funds and when payments are
to be made.
