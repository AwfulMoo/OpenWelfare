|                                   | and their partner's personal      |
|                                   | details including names, address, |
|                                   | dates of birth, telephone numbers |

|                                   | essential that the correct        |
|                                   | relationship status is coded on   |
|                                   | the Marital Status (MS) screen.   |
|                                   | This ensures that the customer    |
|                                   | receives the correct rate of      |
|                                   | payment.                          |
