This document outlines the information required from an ABSTUDY customer
who commences or returns to full-time, part-time or casual employment
and the effect of employment on their payments.

On this Page:

Continuing eligibility for payment

ABSTUDY students are able to remain on Living Allowance payments if the
income from employment is within personal income test limits and the
student is still undertaking a full-time (or concessional) study load.

Australian Apprentices

If the customer is returning to work as a full-time Australian
Apprentice, consider entitlement to ABSTUDY as an Australian Apprentice.

Customers receiving ABSTUDY as an Australian Apprentice are subject to
the same income and assets tests that apply to students.

Income Bank and Working Credit

ABSTUDY students have access to the Student Income Bank (SIB) and
ABSTUDY Australian Apprentices have access to the Australian Apprentice
Income Bank. This will generally be referred to as the Income Bank.

If the customer transfers to a payment that attracts Working Credit,
they will be able to transfer the lower of their Income bank balance or
1000 credits from their Income bank to their new Working Credit Balance.

Family Tax Benefit implications

If the customer or partner receives Family Tax Benefit (FTB) or Child
Care Subsidy (CCS), check if the customer needs to revise their current
income estimate and advise the customer of the choices available to help
reduce the chance of an overpayment during the reconciliation process.
