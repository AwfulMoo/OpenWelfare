This document outlines information relating to when previous study may
be disregarded when assessing allowable time/reasonable time for
ABSTUDY, ABSTUDY Pensioner Education Supplement (PES), Austudy and
Pensioner Education Supplement (PES).

Impact of previous study on allowable time/reasonable time

Payments for students are not made indefinitely and there are limits on
how much study a student can undertake and still remain eligible for a
student payment. The time students have to complete their study is known
as allowable time/reasonable time and may be impacted by any previous
study undertaken or completed.

The rules for Youth Allowance (YA) are different.

Note: this file does not apply to the Assistance for Isolated Children
(AIC) Scheme, which has no rule comparable to allowable time/reasonable
time.

Disregarding previous study

In certain circumstances, it is possible to disregard previous study.
The reasons for disregarding study vary depending on the type of
payment, though some are common to each payment.

Reasons for disregarding previous study for ABSTUDY, ABSTUDY PES,
Austudy and PES include:

Different tertiary level

Undertaken more than 10 years ago

Prerequisite for current course of study

Study was overseas and was not credited as part of an approved course of
study, (with the exception of the prior completion of a masters, or
doctorate degree, or a qualification of the same standing). This
includes a:

-   masters degree, or doctorate, or a qualification of the same
    standing as an Australian institution, or
-   qualification of the same standing from an overseas institution

Failure in or discontinuation of a course due to illness or
circumstances beyond the control of the student

Disregarding previous study for ABSTUDY and ABSTUDY PES only

The following additional reasons are disregarded for ABSTUDY and ABSTUDY
PES only:

-   Course duration 1 year or less
-   Periods of study for which Living Allowance or ABSTUDY PES was not
    paid, regardless of the reason why these were not paid
-   Periods of study in courses other than the one for which reasonable
    time is being calculated are not taken into account, and
-   Studies undertaken more than 10 years before the year for which
    assistance is being claimed

Disregarding previous study for Austudy and PES only

The following additional reasons are disregarded for Austudy and PES
only:

-   Qualification obtained cannot be used in appropriate trade or
    profession due to illness
-   Withdrew from a course without incurring an academic penalty
-   Year 12 study discontinued within 6 months of commencing
-   Secondary study was failed because English is not the student's
    first language
-   Courses not then approved for one of the current student payments
    administered by the agency
-   Ineligible for a Services Australia administered payment at the time
    study was undertaken due to academic progress rules
-   Time spent undertaking a TAFE course or a course provided by a VET
    provider if the normal length of the course for a full time student
    is one year or less

Note: students who have completed a Doctorate level course do not
qualify for Austudy or PES. Students who have completed a Masters level
course do not qualify for PES. This is separate to 'disregarding
previous study' as it is part of the activity test requirements for PES
and Austudy recipients. Refer to Assessing qualifying study for
Pensioner Education Supplement (PES) or Activity test for Austudy for
further information.
