This document outlines how lump sum compensation payments are assessed.

On this Page:

Lump sum compensation payments

Lump sum compensation payments are:

-   single or multiple payments for the same compensable claim
-   aggregated to calculate the effect on a customer's social security
    payments

Assess a separate preclusion period for each compensable claim if:

-   payments contain an economic loss component
-   the amount has been paid wholly or partly for lost earnings or lost
    capacity to earn
-   a single lump sum payment covers multiple compensable claims

The amount paid for each compensable claim is used for calculations.
Apportion the lump sum across the claims where this information is not
available.

Do not aggregate a single lump sum payment for multiple compensable
events. Aggregation includes compensation lump sums for both economic
(for example, lost wages) and non-economic loss made for the same
compensable claim.

A lump sum paid solely as arrears of periodic payments is not treated as
a lump sum.

Lump sum preclusion periods

Preclusion periods apply to prevent customers receiving income support
from both the social security and compensation systems for the same
period.

The Government expects customers to use part of their compensation lump
sum payment to provide their own income support during the preclusion
period.
