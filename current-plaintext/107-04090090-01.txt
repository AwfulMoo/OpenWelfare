This document outlines the reconciliation/re-reconciliation of FTB and
the process which occurs if there is an undetermined FTB qualification
debt on the customer’s record.

FTB qualification debt

FTB qualification debts are debts other than those resulting from
changes in income or maintenance income.

A qualification debt can occur when there has been a retrospective
change to a customer’s circumstances.

For example, a FTB qualification debt may occur due to changes in the:

-   care arrangements for a child such as loss of care or shared care
-   customer’s residency status, or
-   customer’s accommodation circumstances

Raise FTB overpayments due to qualification changes immediately. If the
debt is still undetermined when reconciliation occurs, the debt will
automatically be finalised and included in the reconciliation outcome.

Debts due to changes in the customer’s estimated income or maintenance
income are usually not generated during the relevant financial year and
will be taken into account when reconciliation occurs. If an income or
maintenance income related debt is generated, it can be finalised no
debt and included in the reconciliation result.

Qualification debt already included in reconciliation

Where a qualification debt has been included in a completed FTB
reconciliation result and a debt waiver is required it will be necessary
to raise a manual debt in order to apply the waiver.
