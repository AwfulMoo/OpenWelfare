This document outlines the different payments and services available to
families by Services Australia.

Government intent

Families may contact before or after the birth, adoption or a change of
care of a child. They may also contact when they begin to use child
care. Services Australia will assess the family's circumstances and
offer appropriate payments and services to the family.

Assistance available

Families can be helped to:

-   claim Family Tax Benefit (FTB), including Newborn Supplement and
    Newborn Upfront Payment for a newborn or adopted child
-   claim Child Care Subsidy (CCS) and Additional Child Care Subsidy
    (ACCS) for children attending an approved child care service
-   claim Parental Leave Pay (PPL) and Dad and Partner Pay (DAP)
-   claim an annual Single Income Family Supplement (SIFS) if they did
    not claim or receive FTB. Note: SIFS is not payable from 1 July 2017
    unless customers meet grandfathering provisions
-   choose an FTB payment option that suits the family's financial
    circumstances
-   provide an accurate income estimate to reduce the risk of an
    overpayment of family assistance which will need to be repaid
-   consider 'what if' scenarios to estimate how much FTB and CCS the
    family is likely to get
-   claim extra assistance to help with the cost of education for
    primary, secondary and under 16 year old tertiary students under the
    Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) Scheme
-   claim an income support payment such as Parenting Payment
-   notify a change of circumstances
-   make appointments for complex enquiries/interviews
-   access other government and community assistance

The initial contact may be made [] online, by phone or at a service
centre.
