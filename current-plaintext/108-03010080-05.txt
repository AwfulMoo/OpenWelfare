Module IA - Income and Assets (Mod IA)

Determining the rate of payment for blind customer's claiming RA

Two rate calculations are required to determine the rate of payment for
an Age Pension (Blind) or a Disability Support Pension (Blind) customer
wishing to claim RA with their pension. The customer may be eligible for
the transitional rules for pension customers if they were current on a
relevant pension at 19 September 2009 and have been on the transitional
rules rate since this date. If they are eligible, a rate calculation
under the transitional rules must be done. The customer's income and
assets must be taken into consideration when they claim RA. A rate
calculation taking into consideration the customer's income and assets
is made and compared with a rate calculation using no Means Test, the
higher of the two rates is payable.

These amounts may not be current. They are examples only. For current
payments, see Rates and thresholds.
