*Note: interaction between IMP and OWP

The interaction of the IMP and OWP is dependent on when the customer
receives their leave entitlements and also whether the customer is
serving a partial rate IMP.

An IMP commences on the day the customer receives their leave
entitlements whereas the OWP starts on the date of claim (unless serving
another waiting period).

If a customer claims on the day after their employment has been
terminated and is paid their leave entitlements then the IMP and OWP are
served consecutively.

If the customer claims and has leave entitlements paid out at a later
date or after the OWP is served, the IMP begins when the leave
entitlements are received and they are not consecutive.

If a customer is serving an IMP and they are entitled to a partial rate
of payment, the OWP commences at date of claim and could be served
concurrently with the IMP.
