Income eligibility criteria for DRA

For staff processing Disaster Recovery Allowance (DRA) claims only.

Table 4: This table describes the steps to assess income eligibility for
DRA for those affected by Tropical Cyclone Debbie - March 2017. Service
Officers should not process a claim unless formal training has been
completed. Note: if a claimant is not eligible for DRA claims are still
to be recorded and the outcome noted as rejected. Claims cannot be
rejected until formal approval has been provided. Staff will be notified
via an Operational Message once they are able to reject payments.
