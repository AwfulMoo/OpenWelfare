This document outlines how to explain the reason for an FTB
reconciliation overpayment that was partly or entirely due to
maintenance income or action taken to obtain child support.

When overpayments can occur

An overpayment could occur if:

-   the customer's total annual maintenance income for the financial
    year (including any arrears payments) was more than the amount
    estimated during the financial year and is above the customer's
    Maintenance Income Free Area (MIFA)
-   there is a retrospective increase to a child support assessment for
    a private collect customer. Note: the customer can apply for a
    formal review of the FTB reconciliation debt with Centrelink.
    However if the customer wants a review of the retrospective increase
    to the assessment, they need to contact Child Support
-   reasonable action to obtain child support was not taken. FTB Part A
    is limited to the base rate for a child if action to obtain child
    support is required but not taken
-   relationship status changed during the financial year

FTB Part A supplement, Part B supplement and Single Income Family
Supplement (SIFS) are included in the reconciliation calculation for
eligible customers once adequate income/ not required to lodge details
are available. FTB top-ups, including supplement and SIFS entitlement,
are automatically used for debt offsetting.

If a customer contacts to advise that the retrospective child support
assessment information on their Centrelink record is incorrect or not
present. see Child Support data has not loaded onto or is incorrectly
affecting customer’s record for further details.
