This document explains when and how to process My Health Record opt-out
questions included on Services Australia forms with a Medicare enrolment
component.

Newborn My Health Record questions - old forms

Staff need to make sure they are reading the question and understanding
the response correctly.

The My Health Record question on some earlier versions of the:

-   Newborn Child Declaration (FA081) form, and
-   Medicare Enrolment form MS004

Has a single checkbox to opt a child out of the My Health Record. The
question wording is (or similar to) I do NOT want a My Health Record for
my newborn child.

These forms may also contain questions about consenting for Medicare
information to be included in their child’s record. See The My Health
Record system - Your Health for information about handling customer
enquiries about the My Health Record questions on forms.

Directory Maintenance System (CDMS) if:

-   the checkbox for this question has been ticked, and
-   the applicant or partner has provided evidence of parental
    responsibility, and
-   that person has signed the form

Select Question is not on form or not answered in CDMS if the person
with parental responsibility hasn’t signed the form as either the
applicant or the partner. This is regardless of whether the checkbox has
been ticked.
