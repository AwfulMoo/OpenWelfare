Deleting care recipient assessment in ACMPS

Table 11: This table describes how Service Officers delete a care
recipient assessment details in ACMPS. All requests to delete assessment
details must be directed to the Aged Care Programmes Branch for action.

Requests to delete assessment details are only actioned under rare
occasions requested by the Department of Health and it is a delegation
request. An example is when the care recipient’s assessment details were
matched to an incorrect care recipient’s profile.
