This document outlines when a customer is stood down from work and what
effect this has on their qualification for payment.

Stand down

A stand down occurs when an employer is unable to offer an employee work
for a short period of time, without having their employment terminated.
Such a stand down could include a situation where a factory closes down
for a few weeks over the Christmas holiday period or if a company has a
short term lack of work. A customer who has been stood down is
considered to be unemployed, even if the stand down is only temporary.

When assessing a claim for payment, confirmation on the details of the
stand down are required to determine if the customer may be affected by:

-   Seasonal Work Preclusion Period (SWPP)
-   Unemployed Due to Industrial Action (UDIA)

The information is requested on the Employment Separation Certificate
(SU1).
