This document outlines what action to take if during the conversation
with the customer a discrepancy is identified between the customer's
details and the match data, or there is a need for a referral to the
Intelligence and Investigations Branch.

Case Selection

If the intervention should not have been initiated due to case selection
rules, complete a referral to Case Selection.

Before escalating to the CADO Service Desk, Case Selection referrals are
referred to a Quality Development Officer (QDO) for review. The QDO will
determine if the referral meets Case Selection criteria.

Interventions can only be cancelled by the CADO Service Desk.

Intelligence and Investigations Branch referral

After completing an intervention, the Compliance Officer (CO) can refer
the case to the Intelligence and Investigations Branch if they identify
non-compliance outside the scope of intervention.

The Resources page contains links to the CADO Service Desk, Branch
referral form a list of site codes.
