This document outlines the requirements for coding Carer Payment (CP)
employment income in the Earnings and reporting tool as well as
consequential outcomes to enable further follow up action.

Carer Payment

Carers can work, study, train or volunteer and still qualify for CP as
long as the total time the carer is not providing care, including travel
time, does not exceed 25 hours per week.

The processing of CP employment income will include information, warning
prompts and question sets for recording employment income and activities
that the carer may be undertaking alongside their caring
responsibilities. Assessment of the carer's circumstances may be
required immediately or as a follow up action if the customer's
activities exceed 25 hours per week.

Service centre staff should hand off complex enquiries to an appropriate
Carers Service Officer or transfer the call to the Disability, Sickness
and Carers (DSC) queue.

Wife Pension transfer to Carer Payment

The 25 hour rule does not apply to customers who transferred to Carer
Payment (XWP) from Wife Pension on 20 March 2020. CP (XWP) is paid under
grandfathered provisions. The Carer Payment Details section of the
Earnings and reporting workflow is not displayed for this customer
group. The pensions income and asset test continues to apply and
employment income must still be recorded.
