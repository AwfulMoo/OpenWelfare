This document outlines information about obtaining an estimate of
business income from a customer when they have commenced a business. The
income received from a business, whether operated as a sole trader,
partnership, or through a private trust or private company, will be used
for assessment of income purposes and may affect the customer's rate of
payment. Therefore the customer should be asked to provide an estimate
of the likely income to be earned from the business.

Reasonable estimates

When assessing if the estimated income and expenses provided by the
customer are reasonable, the nature of the business, the likely income
to be earned and expenses incurred by the business should be taken into
account.

If the customer is unable to provide an estimate immediately, they
should be asked to provide one as soon as possible.

The information required usually takes the form of an interim profit and
loss statement. An interim profit and loss statement contains details of
the type and amount of gross income earned and the type and amount of
each expense incurred for the period from the commencement of the
business.

If the business is being operated through a private trust or private
company, the case must be referred to the Complex Assessment Officer
(CAO) for assessment. The CAO will determine the attribution to the
customer from the controlled private trust or company and examine the
estimated income for the entity.
