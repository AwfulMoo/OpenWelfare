| 1                                 | Initial contact required with one |
|                                   | customer to verify facts          |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | A payer calls to report an error  |
|                                   | in the estimate they provided 2   |
|                                   | months ago. It was recorded as    |
|                                   | $65,000 instead of $56,000. The   |
|                                   | original estimate notepad         |
|                                   | confirms the $56,000 figure       |
|                                   | should have been used.            |

|                                   | The error may be corrected as a   |
|                                   | simple error without the payer    |
|                                   | lodging an objection as the       |
|                                   | correct amount has been           |
|                                   | confirmed. There is no need to    |
|                                   | make initial contact with any     |
|                                   | associated customers, such as the |
|                                   | payee, to confirm the facts as    |
|                                   | they would have no knowledge of   |
|                                   | the payer's estimate amount.      |
