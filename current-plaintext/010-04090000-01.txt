This document outlines procedures relating to the cancellation and
restoration of Austudy payments.

On this Page:

Cancellation of Austudy

Austudy payments may be cancelled automatically by the system, manually
by a Service Officer or online by a customer:

-   Automatic cancellation occurs when the student loses entitlement in
    some way, for example the student course end date coded on the
    system is reached
-   Manual cancellation occurs when a Service Officer makes a decision
    to cancel a customer’s payment based on the application of Social
    Security Law or the customer has requested the cancellation
-   Eligible customers can cancel their payment via the Cancel my
    current payment option online

Restoration of Austudy

Restoration of Austudy should only happen where the following conditions
are met:

-   the cancellation reason is restorable,
-   the customer's eligibility and ongoing entitlement from the
    appropriate date has been established, and
-   relevant information is updated in the customer's record prior to
    restoring the payment (where there have been changes in the
    customer's circumstances), to avoid arrears

Note: evidence that the customer has met compulsory Activity Test or
participation requirements may be required for the periods of
restoration.
