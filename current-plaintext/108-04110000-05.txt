|                                   | Josie is aged 79 and receiving    |
|                                   | Age Pension. Josie has a life     |
|                                   | interest in her late partner's    |
|                                   | estate which consists of          |
|                                   | investments worth $150,000. The   |

|                                   | year is $7,000.                   |

|                                   | Based on the quasi life tables,   |
|                                   | Doris has a life expectancy of    |
|                                   | 5.26 years. She receives life     |
|                                   | interest income of $5,000 per     |
|                                   | year from her late partner's      |
|                                   | estate. An approximate value of   |

|                                   | If the total assets Doris had     |
|                                   | consisted of a bank account of    |
|                                   | $10,000 and home contents of      |
|                                   | $10,000 then it is not necessary  |
|                                   | to obtain an actuarial valuation  |
|                                   | of the life interest because the  |
|                                   | total assets would not come close |
|                                   | to the assets threshold. The CAO  |
|                                   | would code an amount of $26,300   |
|                                   | on the OAS screen.                |
