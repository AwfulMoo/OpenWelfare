| Item                              | Scenario                          |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Changing address                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A customer submits a Separation   |
|                                   | details (MOD S) form online and   |
|                                   | attempts to update their address. |
|                                   | The customer is unable to update  |
|                                   | their address online so calls     |
|                                   | Centrelink to have this           |
|                                   | completed. The Service Officer    |
|                                   | updates the customer's address    |
|                                   | but does not process the MOD S    |
|                                   | that is already on the file.      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The privacy risk/s that may occur |
|                                   | include:                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   The new residential address   |
|                                   |     is updated before the         |
|                                   |     customer is unlinked from     |
|                                   |     their former partner. This    |
|                                   |     results in the customer's new |
|                                   |     address flowing onto the      |
|                                   |     former partner's record and   |
|                                   |     being available to them on    |
|                                   |     their online accounts. This   |
|                                   |     places the customer's privacy |
|                                   |     at risk                       |
|                                   | -   The postal address is not     |
|                                   |     updated and a rent            |
|                                   |     certificate letter is sent to |
|                                   |     the postal address and is     |
|                                   |     received by the former        |
|                                   |     partner. This letter includes |
|                                   |     personal information,         |
|                                   |     including the customer's new  |
|                                   |     address, placing their        |
|                                   |     privacy at risk               |
|                                   | -   If the customer has family    |
|                                   |     and domestic violence         |
|                                   |     concerns, their personal      |
|                                   |     safety may also be at risk    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Note: action must be taken to     |
|                                   | protect the customer's personal   |
|                                   | information before the customer's |
|                                   | address is updated. This may      |
|                                   | include processing the MOD S,     |
|                                   | changing PPE/PPU to 'no' or       |
|                                   | removing a nominee arrangement.   |

| 2                                 | Medicare Group Card               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A customer updates their address  |
|                                   | online and a message displays     |
|                                   | advising that the update will     |
|                                   | flow to other people on the       |
|                                   | Medicare card, at this point they |
|                                   | stop the online update and call   |
|                                   | the agency. The customer notifies |
|                                   | of a separation and requests an   |
|                                   | address change. The Service       |
|                                   | Officer updates the customer's    |
|                                   | address.                          |

|                                   | The privacy risk/s that may occur |
|                                   | include:                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   The customer's new address    |
|                                   |     will flow to the former       |
|                                   |     partner's record and be       |
|                                   |     available through their       |
|                                   |     online account. This places   |
|                                   |     the customer's privacy at     |
|                                   |     risk                          |
|                                   | -   The customer may receive      |
|                                   |     Medicare correspondence for   |
|                                   |     their former partner. This    |
|                                   |     places the former partner's   |
|                                   |     privacy at risk               |
|                                   | -   If the customer has family    |
|                                   |     and domestic violence         |
|                                   |     concerns, their personal      |
|                                   |     safety may also be at risk    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Note: the Service Officer must    |

|                                   | Medicare card before updating     |
|                                   | their address to avoid their      |
|                                   | details being available to their  |
|                                   | former partner.                   |

| 3                                 | Nominee Arrangements              |

|                                   | A customer's partner is their     |
|                                   | correspondence nominee. The       |
|                                   | customer completes a Family Tax   |
|                                   | Benefit (FTB) claim online,       |
|                                   | identifying that they have        |
|                                   | separated and will be sharing     |
|                                   | care of the children. The         |
|                                   | customer does not recall the      |
|                                   | nominee arrangements being in     |
|                                   | place so did not answer the       |
|                                   | question within the FRB claim     |
|                                   | regarding nominees. As the        |
|                                   | customer has not requested a      |
|                                   | change to their nominee           |
|                                   | arrangement as part of the claim, |
|                                   | no nominee responses flow through |
|                                   | to the service officer processing |
|                                   | the claim.                        |

|                                   | The privacy risk/s that may occur |
|                                   | include:                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   The nominee arrangements are  |
|                                   |     not reviewed as part of the   |
|                                   |     FTB processing so the FTB     |
|                                   |     grant letter is sent to the   |
|                                   |     former partner. This letter   |
|                                   |     discloses personal            |

|                                   | -   The nominee will continue to  |
|                                   |     have access to the customer's |
|                                   |     personal information via      |
