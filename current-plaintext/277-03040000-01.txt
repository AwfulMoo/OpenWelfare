Change in care for a child on a Child Support assessment (post 1 July 2010)

Customers who have both a Child Support and Centrelink assessment are
mutual customers and can notify either program of a change to the care
for a Family Tax Benefit (FTB) eligible child of an assessment. The
program that is notified first will:

-   record the change in care details
-   conduct investigations
-   make a care decision
-   give effect to the decision

Throughout this process, information will be shared between Child
Support and Centrelink electronically via data exchange. The final
decision will be applied electronically to the customer’s Child Support
and FTB assessment as the same rules are used to determine care
percentages.

Note: for care changes before 1 July 2010 (3 March 2011 for WA
Ex-nuptial cases) or Centrelink-notified care decisions on WA Ex-nuptial
cases before 3 March 2011, contact Operational Blueprint to request
previous versions of this document. Seek help from an SSO.
