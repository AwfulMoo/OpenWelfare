This document outlines the hardship provisions for the Liquid Assets
Waiting Period (LAWP).The LAWP may be recalculated if the customer is in
hardship. In some circumstances the waiting period can be waived.

When LAWP is applied

The LAWP is applied at the new claim stage and can only be applied once
within a 12 month period. A LAWP is not applied if a person or their
partner have been subjected to a LAWP that started within the last 12
months (which includes where only part of a LAWP has been served). The
LAWP only affects customers applying for Austudy, JobSeeker Payment
(JSP) and Youth Allowance (YA).

A customer may be in hardship, although at the time of claim they have
had money available to them. If this money has been used on unavoidable
and reasonable expenditure then this waiting period may be waived.

Effect of a customer changing relationship status from single to partnered while serving a LAWP

There is no provision under section 598 of the Social Security Act 1991
to reassess a person's LAWP and date of commencement based solely on
their change of circumstances from single to partnered or vice versa.
However, a person can always request a reassessment under subsection
598(5) if they are in severe financial hardship.

The Resources page contains the LAWP calculators and information about
how certain liquid assets are to be assessed for the purposes of the
LAWP.
