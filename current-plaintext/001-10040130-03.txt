|                                   | are evidence-based decisions.     |
|                                   | This means the decision must be   |
|                                   | based on relevant facts.          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | All compliance investigations     |
|                                   | include evidence from both the    |
|                                   | person who reported the failure   |
|                                   | or generated the investigation,   |
|                                   | and the job seeker. Whether any   |
|                                   | further evidence is required to   |
|                                   | reach a decision, will depend on  |
|                                   | the clarity and consistency of    |
|                                   | these two forms of primary        |
|                                   | evidence.                         |

|                                   | The decision maker must be        |
|                                   | confident they have sufficient    |
|                                   | evidence to establish the facts   |
|                                   | relevant to the reported failure  |
|                                   | to make an informed decision.     |
|                                   |                                   |
