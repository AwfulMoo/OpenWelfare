|                                   | must be evidence-based decisions. |
|                                   | This means the decision must be   |
|                                   | based on the relevant facts.      |

|                                   | include evidence from both the    |
|                                   | person who reported the failure   |
|                                   | or generated the investigation,   |

|                                   | further evidence is required to   |
|                                   | reach a decision, will depend on  |

|                                   | be assessed by considering the:   |

|                                   | -   source of the evidence and/or |

|                                   | -   credibility of the evidence,  |
|                                   |     that is, how convincing it    |
|                                   |     is, is it corroborated or     |

|                                   | known as 'weighing' the evidence. |
|                                   | This is an important part of the  |
|                                   | compliance investigation.         |

|                                   | of evidence allows the decision   |
