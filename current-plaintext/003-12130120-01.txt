This document outlines information about recording Vulnerable Welfare
Payment Recipient (VWPR) Notice assessments in the Social Work Recording
Application (SWRA) in Process Direct and the Social Work Information
System (SWIS) in Customer First.

VWPR assessments

The VWPR assessment is generally part of a complex social work
intervention requiring ongoing contacts with customers and third parties
if appropriate.

There is no maximum number of contacts that can be recorded and this
should reflect the complexity of the customer’s circumstances as well as
the social work assistance provided.

Note: this procedure does not apply for recording exclusion assessments
for auto triggered Youth VWPR. For information on recording these
exclusion assessments see:

-   Vulnerable Welfare Payment Recipient (VWPR) Exclusion (Not
    Practicable due to Support and Demonstrated Capacity) Assessments in
