This document outlines information regarding the Ripple Manager, a
background task which automates the assessment of customers who have
separated but who share the care of their children.

Automated assessment

Child circumstance data, for example a change of child's name, will be
replicated on the record of the custodial parent and any other
custodians. It includes assessment of customers within and across all
ISIS (Income Security Integrated System) environments.

Ripple Manager To Do Indicator (TDI) errors

Where a customer is linked (for example, member of a couple, parents
and/or children) information is passed between the records via ripples.
Sometimes information is passed between the records even after the link
has ended (for example, after a couple separate). Error E001RQ may occur
because a ripple has been initiated to a linked record and that ripple
has not yet completed.

A To Do Indicator (TDI) error may occur in the following situations:

-   processing a claim for a partnered customer, the partner is not
    claiming and/or the partner has investments
-   as part of a system fault
