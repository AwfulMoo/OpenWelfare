|                                   | couple separated due to illness   |
|                                   | and a respite care couple?        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | To meet the definition of a       |
|                                   | respite care couple, the couple   |
|                                   | must be separated for a temporary |
|                                   | but definite period, of at least  |
|                                   | 14 consecutive days and must be   |
|                                   | in approved respite care.         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | For a couple separated due to     |
|                                   | illness, at least 1 partner (can  |
|                                   | be both partners) must be unable  |
|                                   | to live at home due to illness or |
|                                   | infirmity and have increased, or  |
|                                   | are likely to have increased      |
|                                   | expenses because of the           |
|                                   | separation. The inability to live |
|                                   | together must be likely to        |
|                                   | continue for an indefinite        |
|                                   | period.                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | There is no rule on where the ill |
|                                   | partner must reside or a minimum  |
|                                   | period. However they must not be  |
|                                   | residing together and must have   |
|                                   | extra expenses due to the         |
|                                   | separation and the period must be |
|                                   | indefinite. Customers separated   |
|                                   | due to illness may be entitled to |
|                                   | receive RA on their new           |
|                                   | accommodation.                    |

|                                   | an asset while they are in        |
|                                   | respite care?                     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The customer will retain their    |
|                                   | former homeownership status (that |
|                                   | is, homeowner or non-homeowner)   |
|                                   | while they are in respite care    |
|                                   | regardless of whether their       |
|                                   | partner stays in the principal    |
|                                   | home or not.                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the customer changes into      |
|                                   | another form of care the home     |
|                                   | status may change from that date. |
