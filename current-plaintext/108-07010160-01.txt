This document outlines the eligibility requirements of the employment
income nil rate period provision. This provision enables a customer to
retain certain benefits, such as a concession card when their rate of
income support payment is nil due to the effect of the Income Test. This
only occurs when the customer's total ordinary income includes
employment income.

Eligibility and duration of employment income nil rate period

A customer may qualify for an employment income nil rate period if their
social security pension or benefit is not payable because of ordinary
income, made up entirely or partly of employment income and they:

are receiving a social security pension or benefit, except:

-   Special Benefit (SpB) customers, or
-   Parenting Payment Partnered (PPP) customers of Age Pension age

remain qualified for their social security pension or benefit, including
meeting the employment qualifications (employment qualifications exist
for Jobseeker Payment (JSP), Carer Payment (CP), Disability Support
Pension (DSP) and Youth Allowance (YA) (job seeker)), and

continue to satisfy the payability provisions for their social security
pension or benefit, except for being not payable due to the income

A zero rate applies for 6 full fortnights of the employment income nil
rate period, see Resources for examples.

A customer may have multiple income nil rate periods without having to
reclaim if basic qualification for the income support payment is still
met.

There is no limit to how many times a customer can enter an employment
income nil rate period.

The employment income nil rate period applies to other payments
including Austudy and Youth Allowance (YA) students.

Pensioner details

The employment nil rate period applies to Age Pension age customers in
receipt of a pension.

Pensioners of Age Pension age who are not payable under the Income Test
due to employment income will have their:

-   payment automatically suspended, and
-   status shows as CZR (Current Zero Rate)

If a customer over Age Pension age is paid employment income that is
enough to pay a nil rate, they are to be offered the choice of
cancellation or temporary suspension (CZR). Tell the customer of the
benefits and disadvantages of each.

Cancellation:

Pensioner Concession Card (PCC) is cancelled, but the customer may
access:

-   the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card (CSHC)
-   the quarterly supplement, and
-   one-off bonuses targeted to non-income support customers

The customer will need to reclaim when payable

Suspension (CZR):

-   PCC remains current but the customer may miss out on bonuses
    targeted to customers getting a pension and CSHC holders only
-   The customer does not need to reclaim when payable, but payment will
    cancel if still not payable after 12 weeks

The employment income nil rate period allows for 6 full fortnights at
nil rate after the first affected entitlement period due to income, that
is:

-   partly or fully from employment
-   (up to a maximum of 97 consecutive days or 6 fortnights plus 13
    days)

Home Equity Access Scheme

Customers who get loan payments under the Home Equity Access Scheme will
continue to get loan payments (both fortnightly and/or advance payments)
even if the qualifying pension payment stops due to employment income.

Where the pension payment cancels, suspends or reduces to nil rate due
to employment income, the pension status will automatically adjust to
CZR (Current Zero Rate) for reason PLS. This allows the customer's loan
to continue, providing the customer is still otherwise qualified for the
applicable pension.

Working Credits or Work Bonus

If the customer is:

-   under Age Pension age, any Working Credits will be depleted before
    the employment income nil rate period is applied
-   over Age Pension age and in receipt of a pension (excluding
    Parenting Payment Single) they may be entitled to the Work Bonus.
    Note: the Work Bonus is not used in the customer's transitional
    rules calculation, however partners may still benefit by the
    reduction in total income. This is applied before the employment nil
    rate period is applied

A job seeker who is in a current employment income nil rate period,
whether due to their own or their partner's income does not have mutual
obligation requirements. In other words, if the customer's income
support payment reduces to nil, all their mutual obligations
requirements are deemed to be satisfied.

During the employment income nil rate period

The customer must remain qualified for their income support payment
during the employment income nil rate period. If qualification is lost
during the employment income nil rate period, the payment is to be
cancelled from the date that qualification stops. For example:

-   If a JobSeeker Payment (JSP) customer starts working in a full time
    job expected to last for at least 6 fortnights, they are no longer
    unemployed and payment should be cancelled once any Working Credits
    are depleted
    Note: this does not apply to JSP or YA (Other) customers who are
    employed under the Youth Bonus Wage Subsidy (YBWS) initiative. These
    customers will automatically suspend for 26 weeks instead of
    cancelling
-   If a Disability Support Pension (DSP) customer commences working for
    30 hours per week or more at the relevant minimum wage, they will
    not be entitled to the employment income nil rate period. However,
    payment may be suspended for up to 2 years

For Parenting Payment (PP) customers (under Age Pension age):

-   an employment income nil rate period can continue if their
    relationship status changes, and
-   their PP is reassessed (transfers between PPS and PPP)

However, an employment income nil rate period ends if a customer loses
qualification for their payment and transfers to another income support
payment. For example, a PPS customer's youngest dependent child turns 8
and they transfer to JSP.

Reporting income

During the employment income nil rate period a customer who would
normally report fortnightly must continue to report fortnightly. Failure
to report will result in the cancellation of payment. The payment can be
restored if they report their employment income at a later date. An
exemption to this is for payments that can no longer be claimed.

Care needs to be taken for payments that can no longer be claimed. If
the customer's payment is cancelled due to a failure to report income
these payments cannot be reclaimed even if it is still within the
employment income nil rate period. This applies to payment of JSP at the
transitional Wife Pension (WP) rate. In this case, the customer will
need to test their eligibility for another payment.

Note: if the customer's payment cancels due to failure to report income
due to staff error (for example, the income was coded but the payment
was not stimulated) then the payment can be restored.

Resuming income support payments

During the employment income nil rate period, if the customer's income
decreases or stops sufficiently:

-   they may become eligible for a part or full rate of income support
    payment, and
-   payment may resume without the need to make a new claim

Eligibility for nil rate period where partner receiving payment

If the customer has a partner:

their partner is also entitled to the employment income nil rate period
if all of the following are met:

-   the partner is receiving an income support payment entitled to the
    employment nil rate period
-   the partner is receiving a nil rate due to employment income
-   the customer's excess income reduces the partner's payment to zero

the customer is entitled to the employment income nil rate period if all
of the following are met:

-   the customer is receiving an income support payment entitled to the
    employment nil rate period
-   the partner has employment income
-   the partner's excess income reduces the customer's payment to zero

Impact on partner's payment

If an allowance customer has returned to full time work, their payments
will cancel once their Working Credits have been depleted. This is
because they are no longer entitled to the employment income nil rate
period due to a lack of qualification. If their partner is on Parenting
Payment Partnered (PPP), the system will:

-   SUS-INV the PPP customer's payments
-   automatically send an income estimate form for customer to complete
    for FTB and CCS estimate of income details update
-   create a manual follow up to check PPP entitlement

As the PPP customer is entitled to the employment income nil rate period
if under Age Pension age, the PPP will need to be restored if there are
no other changes to their entitlement. Smart Centre Call Service
Officers can do this once the customer's entitlement is established.

If the partner's payment is not dependent on the customer being current,
the partner's entitlement needs to be assessed based on the payment that
they are getting for:

-   Working Credits or the Work Bonus, and
-   the employment income nil rate period

Benefits retained

The benefits the customer can retain vary according to the income
support payment that they are qualified for. Provided the customer has
the required qualification, the following benefits can be retained while
the customer is in an employment income nil rate period:

Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A payment at the income tested rate for
certain customers:

-   Single customers will need to provide an income estimate when they
    enter an employment income nil rate period
-   Partnered customers will need to provide an income estimate when
    they enter an employment income nil rate period where:
    both customer and partner are receiving an income support payment
    and both are within an employment income nil rate period, or
    one member of the couple is in receipt of an income support payment
    and they enter an employment income nil rate period

FTB Part B:

-   Single customers receiving income support payments are paid FTB Part
    B at the maximum rate. FTB Part B is not income tested for single
    customers on income support payments
-   Partnered customers will need to provide an estimate of their income
    to be paid Part B. Partnered customers will have their Part B
    payments reconciled at the end of the income year

Rent Assistance (RA) in regards to the customer's partner is paid as if
they were both receiving an income support payment

customer's FTB Part A rate, navigate to the FTB Income Support Payment
Explanation Screen (FTBISPX).

Retained eligibility for add-ons

For the Allowance Income Test the customer's partner is treated as if
both members of the couple are receiving an income support payment

Entitlement to a Health Care Card (HCC) or Pensioner Concession Card
(PCC), whichever is applicable to customer. If a customer is currently
entitled to retain their PCC for a longer period, that period starts at
the date of the first fortnight of nil rate of payments

Education Entry Payment entitlement maintained, if eligible

Special Employment Advance entitlement maintained, if eligible

Supplementary benefits/payments such as:

-   Work for the Dole Supplement
-   Pensioner Education Supplement
-   Telephone Allowance (TAL), if receiving TAL before employment nil
    rate period
-   Language, Literacy and Numeracy Supplement (LLNS)

Concession cards

-   Customers continue to be entitled to the HCC for 12 weeks if they
    are in an employment income nil rate period
-   If the customer's payment stops due to a return to work or an
    increase in employment income, they are issued with an extension HCC
    for 26 weeks if they have been in receipt of that payment for 52
    weeks
-   For PPS customers, the 12 week continuation period runs concurrently
    with the extension period of 26 weeks. As a result, they have a
    continuation of the PCC during the employment income nil rate period
    and get an extension HCC for the balance of the 26 week extension
    period
-   PP customers who claimed payment on or after 1 July 2006 and have an
    assessed partial capacity to work, continue to be entitled to the
    PCC for 12 weeks if they are in an employment income nil rate
    period. They also get extended access to the PCC for another 52
    weeks if their payment stops on or after 1 January 2008 due to their
    employment income being sufficient to cancel their payment
-   PPP customers who claimed payment on or after 1 July 2006 and have
    an assessed partial capacity to work, continue to be entitled to the
    PCC for 12 weeks if they are in an employment income nil rate
    period. They also get extended access to the HCC for another 14
    weeks concurrently after the PCC extension if their payment stops on
    or after 1 January 2008 due to their or their partner's employment
    income being sufficient to cancel their payment
-   DSP customers who are below Age Pension age, whose payments are
    suspended for up to 2 years due to working 30 hours or more per
    week, are entitled to the PCC for 52 weeks from the date of
    suspension

Telephone Allowance (TAL)/Pension Supplement

Customers who qualify for TAL can continue to get it for 6 months (12
months for DSP under 21 with no dependent children) after their income
support payment is suspended or cancelled due to the customer or their
partner beginning employment. The customer must remain qualified for
TAL:

-   that is, be a telephone subscriber, during the extension period
-   if entitled, the 26 week extension of TAL starts from the end of the
    12 week employment nil rate period
-   TAL continues to be paid for those entitled through the 12 week
    employment nil rate period

TAL is not payable for customers getting:

-   Pension Supplement
-   the transitional rate of pension, or
-   the transitional rate of JSP
    Therefore, they are not eligible for a TAL extension if their
    payment is suspended or cancelled for an employment related reason.

PP customers who have an assessed partial capacity to work due to a
disability and who claimed PP on or after 1 July 2006 will be entitled
to a 52 week extension of TAL when:

-   their and/or their partner's employment income cancels their payment
    on or after 1 January 2008, and
-   they remain entitled to TAL

The Resources page has examples, historical information, and information
on system limitations for DSP and PP. This means that some payments are
not automatically cancelling after the employment income nil rate
period.
