|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Julie has a 30 hour per fortnight |
|                                   | mutual obligation requirement, as |
|                                   | principal carer of a child under  |
|                                   | 16. Julie works 40 hours a        |
|                                   | fortnight in a shop and is paid   |
|                                   | $14 an hour. Julie is paid $560 a |
|                                   | fortnight. The applicable hourly  |
|                                   | rate for Julie is the national    |
|                                   | minimum wage. This means Julie    |
|                                   | will satisfy the sufficient work  |
|                                   | test by earning at least $548.70, |
|                                   | which equals 30 hours at $19.84.  |
|                                   | As Julie's paid income exceed     |
|                                   | this requirement, and is working  |
|                                   | at least 30 hours in the          |
|                                   | fortnight, the sufficient work    |
|                                   | test is satisfied.                |

|                                   | If Julie was working 30 hours per |
|                                   | fortnight at the $13 per hour     |
|                                   | pay, this would not meet the      |
|                                   | sufficient work test as Julie     |
|                                   | would only be paid $390, rather   |
|                                   | than the $548.70 required based   |
|                                   | on the national minimum wage.     |

|                                   | Rahni is a principal carer, who   |
|                                   | currently works 30 hours a week   |
|                                   | at $19.84 an hour (national       |
|                                   | minimum wage rate) and fully      |
|                                   | satisfies the sufficient work     |
|                                   | test. Rahni takes leave for 2     |
|                                   | weeks at half-pay. This is        |
|                                   | regarded as being equivalent to   |
|                                   | 15 hours work per week at $19.84  |
|                                   | an hour, which still satisfies    |
|                                   | the sufficient work test.         |

|                                   | Yusuf is a principal carer        |
|                                   | working 15 hours a week at $19.84 |
|                                   | per hour, giving a wage of        |
|                                   | $548.70 per fortnight. Yusuf      |
|                                   | takes half-pay leave for 2 weeks, |
|                                   | which is equal to 7.5 hours work  |
|                                   | a week. This will not satisfy the |

|                                   | period and Yusuf will therefore   |
|                                   | have to undertake other           |
|                                   | activities or be referred to an   |
