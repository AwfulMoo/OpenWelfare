This document outlines how to pay Telephone Allowance (TAL) arrears
including the higher rate payable for eligible customers who subscribe
to a home internet service.

Payment of arrears of TAL

Arrears of TAL are only payable in restricted circumstances, which
include any of the following:

-   If it can be proven that the customer's telephone number was not
    recorded on their Centrelink record when they advised
-   If it can be proven that the customer's home internet provider
    details were not recorded on their Centrelink record when they
    advised. The earliest date for payment of arrears of the higher rate
    of TAL is 20 March 2008
-   If it can be proven that the customer was recorded as being a
    non-subscriber when they had advised they were the telephone
    subscriber
-   The customer's record has been restored because of suspension or
    cancellation and the customer is recorded as a telephone subscriber.
    This is an automatic issue of arrears, and therefore will not be
    addressed in this procedure, or
-   If it can be proven that the customer's internet connection details
    failed to be collected, either in the March 2008 mailout or
    subsequently, before the claim forms being updated with internet
    subscriber questions

The customer has to have been eligible for TAL for the whole period they
are claiming the arrears. There is no actual limit on payment of TAL
arrears if Services Australia is at fault.

Arrears of the difference between the basic and higher rates of TAL can
also be paid. The way arrears are paid is different in each system.

The Resources page has a link to mySupport to report customers where TAL
needs to be paid beyond the limiting date.
