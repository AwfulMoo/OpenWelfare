| 7                                 | Question: When a person is        |
|                                   | evicted from their home, are they |

|                                   | Answer: Eviction is not           |
|                                   | considered as extreme             |

|                                   | giving tenants sufficient         |
|                                   | notification before leaving the   |
|                                   | home, the situation is therefore  |
|                                   | not unforeseen.                   |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | evictions. Check the relevant     |
|                                   | state or territory tenancy laws   |
|                                   | via their official websites to    |
|                                   | make sure the claimant can        |
|                                   | demonstrate the eviction was      |
|                                   | unlawful.                         |

|                                   | The intention of CrP is to help   |
|                                   | customers who have suffered an    |
|                                   | extreme circumstance where it is  |
|                                   | unreasonable to expect the person |
|                                   | to remain in, or return to their  |
|                                   | home. For example, a person who   |
|                                   | has been forced from their home   |
|                                   | due to a house fire that renders  |
|                                   | the home uninhabitable would      |
|                                   | qualify for CrP, as it would be   |
|                                   | unreasonable to expect them to    |
|                                   | remain in the home. Verification  |
|                                   | of the extreme circumstance by a  |
|                                   | third party is also needed, for   |
|                                   | example, by police or fire        |
|                                   | brigade. Each case should be      |
|                                   | considered on its own merits.     |

|                                   | Answer: Each person who has been  |

|                                   | of extreme circumstances, may     |
|                                   | qualify for a CrP. For example,   |
|                                   | each member of a couple receiving |
|                                   | Age Pension may both qualify for  |
|                                   | a CrP. Similarly, each member of  |
|                                   | a group house receiving Youth     |
|                                   | Allowance may be entitled to a    |
|                                   | CrP if their house burnt down.    |
