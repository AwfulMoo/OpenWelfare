|                                   | considered as extreme             |

|                                   | home. For example, a person who   |

|                                   | due to a house fire that renders  |

|                                   | qualify for CrP, as it would be   |
|                                   | unreasonable to expect them to    |
|                                   | remain in the home. Verification  |
|                                   | of the extreme circumstance by a  |
|                                   | third party is also needed, for   |
|                                   | example, by police or fire        |
|                                   | brigade. Each case should be      |

|                                   | Answer: Each person who has been  |

|                                   | of extreme circumstances, may     |
|                                   | qualify for a CrP. For example,   |
|                                   | each member of a couple receiving |

|                                   | a CrP. Similarly, each member of  |
|                                   | a group house receiving Youth     |
|                                   | Allowance may be entitled to a    |

|                                   | Answer: No. CrP is not payable if |

|                                   | other homeless people. If a       |
|                                   | person becomes homeless because   |
|                                   | of an extreme circumstance - for  |
|                                   | example, the person has been cast |
|                                   | out by their community and they   |
|                                   | would be placing themselves at    |
|                                   | risk of violence by returning to  |
|                                   | their community - then the person |
|                                   | may qualify for a CrP at that     |
|                                   | point of becoming homeless. It    |
|                                   | would be hoped that the CrP may   |
|                                   | then help them establish a new    |
|                                   | home and they would not be forced |
|                                   | to live in 'long grass'. However, |
|                                   | a person who is already homeless  |
|                                   | would not qualify for a CrP       |
|                                   | because of an extreme             |
|                                   | circumstance rendering them still |
|                                   | homeless. Therefore, a bush fire  |
|                                   | burning the long grass that       |
|                                   | people are living in would not    |
|                                   | qualify as a forced departure     |
|                                   | from home for the purposes of     |
|                                   | CrP.                              |

|                                   | CrP under the assumption that the |
