This document outlines the process for revaluing managed investments,
shares and securities and how to use the trial revaluation facility for
customer requested revaluations.

On this Page:

Revaluation of market-linked managed investments listed on MIN system

The value of a customer’s stake in a market-linked managed investment is
based on the value of the units. These unitised managed investments and
their values are updated on a monthly basis, using prices from the last
working day of each month.

The updated prices are not automatically applied to the unitised managed
investments recorded on the customer's record. A revaluation happens:

on 20 March and 20 September automatically, or

when a customer:

-   updates the number of units they hold, or
-   requests a revaluation

Revaluation of shares and securities in listed public companies

The value of shares in public companies listed on the Australian
Securities Exchange (ASX) are loaded on to the system fortnightly.

The updated share prices are not automatically applied to the shares and
securities recorded on the customer's record. A revaluation of a
customer’s shares happens:

on 20 March and 20 September automatically, or

when a customer:

-   updates the number of shares they hold, or
-   requests a revaluation

The Financial Industry and Network Support (FINS) Helpdesk obtains the
updated share prices:

-   Each month, or at other times on request, for public companies
    listed on the other Australian stock exchanges, such as the National
    Stock Exchange (NSX)
-   Biannually for overseas listed public companies on 31 January and 31
    July. They are coded before the automatic revaluation that occurs in
    March and September

For more details about the coding of overseas investments, contact the
FINS Helpdesk.

Exchange rate updates in March and September

Overseas bank accounts and overseas unlisted shares with an overseas
currency recorded are automatically updated with the latest exchange
rates on 20 March and 20 September.

Listed shares and unitised managed investment updates occur in March and
September and as part of the same job:

-   customers with overseas bank accounts, and unlisted sharers are
    selected
-   the value following the exchange rate change is refreshed, and
-   the asset value recalculated for the purpose of deeming

Managed investments and shares excluded from the automatic revaluation process

The following managed investments are not automatically revalued:

-   account based managed investments
-   unitised investments not listed on the MIN system
-   non ASX listed and unlisted shares and securities

Manual Follow-up (MFU) reviews

On 20 March and 20 September, a manual follow-up activity is created on
all customer records that have:

-   one or more unlisted non-superannuation managed investments, and
-   Australian unlisted shares and securities

Revaluation of private trusts and company owned managed investments or shares

Managed investments or shares owned by a private trust or company are
revalued with any review of, or investment update within, the trust or
company. The latest prices/values are automatically applied at the time
of the review to update and include within the attributable assets.

Customer requests for revaluation

Customers are able to request a revaluation at any time of their:

-   market-linked managed investments
-   listed shares
-   securities

The system cannot revalue just one type of share or managed investment.
If a revaluation occurs, all unitised managed investments and listed
shares on the customer's record will be included.
