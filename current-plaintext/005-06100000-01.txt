This document outlines the process when the Department of Home Affairs
requires Services Australia to reduce the customer’s Status Resolution
Support Services (SRSS) payment to recover monies owed to them.

Services Australia debt vs the Department of Home Affairs’ debt

A debt to Services Australia occurs if the customer has received an
amount of SRSS payment that they were not entitled to, for example:

a change in circumstances occurs for a period already paid to the
customer and the SRSS payment is reassessed

loss of entitlement to SRSS payment, such as:

-   change of visa status
-   relationship status
-   care of dependent children
-   accommodation
-   rent
-   left the country
-   in prison
-   liquid assets over the allowable limit

income received, such as:

-   income from employment
-   self-employment
-   compensation
-   investments has not been taken into account when calculating the
    SRSS payment paid

Administrative or system error

A Department of Home Affairs debt occurs when a SRSS customer is
required to repay amounts provided to them by a Department of Home
Affairs contracted service provider.

These may include:

-   financial loans
-   pay for damages to a property
-   unpaid utilities bill
-   other services

How the Department of Home Affairs advises Services Australia of the debt

Money owing to the Department of Home Affairs will not be ‘raised as a
debt’ on the Services Australia's system. Department of Home Affairs
will advise Services Australia:

-   the debt via the data link, and
-   the deduction will be automatically applied to the customer's
    payment

Five per cent (5%) of a customer's total SRSS payment (after the income
test is applied) will be deducted each fortnight until:

-   the Department of Home Affairs' debt is fully repaid, or
-   the customer's SRSS payment is cancelled

Services Australia advises the Department of Home Affairs when the total
sum of money has been recovered. This advice will be provided
automatically to the Department of Home Affairs via the data link.

Notifying the customer of a Department of Home Affairs debt

The Department of Home Affairs are responsible for managing the details
of the money owing including:

-   notifying the customer they have to repay money, and
-   advising the customer when the money owing has been repaid in full

All enquiries regarding debts as a result of monies owed to the
Department of Home Affairs should be referred to the customer's
Department of Home Affairs contracted Service Providers .

Services Australia and the Department of Home Affairs debt recovery hierarchy

In the debt recovery hierarchy, the Department of Home Affairs debts are
recovered first. For example, a SRSS customer has a Services Australia
debt being recovered by withholdings from their SRSS payment and
Services Australia are then advised of a Department of Home Affairs
debt. The Services Australia debt withholdings are to cease and the
Department of Home Affairs deduction recovery is to commence. All
outstanding Services Australia debts are transferred to the Department
of Home Affairs.
