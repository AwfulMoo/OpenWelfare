Crisis Payment.

Government intent

Crisis Payment (CrP) is a one-off, non-taxable payment that is designed
to help new and existing Services Australia customers who are in severe
financial hardship.

Customers experiencing a crisis may be eligible for a Crisis Payment
(CrP).

Common criteria for claiming CrP

The common criteria for customers claiming CrP:

-   the customer is qualified (and payable) for a social security
    benefit, social security pension or ABSTUDY Living Allowance
-   the customer is in severe financial hardship
-   the claim for CrP is made within Australia
-   the customer's participation payment is not payable due to a penalty
    applied for failing to meet a compulsory requirement
-   the customer is not subject to an unemployment non-payment period or
    a serious failure period

Note: CrP is not generally payable to customers who are subject to an
Assurance of Support (AoS), however may be payable if it is unreasonable
for the assuree to accept the assurer's support.

The Resources page contains intranet links to the Crisis Payment fact
