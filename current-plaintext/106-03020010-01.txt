This document outlines information about the start days for payments and
identifies the start days that can be backdated.

Backdating provisions

Backdating provisions differ for each payment. As a general rule, if a
person claims a payment and is qualified on the day the claim is made,
that is the start day.

A customer's start date may be backdated to an earlier day before the
day on which they lodged a completed claim if the person is qualified
and the claim is made:

-   after a partner's claim
-   as a transfer to another payment
-   after childbirth
-   by an incapacitated customer
-   after the death of a partner
-   when a contact has indicated an intention to claim for a customer
    experiencing a vulnerable circumstance
