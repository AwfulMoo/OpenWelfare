-   customer status is either CUR, CZR, SUS or ASS

The Manage Study Details service will record relevant information about
the course of study. If possible, it will update the customer's record.
If this is not possible, a started manual handoff will be generated via
Workload Management (WLM) in Customer First. This has an interaction
with Notes detailing the required steps to process the update. This
requires the Service Officer to complete an open ISIS activity, which
will be started in the Customer First activity notes.

Using this service, the customer can do one or a combination of the
following:

Add a new course

Edit current course information, including:

-   contact hours
-   study load
-   student ID
-   confirm/update their student end date (this includes if they are no
    longer studying)
-   confirm the course end date is correct and, if necessary, correct it
-   remove a future course which has not started yet (My profile only)
-   notify they intend to stop receiving an income support payment, and
-   book a participation appointment to transfer to the YA Jobseeker
    activity test (if they are YA full-time or concessional study load
    student and under 22 years of age)

Decisions (if eligible), when adding a new course or editing an existing
course

YA job seekers returning to study

Customers receiving YA as a job seeker are able to use the Manage Study
Details Service to provide their course details if they are returning to
study. Depending on the circumstance, once the study details are
provided the system may automatically transfer the customer to YA
(student). If the system is unable to complete the update automatically,
a manual work item will be created for action by a Service Officer.

A WLM work item will be created for action by a Service Officer when the
customer:

-   had a previous student end date 14 days in the past
-   is independent for reason Partial Capacity for Work (PCW)
-   is under 18 years of age and has not completed year 12 and has a
    study exception
-   is receiving AFH rate due to improved job prospects
-   indicates they are not studying full-time or
-   indicates they were studying part time in the previous period, or
-   has a waiting period applied on their record with a status of
    YAL-JSK/ASS and the student start date is within the waiting period

Notes for staff are applied to the WLM items that must be assessed
manually.

Update study details for future intent to study

Using the Manage Study Details service, the student can advise their
future study intentions and if they will:

-   not be studying in the next available study period and will need no
    more help from Services Australia
-   not be studying in the next available study period and will need
    help from the agency
-   be continuing or intending to study as a full-time student in the
    next available semester within 20 weeks of their current student end
    date. Youth Allowance (YA) or Austudy students in this situation
    will normally have been sent a Course Details Required (SY074)
    letter 21 days before the end of their intention to study period
-   be continuing as a part-time EPA or EPF student in the next
    available semester
-   advise future education or study details for any new course details
    after their current course finishes

to provide their family home address for assessing their eligibility for
the regional rate of Relocation scholarship.

Customers who advise a new course of study or change their current
course details may have the option to Accept and/or Decline SSL for
current or future loan periods.

Locating study update hand offs from an online update

Workload Manger (WLM) will allocate a Change of Circumstance (CoC)
transaction to a suitably skilled Service Officer, if a YA, PES, ABSTUDY
or Austudy customer:

-   updates their study details through their Centrelink online account
    or Express Plus Centrelink mobile app, and
-   the system does not complete the study update and/or Student
    Start-up Loan update

Staff can also follow up study interactions on customer records by using
the search options inside the Customer Online Account section of the
workspace screen. Information about why the handoff has failed can be
viewed in the Notes tab and the Attachments tab within the Interaction.

page can be accessed from the Attachments tab within the Interaction.
