This document outlines the effect on a customer's entitlement to
Pensioner Education Supplement (PES) payment if they become
incapacitated.

Reduced study load

If the student continues to study with a reduced study load they may be
entitled to continue to receive PES with a study load concession.

Cessation of studies

If the student ceases to be enrolled in their course or ceases to
undertake study, they would lose their qualification for PES but this
would not affect their qualification for their PES Attracting Payment.
