This document outlines the duties and responsibilities of Service
Officers, Intensive Collection Services Referral Officers, Departure
Prohibition Order (DPO) specialists and the delegated decision makers
when issuing a DPO.

Departure Prohibition Order

A DPO prevents a child support debtor, including a debtor with an
overpayment, from leaving Australia. If a payer attempts to leave
Australia when a DPO is in force they will be physically stopped at the
point of departure by the Australian Federal Police (AFP).

DPOs place significant restrictions on the normal liberties of citizens,
residents and visitors to Australia and are only made after serious
consideration of all relevant circumstances.
