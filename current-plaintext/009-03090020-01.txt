This document outlines information about processing the death of a care
receiver who is a lower Adult Disability Assessment Tool (ADAT) score
adult.

Effect on carer when lower ADAT score adult dies

When a lower ADAT score adult dies, the carer is entitled to a
continuation of Carer Payment (CP) during the bereavement period and a
bereavement lump sum is payable to the carer, equivalent to the amount
the care receiver would have received up to the end of the bereavement
period of 14 weeks.
