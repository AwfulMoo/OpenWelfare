|                                   | Wendy had a child in September    |
|                                   | 2015 and failed to take           |
|                                   | maintenance action for the child. |
|                                   | Over the years, Wendy was in      |
|                                   | contact with Services Australia   |
|                                   | many times advising of the wish   |
|                                   | to apply for a parentage unknown  |
|                                   | exemption. Wendy was not aware    |
|                                   | who the father was. On many       |
|                                   | occasions, Wendy even attended    |
|                                   | social worker appointments to     |
|                                   | request an exemption.             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | On each occasion, Wendy was       |
|                                   | advised of the need to provide    |
|                                   | the child's birth certificate to  |
|                                   | show that the father was not      |
|                                   | named. Wendy's FTB increased      |
|                                   | several times because of these    |
|                                   | discussions. This was due to      |
|                                   | Wendy advising the birth          |
|                                   | certificate would be supplied     |
|                                   | within the specified timeframe.   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | In November 2020, Wendy again     |
|                                   | contacted and requested an        |
|                                   | exemption. Wendy was again        |
|                                   | advised of the need to provide    |
|                                   | the child's birth certificate. In |
|                                   | December 2020, Wendy provided the |
|                                   | child's birth certificate showing |
|                                   | the father was not named.         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The social worker assessing       |
|                                   | Wendy's case requested that the   |
|                                   | exemption be backdated to the     |
|                                   | child's date of birth in 2015.    |
|                                   | The reason is the identity of the |
|                                   | father had been unknown from      |
|                                   | then.                             |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | established before the exemption  |
|                                   | can be backdated to the child's   |
|                                   | date of birth in 2015 because:    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   the exemption was requested   |
|                                   |     in the 2020-21 financial year |
|                                   |     and                           |
|                                   | -   the social worker is          |
|                                   |     recommending the exemption be |
|                                   |     backdated to September 2015,  |
|                                   |     which is before the start of  |
|                                   |     the previous financial year   |
|                                   |     (1 July 2019)                 |

|                                   | The case is referred to the       |

|                                   | when Ebony was granted a MAT      |
|                                   | exemption due to violence (VIO).  |
|                                   | Recently however Ebony's income   |
|                                   | has increased substantially,      |

|                                   | could go from being the payee to  |

|                                   | (potential) payer is the victim.  |

|                                   | relationship in their care        |
|                                   | generally does not apply. They    |
|                                   | are regarded as having taken      |
|                                   | reasonable action by virtue of    |
|                                   | the fact that the child/ren in    |
|                                   | their care would be included in   |
|                                   | the overall assessment. The       |
|                                   | potential payer (Daniel) should   |
|                                   | be advised that they will end up  |
|                                   | being the payer in the case due   |
|                                   | to the other children being       |
|                                   | included in the assessment.       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If Daniel chooses to proceed with |
|                                   | the child support application,    |
|                                   | the assessment will take all 3    |
|                                   | children into account. Due to     |
|                                   | Samantha having a lower income,   |
|                                   | Samantha becomes the payee. This  |
|                                   | will have the effect of           |
|                                   | overriding Samantha's violence    |
|                                   | exemption with details of the     |
|                                   | child support case, even though   |
|                                   | Samantha did not apply for child  |
|                                   | support. This means that          |
|                                   | Samantha's FTB will potentially   |
|                                   | be reduced due to maintenance     |
|                                   | income, even though Samantha did  |
|                                   | not initiate the child support    |
|                                   | case.                             |

|                                   | recommencement of the child       |
|                                   | support case as Samantha does not |

|                                   | father of the children due to     |
|                                   | domestic violence issues. Check   |
|                                   | whether the social worker made a  |

|                                   | rate. In this scenario, when the  |

|                                   | Australia, they should be         |

|                                   | be applied/coded. This may        |
|                                   | prevent the payer from restarting |

|                                   | Australia because FTB Part A      |
|                                   | payment has reduced               |

|                                   | Carolyn explains that if the      |
|                                   | other parent is asked for child   |
|                                   | support, there is a concern that  |
|                                   | the other parent may end their    |
|                                   | life. Carolyn advises that the    |
|                                   | other parent is currently         |
|                                   | hospitalised due to serious       |
|                                   | mental health problems.           |

|                                   | Carolyn advises that although     |

|                                   | helps the ex-partner a lot at the |
|                                   | moment. The ex-partner has        |
|                                   | elderly parents and just lost a   |
|                                   | job.                              |

|                                   | support assessment. Carolyn       |
|                                   | agrees that this would be a good  |
|                                   | option and is referred to a       |

|                                   | confirms they cannot help. Wendy  |
|                                   | presents this letter to           |
