AIC - Additional Boarding Allowance - Request for Boarding Fees

Examples - determining Boarding Allowance eligibility

Determining whether a living arrangement is boarding or a second home
can be difficult. Where the family (parents, student or a sibling) sign
a rental agreement and/or self cater for cooking and laundry, the
residence is more likely to be a second home arrangement rather than a
boarding arrangement. Some educational institutions offer a boarding
arrangement and a second home arrangement (rental units), so care is
needed to determine the correct rate of payment.

Note: Boarding Allowance includes Additional Boarding Allowance where
appropriate.

| Example                           | Description                       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| At a hostel                       | Genevieve is living away from     |
|                                   | home to study Year 12 at Study    |
|                                   | College and will be residing in   |
|                                   | accommodation at Student Housing  |
|                                   | Hostel. A tenancy agreement is    |
|                                   | required to be signed and         |
|                                   | services such as the supplying of |
|                                   | linen, meals and laundry are      |
|                                   | Genevieve's responsibility. This  |
|                                   | is therefore not a boarding       |
|                                   | arrangement but may be payable as |
|                                   | Second Home Allowance.            |

| At a school                       | Alistair is studying Year 11 at a |
|                                   | Senior College in Tasmania and    |
|                                   | will be living away from home in  |
|                                   | the accommodation provided by the |
|                                   | College at their Boarding         |
|                                   | Association. As the Association   |
|                                   | is providing the room and the     |
|                                   | full range of services (that is,  |
|                                   | meals and laundry), this can be   |
|                                   | assessed for Boarding Allowance.  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Alistair's sibling, Arabella is   |
|                                   | also studying at the Senior       |
|                                   | College in Tasmania, and living   |
|                                   | away from home. However, Arabella |
|                                   | will be living at the College in  |
|                                   | a self-contained unit rented by   |
|                                   | their parents. Boarding Allowance |
|                                   | is not appropriate but Second     |
|                                   | Home Allowance may be payable.    |

| With a sibling                    | An AIC claim is lodged for Jerome |
|                                   | for boarding away from home for   |
|                                   | secondary study and states Jerome |
|                                   | will be living with an elder      |
|                                   | sibling, Thomas. A check of       |
|                                   | Thomas' record shows Thomas is 21 |
|                                   | years old and in receipt of the   |
|                                   | dependent rate of Youth Allowance |
|                                   | (that is, based on the parent's   |
|                                   | income). As Jerome is living with |
|                                   | an older dependent sibling,       |
|                                   | Boarding Allowance is not         |
|                                   | payable. However, Second Home     |
|                                   | Allowance may be payable as the   |
|                                   | cost of maintaining the term      |
|                                   | residence is being met by         |
|                                   | Jerome's family.                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Casey is boarding away from home  |
|                                   | for secondary studies and will be |
|                                   | living with an older sibling. The |
|                                   | sibling is 21 years of age and in |
|                                   | receipt of the Independent rate   |
|                                   | of Youth Allowance because of     |
|                                   | being married with a child. As    |
|                                   | the sibling is independent of the |
|                                   | parent's income and is providing  |
|                                   | the full boarding services, the   |
|                                   | Boarding Allowance may be payable |
|                                   | in this private boarding          |
|                                   | arrangement.                      |

| With a grandparent/other person   | Ernestina's parents lodge an AIC  |
|                                   | claim for Boarding Allowance      |
|                                   | stating Ernestina will be living  |
|                                   | with a grandparent in a home the  |

|                                   | Allowance may be payable.         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Napoleon's parents have claimed   |
|                                   | AIC Boarding Allowance stating    |
|                                   | Napoleon will be living with an   |
|                                   | uncle in a home the family have   |
|                                   | set up in town. The parents have  |
|                                   | signed the lease and the uncle    |
|                                   | will be providing the cooking and |
|                                   | laundry. In this case, even       |
|                                   | though the uncle is providing the |
|                                   | services, the parents are         |
|                                   | maintaining the residence by      |
|                                   | paying for all the rent,          |
|                                   | utilities and food. In this       |
|                                   | situation, Second Home Allowance  |
|                                   | is the more appropriate payment.  |

| Shared home                       | Two families, the ZZZ family and  |
|                                   | the YYY family, have set up a     |
|                                   | shared home in town for their     |
|                                   | children to live away from home   |
|                                   | and go to the local secondary     |
|                                   | school. They are eligible for AIC |
|                                   | as their principal family homes   |
|                                   | are geographically isolated. The  |
|                                   | ZZZ family have signed the lease  |
|                                   | and 1 parent resides in the       |
|                                   | 'in-town' home with the children  |
|                                   | during the school week, while the |
|                                   | other parent lives at the         |
|                                   | principal family home. The YYY    |
|                                   | family share the costs of running |
|                                   | the home, but are not on the      |
|                                   | lease. The ZZZ parent does all    |
|                                   | the cooking and cleaning,         |
|                                   | etcetera. In this case, the ZZZ   |
|                                   | family may be paid the Second     |
|                                   | Home Allowance. The YYY family    |
|                                   | may claim the Boarding Allowance. |
|                                   | If both families were on the      |
|                                   | lease and/or sharing the duties,  |
|                                   | then both could only claim the    |
|                                   | Second Home Allowance.            |
