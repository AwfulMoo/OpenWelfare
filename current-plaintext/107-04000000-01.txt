This document outlines topics dealing with raising debts.

When a debt is identified

When a debt is recoverable:

-   it is raised and recorded in the Debt Management and Information
    System (DMIS)
-   the customer will get an Account Payable letter

Debts managed in Process Direct will have the Account Payable issued via
Process Direct. See:

-   Raising Child Care Subsidy (CCS) debts in Process Direct
-   Debt screens in Process Direct

The role of Services Australia staff when raising debts is to:

-   raise a debt as quickly as possible
-   make the customer aware of the debt as soon as it occurs
-   meet timeliness performance standards

For deceased customers see:

-   Requesting refunds and raising debts for deceased customer
-   Recovering debts from a deceased customer's estate
