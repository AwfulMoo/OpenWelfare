Emergency payments

Emergency payments include:

-   Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment (AGDRP)
-   Disaster Recovery Payment for New Zealand Special Category
    (subclass 444) visa holders (NZ DRP) - previously known as ex-gratia
    DRP
-   Disaster Recovery Allowance (DRA)
-   Disaster Recovery Allowance for New Zealand Special Category
    (subclass 444) visa holders (NZ DRA), and
-   Australian Victim of Terrorism Overseas Payment (AVTOP)

Closed emergency payments

When a claiming period for an emergency event (for example, major
disaster or terrorist attack) has ended, an emergency payment is then
closed. Claims may only be lodged if special circumstances apply.

Allowable claiming periods are different for different types of
emergency payments.

Claims lodged after claiming period has closed

For AGDRP, NZ DRP, DRA and NZ DRA, see Emergency payment claims lodged
outside of the time limit.

For AVTOP, see Australian Victim of Terrorism Overseas Payment (AVTOP)
claims lodged outside of the time limit.
