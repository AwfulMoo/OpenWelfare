payments subject to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) for providers.

About GST

The GST is a consumption-based tax levied in Australia on goods,
services and activities, rather than directly on income. GST is applied
to a number of Allied Health items and services administered on behalf
of the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) by Services Australia.

GST and Services Australia

Many health services, such as Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits
Scheme (PBS), are free from the GST. However, the Australian Taxation
Office (ATO) has advised that GST should apply to some payments,
including some of those paid on behalf of the Department of Veterans'
Affairs (DVA). Under those circumstances, the payment itself is deemed
under GST law to be a 'consideration for a supply' that is, a payment
for a service that you are deemed to be rendering to us or the
Australian Government.

GST and Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA)

All DVA medical and hospital services are GST exempt. The system will
automatically apply GST to Allied Health GST items when claims are
assessed. The GST amount should not be included in the claim keyed by
VAP Processing Officers for GST items. The GST amount is calculated
automatically on the base fee that is charged by providers.
