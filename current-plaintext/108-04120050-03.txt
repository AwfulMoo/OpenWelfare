|                                   | of whether it is unreasonable to  |
|                                   | expect a customer to sell or      |
|                                   | realise an asset.                 |

|                                   | for a pension customer to sell or |
|                                   | realise an asset:                 |

|                                   | -   a pension customer has a long |
|                                   |     term attachment to a property |
|                                   |     on which he or she has lived  |
|                                   |     for 20 years or more, unless  |
|                                   |     he or she can subdivide and   |

|                                   |     the home is situated          |
|                                   | -   the property is a farm and    |
|                                   |     the claimant has been a       |
|                                   |     farmer for at least 20 years  |
|                                   |     and still farms the property, |

|                                   | unforeseen circumstances, have    |
|                                   | continued to live on the property |
|                                   | (or in the environment) for an    |

|                                   | -   for example, a couple         |
|                                   |     purchased a farming property  |
|                                   |     and, ten years later, the     |

|                                   |     and children. In this case it |
|                                   |     can be accepted the widow has |
|                                   |     a long term attachment to the |
|                                   |     property                      |

|                                   | It is also unreasonable to expect |
|                                   | a customer to sell:               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If a farmer or other              |
