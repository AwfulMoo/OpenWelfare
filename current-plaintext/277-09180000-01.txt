This document outlines the process to follow when a customer appeals a
Child Support decision to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT).

Appealing to the AAT

A customer may apply to the AAT for a review of a decision to:

-   disallow, allow or part-allow an objection, or
-   refuse an application for an extension of time to lodge an objection

The AAT refer to this process as an ‘application for review'.

The AAT requires customers to make an application for an AAT first
review within a specified time after they receive notification of the
objection decision. If a customer wants to apply for an AAT first review
outside of those time limits, they can request an extension of time. The
AAT refer to this process as an ‘application for extension of time for
review’. Operational Blueprint procedures refer to this process as an
‘AAT EOT application’.
