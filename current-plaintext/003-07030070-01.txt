This document outlines what to do when a customer has been in prison, or
is currently in prison, but their record does not contain any
information to support their incarceration.

Data matching and overpayments

When a customer is imprisoned, they might not be matched with data
received by Service Zone staff or during the national data match
process. Where this occurs, customers may be incorrectly paid while in
prison, resulting in overpayments.

Affected customers may be identified when they apply for a pre-release
payment or after they are released from prison.

The Resources page contains a link to confirming prison and juvenile
justice releases and a sample NSW Corrective Services release/discharge
certificate. It also contains the Queensland Watch house fax proforma.
