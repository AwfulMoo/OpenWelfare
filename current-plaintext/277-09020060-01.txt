This document outlines the process for Child Support staff to record
customer complaints and compliments in Cuba.

Principles of good documentation

Child Support staff use the Complaints handling macro to document the
details of a complaint and create a document for the complaint record in
Cuba.

See Documenting Child Support information for information about
documentation best practice.

Recording compliments

Record a compliment if a customer gives a compliment about a Service
Officer, the service provided by Child Support or a product. Compliments
are a good way to recognise staff and contribute to a quality service.
