This document outlines information about which documents are needed by
the Services Australia to assess the income and assets from a private
trust or a Special Disability Trust (SDT). Information is also provided
on why these documents are required for the assessment.

Rules from 1 January 2002

From 1 January 2002, the way private trusts are assessed under the
Income and Assets Tests changed. The determination of a customer's
assessable income and assets in respect of their involvement in a
private trust is made by a Complex Assessment Officer (CAO), based on
information provided in the Private Trust form (MOD PT) or Special
Disability Trust form (MOD SDT) and accompanying documents.

MOD PT or MOD SDT forms

Service Officers are responsible for providing the customer with the MOD
PT or MOD SDT, if the new claim or a review triggers it to be issued.
The Service Officer will also obtain from the customer all the relevant
documentation as detailed in the checklist in Part D of the MOD PT or
the checklist of the MOD SDT.

Note: if the customer is involved in more than one private trust they
will need to complete a separate form for each private trust and provide
the documents in the checklist for each private trust.

These documents are needed by the CAO to determine the assessable income
and assets of the private trust and to whom the assessable income and
assets are attributed. This may be used to determine the rate of an
income support payment under the Social Security Act 1991, or ongoing
entitlement to a Low Income Health Care Card (LIC) for impacted
customers.

Services Australia requires the completed modules, and any other
documents that may be required for the assessment, within 14 days of
them being issued.

Required documents and financial statements

Following is a list of the types of documents and financial statements
that may be needed to assess a private trust or SDT.

Note: all of the documents and financial statements listed may not be
needed, only those that are applicable to the individual customer and
the trust they are involved in:

-   Private Trust form (MOD PT) or Special Disability Trust form (MOD
    SDT)
-   Private Company form (MOD PC), only if the trustee is a corporate
    trustee
-   Business Details form (MOD F), only for partnerships and primary
    production aggregation
-   Trust Real Estate details section of the MOD PT for each property
    held by the trust including the home of the customer and their
    partner
-   loan agreement for each liability of the Trust
-   the latest individual tax return for the customer and their partner,
    if applicable
-   the latest tax return for the private trust in which the customer or
    their partner is involved, including the complete financial
    statements

-   notes to and forming part of the accounts
-   initial trust deed, or the original (or a certified copy of the
    original) statutory declaration or legal document of your
    resignation from the trust, which also states you will not exert any
    control over, or benefit in any way, from the trust
-   council rates notice for each property held by the trust
-   for a SDT - a copy of a will if the trust is the result of monies
    from a death bequest
-   for a SDT - the trust deed(s), schedules showing contribution(s) or
    Donor Register and Statutory Declaration(s) by Trustee(s)
-   evidence the trust has had a change in circumstance or any
    additional information the customer would like Services Australia to
    consider

Documents that may be requested at a later stage

The following documents may be requested at a later stage, if required:

-   for a private trust - the trust deed, deed of settlement, or will
-   last return to the Australian Securities and Investment Commission
    (ASIC)
-   the schedule of unit holders if the trust is a unit trust
-   certificate of title for each property held by the trust
-   certificates for share investments held by the trust
-   certificates for managed investments held by the trust

If several customers are involved in the same trust, some of the
documents required may already have been provided to Services Australia.
For example, the agency may already have been provided with the latest
financial statements of the trust by another customer.
