|                                   | particularly suited to that area  |
|                                   | and no family living there. Sam   |
|                                   | may serve a MALEP employment      |
|                                   | related exclusion period. If Sam  |
|                                   | moves, eligibility for payment    |
|                                   | for 26 weeks may be affected.     |
|                                   | However, if Sam provides evidence |
|                                   | showing that job prospects will   |
|                                   | improve (vacancies, demand for    |
|                                   | skills, etc.) the decision would  |
|                                   | be reconsidered.                  |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | been unable to find work. Anita   |

|                                   | considering moving to Torquay,    |
|                                   | Victoria. Anita does not have a   |
|                                   | job to go to but thought moving   |
|                                   | there would be nice. Anita will   |
|                                   | not be reducing employment        |
|                                   | prospects by more than 2% and     |
|                                   | will be eligible for JobSeeker    |
|                                   | Payment (JSP) while looking for   |
|                                   | work. Anita can move and still be |
|                                   | paid JSP as the move is to an     |
|                                   | area where the unemployment rate  |
|                                   | is not more than 2 percentage     |
|                                   | points higher than in the         |
|                                   | previous area and job             |
|                                   | opportunities are considered to   |
|                                   | be comparable. Anita will not     |
|                                   | have to serve a MALEP employment  |
|                                   | related exclusion period.         |

|                                   | Noel recently moved from          |
|                                   | Canberra, ACT to Wagga Wagga,     |
|                                   | NSW. The unemployment rate is     |
|                                   | more than 2% higher than in the   |
|                                   | previous area. As there were no   |
|                                   | special reasons for moving to     |
|                                   | Wagga Wagga, Noel is ineligible   |
|                                   | for payment for 26 weeks. Noel    |
|                                   | can no longer afford to live in   |
|                                   | Wagga Wagga and is considering    |
|                                   | moving back to Canberra. The move |
|                                   | back to Canberra will make Noel   |
|                                   | eligible for JSP again. The       |
|                                   | non-payment period will be waived |
|                                   | for the remainder of the 26 weeks |
|                                   | employment related exclusion      |
|                                   | period.                           |

|                                   | To avoid foreclosure on their     |
|                                   | mortgage a job seeker sells their |
|                                   | home and moves to an area of      |

|                                   | because it is more affordable.    |

|                                   | the delegate may decide that a    |
|                                   | MALEP should not apply.           |
