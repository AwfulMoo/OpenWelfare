This document outlines information needed to process a manual aged care
means assessment. It does not cover the process for manual reassessments
of a previously completed means assessment.

Historical SPARC process

The System for the Payment of Aged Residential Care (SPARC) is the
legacy aged care payment system for residential care. SPARC is a view
only system from 20 August 2022.

To view the legacy SPARC process, see the historical version.

When to complete a manual means assessment

When a care recipient leaves care and no means assessment is completed
prior to their departure a manual means assessment is required.

Determining liability for residential care accommodation costs is the
only reason for a manual means assessment.

Where a manual assessment is completed, care subsidy reduction (CSR) to
zero applies (if no fee letter was sent before departure from care) and:

-   the care recipient is not liable for income tested fees (ITF) or
    means tested care fees (MTCF)
-   the service provider receives the full care subsidy
-   any accommodation supplements payable to the provider must be
    manually calculated

If there is not enough information to finalise a manual means
assessment, the care recipient will be assessed as means not disclosed
(MND) with a not low means resident status and CSR to Zero will apply to
the care subsidy.

Complete a manual means assessment when:

it is requested by a care recipient or authorised third party, and

the care recipient has entered residential care, and

before completion of the means assessment, the care recipient

-   is deceased, or
-   departed care (not deceased)

Note: once a departure review has been completed, data may not
automatically transfer between aged care systems.

Do not complete a manual means assessment when:

the care recipient died before entering care (unless specifically
requested by the executor)

a home care means assessment was not completed before departure from
care

-   Aged Care Management Payment System (ACMPS) automatically applies
    CSR to zero
-   The service provider receives the full care subsidy payment

a pre 1 July 2014 residential care recipient's income assessment was not
completed before departure

-   Aged care systems will automatically apply CSR to zero
-   The service provider receives the full care subsidy payment

a care recipient departs home or residential care and a previously
completed means assessment is

-   based on incorrect income and/or assets amounts, or
-   means not disclosed (MND) was applied
-   Note: a manual reassessment is needed - see Aged care reviews -
    discharge and departure reviews

Requests for a means assessment

A care recipient, authorised third party, or the executor of the care
recipient's estate can request an assessment by one of the following:

-   Aged Care Calculation of your cost of care, or
-   Verbal application (if the care recipient was eligible for a verbal
    application)

Care recipient is deceased:

Only the executor or administrator of the estate can request a means
assessment using an Aged Care Calculation of your cost of care form, see
the Resources page for a link

-   Unless the care recipient had signed a calculation of your cost of
    care form before death

Evidence is needed that the person requesting the means assessment is
the executor or administrator

An executor will also need to provide Executor/Administrator Request for
information form (SS524).

Care recipient is not deceased:

The calculation of your cost of care form can be signed by the care
recipient or authorised third party

-   See the Signature requirements for the aged care means assessment
    forms table in Aged care - consent and disclosure for information on
    where the signatory is a person other than the care recipient

The online application can be completed by the care recipient or
Centrelink correspondence nominee

Death and departure manual follow-ups (MFUs)

If a MFU is present on the care recipient's Customer First record, see
Aged care reviews - manual follow-ups.

If needed, see Aged care reviews - discharge and departure reviews for
information on departure reviews.

The Resources page contains links to information on needing help when
someone dies, the Aged Care Manual Assessment email template and costs
for people entering residential aged care from 1 July 2014.
