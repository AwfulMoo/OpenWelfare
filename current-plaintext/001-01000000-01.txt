This document outlines how Services Australia can assist customers when
they contact seeking help looking for work or claiming financial
assistance.

Government intent - job seeker

The government intent for job seekers is that the agency will assess the
customer's circumstances so that products and services best suited to
helping the customer find work may be offered. This may include an offer
of financial assistance if appropriate.

Customer contact

When a customer contacts the agency seeking help to look for work, they
need to provide information about their circumstances and a willingness
to tell the truth.

From 1 July 2018

Eligible customers will receive payments or concession cards from the
date they actually submit a claim with all relevant supporting
documentation.

Different processes apply for customers in vulnerable circumstances.

Before 1 July 2018

Where the date of initial contact was before 1 July 2018, the date of
initial contact may be used as the date of claim if the customer
submitted a claim within 14 days. As such, it was important that all
contacts with the customer were recorded on the system where the
customer was willing to provide sufficient personal details.

Claiming a payment

The initial process of claiming an income support payment can be made:

-   [] by completing an online claim
-   in person at a Centrelink service centre
-   by phoning the agency
-   by contacting an agent or representative of the agency

When a customer contacts about making a claim, the Service Officer
should record the contact and provide appropriate advice about claiming
options available to the customer.

Online claims

With the introduction of online claim options, Service Officers should
complete the following:

JobSeeker Payment/Youth Allowance

-   [] Offer the online claim
-   If a customer is unable or unsuitable to complete an online claim,
    the Service Officer must record the contact on a DOC, update the
    customer phone number and run the Assisted Customer Claim (ACC). The
    ACC is similar to the online claim workflow and contains the same
    questions to ask the customer

Different processes apply for customers in vulnerable circumstances.

Note: a correspondence nominee can submit a job seeker online claim on
behalf of their principal.

Parenting Payment

-   [] Offer the online claim. The online claim cannot be submitted
    until all Required Tasks present as done unless the customer meets
    the exemption criteria
-   If a customer is unable or unsuitable to complete an online claim,
    the Service Officer must complete an ACC. Different processes apply
    for customers in vulnerable circumstances

Payments while looking for work

The 2 primary income support payments for job seekers are JobSeeker
Payment (JSP) and Youth Allowance (YA) (job seeker).

-   JobSeeker Payment (JSP) provides financial help for job seekers aged
    22 or over who are looking for work and willing to take part in
    their mutual obligation requirements to increase their chances of
    finding a job
-   Youth Allowance (YA) (job seeker) supports young people with
    financial assistance if they are 16 to 21 years old and are meeting
    their mutual obligation requirements

There are also payments to assist principal carer job seekers and job
seekers with a disability:

-   Parenting Payment (PP) is a main income support payment for a
    principal carer of a child (under eight years if single, or under
    six years if partnered) where recipients may undertake voluntary or
    compulsory mutual obligation requirements to assist with increasing
    their opportunity for finding work
-   Disability Support Pension provides financial support for customers
    with a physical, intellectual, or psychiatric condition that stops
    them from working
-   Mobility Allowance can assist customers who have a disability,
    illness or injury and are undertaking approved activities. The
    allowance helps with transport costs if the customer cannot use
    public transport without substantial assistance
-   The Youth Disability Supplement provides additional financial
    support to young people with a physical, intellectual or psychiatric
    condition who receive certain income support payments
-   Child Care Subsidy (CCS) and Additional Child Care Subsidy (ACCS)
    provide extra assistance with the cost of approved child care for
    principal carers that meet their mutual obligation requirements as
    part of a Job Plan
