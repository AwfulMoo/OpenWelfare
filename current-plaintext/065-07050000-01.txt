This document outlines information regarding rejections and
cancellations of a customer's registrations for the Pension Bonus Scheme
(PBS) and the rejection of claims for a PBS payment.

PBS registration rejections and cancellations

PBS registration is rejected using one of the rejection codes if the
customer does not meet the eligibility criteria such a residence or age
requirements. Customers may withdraw their claims for Age Pension and
Pension Bonus voluntarily. Withdrawn claims for Pension Bonus are not
rejected. They are deemed to have never been made.

PBS registration is automatically cancelled when a customer is paid the
Pension Bonus payment. It can also be cancelled at the customer's
request, if the Pension Bonus payment is not claimed with Age Pension or
the customer receives a precluding payment.

Registration for the PBS cannot be suspended. Registration can remain
indefinitely on a customer’s record.

Rejection of PBS payments

If a customer is not eligible for a Pension Bonus payment or Pension
Bonus Bereavement payment the claim is rejected using one of the
rejection reason codes. Rejection codes for the Pension Bonus Top-up
payments are automatically recorded.
