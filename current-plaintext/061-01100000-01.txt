This document outlines when customers receiving certain payments can
continue being paid if they need to travel overseas due to special
circumstances.

On this Page:

Payability overseas

These payments include:

JobSeeker Payment (JSP)

Youth Allowance (YA)

Austudy

ABSTUDY

Special Benefit (SpB)

Disability Support Pension (DSP)

Farm Household Allowance (FHA)

Or the following payments paid under Special Benefit rules

-   family assistance
-   Double Orphan Pension (DOP) and/or
-   Paid Parental Leave scheme payments

JSP, YA, AUS, ABSTUDY, FHA and SpB can usually only be paid overseas:

-   in limited circumstances and,
-   only for the minimum amount of time required for the customer to
    deal with the reason limited portability was granted

DSP customers can usually only be paid overseas for 4 weeks in a rolling
12 month period. Customers may also be paid for an additional period:

-   in limited circumstances
-   up to a maximum of 4 weeks to deal with the reason for which the
    limited portability was granted

SpB, family assistance, Paid Parental Leave scheme payments and DOP paid
to customers holding a temporary visa subclass 309, 785 (granted on or
after 16 December 2014), 790 or 820 are payable overseas in limited
circumstances. For customers receiving these payments, but holding a
different temporary protection type visa (for example, subclass 449),
payment is not portable at all and will cancel on departure. See:

-   Certain temporary visas that qualify customers for some payments,
    and
-   Temporary Protection, Humanitarian, Safe Haven and Return Pending
    Visas.

Portability interview

Service centre and Smart Centre Service Officers are responsible for
handling the portability interview and any departure coding where a
customer clearly does not satisfy necessary criteria for an approved
reason.

The service centre and Smart Centre Service Officer must confirm with
the customer the reason(s) for travel and also:

-   the date of departure
-   the date they expect to return to Australia, and
-   the country to which they are travelling

If a customer has advised that their overseas travel meets the initial
criteria for an approved temporary absence, the case must be referred to
Centrelink International Services (CIS) to assess entitlement and code
the departure.

Approved Temporary Absences reasons

Only Centrelink International Services (CIS) Service Officers have the
delegation to approve payment overseas for an approved reason.

These special circumstances are:

-   A customer who is going overseas to receive eligible medical
    treatment of a kind not available in Australia
-   Humanitarian reasons which include attending legal proceedings
    (including custody cases) or adoption proceedings. Note: this does
    not apply to Austudy, ABSTUDY or YA students and Australian
    Apprentices
-   Dealing with an acute family crisis such as death of a family
    member, or a family member suffering serious illness

Note: some payments may have portability proved due to travelling for a
training camp with the Australian Defence Force Reserves. This
portability reason is subject to different rules than the Approved
Temporary Absence reasons, but the case must still be referred to CIS to
assess entitlement.

The customer will need to provide appropriate documents and evidence to
verify the reasons for the overseas absence.
