Organisation Register Banking Details for an Organisation Site Record

The payment to practices, supervisors, salary support and registrars are
delivered as:

-   Practice payment – can only be paid to an Accredited training
    practice – the Payment Requestor (Colleges) requires an Organisation
    Site ID as the payment recipient identifier – therefore the Practice
    must be in the Organisation Register
-   Supervisor payment – will be paid to the practice unless the
    practice directs the Payment Requestor to pay the Supervisor
    directly. Therefore the Payment Requestor requires either the
    Organisation Site ID or a Medicare Provider Number (MPN) as a
    payment recipient identifier
-   Salary Support Payment – can only be paid to an Accredited training
    practice hosting a salary support for Aboriginal and Torres Strait
    Islander health training – the Payment Requestor requires an
    Organisation Site ID as the payment recipient identifier – therefore
    the Practice must be in the Organisation Register
-   Registrar Payment – can only be paid to the Registrar – the Payment
    Requestor requires either the Registrar’s MPN (8 digits) or STEM (6
    digits) as the payment recipient identifier

Registered GP training payments must have registered their associated
bank account details before a payment can be made to a practice,
supervisor or registrar.

Practice Administrators can assign bank account details for the
practice.

Security

In addition to existing PRODA and HPOS access, the Organisation Register
has 3 HPOS attributes that control access and functionality to the
Organisation and Organisation Site Records including adding new bank
details and or updating existing bank details.

The new Organisation Register attributes are either automatic, depending
on PRODA Organisation Membership/role or are delegated by a
Director/Owner or member with Owner Access in the first instance to
another PRODA member who may also be given a delegable attribute.

The new attributes control access to View, Add New or Update Existing
Bank details for GPTP on the Organisation Site record and only become
available once HPOS has been linked to an Organisation in the
Organisation Register using the organisation ABN as an Identifier.

The 3 new attributes create 2 levels of security access for banking
details.
