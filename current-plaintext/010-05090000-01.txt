This document outlines the procedure that looks at the study
requirements for ABSTUDY Pensioner Education Supplement (PES). They
include course approval, eligibility for various awards, study load
concessions and the activity test.

Study requirements

Students must be enrolled in and studying an approved course to receive
ABSTUDY PES. They must also be studying full-time (undertaking at least
75 per cent of the normal full-time study load of the course) or
receiving an approved study load concession.

Secondary school students are required to participate in full-time
study, including full daily program attendance.

In terms of attendance, tertiary and secondary non-schooling students
simply need to meet the education institution's course requirements.

Australian Apprentices

Full-time Australian Apprentices are not entitled to ABSTUDY PES.
Part-time Australian Apprentices who are undertaking full-time or
concessional study may qualify for ABSTUDY PES.

Study load concession

unless one of the following study load concessions apply:

-   disability study load concession
-   pensioner study load concession
-   two-thirds study load concession

The Resources page contains further information regarding the full-time
or concessional study load study requirements for different students.
