|                                   | When an inter-environment change  |
|                                   | of address (ICoA) is required,    |
|                                   | the first step is to check the    |
|                                   | customer circumstances.           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | In many instances, when a child   |
|                                   | is transferring with their        |
|                                   | parents, there is no need to      |
|                                   | undertake this procedure because  |
|                                   | if the child is attached to their |
|                                   | parent's record, their record     |
|                                   | will be transferred when the ICoA |
|                                   | transfer of the customer record   |
|                                   | is undertaken.                    |

|                                   |     to a change in custody. Go to |
|                                   |     Step 2.                       |
|                                   | -   The child is changing         |

|                                   |     parents, but has a record of  |
|                                   |     their own. Ensure the parent  |
|                                   |     is transferred first. See     |

|                                   |     customer record. When the     |
|                                   |     parent transfer is complete,  |
|                                   |     go to Step 2                  |

|                                   | If the child does not have a      |
