|                                   | booked a flight for 10 March to   |

|                                   | weeks. Terry phoned Services      |
|                                   | Australia on 9 March to advise of |
|                                   | the absence and was granted       |

|                                   | the approved portability          |
|                                   | provisions.                       |

|                                   | Due to a mix up with flights,     |
|                                   | Terry was unable to leave         |
|                                   | Australia until 14 March. The     |
|                                   | Service Officer must make a new   |
|                                   | portability decision based on the |
|                                   | new departure date including      |
|                                   | assessing whether the absence is  |
|                                   | still an approved absence. The    |
|                                   | Service Officer was satisfied     |
|                                   | that the delay was due to a mix   |
|                                   | up with flights and that the      |
|                                   | customer's parent was still       |
|                                   | critically ill. Terry was granted |
|                                   | 3 weeks portability from the new  |
|                                   | departure date.                   |

|                                   | occur if the customer does not    |
|                                   | advise of the change or the       |
|                                   | Service Officer does not redo the |
|                                   | portability decision, where there |
|                                   | is a difference of more than 3    |
|                                   | days between the customer's       |
|                                   | approved absence date and the     |
|                                   | actual date of departure. Without |
|                                   | rechecking portability, there is  |
|                                   | no way to determine whether the   |
|                                   | approved absence still applies    |
|                                   | and therefore payment would cease |
|                                   | on the day of departure.          |

|                                   | Angela later advised that they    |
|                                   | were actually leaving Australia   |
|                                   | earlier than planned, on 2        |
|                                   | February instead due to a         |
|                                   | relative's illness. The Service   |
|                                   | Officer re-ran the script which   |
|                                   | confirmed that payment would stop |
|                                   | on departure because Angela was   |
|                                   | identified as a former resident   |
|                                   | as at 2 February, having returned |
|                                   | to reside in Australia less than  |
|                                   | 2 years ago. By 20 February,      |
|                                   | Angela would have been an         |

|                                   | live in Canada. The DSP would not |
|                                   | be payable under domestic         |
|                                   | legislation as Bill has not been  |
|                                   | assessed as satisfying the no     |

|                                   | provisions, however Bill could be |
|                                   | paid indefinitely under the       |
|                                   | international agreement with      |
|                                   | Canada if assessed as 'severely   |
|                                   | disabled'. If Bill meets the      |
|                                   | agreement qualifications, DSP     |
|                                   | would be paid at a proportional   |
|                                   | rate of 144/420 due to having     |
|                                   | lived in Australia as an          |
|                                   | Australian resident for 12 years. |

|                                   | However, Bill's departure was     |
|                                   | delayed by 5 weeks until 15 July. |
|                                   | This means Bill would receive a   |
|                                   | proportional rate of 145/420 due  |
|                                   | to having lived in Australia as   |
