This document outlines reviews and appeals for customers who are subject
to Income Management. It sets out details for each Income Management
measure.

Review and appeal options

A customer who does not understand or does not agree with a decision
relating to their status under any Income Management measure may:

-   request an explanation of the decision by a Subject Matter Expert
    (SME)
-   apply for a formal review by an Authorised Review Officer (ARO)
-   request a review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) (first
    review)
-   request a review by the AAT (second review)
-   appeal to the Federal or High Court

If a customer does not agree with a decision to be placed on Income
Management made by the Family Responsibilities Commission, a State or
Territory Child Protection Authority, or a Supporting People at Risk
approved referring authority, the referring authority is responsible for
reviewing the decision.

If a decision about Income Management is being reviewed under social
security law, Income Management continues to apply until the review is
finalised, unless otherwise directed by the AAT or court.

Decisions affecting social security payments and not related to Income
Management are reviewable in accordance with social security law or
family assistance law.
