This document outlines the process for completing a home care means
assessment after a care recipient has started receiving home care.

Post-entry home care means assessment

When a care recipient starts a home care package, the Aged Care
Management Payment System (ACMPS):

-   determines if Services Australia or the Department of Veterans’
    Affairs (DVA) is responsible for completing the means assessment
-   transmits entry details only to the agency/department responsible
    for the means assessment. For example, to Customer First if Services
    Australia is responsible

Note: all entry events for care recipients who started home care before
1 July 2019 are transmitted to Services Australia. If DVA is later found
to be responsible for the means assessment, the means assessment is
manually rejected.

Means assessments

-   Determine what fees the care recipient needs to pay for their home
    care package
-   Only income is assessed
-   The care recipient and nominee (if applicable) receive a letter with
    a summary of the income used to calculate the basic daily fee (BDF)
    and/or income tested care fee (ICTF) payable
-   The Service Provider receives a letter advising of the basic daily
    fee (BDF) and/or income tested care fee (ICTF) they can charge the
    care recipient

Means assessments may be completed:

as an automatic means assessment when

-   Customer First completes a means assessment automatically when an
    entry event is received for a current means tested income support
    recipient, and
-   the required information is available in the system
-   Note: a means assessment cannot complete automatically if there is a
    started RCA/HOM activity on the Activity List (AL) screen. This may
    occur if a care recipient lodges an Aged Care Calculation of your
    cost of care before their entry into home care

as a verbal assessment

by completing an Aged Care Calculation of your cost of care form

To check if an application is needed, see Determining when a calculation
of cost of care is required for a home care means assessment.

Income from real estate and businesses

Home care recipients do not need to provide asset information for any
real estate or business interests. However, they do need to provide
information about:

-   rental income received from real estate (including their principal
    home)
-   income received from a sole trader or partnership

Note: current income and assets details for real estate and businesses
should already exist in Customer First where the care recipient (or
their partner) receive a means tested income support payment.

Income from private trusts and companies

Where a care recipient has an interest in a private trust and/or private
company, they must:

-   complete a Private Trust form (MOD PT) and/or
-   a Private Company form (MOD PC)
-   provide all supporting documentation

Note: these documents are needed for referral to a Complex Assessment
Officer (CAO).
