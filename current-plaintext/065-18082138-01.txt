This document outlines the process for completing a home care means
assessment after a care recipient has started receiving home care.

On this page:

Post-entry home care means assessment

When a care recipient starts a home care package, the Aged Care
Management Payment System (ACMPS):

-   determines if Services Australia or the Department of Veterans’
    Affairs (DVA) is responsible for completing the means assessment
-   transmits entry details only to the agency/department responsible
    for the means assessment. For example, to Customer First if Services
    Australia is responsible

Note: all entry events are transmitted to Services Australia for care
recipients who started home care before 1 July 2019. The entry event is
manually rejected if DVA are later found to be responsible for the means
assessment.

Means assessments may be completed:

as an automatic means assessment when

-   Customer First completes a means assessment automatically when an
    entry event is received for an income support recipient, and
-   the required information is available in the system
-   Note: a means assessment cannot complete automatically if there is a
    started RCA/HOM activity on the Activity List (AL) screen. This may
    occur if a care recipient completes an Aged Care Calculation of your
    cost of care before their entry into Home Care

as a verbal assessment

by completing an Aged Care Calculation of your cost of care online or by
form

To check if an application is needed, see Determining when an online
calculation of cost of care or form is required for a home care means
assessment.

Income from real estate and businesses

Home care recipients do not need to provide asset information for any
real estate or business interests. However they do need to provide
information about:

-   rental income received from real estate (including their principal
    home)
-   income received from a sole trader or partnership

Note: where the care recipient (or their partner) receive a means tested
income support payment, current income and assets details for real
estate and businesses should already exist in Customer First.

Income from private trusts and companies

Where a care recipient has an interest in a private trust and/or private
company, they must:

-   complete a Private Trust form (MOD PT) and/or
-   a Private Company form (MOD PC)
-   provide all supporting documentation

Note: these documents are needed for referral to a Complex Assessment
Officer (CAO).

The Resources page contains link to the MOD PT and MOD PC forms.
