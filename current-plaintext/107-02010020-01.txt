This document outlines the action to take when a Services Australia
customer is the victim of identity fraud and they have a debt based on
incorrect income details.

Identity compromise

The agency may become aware that a customer's identity has been
compromised when:

-   the ATO notifies the agency that a customer has had their identity
    stolen
-   the customer provides the information during compliance data
    matching
-   the customer responds to an Account Payable notice
-   the customer responds to recovery action

Identity fraud and debt raising

A debt may be raised incorrectly if a customer's identity information
was used to lodge a fraudulent income tax return.

This can affect customers who:

-   get Family Tax Benefit (FTB)
-   get a Social Security payment
-   are subject to compliance data matching reviews

Before raising a debt:

-   make sure a legally recoverable debt exists
-   investigate debts raised under different Acts and Income Test rules
    individually

If a customer did not get income because they were unemployed, any
fraudulent information about their employment or income cannot be used
to cancel, suspend, or adjust their rate of payment.

Family Tax Benefit (FTB) and Child Care Subsidy (CCS)

A fraudulent tax return may result in an incorrect FTB/CCS
reconciliation (debt or reduced top-up). This may:

-   result in deductions (withholdings) from the customer's payments to
    recover debts
-   stop the customer from getting an FTB advance
-   affect the customer's current FTB/CCS rate if their rate is based on
    a default estimate
-   cancel the payment if the incorrect income is too high
