This document outlines how some customers have the choice to offset
eligible payments and supplements against their income support payment,
resulting in the customer receiving the offset payments in the alternate
week. Customers may request to offset their payments or Service Officers
may offer this payment option to assist the customer with budgeting.

Offsetting limited to some payments and supplements

Offsetting is strictly limited to the following payments or supplements:

-   Family Tax Benefit (FTB)
-   Double Orphan Pension (DOP) and/or
-   Carer Allowance (CA)

It is important to be aware that by offsetting one of the eligible
payments, if the customer is in receipt of one or both of the other
eligible payments (FTB, DOP and/or CA), all of the payments will be
offset.

Individual circumstances to be considered

A customer's individual circumstances must be considered for each
request.

It is important to ensure that any change will:

-   not cause or intensify a customer's hardship
-   assist with a customer's ongoing and regular budgeting requirements.

An example of this would be changing the customer's payday to coincide
with a major regular expense like rent.

A customer's Entitlement Period End Date (EPED) must not be changed to
issue the customer with an early payment when they are not eligible for
an urgent payment. FTB payments are not an eligible payment for issuing
an urgent payment.
