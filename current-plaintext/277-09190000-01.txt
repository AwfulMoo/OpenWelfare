This document outlines the processes used in relation to open exchange
of information (OEI).

Legislative requirement to provide customers with information

Services Australia is required by legislation to provide customers with
information and copies of documents supplied by an applicant, respondent
or third party as part of the following decision making processes:

-   Change of Assessment (COA)
-   Capacity to Pay (CTP)
-   Objections - including General, Care and Part 6A
-   Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) - AAT first review

Information used to make these decisions must be exchanged with both
customers to ensure a transparent, fair and reasonable decision making
process.

Note: there is no legislative requirement in the objections process to
provide a copy of the response (and/or accompanying documents) to the
objector.

Child Support open exchange is consistent with the AAT and courts.
