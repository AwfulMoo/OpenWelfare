This document outlines the policy and procedure to reinstate an
individual eHealth Program (EHP) record in the Healthcare Identifiers
(HI) Service.

Reinstate eHealth Program (EHP) individual record

A Service Officer can reinstate an EHP individual record when a record
has been retired in error.

Note: the following conditions must be met:

the request to reinstate the EHP individual record must come from either
of the following:

-   the Healthcare Provider Individual
-   Trusted Data Source

the status of the EHP individual record must be retired

Sufficient evidence must be provided to confirm that the retirement was
performed in error, unless the request is received from a data source.

If the record has been retired in error, the following must be removed
from the record:

-   date of death
-   date of death accuracy indicator
-   source of death notification

When reinstating the EHP individual record, the HI Service will:

-   restore the record to the previous status before incorrect
    retirement
-   retain the originally allocated Healthcare Identifier and restore
    all end dated provider organisation links
-   restore any previous entries in the Healthcare Provider Directory
    (HPD)

Note: if the EHP individual is also a:

-   Responsible Officer (RO), the RO links to a provider organisation
    are not re-established, or
-   Contracted Service Provider (CSP) officer, the CSP officer links to
    a CSP organisation are also not re-established

Any previously removed Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) permissions to
the HI Service are reinstated.
