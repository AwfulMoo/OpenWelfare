Interpreter Connect

Interpreter Connect:

-   is exclusively available for Services Australia staff
-   automatically connects staff with the qualified and available
    interpreters for International and Indigenous languages

Staff must not transfer calls to this service and must always stay on
the line. Customers cannot access a telephone interpreter on their own.
The service is not for customers to contact directly and they must not
be provided with its number.

On-demand telephone interactions are suitable for:

-   Centrelink, Medicare and Child Support interactions for Smart
    Centres and service centres
-   staff and customer-initiated calls
-   unscheduled interactions
-   urgent interpreter requests
-   scheduled appointments where an interpreter was not booked or did
    not attend
-   staff working outside an agency's premises, for example staff
    working from home

On-demand telephone interpreters

On-demand telephone interpreters are:

-   non-agency staff
-   to adhere to the AUSIT (Australian Institute of Interpreters and
    Translators) Code of Ethics and the terms of their contracts
-   required to undergo cultural vetting if the request is for an
    Indigenous language
-   limited to availability (delays connecting to interpreters for
    certain languages may be experienced)
-   available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. There is decreased
    availability and technical support provided outside core business
    hours, weekends, and NSW public holidays
