This document outlines how to contact the Interpreter Connect service
(on-demand telephone interpreting).

Interpreting services during COVID-19

Services Australia introduced changes to interpreting services during
the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. These services continue to be
available for customers with limited English proficiency:

Interpreter Connect service (on-demand telephone interpreting): connects
staff immediately to a telephone interpreter via an automated system

Booked telephone appointments: staff can book a telephone interpreter
for future appointments

Booked on-site appointments: only available by exception, for example,
Auslan and sign language appointments

Rostered interpreter service (sessional):

-   provides staff with rostered on-site interpreters at service centres
    with high language needs. Restrictions to the service are dependent
    on the service centre’s COVID status level
-   Indigenous rostered interpreters are available at Broome, Kununurra
    and Halls Creek Service Centres

Interpreter Connect service (on-demand telephone interpreting)

The Interpreter Connect service is solely for staff and provides
immediate (on-demand) access to a telephone interpreter. It uses an
automated system that connects staff to the most qualified and available
interpreter in the requested language.

Staff must not transfer calls to this service and must stay on the line
at all times. Customers cannot access a telephone interpreter on their
own. The service is not for customers to contact directly and they must
not be provided with its number.

On-demand telephone interactions are suitable for:

-   Centrelink, Medicare and Child Support interactions for Smart
    Centres and service centres
-   staff and customer initiated calls
-   unscheduled interactions
-   urgent interpreter requests
-   appointments shorter than 30 minutes
-   scheduled appointments where an interpreter was not booked or did
    not attend
-   staff working outside an agency's premises, for example staff
    working from home

On-demand telephone interpreters

On-demand telephone interpreters are:

-   non-agency staff
-   contractors who are part of the agency’s panel of interpreters and
    translators or are contracted via external service providers
-   required to undergo cultural vetting if the request is for an
    Indigenous language
-   limited to availability (delays connecting to interpreters for
    certain languages may be experienced)
-   available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. There is decreased
    availability and technical support provided outside core business
    hours, weekends and NSW public holidays
