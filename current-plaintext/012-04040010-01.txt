This document outlines how to link a healthcare provider to an
organisation in order to access the My Health Record program via the
Provider Portal.

Auth-links

The healthcare organisation must be registered in the Healthcare
Identifiers (HI) Service and My Health Record system. The organisation
holds the permission to access patients’ My Health Records via their
compliant Software program. A healthcare provider must hold a valid
HPI-I in order to be linked to the organisation.

When a provider is physically away from the clinic, they can log into
the National Provider Portal and access a view-only version of a
patient’s My Health Record, by being linked to the organisation that
they are affiliated with. This process is called ‘Auth-links’.

An Auth-link request can be made via an Application to establish list of
authorised healthcare provider individuals form (HA0916), and in some
cases over the phone. Or they can create the link themselves via HPOS.

When a call is received the right questions must be asked to ensure what
they want is to create an Auth-link.

Questions to ask:

-   Try to establish what the caller is trying to do
-   Does the Individual have a PRODA account?
-   Are they trying to get access through the My Health Record Provider
    Portal?
