|                                   | -   Yes, e.g. if a foster carer   |
|                                   |     is formally adopting the      |
|                                   |     child it would not be         |

|                                   |     the same child CRN. This is   |
|                                   |     because the CRN is also       |
|                                   |     linked to the birth mother    |
|                                   |     and/or other previous carers. |

|                                   |     payments. In this instance, a |

|                                   |     created. Go to Step 7.        |
