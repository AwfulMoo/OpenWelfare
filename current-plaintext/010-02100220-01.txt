This document outlines rules for entitlement to interstate travel for
ABSTUDY students claiming Fares Allowance (FAA).

Rules for entitlement to interstate travel

Restrictions on entitlement to FAA may apply to students who wish to do
their course of study in an Australian State or Territory other than
where their permanent home is located.

Entitlement to interstate travel will vary according to the type and
level of study undertaken by the student.

Restrictions on interstate travel will apply to:

-   secondary school students
-   Certificate and Enabling courses
-   Statement of Attainment courses, and
-   an Away from Base field trip or placement

An Australian Apprentice is not entitled to FAA for the Australian
Apprenticeship.

Eligibility for interstate travel

FAA is only payable to students travelling interstate to do their course
or Away from Base activity in certain circumstances.

A student may be eligible for interstate travel if:

-   they live near a State/Territory border
-   it is more cost effective for them to travel interstate, rather than
    intrastate
-   they have been granted an away from home criteria allowing them to
    travel interstate. For example, a scholarship
-   the student has a sibling approved to attend the same interstate
    school
-   they are attending an approved special school or a special
    assistance school not available in their home state/territory

For more information to check if a student is eligible for interstate
travel, see the Process page.

The Resources page contains a link to the Interstate Cost Effectiveness
Assessments spreadsheet, a list of the most costly intrastate travel
locations for each State/Territory. It also contains examples of
determining eligibility for interstate travel, contact details, links to

website and Unique Courses exempt from restrictions on interstate
travel.
