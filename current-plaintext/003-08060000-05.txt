Changed circumstances that are not substantial for the purposes of SpB

The following examples are not considered a substantial change in
circumstances for the purpose of qualification for SpB - where no other
extenuating circumstances are involved:

-   Claimant and partner are separated, but living under one roof
-   Partner and the visa holder separate due to breakdown of the
    relationship and there is no domestic violence involved
-   Partner misrepresents their circumstances (financial, physical,
    material) and the partnered provisional visa holder chooses to leave
    because of this
-   Partner leaves work to study or train, engages in an unprofitable
    business, resorts to excessive gambling or makes another lifestyle
    choice that impacts on the couple financially
