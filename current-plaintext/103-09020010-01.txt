This document contains information about correctly reissuing a returned
or rejected Centrepay payment.

Returned or rejected payments

A Centrepay payment may be returned or rejected due to incorrect account
details recorded on the business record, a closed bank account, or if
the BSB has changed. Services Australia will attempt to correct details
and reissue the payment. If details cannot be corrected, the payment
will be reissued to the customer.

A Centrepay payment may also be rejected by the business if the payment
amount is under the minimum transaction of $1.00. In these cases the
payment is reissued automatically. However, a notification will be
received by the National Business Gateway Recoveries Team (NBGRT) to
enable them to confirm all returns have been successful and to manually
return those amounts that were not successful.

Notification of returned or rejected payments

NBGRT will receive email advice from the Centrelink Cash Management Team
when a Centrepay payment has been returned by a Financial Institution
(Government Direct Entry Service (GDES)) or rejected by the Reserve Bank
of Australia (Government Administered Returned Payments (GARP)).

The Resources page contains links to Office Locator, contact details and
a list of payment return codes.
