This document outlines the procedures involved in processing
cancellations, restorations and suspensions to payments for YA (job
seekers, students and Australian Apprentices).

Cancelling YA (job seekers, students and Australian Apprentices)

Before cancelling a customer's Youth Allowance (YA), care should be
taken to establish that the customer no longer meets the qualification
and/or payability provisions for YA as a job seeker, student or
Australian Apprentice. If the decision to cancel is made, an advice must
be sent to the customer with the cancellation reason and rights of
review and appeal.

Suspending YA (job seekers, students and Australian Apprentices)

Generally, payments should only be suspended if:

-   a determination has been made that the customer is not qualified, or
    the payment is not payable, temporarily or for a specific period, as
    a result of changes in their circumstances, or
-   the customer has not complied with a reasonable request . For
    example, a request to provide information, attend an interview, or
    to take action (such as to obtain a foreign payment)

Before suspending a customer's YA, establish that:

an appropriate request for information/action has been issued to the
customer, including:

-   information or action required
-   a time frame for the customer to respond
-   consequences of non-compliance
-   reference to the relevant Act the request has been made under

an appropriate time for a response has passed

the customer is temporarily not eligible for payment

there is a legislative basis to suspend the payment

all appropriate action has been taken

On the customer record, add a:

DOC advising the reason. For more information see:

-   Online Document Recording (ODR) Resources page for Act References
-   Creating, reviewing and deleting documents (including Fast Notes and
    DOA DOCs)

manual review to follow up the suspension

Restoring YA (job seekers, students and Australian Apprentices)

Restoration of suspended or cancelled Youth Allowance (YA) occurs when a
customer's qualification for YA as a job seeker, student or Australian
Apprentice has been re-established after a cancellation or suspension.

Unfavourable decision

When making an unfavourable decision, speak to the customer:

-   explain the decision
-   give them a chance to provide more information, and
-   advise their review and appeal rights.

Check and update contact details

Every customer's address (including postal address) and telephone
details (including mobile phone numbers) must be checked at every
contact, and updated if required. Note: if the customer has
authenticated themselves via IVR, address details do not need to be
confirmed.
