This document outlines explanations of the different categories and
fields used by Services Australia social workers to record non-casework
activities in the Social Work Information System (SWIS).

Definition of non-casework activity

A non-casework activity (also known as an office activity) is an action
undertaken by one or more social workers that does not involve direct
one on one (face to face, phone or other) contact with a customer. This
can include:

-   Being involved in meetings and working groups both within Services
    Australia and/or with community agencies and other government
    departments/agencies. This can cover a range of topics such as
    service gaps, policy feedback and upcoming initiatives
-   Staff selections and recruitment exercises
-   Group work (although group sessions are conducted with customers,
    unless the contact becomes one on one it should not be recorded as a
    referral/contact)
-   Preparation of submissions relating to policy development
-   Attending Centrelink Service Centre/Area meetings and assisting with
    the development of service delivery initiatives
-   Training of social work and non-social work staff
-   Completing quality checking activities
-   Participating in professional development
