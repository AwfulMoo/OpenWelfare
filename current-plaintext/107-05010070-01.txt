This document outlines information on evaluating the cost effectiveness
of the investigation and recovery process for outstanding debts.

Cost effectiveness considerations

Cost effectiveness is determined by considering:

-   the amount owed
-   the customer's circumstances, and
-   the relative cost of available recovery action

Where there are no legislative requirements (for example, debts less
than $50 are raised and waived automatically), apply a common-sense
approach to managing the recovery of a debt. This excludes Public
Governance Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (PGPA).

Balance the cost of investigation against the recovery outcome. Make
timely decisions about non recovery action when a customer cannot be
located.

Recovery guidelines and procedures support:

-   cost effective processing, and
-   an improved likelihood of a successful outcome

Phoning a customer is more effective than sending a letter. Use all
appropriate avenues to contact the customer before implementing a
recovery decision.
