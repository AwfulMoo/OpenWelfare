For Debt Management Officers (DMO) only.

This document outlines what to do when a customer with an outstanding
family assistance overpayment becomes bankrupt.

When a customer becomes bankrupt

This can affect the recovery of these overpayments:

-   Family Tax Benefit (FTB)
-   Child Care Subsidy (CCS)

CCS providers may also contact to advise on bankruptcy.

Bankruptcy does not eliminate all overpayments. Some cease to be payable
during the bankruptcy.

The overpayment is included in the bankruptcy if the liability occurs
before the bankruptcy period. For reconciliation overpayments, liability
arises when the customer is reconciled.

Family assistance overpayments are not split like social security debts
into before and after bankruptcy periods.

Escalation

If a case is unusual or not covered in Operational Blueprint, discuss
with the APS5 Bankruptcy Officer. The APS5 will refer to the relevant
Level 2 Service Desk, policy team and/or Legal Services for guidance.

Policy Helpdesk enquiry form.
