This document outlines the process for Pensioner Education Supplement
(PES) students who have deferred, or withdrawn from full-time studies
prior to the end of their course.

Change of circumstances

This is a change in the student's circumstances affecting their
qualification for payment, and is therefore a notifiable event. In
addition to the common notifiable events, students who are undertaking
study or training must notify the Services Australia as follows:

for notification reporters, within the 14 day notification period if any
of the following events occur, or are likely to occur:

for stimulus (and variable reporter) customers:

-   by the Report Due Date, or
-   by the Entitlement Period End Day (EPED)

If any of the following events occur, or are likely to occur:

-   starting or discontinuing a full-time course of study
-   not enrolling in a course as a continuing student by the end of the
    enrolment period
-   not beginning in the course on the first day it is offered, or
-   changing enrolment in the course

Online accounts

[] PES students may notify the change to their course end date or other
study details by updating their details online if they are registered
online and authenticated. If there is a change to the student's
Participation Status or Student End Date, the record will either
generate a DOC, or create a Change of Circumstances interaction with
details of the change for follow up action to be undertaken by a Service
Officer.

Express Plus application

[] Customers with a Centrelink online account can view their personal
information including study details through the 'My Profile' menu option
in the Express Plus applications.

Identification Confirmation

If Identity documentation is applicable, at every phone or personal
contact, staff must check and update if required:

-   all of a customer's addresses (including postal address), and
-   telephone details (including mobile phone numbers)

Note: if the customers have authenticated themselves via Interactive
Voice Response (IVR), address details do not need to be confirmed.

Reduced study load

Generally, if a student ceases full-time study they cease to qualify for
one of the Centrelink administered payments for students. However, if
the customer has reduced their study load, they may qualify for a study
load concession.
