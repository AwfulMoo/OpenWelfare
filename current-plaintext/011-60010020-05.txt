Script to identify caller on IME enquiry line

For Services Australia to release Medicare card numbers under the
secrecy provisions of the Health Insurance Act 1973, callers must answer
a series of questions to identify themselves. Staff must also verify the
caller's identity prior to the release of information. See the
References page for a link to the act.

Note:

-   callers may not always be the pharmacy’s approved person, but they
    must be able to correctly respond to any questions you ask to verify
    the caller, including who is the approved person for the pharmacy
-   for a pharmaceutical benefit related query, general practitioners
    (GP) can only request to have a patient's concessional entitlement
    status confirmed via Medicare Provider Enquiries line – Option 5 –
    sub option 2 – Medicare concessional entitlement status

Suspected fraudulent calls

Table 4: this table describes additional questions to ask and actions to
take where a call is suspected to be fraudulent. There is a standard
Report Suspected Fraud form located on the intranet. Not all fields need
to be completed. Refer to your leadership team for further advice.

Where possible, get both the card number and full name of the patient.
This helps with any fraud investigations. Always complete a Report
Suspected Fraud form when you suspected fraud.

Note: callers to the IME line do not have to be the pharmacist or the
approved person. However, the caller must correctly respond to the
questions asked to verify the caller, including who the approved person
is for the pharmacy. Do not give any information if a call is suspected
to be fraudulent. Never disclose a patient’s date of birth or address to
the caller.

Patient listed on two valid Medicare cards

A patient can be listed on 2 valid Medicare cards. This usually occurs
because the patient is a child (or young adult) and it is more
convenient for claiming.

If a patient is listed on 2 valid Medicare cards, check the patient's
date of birth. If the patient is:

a child (or young adult):

-   ask the caller which person the child is with
-   determine the correct card according to the address and the person's
    name on the card before releasing the card details

an adult:

-   release the patient’s adult Medicare card details after matching the
    given address

If a Service Officer needs clarification because the scenario does not
fit with the above criteria, they should call the PBS Help Desk for
advice.
