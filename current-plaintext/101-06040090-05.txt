This page contains a list of rejection/cancellation codes for Low Income
Health Care Cards (LIC). It also advises which codes may be restored and
indicates whether they may be restored at a Smart Centre Call or only at
a service centre. Restoration of a LIC can only occur when LIC has been
cancelled. If the Benefit Status line on the customer's record shows LIC
has been rejected, the customer is required to commence the new claim
process.
