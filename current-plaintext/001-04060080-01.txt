This document outlines how a Youth Allowance (YA) or Disability Support
Pension (DSP) customer is considered independent due to parent(s) being
unable to exercise parental responsibilities.

Parents unable to exercise responsibilities

Parents are unable to exercise parental responsibilities if they are
missing, mentally incapacitated, serving a prison sentence or living in
a nursing home for an indefinite period.

It does not matter if the young person is dependent, or was last
dependent on someone else. If parents cannot exercise their
responsibilities for a short time only, consider other categories of
independence.

This assessment may be required for DSP customers aged between 16 and 21
years. This would only apply to DSP customers aged between 18 and 20
years if they are living in the parental home. These customers are
considered independent if they are living away from the parental home.

Situations when not applicable

A parent unable to exercise parental responsibilities does not include a
parent who cannot provide a home for their child because of their own
lack of stable accommodation. In this case, consider independence under
the unreasonable to live at home criteria.

Relocation scholarship

Some independent students who are disadvantaged by personal
circumstances may also be qualified to receive Relocation Scholarship
(RS). RS eligibility explains the extra coding required for these
independent students to pay RS correctly.

The Resources page contains examples and links to relevant claim forms.
