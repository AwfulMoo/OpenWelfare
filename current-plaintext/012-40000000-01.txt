Medicare services and benefits.

Government intent

Services Australia administers Medicare on behalf of the Department of
Health and Aged Care, who is responsible for developing Medicare policy.

Services Australia pays Medicare benefits in accordance with legislation
governing Medicare and has no discretion to pay benefits outside of this
legislation.

The Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) is a Department of Health and Aged
Care publication that lists services that are subsidised by the
Australian Government under Medicare.

Medicare usually covers:

-   free or subsidised treatment by health professionals such as
    doctors, specialists, optometrists and in specific circumstances
    dentists and other allied health practitioners
-   free treatment and accommodation as a public Medicare patient in a
    public hospital
-   75% of the Medicare Schedule fee for services and procedures if a
    person is a private patient in a public or private hospital. This
    does not include hospital accommodation and items such as theatre
    fees and medicines
-   some health care services in certain countries
