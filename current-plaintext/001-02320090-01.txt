This document outlines the process for Services Australia to follow when
an ESAt report is found to have inconsistencies submitted by the
Assessor.

Purpose of escalation protocols

The agency requires a single professional view of a customer's
functional impairment and work capacity between Assessment Services
(Assessors and Health Professionals Advisory Unit (HPAU) Advisors) and
other staff such as Service Officers, Authorised Review Officers (ARO),
International Services (CIS) officers and Litigation and Information
Release Branch staff.

The ESAt report contains the Assessor's recommendations about a
customer's work capacity, appropriate interventions, recommended
referrals to employment assistance programs, risk of non-compliance
ratings and vulnerability indicator categories. If the ESAt report is
upgraded to a Job Capacity Assessment (JCA), the report may also
recommend an Impairment Rating.

Assessment Services internal escalation process

The Assessment Services internal escalation process:

-   provides a mechanism to capture and manage issues as required within
    the agency's quality framework including reporting that is
    consistent with continuously improving business practices
-   provides a mechanism for Assessors to reconsider and adjust work
    capacity, in line with legislative requirements and the Social
    Security Guide
-   helps in clarifying congruency of medical evidence to assessed
    impairment and work capacity
-   maintains relationships between Assessors, HPAU advisors and
    determining staff to provide timely advice and consideration of a
    customer's functional impairment and work capacity when additional
    information becomes available during the review and appeal process
-   gives staff ways to discuss extra information provided during the
    review and appeal process where reassessment is not warranted. For
    example, evidence of mental health diagnosis by clinical
    psychologist or psychiatrist
-   helps International Services staff in determining complex matters
    regarding impairment and work capacity for foreign pension and
    Agreement claim matters
