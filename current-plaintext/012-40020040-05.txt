|                                   | -   it is the fee difference      |
|                                   |     amount ($3.25) in this        |

|                                   | outlined above is repeated for    |
|                                   | each item involved. When          |
|                                   | selecting the item to be          |
|                                   | adjusted, make sure that the      |

|                                   | adjusted is sufficient to allow   |

|                                   | the item that has already been    |
