This document outlines the process for completing a home care means
assessment before a care recipient enters care.

On this page:

Pre-entry home care means assessment

A care recipient can choose to have a means assessment before starting a
home care package.

Pre-entry means assessment:

-   Determines what fees the care recipient needs to pay if they start
    receiving a home care package
-   Only income is assessed
-   The care recipient and nominee (if applicable) receive a letter with
    a summary of the income used to calculate the basic daily fee (BDF)
    and/or income tested care fee (ICTF) payable if they enter care

Income from real estate and business

Home care recipients do not need to provide asset information for any
real estate or business interests, however they do need to provide
information about:

-   rental income received from real estate (including their principal
    home)
-   income received from a sole trader or partnership

Note: where the care recipient (or their partner) receive a means tested
income support payment, current income and assets details for real
estate and businesses should already exist in Customer First.

Income from private trusts and companies

Where a care recipient has an interest in a private trust and/or private
company, they must:

-   complete a Private Trust form (MOD PT) and/or
-   complete a Private Company form (MOD PC) module
-   provide all supporting documentation

Note: these documents are needed for referral to a Complex Assessment
Officer (CAO).

The Resources page contains link to the MOD PT and MOD PC forms.
