This document outlines how to cancel AIC payments and action
overpayments. Only AIC Smart Centre staff can cancel AIC payments.

Cancelling AIC payments

An applicant may no longer be entitled to the payment(s) if there is a
change of circumstances. It can include the student:

-   stopping full-time study
-   changing their term living arrangements
-   transferring to another payment, such as Youth Allowance, or
-   the applicant not having eligibility for payment

AIC Continuity of Schooling concession

The change of circumstances may mean the student no longer meets one of
the AIC isolation conditions. The applicant could still get AIC payments
if the student continues:

-   to attend the same school, or
-   be enrolled at the same distance education institution

Update the AIC record to show the change in circumstance where the
student/applicant is no longer eligible for:

-   AIC
-   Boarding Allowance
-   Additional Boarding Allowance, or
-   Second Home Allowance

AIC Debts and Third Party Organisations (TPO)

AIC debts are usually the responsibility of the applicant.

Funds paid incorrectly to a TPO may be recovered in some circumstances.
