|                                   | to visit and care for an unwell   |
|                                   | family member. Where is the line  |
|                                   | drawn between visiting and        |
|                                   | caring?                           |

|                                   | Answer: The purpose of travelling |
|                                   | must be either 'visiting' a       |
|                                   | family member who is critically   |
|                                   | ill, has been hospitalised with   |
|                                   | an illness which is serious, or,  |
|                                   | where a family member has died or |
|                                   | is subject to another             |
|                                   | life-threatening situation over   |
|                                   | which they have no control (for   |
|                                   | example, hostage situation).      |
|                                   | Assuming ongoing caring           |
|                                   | responsibilities for someone does |
|                                   | not satisfy the definition of     |
|                                   | acute family crisis. Payment can  |
|                                   | be approved to visit the family   |
|                                   | member but cannot be extended in  |
|                                   | order to provide ongoing care.    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Example 1: A customer attends a   |
|                                   | service centre with a medical     |
|                                   | certificate saying their parent   |
|                                   | in the United Kingdom (UK) had    |
|                                   | suffered an asthma attack and had |
|                                   | been admitted to hospital for     |
|                                   | observation but had been released |
|                                   | before the customer left          |
|                                   | Australia. The customer wanted to |
|                                   | go overseas to visit their parent |
|                                   | and remain for 3 weeks to provide |
|                                   | care.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This case as presented does not   |
|                                   | satisfy the criteria for acute    |
|                                   | family crisis as customer's       |
|                                   | parent was not critically ill or  |
|                                   | hospitalised with an illness      |
|                                   | which is serious.                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Example 2: Customer attends a     |
|                                   | service centre with a medical     |
|                                   | certificate saying their parent   |
|                                   | in the United Kingdom (UK) has    |
|                                   | suffered an asthma attack with    |
|                                   | severe complications and has been |
|                                   | admitted to hospital. The doctor  |
|                                   | advises that the parent is        |
|                                   | seriously ill and will have to    |
|                                   | stay at least 3 weeks due to the  |
|                                   | additional complications. The     |
|                                   | parent will also require someone  |
|                                   | to look after them for 4 weeks    |
|                                   | once they can be released from    |
|                                   | hospital. The customer is the     |
|                                   | only child.                       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | In cases like these Centrelink    |
|                                   | must look at whether the doctor   |
|                                   | thought the parent was critically |
|                                   | ill (life-threatening), or        |
|                                   | seriously ill in hospital. (Note: |
|                                   | asthma can be life threatening.   |
|                                   | It is up to the doctor to say how |
|                                   | critical it was).                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Based on that case, the customer  |
|                                   | may be paid for 3 weeks to visit  |
|                                   | their parent but not for the      |
|                                   | additional time their parent      |
|                                   | needs ongoing care.               |

|                                   | Centrelink wanting to go overseas |
|                                   | due to the death of a family      |
|                                   | member. What situations are       |
|                                   | considered reasonable for         |
|                                   | approving payment outside         |
|                                   | Australia if travel is related to |

|                                   | Answer: Generally, payment would  |
|                                   | only be approved if the death of  |
|                                   | a family member occurred overseas |
|                                   | and the customer wanted to attend |
|                                   | the funeral and/or arrange estate |
|                                   | matters. Consideration may be     |
|                                   | given to customers who are able   |
|                                   | to demonstrate they were unable   |
|                                   | to travel at the time of death.   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This provision generally does not |
|                                   | cover situations where a person   |

|                                   | ashes overseas nor situations     |
|                                   | where cultural or religious       |
|                                   | customs require a person to       |
|                                   | travel after the death (for       |
|                                   | example 12 month mourning period) |
|                                   | as these are not acute            |

|                                   | family member died in Australia.  |
|                                   | It was the family member's wish   |

|                                   | This case does not satisfy the    |
|                                   | criteria of an acute family       |
|                                   | crisis as the death occurred in   |
|                                   | Australia, therefore there is no  |

|                                   | Question: Is there anything that  |
|                                   | should be done if CIS has not     |
|                                   | accepted that the customer is     |
|                                   | going overseas for an approved    |
|                                   | reason?                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: Check that an alternative |
|                                   | reason for payment or an          |
|                                   | alternative payment type is not a |
|                                   | possibility for the customer. For |
|                                   | example: if a JobSeeker Payment   |
|                                   | (JSP) customer and PPP customer   |
|                                   | partner are going overseas due to |
|                                   | the death of the PPP customer's   |
|                                   | father, JSP would not normally be |
|                                   | portable. However, PPP is         |
|                                   | portable for 6 weeks for any      |
|                                   | reason. If the current PPP        |
|                                   | customer can qualify for JSP,     |
|                                   | they would satisfy the definition |
|                                   | of acute family crisis and be     |
|                                   | payable for a specific negotiated |
|                                   | period. If the current JSP        |
|                                   | customer qualifies for PPP, their |
|                                   | payment would then be portable    |
|                                   | for up to 6 weeks.                |
