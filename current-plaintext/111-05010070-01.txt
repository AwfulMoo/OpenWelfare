This document outlines the process to follow if a personal call is
received for another staff member.

Privacy

Under privacy regulations and respect for the privacy of other staff
members, information is not permitted to be disclosed about another
staff member - including confirming that the person is a staff member.
If the call is not urgent the caller should be asked to ring the person
at home. Under no circumstances should urgent phone calls not be
followed up. For further details of what to do, please refer to the
Process Summary and the Process pages.

Staff members will usually supply friends, family and other parties with
a direct contact number.

Receiving personal calls on secondary lines

In Smart Centre Call, staff are expected to either redirect their
secondary line when on phone duties or provide alternative contact
details to family and friends to avoid customer calls being disrupted.
In the interests of providing quality customer service, putting
customers on hold while taking a personal call is unacceptable except in
an emergency situation.

If there is an urgent need to return a personal call during phone time,
staff should move to the 'make busy' phone mode. Non-urgent calls should
be made during a more appropriate time. If a Smart Centre Call staff
member has personal circumstances that need to be considered, they
should discuss this with their Team Leader.
