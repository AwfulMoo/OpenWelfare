This document outlines how customers can provide acceptable proof of a
child's birth for their claim for Family Tax Benefit (FTB), Parental
Leave Pay (PPL), Dad and Partner Pay (DAP), Child Care Subsidy (CCS),
Double Orphan Pension (DOP) or Single Income Family Supplement (SIFS).
Proof of the child's birth must be provided for the customer's claim to
be finalised, unless it is already recorded as provided for the child.

Newborn Child Declaration (FA081)

The FA081 is included in the Parent Pack issued to parents by doctors
and midwives after the birth of their child. The back page of the FA081
contains a birth declaration that must be signed by the doctor or
midwife. It also contains a serial number that is recorded online by the
customer. This serial number is also checked when staff are processing
the customer's claim.

The FA081 can be provided by parents to Services Australia to support
their claim for the following payments and services:

-   FTB, PPL, DAP, CCS, DOP or SIFS
-   enrolment in Medicare, Medicare Safety Net, the My Health Record
    system and the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR)

If a customer is unable to provide the FA081 to support their claim,
they will need to advise what has happened to the original document. If
the FA081 was not issued at the time of birth, this needs to be referred
to the Level 2 Helpdesk for further advice before finalising the claim.

Providing proof of birth for a newborn child using the FA081

[] The easiest way for parents to provide proof of birth is to:

-   go online to finalise their claim, and
-   upload the Doctor/Midwife - Proof of Birth declaration on the back
    page of the FA081

If completed online, these customers will not need to complete the full
FA081.

If the customer:

has already lodged a pre-birth claim for FTB and/or PPL, they can
finalise their claim by:

-   accessing Centrelink services from their myGov account or the
    Express Plus Centrelink mobile app, and
-   selecting the Add newborn option or Add Child in the mobile app

has not lodged a claim and wants to do so, they can:

-   access Centrelink services from their myGov account, and
-   select the Make a claim option

If a customer has no reasonable online access, or wants to enrol in
Medicare services only, parents will need to fully complete the FA081
and return the whole form.

Other acceptable proof of birth

If customers are unable to provide the FA081 as proof of birth, to
support their claim other acceptable documents can be provided. See
Table 2 Item 1 for a detailed list.

Documents provided do not need to be certified originals. Any images or
copies of documents provided must be clear and legible.

Children born overseas

To support their claim, acceptable proof of the child's birth can
include any of the following:

-   Australian Citizenship by descent certificate
-   child's passport (Australian or otherwise)
-   Department of Home Affairs automatic data link verification
-   Birth certificate issued by the government of the country in which
    the child was born

Note: it is preferred that a child’s date of birth is verified using an
Australian immigration document compared to a birth certificate issued
by the country in which the child is born. If no Australian document can
be provided, a foreign birth certificate or other suitable documents
that verifies the child’s date of birth may be used.

When a document in another language is presented for Identity
Confirmation or Proof of Birth purposes, it must be referred to the
Language Services for translation. The exception is it is accompanied by
another acceptable identity confirmation document. This is required even
if the customer provides their own translated version.

Lodging proof of birth documents

If a pre-claim was made online or via FA100

[] Customers can upload acceptable proof of birth documents using Upload
documents. The customer will be required to use the 'Add Newborn'
service online or via the Express Plus Centrelink mobile app to complete
their claim. Alternatively they can lodge a fully completed Newborn
Child Declaration form (FA081) with the back page included.

If a pre-claim was not made

[] Customers can claim online and upload acceptable proof of birth using
Upload documents or claim using the Claim for Paid Parental Leave and
Family Assistance (FA100) form and include the back page from the FA081.

All images uploaded must be clear and legible and must be provided with
the child's details and any required claim information.

The Resources page contains a link to the Medicare Enrolment Application
form, a link to the Families and Child Care Level 2 Policy Helpdesk
Online Query form, and scenarios of customers lodging proof of birth and
staff action.
