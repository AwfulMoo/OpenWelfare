This document outlines information regarding payment of Location
Specific Practice Number (LSPN) claims for diagnostic imaging or
radiation oncology services.

On this Page:

Eligibility

To be eligible for Medicare benefits for diagnostic imaging or radiation
oncology services, individual providers must include on a patient's
account, receipts or bulk bill claims (including electronic claims), the
LSPN of the practice site or base for mobile equipment where the service
was provided. The patient is not to be disadvantaged where a claim for a
diagnostic or radiation oncology service has been submitted without a
LSPN on the account or receipt.

Patient notification

The Health Insurance Act 1973 states that a proprietor of an
unregistered diagnostic imaging or radiation oncology premises,
including mobile bases, must notify the patient, either in writing, or
by a written notification which is predominantly displayed that no
Medicare benefit is payable. The References page contains the relevant
section and a link to the Act.

If, at the time of the service, the patient or claimant is not notified
that a Medicare benefit is not payable, they can apply to the delegate
for approval to receive a Medicare benefit.

Check claim for LSPN

Service Officers must check claims for the inclusion of an LSPN prior to
Medicare benefits being paid and ensure that the item claimed has the
appropriate equipment recorded at the LSPN to perform the service.

The Resources page contains links to contact details, the VG4 form and
the LSPN declaration form.
