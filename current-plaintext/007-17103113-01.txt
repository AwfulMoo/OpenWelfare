This document outlines how a customer's entitlement for Child Care
Subsidy (CCS) is determined after establishing their eligibility.

Entitlement for CCS

While a customer may have been assessed as eligible for CCS, they will
not be entitled to receive CCS as reduced fees unless they:

-   meet reconciliation conditions, and
-   have confirmed their child’s enrolment details provided by the child
    care service.

The child care service must lodge a session/attendance report before
payments can be made.

Calculating the rate of CCS

A CCS fortnight is a period of 2 weeks beginning on Monday 2 July 2018,
and every second Monday after that.

A CCS year is not the same as a financial year. This is because CCS is
assessed in fortnightly periods which:

-   start on a CCS Monday, and
-   end on a Sunday

The exception being where the customer loses eligibility to payment
within the fortnight and entitlement ceases from date of event.

The CCS year ends on the Sunday of the fortnight containing 30 June.

The following three factors will determine the rate of CCS a family may
be entitled to receive in the CCS fortnight.

Family income

CCS is income tested. A family's CCS % is based on their estimated
Adjusted Taxable Income (ATI). After the end of the financial year, the
family's CCS rate is balanced (reconciled) using their actual (ATI).

The Resources page has a table showing the different CCS percentages
based on a family’s combined income. For more information, see Combined
family income for Child Care Subsidy (CCS). The CCS percentage is
applied to the maximum hourly rate cap.

More than one CCS eligible child aged 5 or under

From 7 March 2022, families with more than one child aged 5 or younger
may get higher CCS (Multiple Child Subsidy) for one or more of their
children.

This means customers will now be eligible for the higher subsidy if all
of these apply:

-   they are eligible for CCS
-   their family’s combined income is under $356,756
-   they have more than one child aged 5, or younger

Note: from 7 March 2022 - 10 July 2023 entitlement to higher subsidy is
based on the CCS eligibility (current) status of children in the
customer’s care, aged 5 or under. Children do not need to be enrolled or
actively using child care during this period.

The eldest CCS eligible child aged 5 or younger is known as the Standard
Rate Child. They will continue to receive the income tested rate of CCS.
Any CCS eligible younger children will receive the higher rate of CCS
(and will be referred to as Higher Rate Children).

The Higher Rate Child will always receive 30% added to their standard
rate of CCS, up to a maximum 95%. As the total maximum CCS rate for a
Higher Rate Child is 95%, some children may receive less than the MCS
maximum 30% increase. The Resources page contains examples of the higher
rate of CCS calculation.

Customers do not need to do anything to access the higher rate of CCS.
The system will:

-   identify all relevant children, and
-   apply the higher (Multiple Child Subsidy) rate of CCS automatically

In Home Care (IHC) sessions of care will always be paid at the standard
income tested rate of CCS.

Where:

-   a customer has multiple children with the same date of birth (e.g.
    multiple births such as twins or triplets), and
-   they all meet the eligibility of a Standard Rate Child,
-   the system will automatically determine the Standard Rate Child as
    the child with the lowest number CRN

A customer can ask to change which child is determined as the Standard
Rate Child for multiple birth children. For more information see.
Exceptional circumstances for Child Care Subsidy (CCS) and Additional
Child Care Subsidy (ACCS).

Higher CCS (Multiple Child Subsidy) - Combined families

A combined family for higher CCS (Multiple Child Subsidy) is where both
members of a couple are individually CCS eligible for different children
in their family.

From 7 March 2022 to July 2022, entitlement to higher CCS will be
assessed using children in the individual’s care.

From July 2022, the CCS System will:

-   recognise all children in the care of both customer's as one family
    unit, and
-   determine the family's Standard and Higher rate children

In July 2022, Services Australia will:

-   reassess all combined families back to 7 March 2022, and
-   pay any CCS arrears owed

It is recommended families wait to get the automatic rate increase and
arrears payment in July 2022.

If a combined CCS family asks for immediate access to the higher rate of
CCS, one parent can claim for all children in the family. The family
must:

-   have one parent or carer claim for all children in the family
-   contact the child care service, and
-   create a new enrolment for the child/ren in the name of the person
    claiming CCS for the child/ren

CCS claims can only be backdated a maximum of 28 days.

The Resources page contains examples of Combined Family assessments.

CCS Activity test

The number of subsidised hours of child care a family can access in a
fortnight will be determined by an activity test. The customer (and
their partner) need to:

-   be participating in recognised activity/ies for a specific amount of
    hours, or
-   have an exemption

The Resources page has a table outlining the number of subsidised hours
a customer may be entitled to access based on their (and their
partner’s) level of activity. For more information, see Activity Test
for Child Care Subsidy (CCS).

Type of child care service used

The type of child care service used will determine the maximum hourly
rate cap to which a customer’s CCS percentage will be applied.

Types of child care include:

-   centre based day care service
-   family day care service
-   outside school hours care service
-   in home care

When a child attends centre-based day care or outside school hours care,
the hourly rate cap used will depend on whether the child/ren attends
school.

In some cases the child’s school level will mean a different hourly rate
cap is used.

If the child is:

-   school aged and in centre-based care the outside school hours care
    rate cap will be used
-   below school age and in outside school hours care the centre-based
    day care rate cap will be used

A school aged child is a child who is:

-   in school, including being home schooled, or
-   6 or older

Withholding of CCS

Most customers will have a set rate of 5% of their CCS payments withheld
until reconciliation. A customer can change their withholding rate.

Absences

CCS and ACCS is payable up to a cap of 42 absences per financial year.
Additional absences are payable if appropriate evidence is provided to
the child care service.

The Resources page contains a table showing the CCS percentage
applicable based on combined family income, and the eligible hours of
subsidised care based on the number of hours engaged in a recognised
activity. There is also a link to the Services Australia calendar, which
shows the start of each CSS fortnight.
