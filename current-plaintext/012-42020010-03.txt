This page contains steps on how to add or cease acupuncture
accreditation for a general practitioner in PDS.

RACGP emails the agency advising of general practitioners eligible for
acupuncture accreditation. The below process commences after the email
from the RACGP has been received through current workflow arrangements.

Note: email requests received directly from general practitioners
requesting this accreditation should not be processed. Escalate to a
Programme Support Officer (PSO) who will escalate to a Programme Officer
(PO) for further investigation and escalation to the RACGP if necessary.

Requests to cease acupuncture accreditation may be received from either
the RACGP or from the general practitioner directly.
