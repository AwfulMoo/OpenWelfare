This document outlines information about the Aged Care Entry Record
(ACER) form.

Historical SPARC process

The System for the Payment of Aged Residential Care (SPARC) is the
legacy aged care payment system for residential care. SPARC is a view
only system from 20 August 2022.

To view the legacy SPARC process, see the historical version.

ACER form

Aged care services use the ACER form to notify Services Australia of new
care recipients entering permanent residential care or home care.

Services Australia use the ACER form to match the care recipient with
either Centrelink or the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) records
for means testing purposes.

Award or settlement indicator on the ACER form

Aged care services:

must inform the Department of Health and Aged Care when a care recipient
has:

-   entered residential care, and/or
-   commences a Home Care Package, with
-   a compensation entitlement such as an entitlement to compensation
    arising from a workplace, motor vehicle accident or from a common
    law claim

can do this by completing the relevant section on the ACER form lodged
with Services Australia

-   the agency will advice the Department of Health and Aged Care

The Department of Health and Aged Care:

will assess the compensation details

may then apply a compensation payment reduction from the care
recipient’s entry date

advise the aged care service and the compensable care recipient of the
amount of the compensation payment reduction

-   the aged care service will be able to invoice the compensable care
    recipient for the total amount of the compensation payment reduction
    in addition to the other relevant fees and charges

The Department of Health and Aged Care will recover the aged care
services subsidy payments made on behalf of the care recipient, for the
period where compensation payment reduction should have applied if:

-   aged care services does not inform that a care recipient is entitled
    to compensation; and
-   the information is made at a later date

Residential Care subsidies (pre-entry leave)

Previously a subsidy was paid for up to 7 days before a care recipient
entered residential care if an approved provider was holding a place for
the care recipient. This was known as pre-entry leave. The payment of
residential care subsidies and supplements for the period of pre-entry
leave ceased from 1 July 2015 and this subsidy was removed altogether.
This means that the government no longer subsidised periods of pre-entry
leave. A subsidy will only begin to be paid once the care recipient has
actually entered care.
