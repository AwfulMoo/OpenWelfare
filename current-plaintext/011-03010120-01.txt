This document outlines how to manage the IHI of a deceased individual.

On this Page:

Date of death details entered into Medicare customer record

This function is available via Business to Business (B2B) where a
provider has authenticated access to the HI Service.

When a date of death is entered on a Medicare customer record for an
individual:

the individual's IHI is automatically updated

on the Amend IHI Details page of the Consumer Directory Maintenance
System (CDMS), the Status Details tab displays the:

-   IHI Status - which remains as it was (either verified, unverified or
    provisional)
-   IHI Status as deceased - this will be updated to RETIRED after FODD
    matching

The below details must be entered:

-   date of death
-   date of death accuracy indicator
-   source of death notification

The individual's online account is immediately disabled.

The name, date of birth and address of an IHI with a deceased status may
be changed by a Service Officer where supported by relevant
documentation.

Confirmation of deceased via Fact of Death Data

Services Australia receives Fact of Death Data (FODD) information to
confirm details of a deceased individual.

FODD data matching:

-   applies to verified and unverified records
-   does not apply to provisional IHI

Once the date of death has been confirmed by FODD and the IHI has 90
days of no activity, IHI Status is automatically updated to retired.

Notification of deceased via a Service Centre, information centre or mail

When notification is received that an individual is deceased, the
Service Officer must conduct a search to retrieve the IHI.

When an IHI is updated with a deceased status, the below can be changed
where supported by the relevant documentation:

-   name
-   date of birth
-   address

Notification of deceased via a Healthcare Provider

A Healthcare Provider may enter the below via a web service request
(B2B):

-   date of death
-   date of death accuracy indicator
-   source of death notification

Deceased status incorrectly applied to an IHI

In the event that an IHI is incorrectly changed to deceased, the
transaction can be reversed by a Service Officer by removing:

-   recorded date of death
-   date of death accuracy indicator
-   source of death notification

This will return the IHI record to the status prior to the incorrect
date of death being applied.
