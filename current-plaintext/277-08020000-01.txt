This document contains information regarding the scrutiny and
registration of overseas maintenance liabilities.

Registration of overseas maintenance liabilities (excluding New Zealand)

This document outlines the process used when an application to register
an overseas maintenance liability (excluding those made in New Zealand)
is made by:

-   an overseas authority,
-   a parent or non-parent carer, or
-   a person who is entitled to receive or liable to pay spousal
    maintenance

This is necessary so Child Support can give effect to international
agreements and arrangements relating to maintenance obligations.

An overseas maintenance liability arises from:

-   a maintenance order made by a judicial authority of a reciprocating
    jurisdiction
-   a maintenance agreement registered by a judicial or administrative
    authority of a reciprocating jurisdiction
-   a maintenance assessment issued by an administrative authority of a
    reciprocating jurisdiction
-   arrears in relation to any of the above liabilities
-   an Agency Reimbursement Liability (an amount that has been paid to a
    payee by an overseas authority for which the overseas authority
    seeks reimbursement from the payer)

An overseas enforcement order is not an overseas maintenance liability
and cannot be registered. Enforcement orders are made by some overseas
courts to enable enforcement of a registered maintenance liability if
voluntary payments are not made. They deal with the manner in which the
registered maintenance liability is collected.

Note: this document does not include the process for the registration of
liabilities or arrears from New Zealand. For information on this
procedure please see New Zealand 'In' case management - Registrations
between NZIR and Child Support.

To be registrable, an ongoing overseas maintenance order, agreement or
assessment must require a person to pay:

-   a periodic amount (or arrears of a periodic amount) for the
    maintenance of their child or step-child or
-   a periodic amount (or arrears of a periodic amount) of spousal
    maintenance

A payee of an overseas maintenance liability that is not a periodic
amount can apply for the non-periodic amounts to be entered into the
Register. This includes lump sum spousal or child maintenance orders and
non-periodic maintenance liabilities such as insurance, dental costs
etc. When non-periodic liabilities are entered into the Register, they
become a debt due to the payee, not the Commonwealth. The payee can:

-   start their own enforcement proceedings in court, or
-   ask the Attorney-General's Department to initiate court proceedings
    on their behalf

If the payee is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction and the payer
is a resident of Australia, the payee may make an application via the
overseas authority for an Australian assessment as an alternative to
seeking registration of their overseas maintenance liability. For more
information, see Applications for a child support assessment.
