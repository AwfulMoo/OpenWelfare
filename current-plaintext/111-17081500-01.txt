This document outlines call and screen recording and access.

Call recording

Verint records inbound and outbound customer calls and a random sample
of screen recordings in most business areas and locations. Staff must
use Services Australia Workspace so these calls are recorded
automatically.

Call recording relies on a number of IT processes. The agency cannot
guarantee to record all screens and calls.

Purpose and approved uses of call and screen recording

The purposes of call and screen recording include:

-   learning and development to support staff, and
-   quality to look at performance, processes and issues

Other approved uses:

-   support with complaints and feedback management
-   review of decisions
-   fraud, internal audit and security
-   release of information
-   support with difficult calls

See the Resources page for the agency’s Call and Screen Recording
Policy.

Access to call and screen recordings

The agency keeps call recordings in a secure data centre for 7 years and
screen recordings for 90 days. The agency stores audit logs of all staff
access to call and screen recordings. Staff need approval before access
to call and screen recordings is provided.

Not all roles have access to search for call and screen recordings.

Staff can also ask for call and screen recordings sent as a link. They
can then listen to the recording through Verint.

Live call monitoring can be used within Smart Centres as an alternative
to side by side listening. The purpose of live call monitoring is to
support staff building capability under the Pathway to Excellence
(previously known as Flightpath for Proficiency).

Administrative access (informal release) of call recordings

Recordings of conversations between a customer and the agency may be
available to customers. This is through the agency’s administrative
access (informal release of information) processes. This is access to
information already provided to the customer during the call.

A customer can verbally request a copy of a call recording. A Service
Officer will submit this request on behalf of the customer. The relevant
business team will retrieve, review and release the recording to the
customer where available and appropriate.

Guidelines for business areas actioning these requests:

-   ensure the call recording is reviewed in its entirety
-   a request under administrative access includes the customer’s
    discussion between themselves and the agency. Where a staff member’s
    voice is recorded whilst the customer is on hold this is not part of
    the customer's conversation with the agency. This may be removed
    from the call recording prior to release
-   determine whether to remove any sensitivities from the call
    recording in accordance with privacy and secrecy provisions. See the
    Resources page for contact details of relevant teams for guidance
    and advice
-   the business area may need to consider further action after the
    release of a call recording. This may be relevant if there were
    quality or customer service concerns within the call

The Process page explains how to process a customer request for a copy
of a call recording.
