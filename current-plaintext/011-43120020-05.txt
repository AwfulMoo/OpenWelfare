Bank account declaration

-   Repeat the BSB number back to the customer. Ask the customer to
    confirm these details are correct
-   Repeat the account number back to the customer. Ask the customer to
    confirm these details are correct
-   Record the confirmation of both BSB and account number in CDMS
-   Ask the customer 'Do you understand that giving false or misleading
    information is an offence?'

When updating the bank account details in CDMS, include a comment that
the privacy note was read to the customer and they accepted the
declaration and confirmed the bank details.

If the customer does not accept either the privacy note or declaration,
