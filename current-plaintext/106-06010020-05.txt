|                                   | Since 1 September 1994, people    |
|                                   | using their New Zealand passport  |
|                                   | have travelled to Australia       |
|                                   | without a visa but they have been |
|                                   | automatically issued with a       |
|                                   | special category visa to stay in  |
|                                   | Australia on arrival.             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Unlike other visitors and         |
|                                   | migrants to Australia, there is   |
|                                   | no formal application process for |
|                                   | the visa. A New Zealand citizen   |
|                                   | is taken to have made an          |
|                                   | application for a special         |
|                                   | category visa by presenting a     |
|                                   | valid New Zealand passport and a  |
|                                   | completed Incoming Passenger Card |
|                                   | at immigration clearance. An      |
|                                   | electronic special category visa  |
|                                   | is granted to New Zealand         |
|                                   | passport holders, and as such it  |
|                                   | is no longer recorded in a        |
|                                   | person's New Zealand passport.    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Prior to 26 February 2001 it was  |
|                                   | possible for a person arriving in |
|                                   | Australia on a New Zealand        |
|                                   | passport to gain Australian       |
|                                   | resident status, as long as they  |
|                                   | intended to remain in Australia,  |
|                                   | and were considered to be         |
|                                   | residing in Australia - i.e. this |
|                                   | is where their established home   |
|                                   | is. For people arriving in        |
|                                   | Australia from any other country, |
|                                   | they must obtain permanent        |
|                                   | residence status, i.e. hold a     |
|                                   | permanent visa.                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Since 26 February 2001 only       |
|                                   | protected SCV holders can have    |
|                                   | Australian resident status.       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | These changes do not affect the   |
|                                   | right of New Zealand citizens to  |
|                                   | travel freely or to live and work |
|                                   | in Australia. It will, however,   |
|                                   | affect their legal status in the  |
|                                   | country, and therefore their      |
|                                   | qualification for and payability  |
|                                   | of Australian Social Security     |
