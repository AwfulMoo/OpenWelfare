This document outlines information on the environment in which a
customer's information is stored and explains how to search for and
retrieve archived records from environments other than the customer's
current environment.

Customer archive records in other environments

Services Australia stores customer information in a number of
environments on the Centrelink system. The environment in which a
customer's information is stored depends on where they live. This
procedure explains how to search for and retrieve archived records from
environments other than the customer's current environment.

The agency collects huge quantities of data relating to customers. Much
of that data is stored off-line in archives when it is no longer
required online. When historical records are required by Service
Officers or other staff, these are retrieved from the archives.

The Customer Archive Retrieval (CAR) system stores historical data, and
allows staff to retrieve, view and print that data after it has been
archived.

A difficulty may arise in that customers can and do move from one
environment to another. Although current data is transferred to the new
environment when a customer moves, the archived data stays with the old
environment. Consequently, archives may exist in more than one
environment for some customers. Service Officers seeking historical
information may then need to go to each of the customer's former
environments to retrieve those archives.
