|                                   | QMA automatically calculates and  |
|                                   | adjusts the sampling rate for     |
|                                   | each staff member.                |

|                                   | QMA selects work items based on   |
|                                   | an algorithm. The algorithm uses  |
|                                   | the staff member's accuracy data  |
|                                   | from the last 20 sampled          |
|                                   | transitions under the relevant    |
|                                   | variant.                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Under the auto sampling model,    |
|                                   | line managers do not need to      |
|                                   | record and adjust staff           |
|                                   | proficiency levels in ESSentials  |
|                                   | to update QMA sampling rates.     |
|                                   | This includes where new staff or  |
|                                   | existing staff start new work     |
|                                   | (not yet proficient). QMA         |
|                                   | sampling will start at 100% for   |
|                                   | these staff by default.           |

|                                   | Line managers still need to       |
|                                   | record a staff member's skill     |
|                                   | tags in Essentials. This enables  |
|                                   | correct allocation of work items  |
|                                   | through Workload Management. This |
|                                   | includes adding accreditation of  |
|                                   | quality checkers (Quality         |

|                                   |     at 2% QMA sampling rate       |
|                                   | -   Intermediate staff will start |

|                                   | -   All others will default to    |

|                                   | can change. As a general guide,   |

|                                   | -   80% and above triggers a      |
|                                   |     decrease in sampling rate by  |
|                                   |     10% (down to 2%)              |
