This document outlines information to assist Service Officers to use the
Centrelink system to locate and view correspondence as well as paper
forms, stored as digital images.

Digital images

Services Australia uses digitisation to create electronic images of
paper forms which are attached to a customer's record. This includes
claim forms, review forms, regularly lodged forms and other
correspondence.

Documents are scanned at service centres, the agency's scanning
provider, Records Management Units and designated processing teams.
Digital images are also lodged online and received via Desk Top Faxing
or can also be uploaded via the Document Upload function in Customer
First.
