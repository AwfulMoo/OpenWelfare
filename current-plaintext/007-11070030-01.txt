This document outlines details about the reconciliation of Family Tax
Benefit (FTB) and Child Care Benefit (CCB). All CCB/CCR references
relate to financial years prior to 2018/2019.

Automatic reconciliation process

Reconciliation of FTB and CCB (and Child Care Subsidy (CCS)) is an
automatic process, however some cases will need manual intervention to
defer reconciliation or to check the reconciliation result before
finalising reconciliation.

From the FTB Confirm Reconciliation Amount Summary (FCRAS) screen, check
the initial calculation and determine whether to include any special
adjustments during the relevant income year.

Coding of the manual intervention screens can differ depending on the
special adjustments that created the manual Intervention activity.

Child Care Subsidy (CCS)
