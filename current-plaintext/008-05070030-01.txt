This document outlines how to assess a customer's eligibility for
continued payment of Mobility Allowance (MOB) and actioning a
cancellation or reduction in the rate of payment.

Date of cancellation

Payment of MOB must cease when a customer no longer satisfies the
qualification criteria. The date of cessation depends upon the reason
why the customer no longer qualifies.

Payment of MOB can continue at the same rate for a period of grace after
the disqualifying event. The length of this period also depends on the
customer's circumstances. The rules that govern the customer's POG are
the same for a reduction in the rate of payment and a cancellation of
payment.

MOB payment ceases immediately

MOB ceases to be paid immediately if the customer:

is imprisoned or in psychiatric confinement

starts receiving a funded package of support under the National
Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). Note:

-   NDIS participants whose MOB payment has been cancelled continue to
    be eligible for a Health Care Card (HCC). The HCC continues to be
    reissued to the customer unless the National Disability Insurance
    Agency (NDIA) advises the customer is no longer a participant with
    the NDIS
-   Note: My Way participants in Western Australia continue to qualify
    for MOB

Two week period of grace (POG)

A 2 week POG applies where the customer:

-   dies
-   becomes able to use public transport without substantial assistance
-   no longer meets the travel test
-   is provided with a 'gift' car from the Department of Veterans'
    Affairs (DVA) through the DVA Vehicle Assistance Scheme or Motor
    Vehicle Compensation Scheme. Note: this includes the initial car
    provided to the customer and any replacement cars if they receive a
    grant to assist with purchasing
-   leaves Australia permanently
-   is exempt from their mutual obligation requirements while in receipt
    of JobSeeker Payment (JSP) and Youth Allowance (YA) (job seeker), or
-   ceases to receive JSP, YA (job seeker) or Austudy payment due to the
    failure to satisfy their mutual obligation requirements

Twelve week POG

A 12 week POG applies for customers receiving the standard rate when
they cease:

-   participation in gainful employment, vocational training, voluntary
    work or a combination of these activities for at least 32 hours
    every 4 week period
-   to receive JobSeeker Payment (JSP), Youth Allowance (YA) (job
    seeker) or Austudy for reasons other than the failure to satisfy
    their mutual obligation requirements or Activity test requirements,
    or
-   undertaking job search activities under an agreement with a
    government funded employment services provider including Disability
    Employment Services (DES)-Employment Support Service, or
-   activities with their Disability Employment Services (DES) -
    Disability Management Service provider

A 12 week POG applies for customers receiving the higher rate when they
cease:

-   working 15 hours or more per week at or above the relevant minimum
    wage and are in receipt of Disability Support Pension (DSP), JSP, YA
    (job seeker) and Parenting Payment (PP)
-   working 15 hours or more per week for wages determined under the
    Supported Wage Scheme (SWS) and are in receipt of DSP, JSP, YA (job
    seeker) and PP
-   looking for work for 15 hours or more per week under an agreement
    with an employment services provider and have compulsory Mutual
    Obligation or Participation Requirements
-   voluntarily looking for work for 15 hours or more per week under an
    agreement with a government funded employment services provider and
    have no compulsory Mutual Obligation or Participation Requirements
-   to become eligible for MOB at the standard rate

When a customer is no longer eligible for the higher rate of MOB and
enter into a POG, at the end of the POG they will either:

-   revert to the standard rate if they remain qualified for that rate,
    or
-   their payment will cancel

Volunteer job seekers with jobactive

MOB job seekers who register as a volunteer with jobactive receive a
total of 12 months employment assistance in Stream A and can be paid MOB
if they remain registered and have a current Voluntary Job Plan.

When the 12 months with jobactive ends the job seekers cannot
re-register with a jobactive provider unless there is a change in
circumstances, for example they are registered as a fully eligible
participant.

To continue to be paid MOB after the 12 months with jobactive ends, the
customer needs to be registered as a fully eligible participant or start
another qualifying activity for MOB.

The current 12 week POG rules automatically apply to these job seekers
when the 12 months with jobactive ends, their Job Plan ends, or if their
registration ends before the 12 month total is reached (whichever event
occurs first).

Job seekers who have compulsory mutual obligation or Participation
Requirements from 8 December 2019 and receive MOB are not affected by
this 12 month servicing limit.

MOB is cancelled immediately during a 12 week period of grace

MOB is cancelled immediately if the customer is in a 12 week POG and
they:

-   become a participant with the National Disability Insurance Scheme
    (NDIS)
-   leave Australia permanently
-   die
-   become able to use public transport without substantial assistance
-   are provided with a 'gift' car from DVA, or
-   receive a sales tax exemption on the purchase of a car

Coronavirus (COVID-19) measure

In response to the COVID-19 national health emergency, the standard POG
was extended for some customers who receive Mobility Allowance for the
period 20 June 2020 to 31 March 2021. These temporary rules applied to
POGs ending on or after 12 June 2020, extended the POG to a total of 18
weeks or until 31 March 2021 (whichever was sooner) and did not affect
standard duration POGs which would have otherwise ended after 31 March
2021.

Temporary overseas departures

MOB is portable for up to 6 weeks:

-   if the customer is overseas temporarily, and
-   they continue to meet the qualification provisions for MOB

For example, customer goes overseas during an employment/training
holiday period.

The portability period may be for less than the maximum 6 weeks. For
example, if their period of leave is only 4 weeks or their portability
for JSP is for 2 weeks then their MOB portability is restricted to the
same period.
