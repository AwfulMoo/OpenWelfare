DST questions

The Decision Support Tool (DST) is included in the Self-employment
workflow in Process Direct. If staff select 'Unsure' to the question 'Is
the customer self-employed?' and select Next, the DST question set will
display. Once the questions have been completed, the workflow will
provide a recommendation whether the customer is self-employed or an
employee. The information within the workflow, including the
recommendation, will be automatically recorded in a Note.

The use of this tool is not mandatory for staff and not for customers to
use.

Questions asked on the DST

Note: this DST is to assist Service Officers to determine whether or not
a customer is self-employed. The process of making a decision about
whether a customer is self-employed or not, is a process of weighing all
the facts. Each case needs to be decided on its own facts and merits.
The following questions are designed to assist staff to make a
determination.
