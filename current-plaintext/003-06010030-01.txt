If you have concerns about a child's safety, conduct the risk and
referral process.

This document explains how to help identify customer vulnerability and
risk issues.

Social worker referrals

Customers identified as vulnerable or 'at risk' may benefit from a
referral to a social worker.

The help offered by social workers to customers and their families is an
integral part of Services Australia service. Social workers also work
with staff and community to support customers with multiple and complex
issues.

Social workers give priority to:

-   customers presenting at risk of suicide or self harm
-   young people without adequate support
-   customers experiencing family and domestic violence
