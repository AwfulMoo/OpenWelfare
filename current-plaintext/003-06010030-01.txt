Risks to a customer's privacy have been identified. See Separating
Safely - protecting personal details to make sure the customer's
personal details are safe before progressing.

If you have concerns about a child's safety, conduct the risk and
referral process.

This document explains how staff (including Smart Centre staff) may
identify customer vulnerability and risk issues.

Social worker referrals

Customers identified as experiencing vulnerability or 'at risk' may
benefit from a referral to a social worker.

The help offered by social workers to customers and their families is an
integral part of Services Australia service. Social workers also work
with staff and community to support customers with multiple and complex
issues.

Social workers give priority to:

-   people who are at risk of suicide or self harm
-   people affected by family and domestic violence (FDV)
-   young people without adequate support
-   people impacted by disasters and emergencies
