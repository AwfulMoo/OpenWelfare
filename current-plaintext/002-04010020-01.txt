Qualifications for RAA

RAA is a paid to help customers with the higher cost of living in a
remote area.

Youth Allowance (YA), Austudy payment and ABSTUDY customers qualify for
RAA if:

-   they have an entitlement to payment, and
-   their usual place of residence is situated in an RAA Specified Area

If a student's term address is their usual place of residence and their
term address is in an RAA Specified Area, they can qualify for RAA.

Youth Allowance (YA) and Austudy customers

If a student's usual place of residence is in an RAA Specified Area, but
they are not living in this area during terms/semesters, they may
continue to receive RAA for eight weeks from the date they leave their
usual place of residence.

ABSTUDY customers

With the exception of secondary school students boarding away from home,
RAA remains payable for the first eight weeks of a student's or
Australian Apprentice's temporary absence from their usual place of
residence. To be considered a temporary absence, a student or Australian
Apprentice must intend to return to their usual place of residence.

Secondary school students boarding away from home to study continue to
be eligible for RAA as long as their usual place of residence remains in
an RAA Specified Area. The Resources page of Remote Area Allowance (RAA)
payment and eligibility contains information on determining a usual
place of residence.
