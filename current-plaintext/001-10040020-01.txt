This document outlines special considerations when managing job seeker
compliance for job seekers affected by a natural disaster, declared
emergency or assisting with a recovery effort through a registered
organisation.

Job seeker affected by a natural disaster or declared emergency

Service Officers assisting job seekers with outstanding compliance
action are expected to display an appropriate level of sensitivity and
discretion when a job seeker has been significantly affected by a
natural disaster or declared emergency and/or is assisting with a
recovery effort through a registered organisation.

A similar level of sensitivity is required when a location is affected
by a significant event, for example:

-   severe weather, but a formal emergency declaration has not been
    made, or
-   restrictions imposed by local authorities in response to a risk or
    outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19), but the State/Territory has not
    issued a public health order

Service Officers should consider referral to external support services
and social work crisis intervention where appropriate.

Capacity to comply with compulsory requirements

Job seekers, including ParentsNext participants, are required to meet
compulsory requirements in return for receiving a participation payment.

A natural disaster or declared emergency may affect a job seeker's
capacity to meet their compulsory requirements, including the
requirement for prior contact to advise of an inability to attend. An
exemption from mutual obligation requirements may be appropriate.

Service Officers are able to check whether the disaster or emergency is
listed as a current event. For more information, see Emergency
management events and Indigenous Community Events

Contingency arrangements

The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations and/or the National
Indigenous Australians Agency (NIAA) may invoke contingency arrangements
for Targeted Compliance Framework (TCF) and Community Development
Program (CDP) job seekers respectively when impacts are more widely
spread. When this occurs, Services Australia is notified of any action
taken.

When formal contingency arrangements invoked for a natural disaster or declared emergency

Targeted Compliance Framework (TCF) job seekers

Where DEWR decides to invoke contingency the following actions are
generally implemented:

Participation reports for non-compliance are automatically finalised if
contact with the job seeker has not occurred

If a job seeker contacts Services Australia during the contingency
period and there is:

-   an active mutual obligation failure on their record, priority should
    be given to finalising these compliance investigations. Job seekers
    are unable to finalise reporting until a determination has been made
    about the active failure
-   an outstanding work refusal failure or unemployment failure on their
    record, it must be assessed in accordance with normal processes, or
    any advice for the specific event
-   an outstanding Capability Assessment on their record, it must be
    actioned via usual processes

CDP participants

Where the NIAA decides to invoke contingency, they will direct CDP
providers and Services Australia to undertake appropriate actions. These
generally include:

The NIAA instructs CDP providers in impacted regions not to submit any
Provider Reports for non-compliance during the suspension of mutual
obligation requirements

CDP participants are not required to attend face-to-face appointments
with their provider (appointments may be conducted over the phone)

DEWR automatically lifts all outstanding Non-Attendance Reports (NAR),
which will restore suspended payments

If a job seeker contacts Services Australia during the contingency
period and there is:

-   an outstanding Comprehensive Compliance Assessment (CCA) on their
    record, it must be finalised without penalty
-   an outstanding failure on their record, it must be rejected,
    including, serious failures for refusing or failing to accept a
    suitable job offer, and serious failures for persistent
    non-compliance

The following penalties that were previously applied and are currently
being served (or have a future start date) must be ended/waived:

-   8 week non-payment periods
-   Penalties applied due to a reconnection failure, or non-attendance
    failure

Note:

-   Unemployment Failures are generally not impacted by contingency
    arrangements and are managed via usual processes unless otherwise
    advised
-   When formal contingency arrangements have been invoked, PST-skilled
    Service Officers must refer to operational messaging and follow any
    task cards authorised by the Job Seeker Compliance Team associated
    with the relevant event

When formal contingency arrangements have not been invoked

PST-skilled Service Officers investigating compliance action must use
their discretion and consider how the natural disaster, declared
emergency or significant event has affected the job seeker’s capacity to
meet their compulsory requirements. Factors may include, but are not
limited to:

-   how the job seeker was personally affected
-   impacts on their primary residence or action the job seeker needed
    to take to make their property safe
-   transport and accessibility issues in the area
-   impacts on care arrangements for children
-   impacts on communication networks
-   involvement in a recovery effort through a registered organisation,
    or
-   effect of the disaster/emergency on their provider or the location
    of a requirement

In some cases a serious event may be localised or still developing and
may not be listed on the Emergency management events or Indigenous
Community Events pages.

If a job seeker claims to have been affected by a natural disaster or
local emergency event that is not listed, staff are expected to use
their discretion to:

-   decide how much weight to give to the customer’s statement. Staff
    may use other sources to verify the customer’s statements. For
    example, local knowledge, or contacting the provider. The source
    needs to be documented if it is used to make a decision
-   consider how the natural disaster or declared emergency has affected
    the job seeker’s capacity to meet their compulsory requirements
