This document explains when it is appropriate for an away from home rate
of payment to be maintained, even though the student's circumstances
have changed.

Intention of maintaining eligibility for away from home rate

In most cases, dependent students receiving ABSTUDY live at home while
studying. However, some circumstances could make it necessary for them
to live away from home. Therefore, they may receive a higher rate of
assistance.

If those circumstances cease to apply, the away from home rate would
cease also. However, in some cases, the rate of payment can continue
even though the student's circumstances have changed. One of these is
continuity of study.

The intention of maintaining eligibility for away from home rate through
continuity of study provisions is to ensure that a secondary school
student is not disadvantaged when family circumstances change, by:

-   unreasonably expecting them to change school during a year, or
-   in some circumstances, between years

Eligibility for continuity of study

A secondary school dependent student may be eligible for the away from
home rate of ABSTUDY due to continuity of study if all of the following
apply:

-   they have previously been approved for the away from home rate
-   they no longer meet a condition for approval for this rate due to a
    change in circumstances
-   they continue attending the same education institution
-   it would be unreasonable to break continuity of study

Students must have enrolled in accredited secondary school studies to be
eligible for the away from home rate under the continuity of study
provisions.

Permanent home changes

If the student's permanent home changes:

and the student is no longer isolated from any government school due to
time or distance:

-   continuity of study provisions ensure away from home rate continues

to within reasonable travel time or distance of the school the student
is studying at:

-   only Group 2 School Fee Allowance continues as they can keep
    studying at the same school as a day scholar

How to claim

To claim the away from home rate for:

-   new customers, they can lodge the ABSTUDY Claim (SY019), or
-   existing customers, by providing a statement (verbal or written)
    stating the criteria under which they are seeking approval

Unfavourable decisions

When making an unfavourable decision, speak to the customer:

-   explain the decision
-   give them a chance to supply more details or evidence
-   advise their review and appeal rights, and record an application for
    a formal review of the decision if required

Make 2 genuine attempts to contact the customer before finalising the
decision.
