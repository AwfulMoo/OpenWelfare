|                                   | Answer: PCI stands for            |
|                                   | 'Percutaneous Coronary            |
|                                   | Intervention'. This was known as  |
|                                   | angioplasty with stent.           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This procedure is a non-surgical  |
|                                   | procedure that uses a catheter (a |
|                                   | thin flexible tube) to place a    |
|                                   | small structure called a stent to |
|                                   | open up blood vessels in the      |
|                                   | heart that have been narrowed by  |
|                                   | plaque build-up. This is a        |
|                                   | condition known as                |
|                                   | atherosclerosis.                  |

|                                   | What is done? A catheter is       |
|                                   | inserted into the blood vessels   |
|                                   | either in the groin or in the arm |
|                                   | using a special type of X-ray     |
|                                   | called fluoroscopy.               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The catheter is threaded through  |
|                                   | the blood vessels into the heart  |
|                                   | where the coronary artery is      |
|                                   | narrowed.                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | When the tip is in place, a       |
|                                   | balloon tip covered with a stent  |
|                                   | is inflated. The balloon tip      |
|                                   | compresses the plaque and expands |
|                                   | the stent.                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Once the plaque is compressed and |
|                                   | the stent is in place, the        |
|                                   | balloon is deflated and           |
|                                   | withdrawn.                        |

|                                   | Answer: Hospitals can claim for   |
|                                   | the second procedure by claiming  |
|                                   | a second interim PCI package.     |

|                                   | In these cases, Hospitals must    |
|                                   | submit text in online claims or   |
|                                   | write on the manual claim why the |

|                                   | procedure is performed within the |
|                                   | PCI package boundary days, can    |
|                                   | only theatre be claimed for the   |
|                                   | unrelated procedure?              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: Yes                       |

|                                   | unrelated procedures. This is,    |
|                                   | because the PCI Package item      |
|                                   | includes accommodation for all    |
|                                   | procedures within the boundary    |
|                                   | days.                             |

|                                   | Answer: The number of days varies |
|                                   | per package based on what is      |
|                                   | undertaken during the procedure   |

|                                   | hospital can claim a per diem     |

|                                   | If this is the case, how many     |
|                                   | outlier days go with the package  |

|                                   | another procedure. In the example |

|                                   | may apply with use of procedure   |
|                                   | item 38307. By adding the other   |
|                                   | relevant procedure items, it can  |
|                                   | be determined that the hospital   |
|                                   | is claiming the correct package   |
|                                   | item number.                      |
