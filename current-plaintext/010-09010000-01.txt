This document outlines the circumstances when certain student payments
are paid to parents, guardians or third parties.

Youth Allowance (YA) and ABSTUDY

YA and ABSTUDY is generally paid to the customer. There are, however,
circumstances when the payment is made to the parents, guardians or
third parties. The customer may also request the payment be made to a
nominee. If the customer is under 18 years of age, the payment is made
to the parent or guardian unless it is inappropriate, for example, if it
is unreasonable for the customer to live at home.

If the customer is at boarding school, ABSTUDY may be paid directly to
the school/hostel or private board provider.

Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) Scheme

AIC payments are generally made to the applicant. However, at the
applicant’s request, payments can be made to a third party. These are
usually a private board provider, educational institution (for example,
boarding school) or a student accommodation provider (for example,
school term hostel). Where an AIC applicant has requested payments be
made to a third party, and a debt for AIC payments has occurred, the
repayment of the debt remains the responsibility of the applicant.

Payment of AIC to an organisation can also occur where a non-government
organisation is an approved applicant for an eligible student.

SS313 form

The Authorising a person or organisation to enquire or act on your
behalf (SS313) form, is not required by ABSTUDY customers or AIC
applicants to direct payments to a third party where this is part of the
normal payment arrangements or options for these payments. As AIC does
not have a provision for nominee arrangements, payments to a third party
on that basis cannot be made.

The Resources page contains a link to the SS313 form.
