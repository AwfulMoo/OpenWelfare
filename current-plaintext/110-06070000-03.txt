the right person. Access to DVA's View system is needed to ensure
customer details on each system match each other. This work is only

|                                   |     link is not needed            |
|                                   | -   the system detects the DFISA  |
|                                   |     rate fields are populated     |
|                                   |     with a daily rate on a DVA    |
|                                   |     partner record. This normally |
|                                   |     means DFISA is payable for    |
|                                   |     periods before 1 January 2022 |
|                                   |     and the DVA partner's record  |
|                                   |     must be linked to DVA so they |
|                                   |     can be paid. Sometimes the    |
|                                   |     DFISA rate fields contain all |
|                                   |     zeroes (that is, DFISA is not |
|                                   |     payable) - in this case,      |
|                                   |     there is no requirement to    |
|                                   |     link the DVA partner to DVA   |
