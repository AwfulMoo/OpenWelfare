Payments relating to current absence

Portability approved for current absence

Table 3: This table describes the steps to be taken by a Centrelink
International Services (CIS) Officer to code the approved portability
for a current absence from Australia regardless of payment status. It
can also be used where a person has returned to Australia but has not
yet had payment restored or re-granted. Unless otherwise stated, coding
is to be completed in the Customer Record system.
