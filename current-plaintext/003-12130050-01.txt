If a child is in immediate danger or risk of harm you must act, and a
delegate must call 000.

For Services Australia social workers only.

This document outlines the different categories and fields used by
Services Australia social workers to record Child Support Scheme (CSS)
exemption referrals in the Social Work Information System (SWIS).

Child safe framework

In line with a zero tolerance approach to harm of children, if a staff
member in the course of their duties observes behaviour that raises
concerns about a child's safety, Services Australia sets out specific
steps that must be taken. Follow the agency's Risk Identification and
Reporting model, when identifying and responding to child safety
concerns. See: Risk identification and management of threats to the
safety or welfare of a child for more information regarding this model
and the agency's commitment to child safety.

Referrals and contacts

Record all referrals and contacts in SWIS.

Delegated CSS exemption referrals and contacts should only be recorded
in SWIS where a delegated decision is made and an assessment report
completed.
