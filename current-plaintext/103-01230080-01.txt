This document outlines when to recall funds from a BasicsCard to the
customer's Income Management (IM) account.

Recalling funds from a BasicsCard

The only instances where funds should be recalled from the customer's
BasicsCard to their Income Management account are:

-   at the customer's request - this can be during a face-to-face
    interview or over the phone
-   if a Service Officer notices the customer's BasicsCard balance
    exceeds the maximum limit ($3,000). Note: this amount could
    periodically increase due to government initiatives

In all other instances, funds should not be recalled from the customer's
BasicsCard, unless a discussion is held with the customer and they
authorise the action to be taken

Online account

[] If the customer is registered online, they are able to transfer funds
between their BasicsCard and Income Management account as needed via
their Centrelink online account.

Express Plus application

[] Eligible customers are able to transfer funds between their
BasicsCard and Income Management account via the Express Plus
application.
