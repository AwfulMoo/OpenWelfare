This document outlines when to recall funds from a BasicsCard to the
customer's Income Management (IM) account.

Recalling funds from a BasicsCard

The only instances where funds should be recalled from the customer's
BasicsCard to their Income Management account are:

-   at the customer's request - this can be during a face-to-face
    interview or over the phone
-   if a Service Officer notices the customer's BasicsCard balance has
    exceeded the maximum limit ($3,000). Note: this amount could
    periodically increase due to government initiatives

In all other instances, funds should not be recalled from the customer's
BasicsCard, unless a discussion is held with the customer and they
authorise the action to be taken

between their BasicsCard and Income Management account as needed via
