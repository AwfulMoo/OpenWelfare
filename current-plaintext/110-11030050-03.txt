|                                   | An indemnity from prosecution is  |
|                                   | an agreement that the person to   |

|                                   | immune from prosecution, in       |

|                                   | consideration. The indemnity can  |
|                                   | only be issued by the CDPP and    |
|                                   | only after the following          |

|                                   | customer and that evidence is not |

|                                   | The accomplice can reasonably be  |
|                                   | regarded as significantly less    |
|                                   | culpable than the customer.       |

|                                   | the message in language that is   |
|                                   | easily understood, relevant and   |

|                                   | Spend time defining precisely     |
|                                   | what needs to be said and         |
|                                   | assembling relevant facts.        |

|                                   | Think clearly before drafting a   |
|                                   | single word. Plan the writing,    |
|                                   | collect necessary information,    |
|                                   | speak to relevant people,         |
|                                   | organise material, draft the      |
|                                   | statement, edit it and then       |
|                                   | examine if from the reader's      |
|                                   | point of view.                    |

|                                   | A statement is ultimately about   |
|                                   | providing a factual and relevant  |
