Determining a debt waiver

Before determining a debt waiver the debt raising officer must:

-   investigate and raise working age payment debt shell as per normal
    procedures
-   consider if a 10% recovery fee may apply
-   then consider whether a waiver is appropriate

Waiving all or part of a debt

If applying a 10 % recovery fee, it forms part of the working age
payment debt. It is subject to the usual methods of recovery or
non-recovery.

-   If waiving all of the debt, do not add a recovery fee. Waive the
    debt as per normal procedures
-   Do not apply a recovery fee to the waived portion of a debt. If a
    working age payment debt is already raised and a recovery fee
    applied:
-   remove the recovery fee
-   recalculate the recovery fee based on the new debt amount. Part
    settlement (discount) for an outstanding debt can apply where a
    Recovery Fee exists

The recovery fee can never be more than 10% of the amount raised.
