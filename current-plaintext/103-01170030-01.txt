When reading the privacy notice to customers, reference:

-   department as the agency

An Initial Assessment interview is needed to place a customer on IM,
under the DEY and LTWPR measures. The interview:

-   explains how IM works
-   determines how their income managed funds can be best used to meet
    the priority needs of the customer and their family, and
-   give information about other services which may help them, including
    Centrepay

The interview can be held face to face or over the phone. This is
conducted with the customer and if applicable, their partner or payment
nominee.

Failure to attend interview

If a customer does not attend an Initial Assessment interview within
their Income Management engagement period, IM will be automatically
applied to their payments.

If a customer still does not attend an Initial Assessment interview
within 28 days of Auto Income Management starting, their payments may be
suspended.

The Resources page has a links to the Services Australia website, to
Office Locator for links for IM, and contact details for the helpdesk.
