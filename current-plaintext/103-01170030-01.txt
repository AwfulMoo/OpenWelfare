This document explains how to conduct an Initial Assessment interview to
place a customer onto Income Management, under the Disengaged Youth or
Long Term Welfare Payment Recipient measures.

Initial Assessment interview

An Initial Assessment interview is needed to place a customer on Income
Management, under the Disengaged Youth and Long Term Welfare Payment
Recipient measures. The interview:

-   explains how Income Management works
-   determines how their income managed funds can be best used to meet
    the priority needs of the customer and their family, and
-   give information about other services which may help them, including
    Centrepay

The interview can be held face to face or over the phone. This is
conducted with the customer and if applicable, their partner or payment
nominee.

The interview provides an opportunity to advise customers in profile for
IM (Disengaged Youth (DEY) or Long Term Welfare Payment Recipient
(LTWPR) who live in the Northern Territory they do not have to start IM,
but instead permanently transition to the Cashless Debit Card.

Failure to attend interview

If a customer does not attend an Initial Assessment interview within
their Income Management engagement period, Income Management will be
automatically applied to their payments.

If a customer still does not attend an Initial Assessment interview 28
days after Auto Income Management starts, their payments may be
suspended.

Preparing for an Initial Assessment interview

To prepare for an Initial Assessment interview, Service Officers must:

Check whether the customer needs an interpreter, and book interpreter if
needed

Check whether the customer has an excluded payment nominee for Income
Management purposes:

-   If the customer does not have an excluded payment nominee, the
    customer is eligible for Income Management. However, the payment
    nominee must attend the Initial Assessment interview as they are
    responsible for managing the customer's payments
-   If the customer is a payment nominee for another person, that
    person's payments will also be income managed

Determine which exemption category applies to the customer:

-   For customers without dependent children, check for current
    education and rate of payment details should the customer want to
    make an exemption application
-   For customers with dependent children, check age of children to
    determine what evidence will be needed by the customer if they want
    to make an exemption application

Check the record for any vulnerability indicators

Check the customer's current rate of payment and any regular income

Check whether the customer has any current Centrepay deductions or Rent
Deduction Scheme payments

Have relevant Income Management and self-service communication products
available for the customer
