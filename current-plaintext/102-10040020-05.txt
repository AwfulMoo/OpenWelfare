| Scenario                          | Description                       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Restorations where an excess      |
|                                   | payment and arrears result in the |
|                                   | same assessment                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | When a customer's ABSTUDY record  |
|                                   | has been restored, some changes   |
|                                   | that are made to the customer's   |
|                                   | record in the restoration         |
|                                   | activity may cause the system to  |
|                                   | determine an excess payment.      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If arrears are also payable in    |
|                                   | the same activity, the excess     |
|                                   | payment will either be fully or   |
|                                   | partially recovered in the        |
|                                   | arrears, no debt shell will be    |
|                                   | created in the system.            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | It is important to record a DOC   |
|                                   | with the details of the excess    |
|                                   | payment. This will make sure that |
|                                   | a review can be effectively       |
|                                   | undertaken when requested by the  |
|                                   | customer.                         |
