Comparison table for standalone QMA and integrated QMA Workflow

The integrated QMA workflow was introduced on March 2021. It will be
progressively rolled out to all work types subject to QMA.

It is important to determine which QMA interface applies to the work
item selected for quality checking. See the comparison table below for
guidance.
