Release of information legislation

Privacy Act

The Privacy Act 1988 governs the privacy and quality of personal
information, including how it is:

-   Collected
-   Stored
-   Accessed
-   Disclosed

Personal information cannot be released by the agency to a third party
unless it is:

-   Authorised in writing on a Medicare Compensation Recovery Third
    party authority form (MO021)
-   Required under law. For example, under the provisions of the Health
    and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995

A third party may be:

-   an organisation (such as a solicitor) or
-   an individual (such as a friend or relative)

Authority can be given by:

-   injured person or
-   claimant (such as a legal representative)

Freedom of Information Act

Under the Freedom of Information Act 1982, a person has a right, with
limited exceptions, to access documents we hold. An FOI request can take
up to 30 days to process. The Freedom of Information Act 1982 (FOI Act)
gives any person the right to do all of the following:

-   access copies of documents the agency holds, except exempt documents
-   ask the agency to change or annotate customer information if it is
    incomplete, out of date, incorrect or misleading
-   seek a review of the agency's decision to deny a customer access to
    a document or not to amend a personal record

A person can ask to see any document that the agency's holds. The agency
can refuse access to some documents, or parts of documents that are
exempt. Exempt documents may include:

-   those relating to national security
-   documents containing material obtained in confidence
-   Cabinet documents
-   other matters set out in the FOI Act

See: Freedom of Information

Authorising a third party

Written authority must be on the current MO021 form. The agency will
accept the previous form version if it was signed and dated prior to 1
April 2021.

The injured person or claimant can give:

-   the agency authority to release compensation information to a third
    party, and
-   permission for a third party to sign relevant documentation on their
    behalf

The third party must agree to act for the injured person or claimant by
signing the declaration in the form also.

Authorising a third party means that the injured person/claimant is
bound by the third party’s actions.

The agency may then:

-   Release compensation recovery information to the third party
-   Accept or update personal information provided by the third party,
    and
-   Accept relevant compensation recovery documents signed by the third
    party

When authority to release information is:

-   Rejected - provide written notice explaining the reason for the
    decision, a More information is needed to process third party
    authority form (z2450) letter template must be issued
-   Approved - a Compensation claim document enclosed (z2451) letter
    template must be attached with any information that is sent by the
    agency in relation to the case

Note: authorising a solicitor as a third party implies that all
solicitors employed by that firm have the same authority.

The Resources page has links to the letter templates.

Valid third party authority

An authority remains valid unless:

-   revoked verbally or in writing by the injured person or claimant
-   replaced by a new third party authority, or
-   the injured person or claimant dies

Verbal consent for an authorised third party

If an MO021 form has been submitted but is missing a valid signature,
verbal consent can be accepted when:

-   the injured person/claimant has been authenticated
-   the injured person/claimant provides verbal consent authorising the
    third party to act on their behalf, and
-   the MO021 form is current and otherwise complete. See the
    information required on an MO021 form in Step 5 Table 1 on the
    Process page

An injured person or claimant does not need to give their signature
after providing a verbal consent.

An authorised third party cannot give their verbal consent. Their valid
signature must be included on the form.

Obtaining verbal consent

-   Make an outbound call and complete PoRO checks
-   Ask the injured person ‘do you authorise (insert name from TPA form)
    to act on your behalf regarding the Medicare compensation recovery
    case that includes your personal information?’
-   Include a case note such as: ‘Verbal consent has been provided by
    [Injured person/claimant] for [authorised third party name] to act
    on their behalf as per the MO021 form at folder [X]’

Note: verbal consent must be recorded in case notes.

The Process page contains the steps for validating written authority to
release information.

Third party authority (MO021) form.

Legal representative

A legal representative is a person appointed by law to act on the
injured person’s behalf.

Appointment of a legal representative can be advised by:

-   Power of Attorney
-   Last Will & Testament, confirming the executor or executrix of the
    estate
-   Letters of Administration or Probate where the injured person dies
    intestate (without a Last Will & Testament in place)
-   Public Trustee documentation, or
-   Court order

When evidence cannot be provided to confirm legal authority, escalate
the case to a Programme Support Officer or Team Leader. They will
determine if further escalation to Programme Management is required.

Consider each case on its own merits.

Date of injury or illness and third party authority

The date of injury or illness is not a mandatory requirement for the
MO021 form under the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995.
However, the agency must be satisfied that the authority received on the
MO021 form is for the correct compensation case.

The MO021 form is invalid if:

-   The date is missing and there is no other correspondence attached
    confirming the correct date of injury or illness, or
-   The date is prior to or after the date of injury or illness recorded
    on an existing compensation case

The authority will remain invalid until the injured person or claimant
confirms correct date of injury or illness, verbally or in writing.

Record verbal confirmation from the injured person or claimant in the
Compensation Case Management System (CCMS) case notes.

If verbal confirmation cannot be obtained, issue the More information is
needed to process third party authority form (z2450) letter template to
the person who submitted the authority. The date of injury or illness is
required to avoid wrongful disclosure of information by the agency that
relates to another claim.

The Process page contains the steps for validating a written authority
to release information.

The Resources page contains links to the MO021 Medicare Compensation
Recovery Third party authority form and letter templates.

Changes to authorised law firm details

A new third party authority is required when the firm representing the
injured person or claimant has:

-   Split into more than 1 business, or
-   Closed, and a new firm has taken on the claim

Where 2 or more law firms have merged and the new firm retains the name
stated on the initial authority, an existing authority will remain in
effect.

Release of information to an injured person or claimant

Documents supplied to the agency by:

injured person, claimant or authorised party can be released, such as
the completed Medicare history statement and declaration

notifiable person or another party cannot be released for privacy
reasons, such as the notice of judgment or settlement. In these
situations, advise the requestor to:

-   contact the compensation payer directly to request a copy
-   request a copy from the agency via a Freedom of Information request.
    Advise them to search for ‘Freedom of information’ on the agency’s
    website

The FOI Team will redact third party names, signatures and email
addresses from documents prior to release. This will avoid a disgruntled
claimant taking a grievances to social media to defame insurance company
staff by name.

A third party may choose to attach a note to a form stating that if the
form is released under FOI, that their name is not to be released. This
will ensure a greater likelihood of their name not being released in
error.

Release information for a minor

Injured person under 14 years of age

When the injured person is under 14 years of age and:

-   Is enrolled on the parent or guardian's Medicare card, the parent or
    guardian can sign the authority to authorise the release of the
    child's information
-   Is not enrolled on the parent or guardian's Medicare Card, legal
    documentation must be provided to verify the third party has a legal
    authority to act on the child's behalf

Note: when the agency is notified that a state or territory Public
Trustee is acting on the child’s behalf, contact the state or territory
Public Trustee for verification and to obtain legal documents confirming
this arrangement.

The Resources page contains a table for assessing documentation
requirements for a third party acting on behalf of a minor.

Injured person over 14 years of age (but under 18)

When an injured person turns 14 years of age, they need to provide
written authority for a third party to act on their behalf, unless the
injured person has never been mentally or physically capable of handling
their own affairs.

If the parent or guardian has not obtained a Guardianship order or Power
of Attorney, a Commonwealth of Australia Statutory Declaration is
required from the parent or guardian, declaring:

-   The injured person has never been mentally or physically capable of
    handling their own affairs, and
-   They have legal authority to make decisions and sign documents on
    the injured person's behalf

If the agency has existing authority signed by the parent, guardian or
legal representative (legally appointed to act on the injured person’s
behalf) prior to the injured person turning 14 years of age, the
authority remains valid due to implied consent until the injured person
turns 18 years of age, provided:

-   The injured person is still enrolled on the parent or guardian’s
    Medicare card, or
-   The legal representative is still legally appointed by law to act on
    the injured person’s behalf

Although implied consent may be accepted as above. Best practice for
privacy is to obtain a new MO021 form signed by the injured person over
14 years of age.

The More information is needed to process Third party authority form
(z2450) letter template must be issued (option 8).

Release of information to the notifiable person

After an advance payment has been made by the compensation payer,
details of the case can only be discussed with the injured person,
claimant or their authorised third party.

Medicare Compensation Recovery cannot release a copy of the Medicare
history statement to the compensation payer, but the compensation payer
may apply to the Information Release team for this information. The
Information Release Team must have a signed authority from the injured
person or claimant to release the information.

Where an advance payment has not been received at judgment or
settlement, and there is no valid notice of past benefits, a notice to
claimant (Medicare history statement and declaration) is sent to the
injured person or claimant, and when returned, a notice of charge will
be issued to the compensation payer.

Revoking authority including new solicitor representation

The injured person or claimant must advise the agency if they no longer
authorise the release of their information to the third party. This can
be done verbally or in writing. Even after the case is closed, the
authority continues until revoked.

An authorised third party can also notify the agency that they no longer
represent the injured person or claimant, verbally or in writing.

Where the injured person or claimant reports a change in solicitor, a
new MO021 form will be required to authorise release of information to
the new solicitor.

Where the agency becomes aware of the possible involvement of a new
solicitor representing the injured person or claimant, request a new
MO021 form from the new solicitor.

If this is not possible, contact the injured person or claimant or
existing authorised solicitor to determine if the solicitor has changed.
If the solicitor has changed, ask for a verbal cancellation of the
existing authority.

Clearly record revoked authority in the Compensation Case Management
System (CCMS) case notes. No further information must be released to
that third party.

Verbal consent for telephone conversations

In telephone conversations with the injured person or claimant, they may
request to include another person for the duration of the call, such as
a relative or friend. See the Process page for instructions.

The Resources page contains links to contact details, forms, letters and
email templates and information for Service Officers on assessing
documentation requirements for a third party.
