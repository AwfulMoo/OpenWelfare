This document outlines the assessment of hardship for customers serving
an Income Maintenance Period (IMP).

Hardship provisions

For customers who are serving a waiting period for payments made to them
by an ex-employer, hardship provisions are in place so that no
individual would be put in severe financial hardship if they have had to
spend money on unavoidable or reasonable expenditure.

Care should be taken to validate the expenditure and to decide whether
the customer would be put into hardship without the waiving of the
Income Maintenance Period (IMP).
