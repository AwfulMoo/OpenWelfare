This document outlines information about what happens when a JobSeeker
Payment (JSP), Youth Allowance (YA) or Austudy customer advises they
have commenced or returned to self-employment.

Unemployed determination

A customer or partner may be involved as the owner or part owner in a
business when they initially claim an income support payment.

For JSP or YA (job seeker) customers who are self-employed, Service
Officers must determine if they are unemployed.

Self-employed customers are considered to be unemployed if they are able
to:

-   fulfil their mutual obligation requirements, and
-   willing to undertake any suitable work

Self-employment will fully satisfy their mutual obligation requirements
if the person is working at least their required number of hours and the
net income of the business provides the equivalent of the national
minimum wage for the minimum required hours.

Working Credits

Income from self-employment cannot be offset against Working Credits
because it is not regarded as employment income. If the customer's (or
their partner's) income reduces their rate to nil and the income is from
self-employment only, then payments should be cancelled immediately. If
some of the income is employment income the customer may be entitled to
use their Working Credits to offset their employment income. If payment
is reduced to nil rate, a customer can remain current at nil rate for up
to six fortnights and retain certain benefits.

Youth Allowance (YA)

YA customers who are not full-time students may not qualify for payment
if they are substantially involved as the owner or part owner in a
business. Full-time students claiming or receiving YA or Austudy may
qualify for payment if they continue to meet the requirements of a
full-time student. These customers must regularly report their income
from self-employment.

Partial capacity to work

JSP and YA (job seeker) customers who have a partial capacity to work
and are self-employed may meet their mutual obligation requirements if
they are working a minimum of, and declaring at least, minimum wages for
more than 15 hours per week (30 hours, or more, per fortnight).

Principal carers

If the principal carer of a dependent child commences self-employment,
they may satisfy their mutual obligation requirements if they are
working a minimum of 15 hours per week (30 hours, or more, per
fortnight) and declaring at least minimum wages for this period.

The Resources page provides an example of a customer seeking approval to
commence self-employment. It also contains links to relevant forms.
