This document outlines the information required from a customer when
their partner, who is not receiving an income support payment, commences
or returns to work and the effect it will have on their payment.

Partner on income support payments

This procedure does not apply if the partner commencing or returning to
work receives a Centrelink income support payment.

Entitlement to income support payments

A customer may still be entitled to an income support payment if their
partner is working on a full-time basis, depending on the level of
income paid to the partner. If the customer's partner is working
casually or part-time, the partner may also be entitled to an income
support payment.

Self-service

[]Age Pension (AGE), Carer Payment (CAR) and Parenting Payment (PP)
customers who are currently notification reporters will be able to
update employment status via Centrelink Online Account and Express Plus
Mobile App when their partner commences or returns to work with variable
employment income. This service will automatically place the customer on
two weekly reporting.

Genuine attempts must be made to transition customers to report via self
service options before assisted reporting is completed, unless an
Exception applies.

Notifying employment income

It is the responsibility of each income support recipient to notify the
Services Australia of any employment income paid to themselves or their
partner:

-   within 14 days for notification reporters
-   on their Entitlement Period End Date (EPED) via a Reporting
    Statement (online or phone), in person or in writing (SU19) if they
    have mutual obligation requirements
-   via self-service, verbally or in writing for two weekly reporters

Working credit, Work Bonus and nil rate

When the customer receiving the income support payment has employment
income:

-   If under Age Pension age - Working Credits may enable the person to
    keep some of their income support payment while they are working
-   If over Age Pension age -and in receipt of a pension (excluding PPS)
    they may be entitled to the Work Bonus. Note: the Work Bonus is not
    used in the customer's transitional rules calculation, however the
    Work Bonus will still be used in the comparison calculations and
    partners may still benefit by the reduction in total income
-   If the person's income reduces their fortnightly rate to nil and
    some of that income is employment income, the person's payment may
    remain current at nil rate for up to six fortnights and they may
    retain certain benefits
