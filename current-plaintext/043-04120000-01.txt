For Complex Assessment Officer (CAO) use only

This document outlines how to search for, index, record and review
entities within environment A using the organisation screens and the
trust and company script. Information is provided about linking business
entities to customers or other entities, and on how to assess and code
multiple entity structures.

Private trusts and companies

A customer can be involved in designated and controlled private trusts
or private companies as a director, shareholder, appointor, trustee,
beneficiary, creditor or investor. Private trusts and private companies
are recorded as individual entities that are linked to customers. All
organisations are recorded in environment A.

It is common for one organisation to control or have a financial
interest in another organisation, therefore links are also required
between these entities' records for a correct assessment to be made.
