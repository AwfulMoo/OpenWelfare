This document explains employment services for eligible visa holders. A
visa is issued to non-Australian citizens to allow the holder to travel
to and enter Australia, and/or remain in Australia. The type of visa the
customer holds determines their eligibility to access employment
assistance.

Special Benefit (SpB) recipients

Nominated Visa Holders (including Temporary Protection Visa Holders and
Safe Haven Visa Holders) receiving Special Benefit who have mutual
obligation requirements must be registered as Fully Eligible
Participants (FEP) for Workforce Australia services.

Other Special Benefit customers (those without mutual obligation
requirements) are fully eligible for Workforce Australia services but
have voluntary requirements with their Employment Services Provider.

Non-protected SCV holders

Non-Protected SCV holders granted JobSeeker Payment (JSP) or Youth
Allowance (YA) under the New Zealand 10 year residence exemption are
eligible for Workforce Australia services while they are in receipt of
payment for a one-off 6 month period as a Volunteer job seeker.

These SCV holders are not eligible for:

-   Disability Employment Services (DES)
-   New Enterprise Incentive Scheme (NEIS), or
-   Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP)

Visa holders with working rights, not receiving income support

Visa holders are eligible for Workforce Australia Online servicing as a
Volunteer if they:

-   hold a visa that carries working rights
-   are serving a Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Period, or
-   are receiving Status Resolution Support Services (SRSS) payments

Exclusions from employment assistance

The following job seekers are excluded from being registered for
employment assistance:

-   overseas visitors on a working holiday visa
-   overseas students studying in Australia
-   people prohibited by law from working in Australia (including by
    conditions on their temporary visa) - a visa condition code number
    will appear on the visa, usually with text such as 'Employment not
    permitted'

If a visa holder is unable to confirm they have working rights in
Australia, evidence of working rights can be requested.

The Resources page has a link to Visa Entitlement Verification Online
(VEVO), which customers can access to confirm current visa details and
entitlements.
