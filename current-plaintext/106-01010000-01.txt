This document outlines content relevant when a customer contacts
Services Australia intending to claim a payment, or concession card
(including some health care cards).

Claim enquiries

When a customer, their nominee or a third party advises they intend to
claim a payment or concession card, advise them to submit a claim with
all the supporting documents requested to be assessed from the earliest
possible date.

When the customer is unable to submit their claim due to vulnerable
circumstances, see Intent to claim and vulnerable customers.

If a customer, their nominee or a third party contacts Services
Australia about making a claim before the customer is qualified:

-   check if the customer can lodge a complete claim under the early
    claim provisions, or
-   advise them to submit a claim when they become qualified

Note: early claim provisions do not apply to concession card claims.
