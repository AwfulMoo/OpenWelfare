This document outlines information about how to register Medicare
Compensation Recovery claims and how to register a manual case when it
is determined that the case cannot be processed accurately on the
Compensation Case Management System (CCMS).

About case registration

Notification (resulting in registration) of a compensation claim is not
required under the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995
until judgment or settlement has been reached.

When a compensation case can be registered

A compensation case can be registered when Services Australia receives:

-   a valid request for a Medicare history statement/notice of past
    benefits, or
-   a valid notice of judgment or settlement
-   a valid notice of reimbursement arrangement

Registration of a claim

Compensation recovery cases are registered on CCMS. When a request for a
notice of past benefits is received prior to judgment or settlement,
Services Australia is required to action the request within the 28 day
legislative timeframe by registering the claim for compensation.

System registration information requirements

A case is registered when the first document relating to a compensation
case is submitted to Services Australia.

Generally the first document is one of the following:

-   a valid request for a notice of past benefits
-   a valid notice of judgment or settlement, or
-   a valid notice of reimbursement arrangement

In addition to the mandatory information needed to register a
compensation case the agency also needs to enter the below into CCMS
during registration:

-   Medicare number
-   date of lodgement (date document is received by the agency) i.e.
    date stamped on mail, date of email or fax

Error detected prior to further processing

Where it is determined that a case was registered in error because of
incomplete or invalid documents, complete the steps below before any
further processing:

-   check the compensation email inbox for the documents received
-   where documents were not located, confirm that the relevant missing
    information letter was issued with a copy of the document enclosed
-   where appropriate complete end to end processing and terminate the
    case

See the Table on the Process page for how to re-route to the termination
queue and terminate the incorrectly registered case. A new case can be
registered upon receiving the complete/valid document.

See Mandatory checks for Medicare Compensation Recovery for the
mandatory information required and letters to request any missing
information.

CCMS

All compensation cases are registered on CCMS except for cases:

-   where a bulk payment agreement applies
-   without entitlement to claim Medicare benefits
-   assessed as not notifiable

See:

Payments, refunds and debts for Medicare Compensation Recovery

Notifiable and not notifiable claims for Medicare Compensation Recovery

The CCMS allocates a Work Identification Number (WIN) to each
compensation recovery case. The WIN is:

-   the compensation case's identification to which all documents
    received for the compensation case are scanned to, and
-   used as Services Australia reference on all outgoing correspondence,
    and
-   used to identify documents or forms submitted to the agency

Compensation Recovery mainframe screens

The Compensation Recovery screens in mainframe should only be used when
there is not enough information to register in CCMS, and can only be
used when the Medicare number has been provided.

Service Officers must use the mainframe screens to record any action
taken. For example:

-   letter requesting further information issued, or
-   telephone contact with insurer or claimant

The Resources page contains links to the Notice of judgement or
settlement, Request for a Medicare History Statement and Notice of
reimbursement arrangement forms, email templates and contact details.
