This document outlines the Quality On Line (QOL) process for Australian
Victim of Terrorism Overseas Payment (AVTOP) claims.

On this Page:

AVTOP

The Social Security Amendment (Supporting Australian Victims of
Terrorism Overseas) Act 2012 allows the Prime Minister to declare that
an overseas terrorist act is one to which the AVTOP applies.

The Australian Government’s AVTOP is the first comprehensive scheme that
covers Australian victims of overseas terrorism.

The scheme does not extend to domestic terrorism, domestic crime, other
Commonwealth crimes or natural disasters.

QOL

The QOL process involves checking customer updates for payment
correctness and also ensuring the Getting it Right (GIR) Minimum
Standards are undertaken by the Service Officer updating the customer
record.

QOL Checker Certification

Due to the low volume of applications commonly received, QOL Checker
Certification will be subject to an alternate QOL Checker Certification
process. For information on how to become an AVTOP QOL checker email the
Emergency Management Level 2 Helpdesk.
