This document explains how to refer customers to appropriate financial
capability services. These services are free, voluntary and
confidential. Customers can self-refer to these services at any time.

Background

Financial capability is:

defined as the capacity, based on a combination of financial knowledge,
skills, attitudes and confidence, to make and exercise money management
decisions which best fit the circumstances of one’s life

an essential everyday life skill:

-   it means being able to understand and navigate the financial
    landscape, manage money and financial risks effectively to avoid
    financial pitfalls
-   being financially capable means people are able to make sound
    decisions about their money

Staff are responsible for identifying when people need support, and to
provide information, tools and resources targeted to a customer’s
personal circumstances. While it is important to support customers to
build their financial capability, staff are not expected to be financial
planners or counsellors.
