500-599 - restorative (fillings) services

Processing 500-599 range item numbers

This table describes the business rules, restrictions and actions
required for processing dental service items 500-599. It states the
Processing Indicator (PI) or rejection reason (RSN) code to be used.

General

Restorative services are fillings. Treatments to provide fillings are
covered by items in the 500 range (and items in the 600 range which are
usually fillings involving gold).

A restoration and crown provided on the same day are not payable if both
treatments are for the same tooth. The filling (restoration) has to set
before the crowns are placed on or over the tooth.

If the services are for:

-   the same tooth, reject the restoration item with RSN code S 159
-   different teeth, pay the restoration item with PI 42

Restorations cannot be performed where complete dentures have been
previously provided. If a restoration item restricts with a complete
denture (711, 712 and 719), check the tooth numbers.

If the restoration item is for the same jaw as the complete denture,
reject the restoration item with RSN code S 159.

There is a limit of 5 single-surface adhesive restorations (521 and 531)
per day from any provider without prior financial approval.
