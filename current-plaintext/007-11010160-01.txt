This document outlines the process for assessing an exemption from the
non-payment of FTB instalment payments to zero entitlement customer
measure. An exemption may be considered if a customer has demonstrated
an entitlement to FTB instalments since the preclusion was applied, or
if the customer has had a change in circumstances.

Preclusion from FTB instalments

Under the Non-payment of FTB instalment payments to zero entitlement
customers measure, customers who repeatedly underestimate their income
for FTB and then have no entitlement at reconciliation will no longer be
entitled to receive fortnightly instalment payments of FTB Part A and/or
FTB Part B.

A customer's precluded FTB instalment payment can be reinstated if the
customer is eligible for an exemption.

Exemption reasons

An exemption can be applied if any of the following has occurred since
the end of the 2 consecutive zero entitlement years:

An FTB child that was not an FTB child of the customer (or their
partner) during the 2 consecutive zero entitlement years has come into
care of the customer (or their partner). This can include any of the
following:

-   newborn or adopted child
-   Regular Care child that has since become an FTB child
-   partner's child that has become an FTB child of the customer since
    becoming partnered

The customer has become separated or is no longer a member of a couple
with the person who was their partner at the end of the second zero
entitlement year

The customer (or their partner) has received or been granted an income
support payment

The customer has a deemed entitlement to FTB, except when they are in an
employment income nil rate period

The customer (or their partner) has an entitlement to FTB greater than
zero for a later financial year due to reconciliation, re-reconciliation
or the assessment of a lump sum claim

Special circumstances for a non-payment of FTB instalments preclusion
exist in relation to the customer or their partner that did not exist at
the end of the 2 consecutive zero entitlement years

An exemption may also be created due to a ministerial instrument.

Note: exemptions due to deemed or assessed entitlement (reconciliation,
re-reconciliation or lump sum claim) are not applied if the customer has
had an additional 2 consecutive financial years since this entitlement
occurred.

Duration of the exemption

An exemption will apply until either the customer meets the rules for a
new preclusion to be applied or until a new exemption is granted, except
for:

-   Special circumstances due to the death of an FTB child exemptions.
    These exemptions may only be granted for the duration of the
    bereavement period to enable the customer access to FTB instalment
    payments for any surviving children
-   Becoming separated exemptions. If the customer was granted an
    exemption due to separating from their partner but then reconciles
    with the partner for whom the exemption was granted, the exemption
    will cease from the date they reconciled

When an exemption is assessed

Eligibility for an exemption is assessed when:

-   a claim to receive FTB by instalments is received from a precluded
    customer (or their partner) who is not FTB current
-   an FTB current customer with a precluded component advises a change
    in circumstances, or
-   a customer requests an reassessment because of a change in
    circumstances

The Resources page has text to use in letters and DOCs when rejecting an
exemption and examples of determining exemptions. It also contains a
guide to determining the Date of Event (DOV).
