|                                   | important to check with the carer |

|                                   | receive any form of ETT during    |
|                                   | this period. Using ETT provisions |
|                                   | will allow a pro-rata rate of     |

|                                   |     because absences for ETT may  |
|                                   |     allow the carer to be paid a  |
|                                   |     pro-rata amount of CA or      |

|                                   |     absence. For example, if the  |
|                                   |     child was absent from home    |
|                                   |     for 10 periods of 24 hours,   |
|                                   |     midnight to midnight, per     |
|                                   |     fortnight, the carer would    |
|                                   |     only receive payment for four |
|                                   |     days per fortnight, or        |
|                                   |     4/14ths of the full           |
|                                   |     fortnightly payment once the  |

|                                   | example, if the care receiver     |

|                                   |     ask for an estimated date     |

|                                   |     absence. For example, if the  |

|                                   |     for 10 periods of 24 hours,   |
