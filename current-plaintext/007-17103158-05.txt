Evidence requirements

Note:

-   Evidence already available on a customer's record (for example,
    Employment Separation Certificate, Medical Certificate etc.) can be
    used as evidence to support an application for ACCS (Temporary
    Financial Hardship)
-   Evidence must demonstrate the link between the event and a
    substantial reduction in the ability to pay for child care fees
-   Statutory declarations cannot be the sole source of evidence for
    ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship) applications, but can serve as
    complementary evidence to explain how an event has impacted their
    financial circumstances

and it is not intended customers are required to provide all forms of

required to demonstrate the direct link between the event and the
substantial reduction in their ability to pay child care fees.
