| 1                                 | How to calculate 14 day           |
|                                   | notification period               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Customers generally have a 14 day |
|                                   | period in which to advise of a    |
|                                   | notifiable event. The             |
|                                   | notification period commences on  |
|                                   | the day after the day the event   |
|                                   | occurred. For example, if a       |
|                                   | customer has a notifiable event   |
|                                   | on 11 March, the notification     |
|                                   | period commences on 12 March. The |
|                                   | 14 day notification period goes   |
|                                   | from 12 March to 25 March, and    |
|                                   | the customer has until 25 March   |
|                                   | to advise of the change. If the   |
|                                   | last day of the notification      |
|                                   | period falls on a weekend or a    |
|                                   | public holiday, the 14 day        |
|                                   | notification period ends on the   |
|                                   | next working day.                 |
