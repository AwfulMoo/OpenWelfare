This document outlines the actions required by Service Officers and
Programme Support Officers when resolving enquiries from providers
relating to Veterans' Affairs Processing (VAP). Providers refers to
health professionals or their delegates, practice staff and authorised
representatives from hospitals, residential care facilities or approved
provider organisations. Providers may be registered by the Department of
Veterans' Affairs (DVA) only and not by Medicare.

Perform provider security check for VAP

Service Offices and Programme Support Officers can confirm the accuracy
of confidential information or respond to general processing enquiries
received via the VAP National Enquiry Line (phone line) only when a
provider has passed a security check.

Release of VAP information over the phone

Personal information such as a DVA eligible health card holder’s date of
birth, address or disabilities cannot be disclosed over the phone and
requests for such information must be made from the provider directly to
the DVA.

An eligible DVA health card holder’s card number (also called file
number) or claim information can only be disclosed if:

-   sufficient information (name, date of service, item number) is
    supplied that uniquely identifies the card holder, and
-   the information requested is required to enable the lodgement,
    processing, resolution or payment of a claim

Enquiries from DVA only providers

Certain providers are registered by DVA and not by Medicare ('DVA only'
providers). DVA maintains a database (VPUI) containing information such
as provider addresses, specialty codes and registration details.

DVA only provider numbers are most commonly 8 digit numbers beginning
with 9, and fall into the following approved provider groups:

-   approved residential, community, transition and convalescent care
    providers (claiming item numbers beginning with NH)
-   community nursing providers (claiming item numbers beginning with
    NA, NB, NC, NL, NO, NP, NS, NT, NX, NY, NZ)
-   medical grade footwear prescribers (claiming item numbers beginning
    with F)
-   neuropsychologists (claiming item numbers CL20-CL35)
-   visual aids dispensers (claiming item numbers beginning with OP)

In some instances, enquiries from DVA only providers may need to be
escalated to DVA for resolution - for example, change of address, update
of details.

Contacting DVA providers by phone

Service Officers and Programme Support Officers may occasionally be
required to phone providers if it is appropriate to do so. While this is
at the discretion of the Service Officer and Team Coach, it is expected
that phone contact should be made in the following circumstances:

-   provider education
-   clarifying complex information
-   obtaining minor amounts of missing information in order to complete
    a task (such as process a claim)
-   when a letter to the provider may cause confusion
-   resolving an issue by phone will take minimal time compared to
    rejecting and resubmitting a claim

When a provider is contacted by phone (particularly in relation to
making an amendment to a claim) the Service Officer should notate the
following details in the work distribution tool (for example, sticky
note or processing note):

-   date and time of the phone contact
-   name and position of person contacted
-   information provided by the contact
-   any other information the Service Officer and Team Coach deem
    relevant

Issuing duplicate DVA provider statements

Before issuing a duplicate statement:

-   Providers who have submitted claims via an electronic channel or DVA
    Webclaim can access statements electronically. Check if they can
    access the statement this way
-   Ensure the mailing address is correct as an exact duplicate of the
    original will be created. If an address change has been completed
    after the original statement was issued, a manual statement will
    need to be produced and the address amended, see Veterans' Affairs
    Processing (VAP) for contact details if needed.

Duplicate statements can be issued directly via the Mainframe Customer
Information Control System (CICS) screen.

Statements can be faxed to a provider only in exceptional circumstances
and only by a Programme Support Officer.

The Resources page contains links to contact details, links to the
Release of information and Privacy and Secrecy intranet pages, the fax
duplicate statement template, forms, scenarios explaining how different
types of information can be accepted from providers, examples of
identifying the payment source from the statement reference number and
HPOS Mail Centre standard responses for the Department of Veterans’
Affairs (DVA).
