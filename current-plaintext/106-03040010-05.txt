|                                   | find out what assistance they may |
|                                   | be entitled to. Sandy retired     |
|                                   | last year but refused to apply    |
|                                   | for government assistance until   |
|                                   | they were entitled to Age         |
|                                   | Pension. Virginia is given an Age |

|                                   | recorded. Virginia is advised to  |
|                                   | return the completed claim within |
|                                   | 14 days. Virginia mails back the  |
|                                   | claim form on Sandy's behalf, and |
|                                   | it arrives on 10 January 2014.    |
|                                   | The claim is assessed and         |
|                                   | determined on 11 January 2014.    |
|                                   | Virginia is (50 years old) still  |

|                                   | and is therefore not claiming any |
