This document outlines the procedures on requesting and managing a
user’s System for the Payment of Aged Residential Care (SPARC) access.

Mainframe access for SPARC

SPARC is a system used to process various forms and claims in a manual
or online format for:

-   Residential Care
-   Transition Care – historical only
-   Short-Term Restorative Care – historical only

To use the SPARC system, Service Officers must:

-   request access to SPARC, and
-   set up their MAI mainframe and password

Various security levels are provided to the relevant user's
requirements. SPARC security reviews are conducted regularly to ensure a
user’s access level is appropriate to their position or duties.

To access SPARC:

-   request a resource via the ICT Security Portal
-   download the resource from the Software Centre after the ICT
    Security Portal resource has been approved
-   request a SPARC user account via mySupport. Once mySupport allocates
    the user account (SPARC ID) and temporary password, send an email to
    Operational Change and Correspondence Management team for the
    required access groups
-   setup the SPARC mainframe session and login with the User ID and
    temporary password
-   reset the temporary password after the first successful login

The Resources page contains a link to mySupport.
