This document outlines the services available for customers who have
limited English proficiency, are deaf, or hard of hearing.

Interpreting services during COVID-19

Services Australia introduced changes to interpreting services during
the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. These services continue to be
available for customers with limited English proficiency:

Interpreter Connect service (on-demand telephone interpreters): connects
staff immediately to a telephone interpreter via an automated service

Booked telephone appointments: staff can book a telephone interpreter
for future appointments

Booked on-site appointments: only available by exception, for example
Auslan and sign language appointments

Rostered interpreter service (sessional):

-   provides staff with rostered on-site interpreters at service centres
    with high language needs. Restrictions to the service depend on the
    service centre’s COVID status level
-   Indigenous rostered interpreters are available at Broome, Kununurra
    and Halls Creek Service Centres

Interpreting and translating services

An interpreter accurately conveys the spoken message or signed language
from one language to another. Interpreters provide services in person or
over the telephone.

A translator is required to translate written communication from one
language to another.
