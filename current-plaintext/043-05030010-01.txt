A person or business may submit a claim for assistance for any of the
following claim types:

    northbound assistance when they ship eligible goods from Tasmania to
    mainland Australia. This includes eligible goods shipped from King
    Island or the Furneaux Group to mainland Australia
-   Northbound Assistance for Transhipment - goods shipped from Tasmania
    to mainland Australia, for the purpose of transhipment to other
    markets. Assistance for transhipment is paid at a flat rate per
    Twenty Foot Equivalent Unit (TEU)
-   Southbound Assistance for domestic goods - a person or business
    whose primary business activity is agriculture, forestry, fishing,
    manufacturing or mining may be eligible for assistance for goods
    shipped from mainland Australia to Tasmania
-   Southbound Assistance for imported goods - a person or business
    whose primary business activity is agriculture, forestry, fishing,

-   Furneaux Group Additional Assistance (FGAA) - additional assistance
    may be paid to claimants that ship eligible goods between any island
    in the Furneaux Group and mainland Australia, with a land break in
    the journey on mainland Tasmania. It is intended to assist with the
    additional costs associated with shipping goods via the main island
    of Tasmania
-   Sportspersons and Professional Entertainers - sportspersons and
    professional entertainers who receive an income, fee or financial
    reward for performing in a show or event may be eligible to receive
    assistance. This applies to the return leg of a round trip for the
    transportation of equipment associated with the sporting or
    entertainment event

    Australia for servicing and returned to Tasmania may be eligible for
    freight assistance. This includes foals under the age of 6 months,
    conceived on the mainland, born from eligible brood mares. The foals
    do not need to travel with the brood mare to be eligible for
    assistance
