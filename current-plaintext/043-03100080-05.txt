|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Paul has an annual gross income   |
|                                   | of $12,000 including the GST that |
|                                   | has been charged. Over the year   |
|                                   | Paul pays $1,500 in GST to the    |
|                                   | ATO and the adjusted gross income |
|                                   | is $10,500. This is the gross     |
|                                   | income less the GST that is paid  |
|                                   | to the ATO.                       |

|                                   | Paul's allowable deductions are   |
|                                   | $1,815 (for example, petrol,      |
|                                   | blades, spark plugs,              |

|                                   | ATO. Paul's allowable deductions  |
|                                   | are calculated as ($1,815 - $165) |
|                                   | = $1,650.                         |

|                                   | Paul's annual assessable income   |
|                                   | is $10,500 - $1,650 = $8,850.     |
