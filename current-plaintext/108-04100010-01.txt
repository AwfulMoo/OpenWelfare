This document outlines the details of a home equity conversion (HEC)
loan agreement.

HEC loan agreement

A home equity conversion (HEC) loan agreement is a mechanism which
allows a homeowner to convert all or part of the equity locked up in
their home into cash or a stream of income. A key feature of a home
equity conversion agreement is that the loan (including interest) is
generally not repayable until the homeowner moves out of their home or
dies.

HEC loans assessment changes from 23 September 1999

From 23 September 1999 HEC loans are no longer assessed under the income
test.

Under section 8(4) and 8(5) of the Social Security Act 1991 the first
$40,000 of a HEC loan is exempt from the income test, and under section
8(11) of the Social Security Act 1991 any amount in excess of $40,000 is
now exempt from the income test, however, if any of the HEC funds are
kept as financial assets, they will be subject to deeming under section
9 (1) of the Social Security Act 1991.
