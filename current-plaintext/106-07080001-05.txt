| 1                                 | Question: The customer's address  |
|                                   | on the proof of identification is |
|                                   | different to what appears on the  |
|                                   | claim, how is it coded?           |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | must be the same address (postal, |
|                                   | home/residential, temporary, term |
|                                   | or nominee) as appears on the     |
|                                   | claim.                            |

|                                   | exemption may be appropriate      |
|                                   | while the customer pursues this   |
|                                   | option. See POI requirements for  |

|                                   | Where a customer has a nominee    |
|                                   | and the nominee's address is on   |
|                                   | the documents (e.g. bank          |
|                                   | documents) if the nominee details |
|                                   | are recorded on the record, the   |
|                                   | document can be used.             |

|                                   | task involving the customer's     |
|                                   | information should be passed to   |
|                                   | another member of the team who    |
|                                   | does not have a conflict of       |

| 8                                 | Question: Is a formal death       |
|                                   | certificate from Births, Deaths   |
|                                   | and Marriages (BDM) acceptable as |
|                                   | POI?                              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: No, Death certificates    |
|                                   | were not included as acceptable   |
|                                   | POI documents by the Whole of     |
|                                   | Government Taskforce when it made |
|                                   | its recommendations prior to the  |
|                                   | implementation of Centrelink's    |
|                                   | legacy tiered POI model in 2001.  |
|                                   | Although the BDMs verify the      |
|                                   | death of the person, they do not  |
|                                   | verify the details of any         |
|                                   | survivors that may be mentioned   |
|                                   | on the certificate. The death     |
|                                   | certificate therefore provides no |
|                                   | further evidence of the person's  |
|                                   | identity.                         |

| 9                                 | Question: Can a court order from  |

|                                   | POI points?                       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: No, however it can be     |
|                                   | used as verification on SS230 if  |
|                                   | POI exemption procedures are used |
|                                   | because customer does not have    |
|                                   | sufficient identification.        |

| 10                                | Question: What are the advantages |
|                                   | of a current address on a         |
|                                   | document?                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: Under the framework that  |
|                                   | was developed by the 'Whole of    |
|                                   | Government' committee, documents  |
|                                   | with current address details are  |
|                                   | showing a person's 'locational    |
|                                   | identity'. That is, the person is |
|                                   | at a particular address and is    |
|                                   | contactable at that address.      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | In addition, people will often    |
|                                   | throw out documents when a        |
|                                   | replacement arrives. The 'old'    |
|                                   | document could be found and used  |
|                                   | by someone else.                  |

|                                   | certificates acceptable as POI?   |

|                                   | Answer: Ceremonial, commemorative |
|                                   | or decorative birth certificates  |
|                                   | issued are not acceptable as POI. |
|                                   | These certificates do not include |
|                                   | the required information to pass  |
|                                   | through the Document Verification |
|                                   | Service.                          |

| 12                                | Question: Can a document not      |

|                                   | be used as Commencement of        |
|                                   | Identity documents? (e.g.         |
|                                   | Document issued by the United     |
|                                   | Nations High Commissioner)        |

|                                   | Answer: No, only documents issued |
|                                   | by Australian authorities are     |
|                                   | able to be used for verifying the |

|                                   | Australia. This is because the    |
|                                   | person must establish what name   |
|                                   | they are known by Australian      |
|                                   | authorities.                      |

| 13                                | Question: Why does an Australian  |

|                                   | used?                             |

|                                   | Australian passports and has      |
|                                   | advised that passports up to 3    |
|                                   | years after their expiry date are |
|                                   | acceptable identity documents.    |

|                                   | Answer: Procedures differ for     |

|                                   | came about in the year 2000.      |

|                                   | name change so there can be more  |
|                                   | than 1 letter N on any            |
|                                   | certificate. This has been in     |
|                                   | place since 1986. When the letter |

|                                   | born in a former Australian       |
|                                   | Territory (such as Papua New      |
|                                   | Guinea)?                          |

|                                   | Certificates must be coded with   |
|                                   | the state as EXT (Australian      |
|                                   | External Territories) to be       |
|                                   | accepted by the system. These     |
|                                   | documents show the country as     |
|                                   | being an Australian territory and |
|                                   | are acceptable as POB. Papua New  |
|                                   | Guinea was an Australian          |
