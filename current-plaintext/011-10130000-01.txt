This document outlines how to action Australian Immunisation Register
(AIR) returned mail for individuals and providers. Mail may be marked
'not at this address' or 'return to sender (RTS)'.

Update returned mail indicator for AIR mail

For individuals

AIR correspondence (mail) is sent to the address recorded on
individual’s record on AIR Mainframe.

An AIR Service Officer must record a returned mail indicator when AIR
mail is returned:

-   for Medicare card holders, update in CDMS. See Set a return mail
    indicator
-   for individuals with a Supplementary Identification Number (SIN)
    registration, update in AIR Mainframe. See Table 1.

Note: a returned mail indicator processed on CDMS is also transmitted to
the AIR Mainframe. However, a returned mail indicator processed on the
AIR Mainframe is not transmitted to CDMS.

Address updates on CDMS automatically remove a returned mail indicator
recorded in both CDMS and the AIR.

For providers

To record a returned mail indicator for:

-   a Medicare provider, see Amend Medicare providers for Australian
    Immunisation Register (AIR) in Provider Directory System (PDS)
-   an AIR ancillary provider, see Register, amend or cancel ancillary
    providers for Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) in Provider
    Directory System (PDS)

The Resources page contains information for Service Officers on when to
record returned mail on the AIR system.
