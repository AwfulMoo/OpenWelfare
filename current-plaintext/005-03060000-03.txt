|                                   |     as s1237A of the Social       |

|                                   |     (assurer). An assurer does    |

|                                   |     s1237A does not apply. For    |
|                                   |     instance, where an assuree    |
|                                   |     had received an incorrect     |
|                                   |     rate of recoverable payment,  |

|                                   |     error. Although the error was |
|                                   |     administrative, the payment   |
|                                   |     was made to the assuree       |
|                                   |     rather than the debtor. As    |
|                                   |     such, the debt cannot be      |
|                                   |     waived due to administrative  |
|                                   |     error as the assuree is not   |
|                                   |     the debtor in the AoS case    |

|                                   | However, consider waiver of an    |
|                                   | AoS debt due to special           |
|                                   | circumstances. The special        |
|                                   | circumstances may apply to the    |
|                                   | assurer and/or the assuree        |

|                                   | and determined, as the AoS has    |
|                                   | expired, an AoS debt is waived in |
|                                   | the same way as other debts.      |
|                                   | However:                          |

|                                   |     protected (and the case is    |
|                                   |     still current), then the AoS  |
|                                   |     Processing team can only      |
|                                   |     reduce the debt amount by the |
|                                   |     waived amount before the      |
|                                   |     recovery occurs               |
|                                   | -   If it is determined an amount |
|                                   |     is to be waived and there has |
|                                   |     already been recovery action, |
|                                   |     the amount is to be returned  |
|                                   |     to the assurer. This means    |
|                                   |     that if the bank guarantee    |
|                                   |     has been used to recover all  |
|                                   |     or part of the debt, that     |
|                                   |     amount will be returned       |
