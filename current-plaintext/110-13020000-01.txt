This document outlines information about interventions undertaken by the
Payment Assurance Operations (PAO) Division to address the risk of
overpayments to customers related to income (from means other than
personal exertion) or assets owned by customers, partners or relevant
family members.

UII triggers

Unearned Income Interventions (UII) are triggered from a number of
sources, including:

internal data matching and profiling of data held by Centrelink

external data matching with third parties, such as:

-   Australian Taxation Office (ATO)
-   Australian Securities Investment Commission (ASIC)
-   State Government land title offices
-   Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation
-   Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR)

information received from the public via the Centrelink reporting fraud
online form or the Australian Government Services Fraud Tip-off Line

Objectives

The main objectives are to:

Identify customers and/or their partners who may be receiving or may
have received incorrect payments

Verify the accuracy of details declared to Centrelink

Educate customers to encourage voluntary compliance. This includes:

-   creating early, effective and high quality engagements with
    customers to ensure payment correctness
-   explaining how and when to advise of changes in circumstances
-   the voluntary surrender of payments to which people may not be
    entitled
-   the voluntary disclosure of changes in circumstances which affect
    rates of payment

Improve the integrity of Centrelink records

Outcomes of interventions

If an incorrect payment is identified, action may be taken to cancel,
suspend or vary a customer's payment and to recover any overpayment. As
a result of conducting unearned income and asset interventions, the
outcome can be to:

-   stop payments to those people who are no longer qualified
-   reduce or increase payments to the correct rate
-   raise a debt for any past payments that were received when not
    entitled
-   provide help to people who may be entitled to another type of
    allowance/pension/payment
