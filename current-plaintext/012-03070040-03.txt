Update CSP Officer details registered with the HI Service

Table 1: This table describes how Service Officers amend the CSP Officer
details registered with the HI Service. Note:

if acting on behalf of another person known to the HI Service, for
example a CSP Officer, first search for the individual in the eHealth
Program (EHP) prior to searching for the EHP individual

for the purpose of this procedure we are not acting on behalf of another
individual and will search directly for the individual
