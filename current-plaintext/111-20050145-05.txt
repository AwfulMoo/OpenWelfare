|                                   | this is a Known Issue. For        |

|                                   | brief overall description of what |
|                                   | the issue is. For example, ‘      |
|                                   | Unable to finalise claim as       |
|                                   | encountering E012ZZ’ or           |

|                                   | updating partners assets’         |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| What you were doing               | Outline the steps done            |
|                                   | immediately before encountering   |
|                                   | the error. These steps will be    |
|                                   | used by ICT to try to replicate   |
|                                   | the issue, so make sure it is as  |
|                                   | detailed as possible. Staff must  |
|                                   | include things like if they were  |
|                                   | adding new data or changing       |
|                                   | confirmed data. They should also  |
|                                   | indicate the claim type and the   |
|                                   | screen or table where the issue   |
|                                   | (if known) was found. For example |
|                                   | ‘Attempting to close savings      |
|                                   | account 123456789 using the edit  |
|                                   | option on SVS screen but received |
|                                   | error E047SV’.                    |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Expected outcome                  | Staff must state what they        |
|                                   | expected to see from the system.  |
|                                   | For example, what message did     |
|                                   | they expect to see or screen did  |
|                                   | they expect the system to go to.  |
|                                   | Or if they were expecting a       |
|                                   | certain outcome, provide the      |
|                                   | payment time period and the       |
|                                   | calculations they used to expect  |
|                                   | this.                             |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Actual outcome                    | State the response that the       |
|                                   | system gave after the steps the   |
|                                   | Service Officer took. For         |
|                                   | example, ‘Unable to add parental  |
|                                   | income as advised in MOD JY       |
|                                   | therefore claim is auto rejecting |
|                                   | PIA’.                             |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Action required by ICT            | If there is something that ICT    |
|                                   | should be aware of, or a special  |
|                                   | item required to be done,         |
|                                   | indicate it here. For example,    |
|                                   | ‘Please perform a PIT fix as      |
|                                   | advised in NNU34567’.             |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| What have you checked             | Advise if checked resource        |
|                                   | materials. It is also helpful to  |
|                                   | mention if cross-referenced data  |
|                                   | and/or behaviour in other tables  |
|                                   | or screens. For example, ‘I have  |
|                                   | asked Roxy and referred to OB     |
|                                   | 111-2345678 for the correct       |
|                                   | process’.                         |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Actions taken to resolve          | If the claim was regenerated or a |
|                                   | SAP refresh was used, mention it  |
|                                   | here. Make sure to mention if the |
|                                   | Roxy help text for the error was  |
|                                   | followed (if applicable) and that |
|                                   | it didn’t resolve the             |
|                                   | error/issue.                      |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Other relevant information        | Include any details that could    |
|                                   | assist in diagnosing the issue    |
|                                   | that has not already been         |
|                                   | mentioned. Could include any      |
|                                   | details for other known issues    |
|                                   | with this record or previous      |
|                                   | tickets for the same issue. If    |
|                                   | providing screenshots, save them  |
|                                   | to desktop or folder for          |
|                                   | attaching via mySupport. See ‘How |
