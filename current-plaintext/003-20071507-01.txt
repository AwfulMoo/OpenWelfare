This is a Family and Domestic Violence Interaction Point. If the
customer is with another person, on speaker phone, or already identified
with family and domestic violence concerns, continue with the current
business conversation. Otherwise, go to the Family and domestic violence
procedure to conduct the risk identification and referral process.

This document explains how to manage customer payments after they are
granted for Disaster Recovery Allowance (DRA) and Disaster Recovery
Allowance for New Zealand Special Category (subclass 444) visa holders
(NZ DRA). Note: NZ DRA was previously known as ex-gratia Disaster
Recovery Allowance (ex-gratia DRA).

Eligibility and notification requirements

Customers must meet strict eligibility requirements to get DRA/NZ DRA
payments.

Once the payment is granted, customers must notify Services Australia if
their:

-   contact details change, for example address, phone number
-   circumstances change and this may affect the rate of payment, for
    example their relationship status changes
-   income is equal to or more than the fortnightly rate of average
    weekly income amount

A customer's DRA or NZ DRA payment:

may be cancelled if they:

-   tell Services Australia about a change in circumstances that impacts
    their entitlements. For example, they start earning an income that
    is equal to or more than the fortnightly rate of average weekly
    income amount
-   do not provide, Proof of Identity (POI)
    Note: for DRA claims only - payment can also be cancelled if their
    Tax File Number (TFN) is not provided. If the customer provides
    their TFN after the payment is cancelled, DRA may be restored

will be cancelled if the payment should not have been granted or is
fraudulent

Some customers may need help at the end of the DRA or NZ DRA payment
period, for example to transfer to another payment.
