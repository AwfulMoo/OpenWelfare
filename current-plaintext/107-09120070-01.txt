This document outlines information about the 20% family taper for the
Parental Income Test (PIT) and how it is applied when calculating a
dependent child's rate.

Family taper

The family taper was introduced on 1 July 2010 to:

-   align the PIT threshold with Family Tax Benefit (FTB) rates, and
-   replace the sibling concession

A 20% taper rate is applied on parental income as a 'per family' taper
rate.

Affected payments include:

-   Youth Allowance (YA)
-   ABSTUDY Living Allowance
-   ABSTUDY Group 2 School Fees (means tested component)
-   Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) Scheme Additional Boarding
    Allowance (ABA)

A change in circumstances that affects one YA ABSTUDY/AIC customer may
effect each sibling within the family.

Maximum payment rate

For a dependent customer's entitlement under the PIT, calculate the
Maximum Payment Rate (MPR) Calculate each member of the family pool's
MPR.

Siblings and Parental Income Test

A sibling is included in the family pool if they are in receipt of:

-   Youth Allowance (YA)
-   ABSTUDY Living Allowance
-   Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) Scheme Additional Boarding
    Allowance (ABA), or
-   a sibling who meets the definition of an FTB child or regular care
    child and aged 0 - 15 or 16 - 19 and in full-time secondary study
