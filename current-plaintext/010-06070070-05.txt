|                                   | Students will not always maintain |
|                                   | a steady work load for the        |
|                                   | duration of a course. A full-time |
|                                   | student may choose to do some of  |
|                                   | the course on a part-time basis   |
|                                   | and vice versa. Each section of   |
|                                   | the course should be looked at    |
|                                   | separately if possible.           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Most courses are divided into     |
|                                   | academic periods. The standard    |
|                                   | divisions are:                    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   whole years                   |
|                                   | -   semesters (that is, 2 periods |
|                                   |     per year), or                 |
|                                   | -   trimesters (that is, 3        |
|                                   |     periods per year)             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | It is easy to look at each period |
|                                   | separately in these cases, but    |
|                                   | some courses, particularly those  |
|                                   | offered by private providers, do  |
|                                   | not have any divisions. These     |
|                                   | types of courses often have a     |
|                                   | rolling start date (for example,  |
|                                   | the course starts any Monday) and |
|                                   | will finish a set number of weeks |
|                                   | later. In these cases, the course |
|                                   | is looked at as a whole.          |

|                                   | The general rule for YA is that a |
|                                   | student can continue to be paid   |
|                                   | up to the point at which they     |
|                                   | should have completed the course. |
|                                   | For example, a student in a three |
|                                   | year bachelor degree who has      |
|                                   | already completed three and a     |
|                                   | half years of study in that       |
|                                   | course would be expected to have  |
|                                   | completed the course. Note: the   |
|                                   | delay in completing the course is |
|                                   | not always the fault of the       |
|                                   | student. For this reason, an      |
|                                   | allowance is made to disregard    |
|                                   | some, or all, earlier study, in   |

|                                   |     control of the student. Note: |
|                                   |     evidence must be obtained     |
|                                   |     from the customer. For        |

|                                   | To calculate the total amount of  |
|                                   | study for a number of academic    |
|                                   | periods, it is easiest to measure |
|                                   | each period as a percentage of a  |
|                                   | whole academic year. Therefore, a |
|                                   | semester's full-time workload     |
|                                   | would equal 50% of a year, a      |
|                                   | trimester's 33.3% and so on. If   |
|                                   | the study in a period was         |
|                                   | part-time, the appropriate        |
|                                   | fraction would be used. For       |
|                                   | example, if a student undertakes  |
|                                   | two subjects out of the usual     |
|                                   | four in a semester, this would    |
|                                   | equal 25% of a full year's study. |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If a student overloads in a       |
|                                   | semester or year, it is counted   |
|                                   | as 50% (0.5) or 100% (1.0)        |
|                                   | respectively, and not the         |
|                                   | overloaded figure. For example,   |
|                                   | if a customer undertook 125% of   |
|                                   | the normal full-time workload in  |
|                                   | a year, it is counted as 100%     |
|                                   | (1.0) of the workload.            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A student who is undertaking at   |
|                                   | least 75% of the normal workload  |
|                                   | (or 66%, if a study load          |
|                                   | concession has been granted) in a |
|                                   | period is considered to be a      |
|                                   | full-time student for payment     |
|                                   | purposes. They would also be      |
|                                   | counted as a full-time student    |
|                                   | for previous study calculations.  |
|                                   | For example, a study load of four |
|                                   | of the normal five subjects in a  |
|                                   | semester counts as 50% of the     |
|                                   | year's workload (not 40%).        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Where study load aggregation has  |
|                                   | been applied to satisfy full-time |
|                                   | study requirements, all study     |
|                                   | periods included in the           |
|                                   | aggregation assessment are        |
|                                   | counted as full-time. For         |
|                                   | example, a student is part-time   |
|                                   | (0.25 EFTSL) in semester one and  |
|                                   | full-time (0.50 EFTSL) in         |
|                                   | semester two. An aggregation      |
|                                   | assessment is completed and the   |
|                                   | customer is paid as a full-time   |
|                                   | student for both semesters. This  |
|                                   | equals 0.750 EFSTL, allowing the  |
|                                   | customer to meet the satisfactory |
|                                   | progress rules as they have been  |
|                                   | undertaking an aggregated full    |

|                                   | may be paid up to the end of that |
|                                   | study period. If there is         |
|                                   | allowable time remaining at that  |
|                                   | point then payment could continue |
|                                   | after that. A student can         |
|                                   | therefore be told, for example,   |
|                                   | that they may be eligible for two |
|                                   | years but after that, further     |
|                                   | payment could not be made for the |
|                                   | current course.                   |

|                                   | Scenario 1: Yuki is completing a  |
|                                   | two year TAFE course, which has   |
|                                   | an allowable time of 250% or 2.5  |
|                                   | years (minimum time plus six      |
|                                   | months). The course is divided    |
|                                   | into trimesters. Each trimester   |
|                                   | is 33.3%. Yuki has been assessed  |
|                                   | as previously completing 1.1      |
|                                   | years or 108% of this course. At  |
|                                   | enrolment day this year, the time |
|                                   | already spent studying this       |
|                                   | course is under allowable time,   |
|                                   | so Yuki is eligible for payment   |
|                                   | for this year of study.           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | After this full year's study, the |
|                                   | time spent in study for this      |
|                                   | course will have reached 2.1      |
|                                   | years or 208%, which is still     |
|                                   | under allowable time. However, if |
|                                   | Yuki fails some of the subjects,  |
|                                   | they may need more time to        |
|                                   | complete the course. Yuki still   |
|                                   | has another year to complete the  |
|                                   | course and re-enrols next year.   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Yuki will not have reached 2.5    |
|                                   | years of study or 250% until some |
|                                   | point during the second trimester |
|                                   | of the third year. Because Yuki   |
|                                   | has completed 2.1 years or 208%   |
|                                   | of the course and re-enrols for a |
|                                   | 3rd year, they are eligible to    |
|                                   | study for another 0.4 of a year   |
|                                   | or 42% of the course. The first   |
|                                   | study trimester is 0.3 of a year  |
|                                   | or 33.3%. At the end of the 1st   |
|                                   | trimester of the 3rd year of      |
|                                   | study, Yuki has completed 2.4     |
|                                   | years or 241% of their allowable  |
|                                   | time of 250%. During the 2nd      |
|                                   | trimester, they exceed the        |
|                                   | allowable time for this course.   |
|                                   | Yuki remains payable until the    |
|                                   | end of that study period.         |
|                                   | Services Australia would not      |
|                                   | reconsider allowable time until   |
|                                   | the end of that 2nd trimester. At |
|                                   | that point, Yuki's entitlement    |
|                                   | would cease.                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Upon initial application, Yuki    |
|                                   | should be informed that payments  |
|                                   | may not continue after the second |
|                                   | trimester of the third year.      |

|                                   | Scenario 2: Charlie is            |
|                                   | undertaking a Bachelor of Arts    |
|                                   | degree at university, which has a |
|                                   | minimum duration of 3 years and   |
|                                   | an allowable time of 3.5 years    |
|                                   | (350%). Charlie’s university      |
|                                   | delivers courses to an academic   |
|                                   | calendar based on 2 semesters per |
|                                   | year.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Charlie was studying the course   |
|                                   | full-time for 3 years, needing to |
|                                   | repeat some subjects. Following   |
|                                   | year 3, Charlie decided to reduce |
|                                   | to a part-time study-load (50% of |
|                                   | their semester study-load, or 25% |
|                                   | of their year’s study-load) at    |
|                                   | the beginning of the current      |
|                                   | semester.                         |

|                                   | At the end of this semester, the  |
|                                   | total time spent in the course is |
|                                   | 3.25 years (325%), which is less  |
|                                   | than the 3.5 years (350%)         |
|                                   | allowable time. As the allowable  |
|                                   | time has not been reached,        |
|                                   | Charlie is eligible for payment   |

|                                   | will be 3.75 years (375%) at the  |
|                                   | end of the semester. At that      |
|                                   | point, Charlie’s entitlement will |

Student Programme Resource Tool

The Student Programme Resource Tool contains useful reference
information and links. It includes:

-   Allowable Time Calculator
-   Distance Education & Private Provider Date Calculator
-   Long Term Income Support Calculator

The tool can only be used to assist with Allowable Time Assessments if
all study undertaken at the Institution is studied under the current
Term/Semester structure. If the student has studied at the same
institution under different structures the tool will not be able to
assist with the assessment for study within the previous structure. A
manual allowable time assessment is required.
