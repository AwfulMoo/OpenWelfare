This document outlines the Child update screens. Child Update screens
are used to record and display current and historical information
relating to a child's circumstances. If updates are required for Child
Care Subsidy (CCS) purposes, refer to the relevant CCS Operational
Blueprint page for reference.

Change of circumstances

This information is used in calculating family assistance, income
support and concession card entitlement for customers who claim payments
in relation to the child.

If a customer claims a payment in relation to the child or advises that
the child's circumstances have changed, the child should be selected on
the customer's record so that the details can be recorded. If the child
is a Centrelink customer, child details must be recorded on the child's
record.
