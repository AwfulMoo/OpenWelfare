|                                   | A customer who is receiving CCS   |
|                                   | or ACCS contacts their child care |
|                                   | service to advise that their      |
|                                   | child will be absent from child   |
|                                   | care for that day. They provide   |
|                                   | the child care centre with a      |
|                                   | reason for the absence.           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Prior to 5 April 2020, CCS is not |
|                                   | payable for absent days:          |

|                                   | -   before a child actually       |
|                                   |     attends care. This means if a |
|                                   |     child is absent between the   |
|                                   |     enrolment start date and the  |
|                                   |     date they first attend care,  |
|                                   |     CCS is not payable for days   |
|                                   |     prior to the attendance date  |
|                                   | -   after a child’s final day of  |
|                                   |     attendance at care when the   |
|                                   |     enrolment has ceased. This    |
|                                   |     includes situations where     |
|                                   |     enrolment has ceased due to   |
|                                   |     non-attendance or the         |
|                                   |     customer is required to give  |
|                                   |     notice to the service that    |
|                                   |     their child will no longer be |
|                                   |     attending                     |

|                                   |     weeks to be provided. As the  |
|                                   |     child’s last day of actual    |
|                                   |     attendance is Friday of the   |
|                                   |     current week 1, CCS is not    |
|                                   |     payable for absent days the   |
|                                   |     service may lodge for the     |

|                                   |     due to 14 continuous weeks of |
|                                   |     non-attendance. A             |
|                                   |     reassessment will occur and   |
