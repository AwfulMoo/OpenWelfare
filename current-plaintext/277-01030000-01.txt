This document provides the process Service Officers must follow when
documenting child support information.

Reasons for documentation

Documents are a record showing:

-   what happened
-   the information provided, and
-   any recommendations or decisions made

These records are the property of Services Australia.

Services Australia use documents to:

-   meet legislation and policy requirements
-   explain decisions
-   help resolve enquiries, complaints, objections and compensation
    claims, and
-   achieve consistent and fair service delivery outcomes

Call recordings must not be the only record of customer contact.

The Resources page contains links to attachments and examples of
appropriate documentation, hints for documenting in real time and
relevant contact details.
