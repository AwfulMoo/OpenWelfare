Manual Follow-Ups (MFU)

The following scenarios will produce Manual Follow Up (MFU) messages to
support CP (XWP) processing. Most scenarios deal with gaining or losing
entitlement to payment level CA and the effect on CP (XWP)
grandfathering eligibility.

Only staff at the APS5 level or above can make changes to the
grandfathering status.

MFUs where payment level CA is granted or reinstated

Updating the 2020 Former WP - CARER grandfathering type

The carer’s grandfathering provisions and grandfathering status will
appear on the Grandfathering Summary (GFS) screen. Changes to a carer’s
grandfathering status are made on the Grandfathering Override (GFD)
screen.

The initial grandfathering status will be set as GRF on 20 March 2020;
this includes Wife Pension customers who are in a bereavement period on
20 March 2020 and transfer to Carer Payment (XWP) on their bereavement
period end date (BPED) + 1.

Rules when manually updating the 2020 Former WP - CARER grandfathering type

When inserting a new entry (as opposed to changing and existing entry),
the date of effect of any new 2020 Former WP–CARER grandfathering status
entry cannot be the same as an existing grandfathering entry.

The date of effect of any entry must be equal or greater than 20 March
2020.

Any updates, including insertion and changes, will be applied as the
latest status. If there are any subsequent statuses with a DOE that is
later than the new/changing entry, the system will automatically delete
them.

Any deletion of an existing status will make the previous status the
latest one.

Customer must get payment level Carer Allowance when the most recent
status is changed to GRF/GRO.

Where a grandfathered status has been applied manually and payment level
CA ceases, a MFU activity will prompt to manually amend the
grandfathered status.
