This page contains the calculations to be used by the Department of
Veterans' Affairs (DVA) Clearance Team when a manual Defence Force
Income Support Allowance (DFISA) calculation is required.

Manual calculation of DFISA payments by the DVA Clearance Team

This table describes the manual calculations which may be required when
the system does not automatically calculate a DFISA payment, or when
DFISA rates have to be verified for effective periods before 1 January
2022. The information must be coded on the DFISA Calculation Details
screen. The Actual Rate and the Notional Rate both require calculation.

DFISA rates can be viewed on the DFISA Summary (DFS) screen, where they
are shown as a daily rate. Selecting a daily rate will display the DFISA
Calculation Details (DFD) screen, where the notional and actual (or
current) entitlement amounts can be viewed, and a notional or manual
rate of DFISA can be coded.
