Employer withholdings

Employer withholding (EW) is the collection of child support by
deduction from a payer’s salary or wage. It is a legislative requirement
of Services Australia to collect child support via EW for salary or wage
earners, employer administered Paid Parental Leave (PPL) payments
recipients and some independent contractors. Employer withholding is
also an effective enforcement method for non-compliant payers. It can be
established for the ongoing liability and arrears. The collection of
arrears via employer withholdings is called employer withholding arrears
(EWA).

A payer may request they are not linked to their employer. Their
application is considered by Child Support. Seen Employer Withholding
