This document outlines the steps to process an application for Employer
withholding (EW) in Pluto.

Employer withholding

EW is the collection of child support by deduction from a customer’s
salary or wage. It is a legislative requirement of Services Australia to
collect child support via EW for salary or wage earners, employer
administered Paid Parental Leave (PPL) payments recipients and some
independent contractors. EW is also an effective enforcement method for
non-compliant customer. It can be established to collect the ongoing
liability and/or debt. The collection of debts via EW is called employer
withholding arrears (EWA).

A customer (payer only) may request they are not linked to their
employer. Their application is considered by Child Support. See Employer
Withholding (EW) - Election for EW not to apply.
