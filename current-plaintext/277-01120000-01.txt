This document outlines information to support Deceased Customer
Management (DCM) Service Officers to manage cases with a deceased Child
Support customer or child.

It provides information on how to process the death of a customer or
child, work effectively with customers to address any outstanding child
support and appropriately refer customer executor or family member to
support services.

International cases

If the customer died overseas, or resides overseas at the time of their
death, the case must be referred to the DCM team for management. The
team will liaise with the International Central Authority Team for
issues affecting processing or finalisation.

The Resources page contains resources for the management of deceased
customer cases.
