Departure Prohibition Orders (DPO)

A DPO:

-   prevents a person with a Centrelink debt from leaving Australia
-   may place significant restrictions on the normal liberties of
    citizens, residents and visitors to Australia
-   is made after serious consideration of all relevant circumstances

Departure Authorisation Certificate (DAC)

A DAC allows a person to depart Australia for a defined period, despite
having a DPO in force. A DAC places strict limits on when a person may
depart and must return to Australia.

Note: a person cannot leave Australia if they have a:

-   DPO for Child Support Agency or another department, or
-   police warrant

The AFP may ask a person with a DAC to present it when attempting to
depart Australia. Failure to present the certificate may result in a
fine.

The Australian Federal Police (AFP) will take the following action for a
person with a DPO:

If the person does not have a DAC and is attempting to leave Australia,
the AFP will:

-   stop them at the point of departure
-   notify Services Australia of the attempt to travel

If the person does have a DAC, the AFP will:

-   notify Services Australia of the travel and the new expiry date of
    the DPO
