How to convert old national currencies to or from Euro

Conversion:

-   to EUR is done by dividing the amount in the old currency by the
    irrevocable exchange rate
-   from EUR is done by multiplying the Euro amount by the irrevocable
    exchange rate

Note: conversions must also take into account any changes in the rate of
foreign pensions, for example, regular increases for cost of living.
