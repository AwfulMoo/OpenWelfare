This document outlines how to link records of dependent siblings for
whom ABSTUDY, Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) Additional Boarding
Allowance and Youth Allowance (YA) may be payable. This allows the
system to transfer information relevant to the Parental Income Test
(PIT) and its family pool between the sibling records.

Benefits of automatic transfer of information

Consequences of this automatic transfer of information include:

-   dependent siblings in receipt of YA, ABSTUDY or AIC Additional
    Boarding Allowance only notifying Services Australia once of changes
    to their circumstances which cause a change to their maximum rate of
    payment (for example, at home versus away from home rate or changes
    to maximum rent entitlements). The changes will update on all the
    family members' records in the family pool
-   maximum payment rates for all siblings will contain consistent
    up-to-date information which will ensure they are receiving their
    correct entitlement

The system will transfer information relating to the following changes
in the family's circumstances, which may affect the PIT, between sibling
records:

-   an addition of a sibling to the family pool
-   a sibling leaves the care or responsibility of the
    parent(s)/guardian(s)
-   a sibling ceases to be dependent on their parent(s)/guardian(s)

Service Officers can create or delete links between any siblings as the
situation arises.

Requirement for CRNs

Ensure the ABSTUDY or YA customer's record links all parents and
dependent siblings. Sometimes:

-   a parent may not have received family assistance, or
-   a Social Security pension or benefit, or
-   a child record is unavailable because no one has accessed it for a
    long time

Conduct a thorough search for the customer record before:

-   updating the customer's details, or
-   adding a new record

A CRN will enable:

-   data matching of parent income details with the Australian Taxation
    Office (ATO)
-   changes to the statuses of parents and siblings who have received a
    Low Income Health Care Card, pension or benefit from Services
    Australia. This will help determine the rate of payment for YA or
    ABSTUDY
