|                                   | correct so doesn’t make any       |

|                                   | fortnight, so checks their        |
|                                   | payslip. They then see that their |
|                                   | pay is made up of 2 components,   |
|                                   | being the wage of $945 and a      |

|                                   | income, they are presented with a |

|                                   | reporting. They then call their   |
|                                   | employer to discuss the ‘salary   |
|                                   | and wages’, where the employer    |
|                                   | realises they made a mistake by   |
|                                   | not reporting the payment as      |

|                                   | The employer corrects this at     |
|                                   | their end and ensures to report   |

|                                   | The customer doesn’t recognise    |
|                                   | this employer, but before they    |
|                                   | reject the details, they check    |
|                                   | their payslip. Their payslip has  |
|                                   | the employer name of Kitty Cat    |
|                                   | Castles, but the same ABN of 100  |
|                                   | 4567 891 and realises that Kitty  |
|                                   | Cat Castles is the trading name.  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The customer confirms the details |
|                                   | and merges the STP employer with  |
|                                   | the existing employer name on     |
|                                   | their record. They are then       |
|                                   | presented with pre-filled STP     |
|                                   | employment income to review.      |

|                                   | they have logged in to their      |
|                                   | online account early in the       |
|                                   | morning. The customer gets paid   |
|                                   | weekly each Wednesday around      |
|                                   | lunchtime.                        |

|                                   | When the customer reviews their   |

|                                   | is only 1 pay event when they are |
|                                   | expecting 2. The customer         |
|                                   | realises that their employer      |
|                                   | wouldn’t have run the pays for    |
|                                   | this week yet so manually adds    |
|                                   | the missing pay details by        |
|                                   | selecting ‘add pay event’. When   |
|                                   | the employer runs the payroll     |
|                                   | later in the day, the STP data    |
|                                   | may pre-fill on the customer’s    |
|                                   | record, but will not present to   |
|                                   | the customer when they next       |
