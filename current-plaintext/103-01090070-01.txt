System messages

If the system or a Service Officer initiates an Assessment Result (AR)
process on an income managed customer, or a potential Income Management
customer, and further action is required, one of the following will
display:

-   the Income Management Summary screen (in workflow), or
-   the Income Management Warning and Error (IMWE) screen (if coding
    manually)

These screens may display a message or Work Item that could impact
Income Management. All appropriate discussions and updates must be
completed while the customer is present to address the Work Item
generated.

The Resources page contains links to the National transfer numbers,
