This document outlines information about dual recognition of medical
practitioners for Services Australia.

On this Page:

Dual recognition

Referrals from specialists and consultant physicians are valid for 3
months unless the patient is an admitted patient. Referrals for admitted
patients are valid for 3 months or the duration of admission, whichever
is longer.

A referral from a general practitioner to a specialist or consultant
physician is valid for 12 months, unless noted otherwise. If a patient
needs continuing care, general practitioners can write a referral beyond
12 months or for an indefinite period.

The purpose of dual recognition is to allow a specialist or consultant
physician, acting in their capacity as a general practitioner to provide
referrals for their patients for greater than the standard 3 month
period.

Once reflected with dual recognition on the provider record, referrals
will be valid for a 12 month period.

Eligibility for dual recognition

Medical practitioners eligible for dual recognition need to be:

recognised by Services Australia as a specialist (in a specialty other
than General Practice) or consultant physician, and

-   recognised by Services Australia as a Specialist general
    practitioner (Ahpra registered and identified with a 540 speciality
    code), or
-   recognised by Services Australia as a General practitioner as
    determined by the Department of Health (identified with a 530
    speciality code), or
-   recognised by Services Australia as a General practitioner as
    determined by the Department of Health (identified with a 530
    specialty code), or
-   holding general registration and is recorded on the Vocational
    Register (identified with a 130 specialty code), or
-   an Other Medical Practitioner (identified with a 104 specialty code)
    working in general practice

Dual recognition is reflected in the Provider Directory System (PDS)
with a 165 specialty code on the medical practitioner’s stem.

Dual recognition

Dual recognition may be added to the medical practitioner’s provider
record via one of the following:

-   a telephone call from the medical practitioner
-   a signed written request for dual recognition submitted to Services
    Australia

This can also be added where:

they are previously recognised as a specialist or consultant physician,
and

-   a work item has been received notifying that Ahpra has registered
    the medical practitioner as a Specialist general practitioner

the medical practitioner is already recognised as a general practitioner
and recognition as a specialist (in a speciality other than General
Practice) and/or,

-   consultant physician has been processed on the medical
    practitioner’s provider record

Date of effect

If a request for dual recognition is received via telephone, it is to be
effective from the date the call was received. If it is received as a
signed written request, the date of lodgement is the effective date.

When processing applications for specialist and/or consultant physician
recognition, the medical practitioner dual recognition is effective from
the date specialist recognition is granted.

Dual recognition is effective from the date of general practitioner
recognition where:

-   processing recognition as a general practitioner is required, and
-   the medical practitioner has existing recognition as a specialist
    (in a specialty other than General Practice) or consultant physician

Removing dual recognition

Where the medical practitioner no longer meets the requirements for dual
recognition, the Provider Registration team will end date the provider’s
dual recognition.
