This document outlines how Compliance Officers (CO) update customer’s
employment income using Earnings Apportion in Process Direct.

Earnings Apportion

Earnings Apportion supports the update and apportionment of employment
income. It is for Pay As You Go (PAYG) online compliance interventions:

-   Employment Income Confirmation (EIC)
-   Check and update past income (CUPI) service

Earnings Apportion reduces the need for manual coding on the customer's
record and allows staff to update the customer’s employment income for
Online (ONL) and Online Manual (ONM) interventions.

Accessing Earnings Apportion

Earnings Apportion is an application in Process Direct.

For Online Manual (ONM) Interventions, access Earnings Apportion from
the Integrated Review in Process Direct. If an apportionment is started,
Earnings Apportion can also be launched directly from the Process Direct
Inbox.

For Online (ONL) Interventions, access Earnings Apportion through
Assessment Assist.

The Resources page contains a link to ABN Lookup, a table showing Pay
Type categories and a table with Earnings Apportion instructional
messages.
