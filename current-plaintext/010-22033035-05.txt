| 1                                 | Changing study load from          |
|                                   | full-time to part-time            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | In January 2021 Julie enrolled in |
|                                   | a Bachelor of Music at the        |
|                                   | University of Melbourne and       |
|                                   | claimed Austudy. Julie enrolled   |
|                                   | in an EFTSL of 0.375 (75% of the  |
|                                   | normal amount of full-time study) |
|                                   | in both semester 1 and 2 before   |
|                                   | commencing Semester 1 on 23 Feb   |
|                                   | 2021. As Julie would be           |
|                                   | considered a full-time student    |
|                                   | for each individual semester,     |
|                                   | there was no need for an          |
|                                   | aggregation assessment to occur.  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | On 17 March 2021, Julie's study   |
|                                   | load in semester 1 reduces to     |
|                                   | 0.250 EFTSL. An aggregation       |
|                                   | assessment was conducted as Julie |
|                                   | provided evidence, showing        |
|                                   | enrolment across the              |
|                                   | enrolment/aggregation period      |
|                                   | (semester 1 and 2) from the start |
|                                   | of the year. The assessment       |
|                                   | revealed that from 17 March 2021  |
|                                   | Julie had an EFTSL of 0.625       |
|                                   | across the year. As a result of   |
|                                   | the assessment, it is determined  |
|                                   | Julie is not eligible for Austudy |
|                                   | from 17 March due to no longer    |
|                                   | maintaining 75% a full-time study |
|                                   | load in either Semester 1 (as a   |
|                                   | stand-alone) or across the        |
|                                   | academic year (semester 1 and 2   |
|                                   | combined).                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | On 2 June 2021 (prior to the end  |
|                                   | of semester 1) Julie's semester 2 |
|                                   | study load increased to 0.500     |
|                                   | EFTSL, prompting another          |
|                                   | aggregation assessment. This      |
|                                   | assessment showed Julie's EFTSL   |
|                                   | is now 0.750 across the entire    |
|                                   | enrolment period, and Julie       |
|                                   | satisfies the activity test again |
|                                   | from 2 June 2021.                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Julie would NOT be eligible for   |
|                                   | Austudy from 17 March 2021 to 1   |
|                                   | June 2021 as Julie is not         |
|                                   | considered a full-time student    |
|                                   | for this period.                  |

| 2                                 | Student enrols in a Summer        |
|                                   | Semester                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Alice commenced a Bachelor of     |
|                                   | Arts in semester 2, 2020 after a  |
|                                   | break in study. Her enrolment     |
|                                   | shows a study load in Semester of |
|                                   | 0.250 EFTSL. This is insufficient |
|                                   | study load to qualify as a        |
|                                   | full-time student in Semester 2   |
|                                   | on its own. However, Alice also   |
|                                   | enrolled in summer semester 2020  |
|                                   | at the same time as enrolling in  |
|                                   | Semester 2, 2020 in 0.125 EFTSL   |
|                                   | bringing the total for the        |
|                                   | enrolment period of Semester 2,   |
|                                   | 2020 and Summer semester to 0.375 |
|                                   | EFTSL.                            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | As the Summer Semester is         |
|                                   | consecutive with Semester 2, 2020 |
|                                   | she can aggregate the study       |
|                                   | loads. As Summer Semester is not  |
|                                   | a compulsory study period the     |
|                                   | normal amount of full-time study  |
|                                   | would remain at 0.500 EFTSL and   |
|                                   | 0.375 EFTSL would satisfy the 75% |
|                                   | requirement.                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Alice would be considered to be   |
|                                   | undertaking full-time study over  |
|                                   | the aggregate study period of     |
|                                   | Semester 2, 2020 and Summer       |
|                                   | Semester.                         |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Lily has enrolled in a Bachelor   |
|                                   | of Science at Deakin University   |
|                                   | in 2021. She enrolled across the  |
|                                   | three Trimesters with 0.250 EFTSL |
|                                   | in each Trimester. As Trimester 1 |
|                                   | and 2 are considered compulsory   |
|                                   | (Trimester 3 is an optional study |
|                                   | period), the normal amount of     |
|                                   | full-time study for Trimester 1   |
|                                   | and 2 is 0.500 EFTSL therefore    |
|                                   | 0.250 EFTSL is insufficient to    |
|                                   | satisfy full-time study           |
|                                   | requirement in Trimester 1 and 2. |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | However, she can aggregate all    |
|                                   | three trimesters with a study     |
|                                   | load of 0.750 EFTSL for the year, |
|                                   | which is sufficient to be         |
|                                   | considered a full-time student.   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | On 14 May 2021 (prior to          |
|                                   | commencing Trimester 2) Lily      |
|                                   | alters her enrolment so that she  |
|                                   | has no enrolment in Trimester 2,  |
|                                   | 2021 and 0.500 EFTSL in Trimester |
|                                   | 3, 2021. While she is still       |
|                                   | enrolled in a total of 0.750      |
|                                   | EFTSL for the academic year she   |
|                                   | cannot take advantage of          |
|                                   | aggregation of study load because |
|                                   | she has no enrolment in the       |
|                                   | compulsory Trimester 2, 2021. The |
|                                   | study periods are not             |
|                                   | consecutive.                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Lily would cease to be qualified  |
|                                   | from 14 May 2021 as her study     |
|                                   | load for the year dropped below   |
|                                   | 0.750 EFTSL for the academic year |
|                                   | and she does not have a study     |
|                                   | load of 0.375 EFTSL for the       |
|                                   | Trimester. However, she would     |
|                                   | qualify in Trimester 3, 2021 with |
|                                   | a study load on 0.375 EFTSL. Note |
|                                   | that Lily would not lose          |
|                                   | qualification for the period      |
|                                   | prior to 14 May 2021 as she was,  |
|                                   | on the basis of aggregation,      |
|                                   | enrolled and undertaking 75% of   |
|                                   | the normal amount of full-time    |
|                                   | study. This situation only        |
