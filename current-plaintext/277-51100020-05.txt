|                                   | Customer has sole use of a car    |
|                                   | that is jointly owned with a      |
|                                   | previous partner. The customer    |
|                                   | pays all the running expenses and |
|                                   | registration and insurance. The   |
|                                   | partner has continued to pay loan |
|                                   | repayments for the car of $100    |
|                                   | per month. The partner has bought |
|                                   | another vehicle for their use.    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Assessable maintenance = $50 per  |
|                                   | month.                            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This is treated the same as other |
|                                   | loan repayments. Because the car  |
|                                   | is jointly owned, only half the   |
|                                   | loan repayments can be counted.   |
|                                   | The other half is contributing    |
|                                   | toward the partner’s interest in  |
|                                   | the car.                          |

|                                   | owned outright by the other       |
|                                   | parent who pays for registration, |

|                                   | Debbie states that the use is     |
|                                   | shared 50/50, and that Bill paid  |
|                                   | $450 on registration, $130 on     |
|                                   | insurance, $10 per week to cover  |
|                                   | ongoing maintenance, and $40 per  |
|                                   | week for petrol.                  |

|                                   | maintenance and petrol ($25 per   |
|                                   | week)                             |

|                                   | cannot be counted as Bill has not |

|                                   | use the car. He would have        |
|                                   | registered the car anyway so that |
|                                   | he could use it.                  |
