|                                   |     was essential, it could be    |

|                                   |     available funds would be      |
|                                   |     under the allowable limit     |
|                                   | -   If no suitable evidence for   |

|                                   |     provided, the OWP should not  |
|                                   |     be waived as the assessed     |
|                                   |     available funds would be over |
|                                   |     the allowable limit. For      |
|                                   |     example, Rory had $1,000 4    |
|                                   |     weeks ago minus unavoidable   |
|                                   |     expenditure of $200 equals    |
|                                   |     $1,000 assessed as available  |
|                                   |     funds. This is more than 2    |
|                                   |     weeks benefit Rory would be   |
|                                   |     entitled to, therefore Rory   |
|                                   |     would not be considered in    |
