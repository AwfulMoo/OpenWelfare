|                                   | amount that is actually           |
|                                   | collected.                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Zara attempted to collect the     |
|                                   | increased liability and arrears   |
|                                   | from John privately, and when     |
|                                   | unable to do this, has asked      |
|                                   | Child Support to start            |
|                                   | collecting.                       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Unless there are exceptional      |
|                                   | circumstances, Child Support can  |
|                                   | only collect arrears for 3 months |
|                                   | prior to the date Zara asked for  |
|                                   | collection to begin. Zara must    |
|                                   | seek legal advice about enforcing |
|                                   | the remainder of the arrears      |
|                                   | through court action. Centrelink  |
|                                   | raised the $5000 FTB debt, which  |
|                                   | Zara had to start repaying        |
|                                   | immediately.                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Zara sought legal advice and      |
|                                   | provided Centrelink with a letter |
|                                   | from her legal practitioner       |
|                                   | advising that they were unable to |
|                                   | assist her as it would not be     |
|                                   | cost effective. Zara should be    |
|                                   | referred to a Centrelink social   |
|                                   | worker to discuss a partial       |
|                                   | exemption from enforcing the      |
|                                   | child support arrears. If         |
|                                   | granted, an adjustment would be   |
|                                   | made to the FTB payments to       |
|                                   | reflect the amount of child       |
|                                   | support Zara actually collected.  |
