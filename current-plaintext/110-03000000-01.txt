This document provides information on Member of a couple reviews for
customers receiving a payment under Section 24 provisions, or for
customers who have been assessed as Separated Under One Roof (SUOR).

Government intent

Services Australia must know if a person is single or partnered when
considering eligibility for a payment. Most payments take into account
the income and assets of both members of a couple.

Member of a couple reviews (Section 24 or SUOR) must be conducted and
the customer's circumstances assessed to determine if they continue to
meet the relevant criteria and can be paid at the single rate.

As part of the review process, both parties may be interviewed and asked
to provide additional information about their current circumstances.
