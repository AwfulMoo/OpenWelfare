+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Will a claim for item 13200 with  |
|                                   | a date of service AFTER the date  |
|                                   | of service for item 13202 in the  |
|                                   | same calendar year attract a      |
|                                   | Medicare benefit?                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer:                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | No, item 13200 can only be used   |
|                                   | as the initial superovulated      |
|                                   | treatment cycle in a calendar     |
|                                   | year where the cycle results in   |
|                                   | successful oocyte retrieval. When |
|                                   | the first cycle for the calendar  |
|                                   | year is cancelled prior to oocyte |
|                                   | retrieval, item 13202 should be   |
|                                   | used for the initial              |
|                                   | superovulated treatment cycle.    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If item 13202 is claimed with a   |
|                                   | date of service prior to item     |
|                                   | 13200, 13202 becomes the initial  |
|                                   | cycle and item 13200 cannot be    |
|                                   | claimed with a later date of      |
|                                   | service.                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the date of service for item   |
|                                   | 13200 is before the date of       |
|                                   | service for item 13202, override  |
|                                   | the restriction with processing   |
|                                   | indicator PI 45. Note: if item    |
|                                   | 13202 is within 26 days before    |
|                                   | item 13200, the claim would also  |
|                                   | need text or notation indicating  |
|                                   | item 13200 was a ‘short cycle’ to |
|                                   | be payable                        |

|                                   | embryos or both ova and sperm) be |
|                                   | billed as outpatient?             |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | Yes, items 13212 and 13215 can be |
|                                   | billed as either an inpatient or  |

|                                   | previous global item?             |

|                                   | a precondition of the provision   |
|                                   | of ART services under Medicare.   |
|                                   | If no recipient has been          |
