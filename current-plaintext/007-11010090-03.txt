|                                   | When family assistance            |
|                                   | reconciliation first occurred in  |
|                                   | 2001, the system solution used to |
|                                   | apply Clause 3A was to suppress   |
|                                   | any debts that occurred in an     |
|                                   | ex-partner period. Although this  |
|                                   | ensured that ex-partner income    |
|                                   | could not cause a reconciliation  |
|                                   | debt, it also meant that other    |
|                                   | non-income related debts were     |
|                                   | suppressed (for example debts     |
|                                   | caused by circumstance changes,   |
|                                   | maintenance income). There have   |
|                                   | been a number of changes to the   |
|                                   | way the system treats ex-partner  |
|                                   | periods since family assistance   |
|                                   | reconciliation first commenced.   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | In the September and December     |
|                                   | 2005 releases (for FTB) and June  |
|                                   | 2006 (for CCB), a new process was |
|                                   | introduced for 2002-2003 onwards  |
|                                   | so that only income related debts |
|                                   | were prevented in ex-partner      |
|                                   | periods. The new process was      |
|                                   | known as the ex-partner period    |
|                                   | income comparison. See Item 8 in  |

|                                   | table. Unfortunately, there were  |
|                                   | some flaws in this process and in |
|                                   | some circumstances it was still   |
|                                   | possible for a customer to incur  |
|                                   | an income related debt in an      |
|                                   | ex-partner period. Changes to     |
|                                   | correct this process were         |
|                                   | implemented in the December 2008  |
