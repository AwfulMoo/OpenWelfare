This document outlines information about Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme
(PBS) prescribers.

Prescribers (PBS)

It is the prescriber who writes a prescription indicating that a patient
is to be supplied with a subsidised pharmaceutical benefit item. The
prescriber is either:

-   a medical practitioner (doctor)
-   a participating dental practitioner (who can prescribe only a
    restricted range of items)
-   an authorised optometrist (who can prescribe only a restricted range
    of items)
-   a nurse practitioner (who can prescribe only a restricted range of
    items
-   a midwife (who can prescribe only a restricted range of items)

Participating dental practitioners and authorised optometrists can only
prescribe a restricted range of PBS/RPBS items, as listed in the
respective dental and optometrical sections of the Schedule of
Pharmaceutical Benefits.

A prescriber can only write a prescription for the treatment of a
medical, dental or eye condition of a patient. It is the responsibility
of a prescriber to select the item most appropriate for the treatment of
the particular condition of the patient.

Prescribers are responsible for complying with the authority
requirements for benefits of certain medicines.

Prescribers must seek approval prior to prescribing authority listed
medicines.
