This document outlines options for customers apart from the formal
review and appeal processes administered by Services Australia.

Government intent

A high level of transparency and accountability is emphasised in the
Commonwealth Parliament's approach to the actions of government
agencies. It is consistent with this approach that, as well as a review
of the correctness of a decision, customers can seek a review of the
actions of an agency in making a decision or providing a service. This
document links to information about mechanisms available for the review
of government action.

Alternative review options are administered by other government agencies
and the law courts. These options complement the review and appeal
processes. It is important to note that the correctness of a decision
should be challenged via the formal review and appeals system.
