This document outlines information on how Indigenous job seekers have
access to information and employment related services delivered by
Services Australia, Workforce Australia, Community Development Program
(CDP) and other programs from the Department of Employment and Workplace
Relations. This is to improve the employment opportunities of Aboriginal
and Torres Strait Islander customers.

Participation barriers for Indigenous customers

Indigenous job seekers represent some of the most highly vulnerable
customers and many face significant participation barriers. For a
variety of reasons, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander job seekers
may have difficulty dealing with Employment Services Providers.

This applies to all Indigenous job seekers, including:

-   those on income support payments with mutual obligation requirements
-   those receiving income support payments with no mutual obligation
    requirements

For more information, see Identifying barriers to participation for
Indigenous customers.

Facilitating registration or re-registration with a local provider

Services Australia will ensure that, at registration or re-registration,
each Indigenous job seeker will receive assistance to facilitate the job
seeker's earliest possible engagement with a local provider.

Range of assistance provided by local providers

As each individual will have different needs for assistance, there will
need to be a flexible approach. The range of assistance includes:

-   identifying cultural barriers or obligations which may prevent or
    delay accessing assistance from Workforce Australia/CDP, and helping
    the job seeker to take steps to overcome these
-   spending additional time at interview to ensure the job seeker is
    aware of the benefits and services offered from Workforce
    Australia/CDP, and ensuring the job seeker complies with their
    requirements
-   arranging additional Indigenous seminars in areas where these
    seminars have proven to be of benefit in maintaining connection
    between Indigenous job seekers and the services offered from
    Workforce Australia/CDP
-   liaising with Employment Services Providers to help to directly link
    the job seeker to the appropriate provider

Range of additional assistance

The range of assistance which may be provided includes:

-   Identifying cultural barriers or obligations which have contributed
    to the disconnection and helping to find ways to ensure the job
    seeker can remain engaged with the Employment Services Provider
    whilst meeting their own cultural obligations
-   Identifying, through Workforce Australia/CDP meetings, ways in which
    Indigenous services can be improved
-   Direct assistance (such as networking with the community to
    personally locate job seekers), where appropriate, to enable the job
    seeker to attend subsequent Workforce Australia/ CDP appointments
    and maintain contact with their provider

Community Development Program (CDP)

CDP provides an integrated and flexible approach to participation and
employment services for job seekers living in 60 Department of
Employment and Workplace Relations designated remote servicing regions.

Indigenous reference points and support

In recognition of the diversity of its customer groups, Services
Australia has a number of key advisory groups and service measures in
place to promote and implement best practice on Indigenous services.
These services are:

-   Indigenous queues in the Smart Centre and Indigenous Service
    Officers often provide a first point of contact between Indigenous
    customers and Services Australia
-   Indigenous Service Officers (ISOs) and Indigenous Program Support
    Managers (IPSMs) are located in most Service Zones. ISOs support
    local Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities to improve
    access to and understand our payments and services. They do this by
    establishing meaningful connections and effective working
    relationships through community engagement activities

Community visits

At the Zone level, Services Australia will advise and involve Department
of Employment and Workplace Relations liaison officers and Employment
Services Providers, as appropriate, of impending visits to remote
Indigenous communities.

Other community visits may also be undertaken with key Indigenous
community organisations and to appropriate sites (for example, prisons)
to promote the benefits and services available through Workforce
Australia/CDP to the broader Indigenous community.
