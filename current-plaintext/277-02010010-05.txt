For the agreement to be refused because it contravenes section 85, it
must include a provision which states that a person will receive child
support when they are not an eligible carer of a child.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Alice and John have an existing   |
|                                   | assessment for child Jane. Alice  |
|                                   | has 80% care and John has 20%     |
|                                   | care.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | An application is lodged to       |
|                                   | accept the parents' child support |
|                                   | agreement. The agreement includes |
|                                   | the following provisions:         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   John will pay Alice $100 per  |
|                                   |     week for Jane from 1 January  |
|                                   |     2020 to 31 December 2025      |
|                                   | -   The child support payable by  |
|                                   |     John will continue even if    |
|                                   |     Alice's care of Jane reduces  |
|                                   |     below 35%                     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This provision specifically       |
|                                   | states that Alice will receive    |
|                                   | child support when they are not   |
|                                   | an eligible carer. This agreement |
|                                   | must be refused.                  |

| 2                                 | Jo and Val have an existing       |
|                                   | assessment for child Kim. Jo has  |
|                                   | 80% care and Val has 20% care.    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | An application is lodged to       |
|                                   | accept the parents' child support |
|                                   | agreement. The agreement includes |
|                                   | the following provisions:         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   Val will pay Jo $100 per week |
|                                   |     for Kim from 1 January 2020   |
|                                   |     to 31 December 2025           |
|                                   | -   The child support payable by  |
|                                   |     Val will continue even if Val |
|                                   |     gains more care of Kim        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This provision does not           |
|                                   | necessarily mean that the parties |
|                                   | intend the payments to continue   |
|                                   | when Jo ceases to be an eligible  |
|                                   | carer. For example, if Jo         |
|                                   | currently has 80% care and Val    |
|                                   | has 20% care, the parties         |
|                                   | intention may be that the         |
|                                   | payments will continue even if    |
|                                   | Jo's care decreases to 60% and    |
|                                   | Val's care increases to 40%.      |
|                                   | Assuming the parties confirm      |
|                                   | their intention is for payments   |
|                                   | not to continue if Jo ceases to   |
|                                   | be an eligible carer, then this   |
|                                   | agreement could be accepted (if   |
|                                   | all other requirements are met).  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Note: before accepting an         |
|                                   | agreement where it is unclear if  |
|                                   | the parties intend payments to be |
|                                   | made even though a payee ceases   |
|                                   | to be an eligible carer (as per   |
|                                   | the example), contact both        |
|                                   | parties to confirm their          |
|                                   | intention. Unless it is           |
|                                   | specifically intended for         |
|                                   | payments to continue despite a    |
|                                   | payee ceasing to be an eligible   |
|                                   | carer, the agreement will not be  |
|                                   | in breach of section 85.          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If Jo's care did later drop below |
|                                   | 35%, the agreement would still be |
|                                   | suspended/terminated in           |
|                                   | accordance with the usual rules.  |

|                                   | initiating binding child support  |
|                                   | agreement, for children Peter and |
|                                   | Drew. Andrew has 80% care of      |

|                                   | provisions:                       |

|                                   | -   Through periodic child        |
|                                   |     support, Sarah will pay       |

|                                   |     support, Andrew will pay 100% |
|                                   |     of Drew and Peter's private   |
|                                   |     school fees                   |

|                                   | In this example, it is possible   |
|                                   | to determine that there is 1      |
|                                   | agreement in which Sarah is       |
|                                   | liable to pay a periodic amount   |
|                                   | to Andrew (agreement 1), and a    |
|                                   | second agreement in which Andrew  |
|                                   | is liable to pay a non-periodic   |
|                                   | amount to Sarah (agreement 2). As |
|                                   | only agreement 2 contains a       |
|                                   | provision that contravenes        |
|                                   | section 85, because Sarah is not  |
|                                   | an eligible carer, the Registrar  |
|                                   | could accept agreement 1 and      |
|                                   | refuse agreement 2.               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Contact all parties to the        |
|                                   | agreement when determining if an  |
|                                   | agreement should be treated as if |
|                                   | it contained 2 separate           |
|                                   | agreements. Generally, an         |
