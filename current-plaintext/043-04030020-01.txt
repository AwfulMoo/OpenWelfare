This document outlines information about how formal control of a private
company is established. Information about who controls a private company
is used by Services Australia in making the attribution decision.

Formal control

Formal control of a private company is indicated by the following
factors:

-   control of 50% or more of the company voting rights
-   governing director or 'A' class shares which have the power to
    control the company
-   the person, alone or with associates, is beneficially entitled to
    15% or more of the capital or dividends of the company
-   the company is sufficiently influenced by the person, an associate
    of the person or two or more entities covered by the preceding
    factors
-   the person (alone or with associates) is in a position to exercise
    control

Roles within a company

A customer may be involved with a private company as a:

-   shareholder
-   director
-   secretary or public officer or
-   contributor

Shareholders

The most common role is that of a shareholder. The most common shares
issued are ordinary shares, which convey the right to:

-   participate in dividends
-   participate in capital if the company is wound up
-   vote at meetings of the shareholders

Other share types such as preference shares, convertible preference,
cumulative preference, participating preference or redeemable preference
shares usually do not carry voting rights and as such will not indicate
control of the company.

Where a company has an even number of shares held equally by the two
members of a couple, then control of the company would be joint or 50%
each.

Governing director's shares are often classified as 'A' class shares.
These usually give the holder the majority of voting share rights and,
would indicate the ability to control the company.

Directors and the company secretary/public officer are appointed by
shareholders, and as such are subject to their control. Since it is
control of the company that determines attribution, being a director or
secretary in its self would not indicate control unless the person held
shares in the company which gave them a controlling interest.
