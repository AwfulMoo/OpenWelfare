Example of calculation for 1 assistant assists both surgeons

Table 6: This table gives an example of surgical items and fees claimed
by 2 different surgeons and 1 assistant.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| Surgeon 1             | Surgeon 2             | Assistant             |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| Claims item 41578     | Claims item 41579     | Assists both surgeon  |
|                       |                       | 1 and surgeon 2       |
| Fee: $2,000           | Fee: $1,000           |                       |
|                       |                       | Claims item 51303     |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

Example of calculation of assistant's fee:

Surgeon fee for combined operations: $2,000 + $1,000 = $3,000. (Note:
these are example figures only - access MBS for the current schedule
fees)

Assistant fee:

-   20% of the surgical fee for the combined operations
-   $3,000 x 20% = $600 payable under item 51303

Surgeons not operating independently

Where 1 surgeon assists the other or the surgeons both assist each
other, the surgeons cease to be operating independently and it ceases to
be considered as conjoint surgery.

In this case, if there is:

-   an item number of '1 surgeon' (for example, item 30536), the
    principal surgeon claims the normal schedule item that covers the
    service and the co-surgeon claims as assistant fee
-   no item for '1 surgeon', for example, item 45564 and 45565, or
    conjoint surgery is covered by only 1 item, for example, item 41575
    (removal by 2 surgeons), the entire claim is subject to the multiple
    operation rule and only 1 assistance fee can be paid. The surgeons
    involved would need to sort out payment arrangements between
    themselves

Example of surgeons not operating independently items

Table 7: This table shows examples of items that include '1 surgeon',
conjoint surgery' and 'conjoint surgery, co-surgeon' in their item
descriptor.

|                                   | chest - conjoint surgery,         |
|                                   | principal surgeon (including      |
|                                   | aftercare) (Anaes.) (Assist.).    |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 30539                             | Oesophagectomy involving gastric  |
|                                   | reconstruction by abdominal       |
|                                   | mobilisation, thoracotomy and     |
|                                   | anastomosis in the neck or        |
|                                   | chest - conjoint surgery,         |
|                                   | co-surgeon (Assist.).             |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Example of no item for '1 surgeon'

-   Dr Michael (principal surgeon) - charges item 30536
-   Dr Steve (co-surgeon) assisting Dr Michael with item 30536 - charges
    item 51303
-   Dr Michael- charges item 45564
-   Dr Steve - charges item 45565
-   Dr Steve assisting Dr Michael or both surgeons assisting each
    other - charges item 51303

In this example, since there is no item for '1 surgeon' for this
surgery, the multiple operation rule is applied to the entire claim and
only 1 assistance fee can be paid. The surgeons involved would need to
sort out payment arrangements between themselves.

Example of where 2 surgeons perform spinal surgery and assist each other

Patient has items 51165, 51022, 51042 and 51011 during the same
occasion.

Table 8: This table shows item numbers for spinal surgeons and assistant
surgeons.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| Surgeon/Assistant     | Spinal items          | Assistant items       |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| Surgeon A             | 51165                 | Surgeon B can claim   |
|                       |                       | assist fee item 51303 |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| Surgeon B             | 51022, 51042 and      | Surgeon A can claim   |
|                       | 51011                 | assist fee item 51303 |
|                       |                       |                       |
|                       | (Multiple operation   |                       |
|                       | rule applies)         |                       |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

Note: The above scenario is considered to be an independent procedure
within 1 operation. The surgeons are not operating independently from
one another, but rather they are performing independent procedures.
Therefore an assistant fee would be payable.

Example of conjoint surgery covered by one of the items

-   Dr Michael - charges item 41575
-   Dr Steve - charges item 41575
-   Dr Steve assisting Dr Michael or both surgeons assisting each
    other - charges item 51303

In this example, since conjoint surgery is covered by one of the items,
that is item 41575 (CEREBELLO PONTINE ANGLE TUMOUR, removal of by 2
surgeons operating conjointly), the entire claim (41575 x 2) is subject
to the multiple operation rule and only 1 assistance fee can be paid.
The surgeons involved would need to sort out payment arrangements
between themselves.

Assistance at caesarean section (items 51306 and 51309)

There are 2 specific items that provide benefits for assistance at a
caesarean section delivery. The general rules applying to assistant
surgeon benefits apply to these items.

-   51306 - Assistance at a delivery involving a Caesarean section. The
    item has a set fee and benefit
-   51309 - Assistance at a series or combination of operations which
    are identified by the word 'Assist' and assistance at a delivery
    involving Caesarean section

Where all the services that were performed in addition to the caesarean
section are eligible for benefit for an assistant fee, the fees are
calculated in the following manner:

Example A

Caesarean - Schedule fee $800

Operation A (Assist) - Schedule fee $200

Operation B (Assist) - Schedule fee $100

Calculate the fee for the operations by applying the multiple operation
rule as follows:

-   Caesarean - $8000 x 100% = $800
-   Operation A (Assist) - $200 x 100% - $200
-   Operation B (Assist) - $100 x 50% = $50
-   Total Schedule fee - $1050

Calculate the derived fee for item 51309, that is, 20% of the total
Schedule fee

-   $1050 x 20% = $210

Note: these are example figures only - access MBS for the current
schedule fees.

Where not all the services that were performed in addition to the
Caesarean section are eligible for an assistant fee, the claim should be
assessed in the following manner:

Example B

-   Caesarean - Schedule fee $800
-   Operation A (Assist) - Schedule fee $500
-   Operation B - Schedule fee $300.00
-   Operation C (Assist) - Schedule fee $100

Note: the surgeon's fee is obtained by basing the caesarean section at
100% of the Schedule fee and then applying the multiple operation rule
to the remaining items as follows:

Caesarean - $800 x 100%

Operation A - $500 x 100%

Operation B - $300.00 x 50%

Operation C - $100 x 25%

To obtain the assistant's fee, reapply the multiple operation rule but
only to those services for which an assistant fee is payable:

-   Caesarean - $800 x 100% = $800
-   Operation A (Assist) - $500 x 100% = $500
-   Operation C (Assist) - $100 x 50% = $50
-   Total schedule fee = $1350

Calculate the derived fee for item 51309, that is, 20% of the total
Schedule fee

-   $1350 x 20% = $270

Note: all figures are only examples - access MBS for the current
schedule fees.

Assistance at interventional obstetric services (item 51312)

This item provides benefits for assistance at the following
interventional obstetric services included under Group T4 of the MBS:

-   16606 - fetal blood sampling
-   16609 - fetal intravascular blood transfusion
-   16612 - fetal intraperitoneal blood transfusion
-   16615 - fetal intraperitoneal blood transfusion
-   16627 - feto-amniotic shunt
-   16633 - procedure on multiple pregnancies relating to items 16606 to
    16615 and 16627

Benefits are limited to these interventional items, and are payable as a
derived fee, that is, 20% of the fee for the procedure or combination of
procedures at which assistance was rendered.

Assistance at oral and maxillofacial services

Assistance rendered by a medical practitioner (items 51300 and 51303)

Benefits are payable under these items for assistance at an operation
listed in Category 4 of the MBS (oral and maxillofacial services by
approved dental practitioners) as long as the assistance is rendered by
a medical practitioner.

Assistance rendered by an approved dental practitioner (items 51800 and 51803)

Where the assistance is rendered by an approved dental practitioner (who
is not also a medical practitioner), benefit is payable under these
items in Group O2 - Assistance at Operation of the MBS. The general
rules applying to assistant surgeon benefits apply to these items.

Levels of benefit (assistance at operations)

There are 2 levels of benefit payable for assistance at an operation or
combination of operations under items 51300 and 51303.

-   51300 - Assistance at any operation identified by the word 'Assist'
    for which the fee does not exceed $558.30 or at a series or
    combination of operations identified by the word 'Assist' where the
    fee for the series or combination of operations identified by the
    word 'Assist' does not exceed $558.30
-   51303 - Assistance at any operation identified by the word 'Assist'
    for which the fee exceeds $558.30 or at a series of operations
    identified by the word 'Assist' for which the aggregate fee exceeds
    $558.30

Note: these are example figures only - access MBS for the current
schedule fees.

A number of examples are included to show how to calculate assistant
surgeon benefits.

Single operation

Example A

-   Operation A (Assist) - Schedule fee $250
-   A benefit is payable, for assistance under item 51300, as the fee
    for the operation does not exceed $558.30

Example B

-   Operation B (No assist) - Schedule fee $300
-   No benefit is payable for assistance, as the item description does
    not include the word 'Assist'

Note: these are example figures only - access MBS for the current
schedule fees.

Multiple operations

Where multiple operations are performed and all the services are
eligible for an assistant fee, the multiple operation rule applies. As
outlined below, the aggregated total Schedule fee determines if an
assistant fee is payable under item 51300 or 51303.

Note: the total Schedule fee for assistance at operation in respect of
multiple procedures must be calculated after the application of the
multiple operations rule.

Example A

Operation A (Assist) - Schedule fee $250

Operation B (Assist) - Schedule fee $80

Calculate the fee for the operations:

-   Operation A (Assist) - $250 x 100% = $250
-   Operation B (Assist) - $80 x 50% = $40
-   Total Schedule fee = $290

Check which assistant item applies, based on the total Schedule fee for
the operations

Item 51300 applies as the total Schedule fee for the operations does not
exceed $558.30

Example B

Operation A (Assist) - Schedule fee $400

Operation B (Assist) - Schedule fee $250

Operation C (Assist) - Schedule fee $200

Calculate the fee for the operations:

-   Operation A (Assist) - $400 x 100% = $400
-   Operation B (Assist) - $250 x 50% - $125
-   Operation C (Assist) - $200 x 25% = $50
-   Total Schedule fee = $575

Check which assistant item applies, based on the total Schedule fee for
the operations

Item 51303 applies as the total Schedule fee for the operations exceeds
$558.30

Calculate the derived fee for item 51303, that is, 20% - of the total
Schedule fee for operations A, B and C

$575 x 20% = $115

Note: these are example figures only - access MBS for the current
schedule fees.

Multiple operations where not all services are eligible for an assistance fee

In some cases of multiple operations where assistance is given, some of
the services are not eligible for an assistant fee because they do not
have the word 'Assist' in their item description. In this situation, the
multiple operation rule is applied to all the operations in the usual
way, to determine the surgeon's fee. To determine the assistant's fee,
the multiple operation formula is then re-applied but only to those
services that are eligible for an assistant fee and at which assistance
is rendered.

Example

Multiple operation rule - Surgeon

-   Item A - $300 x 100%
-   Item B - $250 x 50%
-   Item C - $200 x 25%
-   Item D - $150 x 25%

Multiple operation rule - Assistant

-   Item A (Assist) - $300 x 100%
-   Item B (No Assist)
-   Item C (Assist) - $200 x50%
-   Item D (Assist) - $150 x 25%

The resultant aggregate fee determines if item 51300 or item 51303
applies to the assistant fee

Note: these are example figures only - access MBS for the current
schedule fees.

2 or more surgeons operating - surgeons operating independently

Where 2 or more surgeons operate on the same patient on the same
occasion and they do not:

-   assist the other surgeons
-   administer, or assist in the administration of, the anaesthetic

they are deemed to be operating independently.

The procedures they perform are considered as separate operations, and
if any of them employs an assistant, the assistant fees are calculated
separately for the services of each surgeon.

See Surgical operations assessing rules in Medicare for more
information.

The following provides examples of various scenarios of surgeons
operating independently.

Example A

Dr Steve and Dr Michael operate independently on a patient on the same
occasion. Dr Ted assists Dr Steve. All of the items at which assistance
is given are eligible for an assistant fee.

Dr Steve

-   Operation A (Assist) - Schedule fee $500
-   Operation B (Assist) - Schedule fee $450
-   Operation C (Assist) - Schedule fee $200
-   Assisted by Dr Ted

Dr Michael

-   Operation 1 - Schedule fee $300
-   Operation 2 - Schedule fee $150

Apply the multiple operation rule to the services that are eligible for
an assistant fee and at which assistance is rendered.

Dr Steve assisted by Dr Ted

-   Operation A (Assist) - Schedule fee $500 x 100% = $500
-   Operation B (Assist) - Schedule fee $450 x 50% = $225
-   Operation C (Assist) - Schedule fee $200 x 25% - $50
-   Total Schedule fee = $775

Compare the total Schedule fee to items 51300 and 51303 to determine
which assistant item applies to Dr Ted's services.

-   Item 51303 applies because the total Schedule fee for the operations
    exceeds $558.30

Calculate the derived fee for item 51303, that is, 20% of the total
schedule fee for operations A, B and C.

-   $775 x 20% = $155

Note: these are example figures only - access MBS for the current
schedule fees.

Example B

Dr Steve and Dr Michael operate independently on a patient on the same
occasion. Dr Ted assists Dr Steve. Not all of the items at which
assistance is given are eligible for an assistant fee.

Dr Steve

-   Operation A (Assist) - Schedule fee $600
-   Operation B - Schedule fee $540
-   Operation C (Assist) - Schedule fee $320
-   Operation D - Schedule fee $250
-   Assisted by Dr Ted

Dr Michael

-   Operation 1 - Schedule fee $340
-   Operation 2 - Schedule fee $100

To calculate the fee for the operations, the multiple operation rule is
applied as follows:

-   Dr Steve assisted by Dr Ted
-   Operation A (Assist) - Schedule fee $600 x 100% = $600
-   Operation B (No assist) - $0
-   Operation C (Assist) - Schedule fee $320 x 50% = $160.00

Operation D (No assist) - $0

Total Schedule fee = $760

Compare the total Schedule fee to items 51300 and 51303 to determine
which assistant item applies to Dr Brown's services.

-   Item 51303 applies because the total Schedule fee for the operations
    exceeds $537.15

Calculate the derived fee for item 51303, that is, 20% of the total
Schedule fee for operations A and C.

-   $760 x 20% = $152

Note: these are example figures only - access MBS for the current
schedule fees.

Example C

Dr Steve and Dr Michael operate independently on a patient on the same
occasion and, although each employs the same assistant, the 2 surgeons
are still deemed to be operating independently. All of the items at
which assistance is given are eligible for an assistant fee.

Dr Steve

-   Operation A (Assist) - Schedule fee $450
-   Operation B (Assist) - Schedule fee $260
-   Operation C (Assist) - Schedule fee $200
-   Assisted by Dr Ted

Dr Michael

-   Operation 1 (Assist) - Schedule fee $200
-   Operation 2 (Assist) - Schedule fee $200
-   Assisted by Dr Ted

To determine the fee level against which the assistant's fee is
calculated, apply the multiple operation rule to the services that are
eligible for an assistant fee and at which assistance is rendered.

Dr Steve assisted by Dr Ted

-   Operation A - $450 x 100% = $450
-   Operation B - $260 x 50% = $130
-   Operation C - $200 x 25% = $50
-   Total Schedule fee = $630

Dr Michael assisted by Dr Ted

-   Operation 1 - $200 x 100% = $200
-   Operation 2 - $200 x 50% = $100
-   Total Schedule fee = $300

Compare the fee with items 51300 and 51303 to determine which assistant
item applies.

Dr Ted assisting Dr Steve

-   Item 51303 applies to the assistant services as the total Schedule
    fee for the operations exceeds the threshold of $558.30

Dr Ted assisting Dr Michael

-   Item 51300 applies to the assistant services as the total Schedule
    fee for the operations does not exceed $558.30.
-   Calculate the derived fee for item 51303 for Dr Steve surgery fee,
    that is, 20% of the total Schedule fee - $630 x 20% = $126.
-   Pay item 51303 using processing indicator (PI) 58. Then as a
    separate claim, pay item 51300.

Note: these are example figures only - access MBS for the current
schedule fees.

Example D

Dr Steve and Dr Michael operate independently on a patient on the same
occasion and each employs a different assistant. Not all of the items at
which assistance is given are eligible for an assistant fee.

Dr Steve

-   Operation A - Schedule fee $400
-   Operation B (Assist) - Schedule fee $380
-   Operation C - Schedule fee $200
-   Operation D (Assist) - Schedule fee $150
-   Assisted by Dr Ted

Dr Michael

-   Operation 1 (Assist) - Schedule fee $220
-   Operation 2 (Assist) - Schedule fee $200
-   Operation 3 (Assist) - Schedule fee $180
-   Assisted by Dr Leigh

To calculate the fee for the operations, apply the multiple operation
rule as follows:

Dr Steve

-   Operation A - Schedule fee $400 x 100%
-   Operation B - Schedule fee $380 x 50%
-   Operation C - Schedule fee $200 x 25%
-   Operation D - Schedule fee $150 x 25%

Dr Michael

-   Operation 1 - Schedule fee $220 x 100%
-   Operation 2 - Schedule fee $200 x 50%
-   Operation 3 - Schedule fee $180 x 25%

To calculate the fee for the assistance, reapply the multiple operation
rule as follows:

Dr Steve assisted by Dr Ted

-   Operation A (No assist) = $0
-   Operation B (Assist) - Schedule fee $380 x 100% = $380
-   Operation C (No assist) = $0.00
-   Operation D (Assist) - Schedule fee $150 x 50% = $125
-   Total Schedule fee = $505

Dr Michael assisted by Dr Leigh

-   Operation 1 (Assist) - Schedule fee $220 x 100% = $220
-   Operation 2 (Assist) - Schedule fee $200 x 50% = $100
-   Operation 3 (Assist) - Schedule fee $180 x 25% = $45
-   Total Schedule fee = $365

Compare the total Schedule fees with items 51300 and 51303 to determine
which assistant item applies per surgeon.

Dr Ted assisting Dr Steve

-   Item 51303 applies to the assistant services as the total Schedule
    fee for the operations exceeds $558.30

Dr Leigh assisting Dr Michael

-   Item 51300 applies to the assistant services as the total Schedule
    fee for the operations does not exceed $537.15

Calculate the derived fee for item 51303, that is, 20% of the total
Schedule fee

-   $505 x 20% = $101

Note: these are example figures only - access MBS for the current
schedule fees.

Multiple surgeons not operating independently

Where 2 or more surgeons operate and each performs 1 or more operations
but 1 assists the other, or they both assist each other, the surgeons
are not considered to be operating independently. The multiple operation
rule is applied to all the operations combined. The assessment of the
assistant's fee is based on the fee for the combined operations.

Example A

Dr Steve and Dr Michael each perform a series of operations on a patient
on the same occasion. Dr Michael also assists Dr Steve. Each of Dr
Steve’s services is eligible for an assistant fee.

Dr Steve

-   Operation A (Assist) - Schedule fee $500
-   Operation B (Assist) - Schedule fee $400
-   Operation C (Assist) - Schedule fee $300
-   Operation D (Assist) - Schedule fee $200
-   Assisted by Dr Michael

Dr Michael

-   Operation 1 - Schedule fee $450
-   Operation 2 - Schedule fee $100
-   Dr Michael assisting Dr Steve
-   Assisted by Dr Steve

To calculate the fee for the operations, apply the multiple operation
rule as follows:

Dr Steve and Dr Michael

-   Operation A - Schedule fee $500 x 100%
-   Operation 1 - Schedule fee $450 x 50%
-   Operation B - Schedule fee $400 x 25%
-   Operation C - Schedule fee $300 x 25%
-   Operation D - Schedule fee $200 x 25%
-   Operation 2 - Schedule fee $100 x 25%

To calculate the fee for the assistant, reapply the multiple operation
rule only to those services that are eligible for an assistant fee, and
at which assistance is rendered:

Dr Steve assisted by Dr Michael

-   Operation A (Assist) - Schedule fee $500 x 100% = $500
-   Operation B (Assist) - Schedule fee $400 x 50% = $200
-   Operation C (Assist) - Schedule fee $300 x 25% = $75
-   Operation D (Assist) - Schedule fee $200 x 25% = $50
-   Total Schedule fee = $825

Compare the total Schedule fee with items 51300 and 51303 to determine
which assistant item applies

Dr Michael assisting Dr Steve

-   Item 51303 applies to the assistant services as the total Schedule
    fee for the operations exceeds $558.30

Calculate the derived fee for item 51303, that is, 20% of the total
Schedule fee - $825 x 20% = $165

Note: these are example figures only - access MBS for the current
schedule fees.

Example B

Dr Steve and Dr Michael each perform a series of operations on a patient
on the same occasion. Both surgeons assist each other.

Dr Steve

-   Operation A - Schedule fee $400
-   Operation B (Assist) - Schedule fee $240
-   Operation C (Assist) - Schedule fee $200

Dr Michael

-   Operation 1 (Assist) - Schedule fee $210
-   Operation 2 - Schedule fee $180

To calculate the fee for the operations, apply the multiple operation
rule as follows:

-   Operation A - Schedule fee $400 x 100%
-   Operation B - Schedule fee $240 x 50%
-   Operation 1 - Schedule fee $210 x 25%
-   Operation C - Schedule fee $200 x 25%
-   Operation 2 - Schedule fee $180 x 25%

To calculate the fee for the assistant, reapply the multiple operation
rule only to the services that are eligible for an assistant fee, and at
which assistance is rendered.

-   Operation B (Assist) - Schedule fee $240 x 100% = $240
-   Operation 1 (Assist) - Schedule fee $210 x 50% = $105
-   Operation C (Assist) - Schedule fee $200 x 25% = $50
-   Total Schedule fee = $395

Compare the total Schedule fee to items 51300 and 51303 to determine
which assistant item applies

-   Item 51300 applies because the total Schedule fee for the operations
    does not exceed $558.30

Note: where each surgeon assists the other, the division of the
assistant's fee is a matter for the surgeons involved.

Note: these are example figures only - access MBS for the current
schedule fees.

Assistance at cataract and intraocular lens surgery (items 51315 and 51318)
