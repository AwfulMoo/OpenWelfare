+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Example 1                         | Customer departed Australia on a  |
|                                   | 10 day cruise. Customer is        |
|                                   | disputing the departure date and  |
|                                   | has provided an itinerary to      |
|                                   | state that out of a 10 day        |
|                                   | cruise, only 5 days were in other |
|                                   | countries/international waters.   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The customer’s itinerary confirms |
|                                   | they left Sydney on 20 April 2022 |
|                                   | but does not confirm what date    |
|                                   | they left Australian waters.      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The date the customer left the    |
|                                   | last Australian port should be    |
|                                   | recorded, i.e. the date the       |
|                                   | customer left Sydney is the date  |
|                                   | of departure.                     |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Example 2                         | Customer has a departure recorded |
|                                   | in the Department of Home Affairs |
|                                   | as the 21st of a month. The       |
|                                   | Itinerary states they travelled   |
|                                   | to 3 different Australian ports   |
|                                   | before departing to the           |
|                                   | international destination. For    |
|                                   | example, departs Sydney 21st,     |
|                                   | then travels to Hobart, Adelaide  |
|                                   | and Perth, before departing for   |
|                                   | Indonesia on the 25th of the      |
|                                   | month. Their itinerary confirms   |
|                                   | that they did not leave           |
|                                   | Australian waters until the 25th. |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The date of departure on RSIM can |
|                                   | be adjusted to the date the       |
|                                   | itinerary shows the date the      |
|                                   | customer left, or is leaving the  |
|                                   | last Australian port. The         |
|                                   | departure date on RSIM would be   |
|                                   | the date the customer left Perth. |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the Department Home Affairs    |
|                                   | has assessed the departure date,  |
|                                   | the workaround would be to code   |
|                                   | an arrival equal to the original  |
|                                   | Department of Home Affairs        |
|                                   | departure date and then code the  |
|                                   | new Centrelink assessed departure |
|                                   | date.                             |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Example 3                         | Customer departed Adelaide on a   |
|                                   | cruise on the 10th of the month.  |
|                                   | They travel to Hobart and Sydney  |
|                                   | before departing for New Zealand  |
|                                   | on the 16^(th). They arrive in    |
|                                   | New Zealand on the 17th.          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The same cruise returns to Sydney |
|                                   | on the 27^(th). They travel to    |
|                                   | Melbourne before ending in Hobart |
|                                   | on the 30th.                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The departure date is the 16th as |
|                                   | this is the date the cruise left  |
|                                   | Australia. The arrival date is    |
|                                   | the 27th as this is the date the  |
|                                   | cruise returned to Australia.     |
