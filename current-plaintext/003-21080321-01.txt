This document explains how to process an urgent payment request on a
customer's record and issue the urgent payment.

Considering urgent payment requests

Staff must first follow the relevant procedure to check if the customer
is eligible for an urgent payment, offer other assistance, and make a
decision to grant or deny an urgent payment:

-   Urgent payment due to exceptional and unforeseen or extraordinary
    circumstances
-   Urgent payments due to Centrelink delay
-   Urgent payments due to expenses associated with a funeral
-   Urgent payments due to holiday processing
-   Urgent payment requests from Income Management customers

Process via script

Use the Immediate payment requests script to record the outcome of all
urgent payment requests.

Payment method

See Urgent payment requests.

The Resources page has links to forms, Office Locator, contact details,
IFP screen codes, FAQs, and the effect of nominee and third party
arrangements. It includes suggested text for DOCs and details the role
of QOL checkers.
