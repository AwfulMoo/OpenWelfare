|                                   | In most cases, an ‘OS TAX INCOME’ |
|                                   | has been calculated with income   |
|                                   | received in the financial year of |
|                                   | the overseas country. When the    |

|                                   | cannot be used to reconcile an    |
|                                   | estimate. Only Australian         |
|                                   | financial year income can be used |
|                                   | to reconcile an estimate.         |

|                                   | For example, a New Zealand        |
|                                   | financial year goes from 1 April  |
|                                   | to 31 March. An OS TAX INCOME for |
|                                   | a New Zealand resident will be    |
|                                   | for income earned from 1 April to |
|                                   | 31 March. It would therefore be   |
|                                   | incorrect to use this to          |
|                                   | reconcile an estimate.            |

|                                   | Note: There are some specific     |
|                                   | circumstances when an ‘OS TAX     |
|                                   | INCOME’ calculation does use      |
|                                   | income from an Australian         |
|                                   | financial year. If the notepad    |
|                                   | clearly indicates that this has   |
|                                   | occurred, consult an SSO to       |
|                                   | confirm if the income should be   |
|                                   | used in the reconciliation.       |
