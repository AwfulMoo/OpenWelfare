This document outlines the steps to be taken by Compensation Recovery
Officers (CRO) in a Compensation Recovery Team (CRT) when linking and
unlinking compensation claim details.

Linking compensation claims

When there are multiple claims for a single incident date, the claims
must be linked to each other. This is to correctly assess the
compensation payments and to correct preclusion periods or debts.

Unlinking and deleting compensation claims

A compensation claim is required to be unlinked or deleted from the
customer’s record where:

-   claims have been recorded on the incorrect CRN
-   claims have been incorrectly linked to another compensation claim
-   the receipt of payments from the claim have no effect under the
    compensation provisions
