DMA work items

Activities or work items generated by the external Government-contracted
Doctor (GCD) referral system are allocated to staff through Customer
First's Workload Management System (WMS). These are the DMA specific
work items for Disability Support Pension (DSP) New Claims:

ZGCD_INCOMPLETE - Insufficient information was available for an
automatic DMA referral to be completed and manual action is required.
Reasons a DMA referral may not automatically generate include:

-   there is a finalised DMA on customer record that was completed
    within the past 2 years
-   there is an open DMA referral on the customer record
-   the system was unable to determine the date of claim/medical review
    initiation
-   the data from the ESAt/JCA report was unable to be automatically
    populated or information is missing; or
-   the system was unable to determine the DMA referral reason

ZGCD_CANNOT_CONTACT – Claimant is unable to be contacted in order to
schedule a DMA appointment

ZGCD_DISABILITY_ASSM - DMA Report has been submitted and is ready for
action

ZGCD_REPORT_RETURN - GCD has requested the DMA report be returned to
them for further action

ZGCD_FAILED_TO_PART - Claimant/recipient has failed to participate in
the Disability Medical Assessment

ZGCD_FAILED_TO_ATTEND - Claimant/recipient has failed to attend a DMA
appointment on two occasions

For a request for an explanation or a formal review of a decision (DMA
referral reason of Appeal) the ownership model of work allocation will
apply.

The allocation of DMA specific work items is based on an ‘ownership
model’ means that a work item for a specific DMA referral is allocated
to the staff member that made the initial referral.

If the staff member is on leave or no longer processing this work their
team leader can reallocate work items to another individual.

If the referral reason is ‘Appeal’ or ‘Review-Other’ the following work
items are allocated via the ownership model:

-   ZGCD_INCOMPLETE_OWN
-   ZGCD_CNNT_CNTACT_OWN
-   ZGCD_FAILED_ATT_OWN
-   ZGCD_FAILED_PART_OWN
-   ZGCD_DISY_ASSM_OWN
-   ZGCD_RPT_RETURN_OWN

The Process page has details on locating and actioning DMA work items.

Skill tags

Work items are allocated on the basis of skill tags.

A single work tag NV CLK MED RVW GCD REF DSP has been created for all of
the work items generated by the DMA referral system.

Only processing staff, Subject Matter Experts (SME) and Authorised
Review Officers (ARO) who have completed training on DMA referrals
should have this skill tag.
