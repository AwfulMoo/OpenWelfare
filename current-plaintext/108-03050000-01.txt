The Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA)

DVA is the Australian Government department that provides support,
services and information for the following members of the veteran
community:

-   Veterans, their dependants, family members and carers
-   Serving and former serving ADF members
-   War widow/ers
-   Australian British Nuclear Tests participants
-   Members of the Australian Federal Police, and
-   Students, teachers and historians

The support, services and information DVA provide also includes:

-   Financial support
-   Health care
-   Rehabilitation
-   Mental health care
-   Help returning to civilian life
-   Commemoration and Recognition
-   Home care assistance

Most of the payments administered by DVA are not paid under Social
Security legislation. Information on DVA legislation can be found on the
DVA website, this includes:

-   Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (VEA)
-   Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 (MRCA)
-   Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence-related Claims) Act
    1988 (DRCA)

There are a number of other passages of legislation that outline DVA
entitlements. Further information on legislation administered by DVA can
be found by visiting Department of Veterans' Affairs (dva.gov.au).

DVA Clients

A DVA client is a person who receives a payment or service from DVA. Not
all people who approach Services Australia to discuss DVA payments or
services will be a current DVA client. For example, a person may have
recently discharged from the armed forces and is looking for information
on how to claim a payment from DVA. A person who approaches may also be
a caregiver providing support to a veteran.

Services Australia and the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA)

Services Australia and DVA both provide payments and services to a wide
range of people and their families. In some cases, a person may be
receiving a payment or service from both agencies at the same time. For
example, when a person receives an income support payment from DVA and
Family Assistance payments from Services Australia they are referred to
as mutual customers. Both Services Australia and DVA hold a mutual
interest in a mutual customers outcomes.

Information on payments and services paid to mutual customers is
transferred between Services Australia and DVA. The information transfer
is either automatically, via a designated data exchange or, manually
through a specialised clearance process. Mutual customers may also
provide payment information themselves, as part of their notification
obligations, to advise of any changes to their circumstances.

Services Australia's role

To support the delivery of services between the two agencies, a number
of roles are undertaken by Services Australia. These roles include
providing support to a mutual customer contacting Services Australia via
the telephony network or, when they attend a Services Australia service
centre. The agency is also responsible for ensuring mutual customers
receive the correct payment entitlement.

A mutual customer contacts the Services Australia telephony network -
When contact is made with the telephony network, Service Officers are
expected to attempt to resolve the enquiry where they are able. This may
include confirming DVA payment information already recorded on the
Services Australia customer record.

A member of the veteran community attends a Services Australia service
centre - Services Australia provides a range of face-to-face services on
behalf of DVA in all Services Australia service centres and Mobile
Service Centres (MSCs), called the Standardised Service Offer. In
addition, the Veterans' Information Service (VIS) also operates from 22
regional Services Australia service centres and is a service provided by
‘VIS Officers’ (Services Australia staff, trained by DVA). The services
under the VIS include those of the Standardised Service Offer as well as
additional items designed to complement the DVA Veterans Access Network
(VAN).

Ensuring Services Australia payment accuracy – As DVA payments can
affect entitlement to payments administered by the agency, the agency
records the details of DVA payments on our records. Given the nature and
complexities of DVA payments, it may be necessary to handoff an enquiry
to another appropriately skilled staff member or area. Services
Australia’s specialised DVA Clearance Team undertake all DVA payment
coding.

A mutual customer may move between the two agencies, due to gaining or
losing eligibility to particular payments and services. There may also
be a direct transfer from one payment to another, often with overlapping
payment dates. To support accurate payment outcomes and to minimise
disruptions, a specialised clearance process exists between Services
Australia and DVA to confirm:

-   start date of payments
-   rate of payments
-   overpayment due to overlapping payments
-   debt amounts including adjustments, any amounts recovered from
    arrears if applicable, as well as any subsequent outstanding debt
    amounts
