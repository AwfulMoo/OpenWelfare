This document outlines the process for conducting proof of energy
reviews for EMEP.

Post-payment compliance

Post-payment compliance will be undertaken on selected customers by a
review of their energy account. This review will determine their ongoing
entitlement to their current EMEP.

Energy account evidence is not required at the time a claim is lodged,
unless the customer has failed to provide acceptable proof of energy
account for a previous review.

Reviews

Five per cent of current EMEP customers will be selected for the energy
account review 12 weeks after the EMEP claim is finalised.

Selected customers will be sent a letter requesting they provide
evidence that they are:

-   the energy account holder
-   the partner of the energy account holder, or
-   contributing toward the energy account

The customer must return the evidence within 28 days of the date the
letter was issued.

Exclusions from review

Customers will be excluded from the review if:

-   the energy account is paid via Centrepay deductions
-   they provided proof of their state/territory rebate as medical
    evidence, or
-   they provided acceptable proof for a previous energy account review

The EMEP claim attached to the review will automatically cancel if
acceptable proof is not provided within 28 days.

Acceptable proof

Customers need to provide the most recent energy bill as proof that
they, their partner, or the equipment user is the account holder or is
contributing to the account.

The proof should be for the energy type (for example, electricity, gas,
diesel, heating oil) used to run the medical equipment and/or medically
required heating/cooling for which EMEP is being paid at their current
residence.
