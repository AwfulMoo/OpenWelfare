This document outlines how to assess Pensioner Education Supplement
(PES) claims.

Qualification for PES

PES is paid in addition to the primary 'qualifying' payment to help with
the ongoing costs associated with study.

To qualify for PES a student must meet all of the following:

-   be receiving a qualifying payment for PES
-   satisfy the residence requirements for PES
-   be of PES age (there is no maximum age limit for PES)
-   be undertaking or intending to undertake an approved course of study
    at an approved institution
-   have not completed a Masters or Doctorate degree or qualification

Note: extra criteria must be considered when deciding if a customer is
eligible to receive PES for a 25% concessional study load.

Identity requirements

For PES claims, if the customer is receiving a:

-   qualifying payment for PES, identity documentation is only required
    if Identity Confirmation was not met when the customer claimed their
    primary income support payment
-   Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) payment, identification
    documentation is required if they have not confirmed their identity
    with Services Australia

PES processing

PES processing has been consolidated into Smart Centre Processing
centres nationally. See Office Locator > Student Network - National PES
/ AIC > Office Messages > Office Notes.

PES rejections

Many rejection reasons automatically occur after details have been coded
into the system. However some rejection reasons have to be coded
manually, for example, failing to supply documents, failing to reply to
correspondence.

Where a customer's PES qualifying pension or payment from

-   Services Australia is not current, their claim for PES is
    automatically rejected
-   Department of Veterans' Affairs is not current, their PES claim is
    manually rejected

When manually rejecting a claim, notify the customer in writing with the
rejection reason(s) and include their rights of review and appeal.
