This document outlines the authorisations, delegations and links to the
legislation for Child Support when Services Australia is notified of a
child of an assessment changing care from 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2018 (3
March 2011 to 14 May 2019 for WA Ex-nuptial cases).

Change in care - Alignment of Legislation between Child Support and Centrelink

From 1 July 2010 (3 March 2011 for WA Ex-nuptial cases) customers who
have both a Child Support and Centrelink assessment and/or record are:

-   mutual customers, and
-   can notify either agency of a change to the care for a Family Tax
    Benefit (FTB) eligible/dependent child of an assessment

The Program who is notified first will:

-   record the change in care details
-   conduct investigations
-   make a care decision
-   give effect to the decision

Throughout this process, information will be shared between Child
Support and Centrelink electronically via data exchange. The final
decision will be applied electronically to the customer’s Child Support
and FTB assessment as the same rules are used to determine care
percentages.

Note: for care changes before 1 July 2010 (3 March 2011 for WA
Ex-nuptial cases), contact Blueprint to obtain previous versions of this
document. Seek assistance from technical support.

Amendments to the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989

The Child Support Assessment Act (the Act) was introduced on 1 October
1989, and has been amended on occasions since then.

From 23 May 2018, amendments were made to:

extend the interim period that applies for recently-established
court-ordered care arrangements, and

provide incentives for the person with increased care to take reasonable
action to participate in family dispute resolution where a care dispute
relates to:

-   an older court order
-   a parenting plan, or
-   a written agreement

From 1 July 2018, the Act was amended further, including changes to
‘care date of effect’ rules.

Both of the above amendments apply for WA Ex-nuptial case customers
where care changes are notified on or after 15 May 2019.

For changes in care notified from 1 July 2018 (15 May 2019 for WA
Ex-nuptial case children) see Notification of change in child support
care from 1 July 2018 (15 May 2019 for WA Ex-nuptial cases). Use this
document for changes notified before the changes taking effect or where
WA Ex-nuptial ‘Child Support Periods’ are present.

System Enhancements for WA Ex-nuptial cases

On 15 May 2019, WA parliament passed legislation that adopted all
Commonwealth child support laws not previously adopted. The parliament
also:

-   referred legislative powers in respect of the maintenance of
    Ex-nuptial children to the Commonwealth, and
-   repealed the Child Support (Adoption of Laws) Act 1990 (WA)

This means that all changes to care notified on or after 15 May 2019 are
managed under the same rules.

Services Australia enhanced the Child Support system on 18 June 2022 to
automatically treat WA Ex-nuptial customers correctly prospectively
where:

-   Child Support Periods (CSPs) are automatically raised on or after 18
    June 2022
-   New cases are registered or cases are restarted with a Start Date of
    Liability (SDOL) on or after 18 June 2022

As this enhancement was prospective only, workarounds are needed for
change of care notifications:

on or after 15 May 2019, and

‘date of events’ within Child Support Periods (CSPs) that reflect a WA
Ex-nuptial status of ‘Yes’ and:

-   care is notified outside of 28 days - late notified care change
-   disputed care - possible interim period - is notified
-   an amended tax assessment is lodged
-   a payee is entitled to child support under an agreement and the care
    they have of the child in the agreement falls below 35%

Service Officers should follow instructions within relevant Operational
Blueprint documents and macros for decision-making and customer
management where these circumstances are present. Once initial decisions
are made, affected records are identified via reporting and specialised
teams action to ensure legislatively correct implementation.

The Resources page contains links to authorisations and delegations,
macros, care calculator, care percentage table and external websites.
