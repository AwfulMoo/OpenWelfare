This document outlines the application and removal of BI flags.

The purpose of a BI flag

BI flags:

prevent further fraudulent activity on records where it has been
identified that:

-   claims may not be legitimate, or
-   the customer details may have been compromised

are used to restrict claiming to prevent legitimate claims being
redirected to a third party bank account where it is suspected a
person's Medicare details have been compromised by a third party

restrict customers from using all Medicare claiming channels without
further intervention by a Service Officer

may be lifted temporarily to allow for the processing of legitimate
Medicare claims

The Intelligence and Investigations Branch is responsible for the
application and removal of BI flags.

Identify a BI flag

The BI flag is placed on a card via the Consumer Directory Maintenance
System (CDMS). To view if a BI flag has been placed on a card:

-   access the Group Program Review Details tab in CDMS, the BI flag is
    identified by the Under Investigation review status, or
-   access the patient history (NHSI) screen of the record using
    Medicare mainframe, the BI flag is identified by a return message
    '8-INVEST' appearing below the command line

The Process page contains information about the application of a BI
flag, the documentation standards required and the ongoing maintenance
and removal of flags.

The Resources page contains an intranet link to mySupport, examples of
when an analyst/investigator should consider applying a BI flag,
examples of recording BI flag comments in the Consumer Directory
Maintenance System (CDMS) and how to check if a Medicare card has been
cancelled.
