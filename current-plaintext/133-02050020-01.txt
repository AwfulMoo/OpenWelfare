Health Professional Online Services

Health Professional Online Services (HPOS) is a simple and secure way
for eligible healthcare professionals, organisations and industry staff
to do business with Services Australia.

HPOS enables eligible users to:

-   create new provider numbers
-   update existing bank account details
-   submit claims, view reports, and
-   verify patient eligibility including patient care plan history

Health professionals can also nominate delegates to undertake
administrative tasks on their behalf, such as applying for practice
incentives.

Access and requirements

To access HPOS:

-   users must create an individual Provider Digital Access (PRODA)
    account, and

To access HPOS on behalf of an organisation:

-   the user must be added as a member of the organisation registered in
    PRODA
-   linked to HPOS, and
-   assigned the HPOS-Access attribute

Different access levels exist to suit the different users as follows:

-   Health professionals can access the full range of HPOS information
    and services they are eligible for based on provider type

    range of tasks on their behalf

    range of basic services including patient verification and basic
