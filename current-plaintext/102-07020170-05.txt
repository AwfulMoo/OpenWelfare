|                                   | may include additional travel     |
|                                   | time to allow Carl to prepare for |
|                                   | the study and/or to finalise      |
|                                   | affairs and return to Australia.  |
|                                   | Carl is travelling 4 days before  |
|                                   | the course start date, which will |
|                                   | be included in the approved study |
|                                   | period. The end date of the       |
|                                   | approved study period will depend |
|                                   | on what date Carl has advised for |
|                                   | return to Australia. If no date   |
|                                   | has been provided, the end date   |
|                                   | will be the study end date of 15  |
|                                   | November. If Carl has advised any |
|                                   | date up to November 21, record    |
|                                   | this as the end date of the       |
|                                   | approved study period.            |

|                                   | If Carl is returning after        |
|                                   | November 21 this would be in      |
|                                   | excess of the total allowable 10  |
|                                   | days and be considered a holiday. |
|                                   | The end date in this instance     |
|                                   | would be November 15, the last    |
|                                   | day of study.                     |
