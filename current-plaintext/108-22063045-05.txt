| 1                                 | System not assessing income       |
|                                   | correctly due to a change to the  |
|                                   | customer's delivery date          |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | periods, for example, after a     |
|                                   | payday change.                    |

|                                   | If the customer's entitlement     |
|                                   | period is for 11 days and the     |
|                                   | customer has earned $220.00 for   |
|                                   | work done on some or all of those |
|                                   | 11 days during this period we     |
|                                   | calculate the income for the      |
|                                   | shorter entitlement period as     |
|                                   | follows:                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | $220.00/11 (days in the period) x |
|                                   | 14 = $280.00 (this is the amount  |
|                                   | to record on the Employment       |
|                                   | Income (EANS) screen). When the   |
|                                   | system divides this amount by 14  |
|                                   | it will assess the correct $20    |
|                                   | per day.                          |

|                                   | Otherwise the system incorrectly  |
|                                   | assumes the period is 14 days and |
|                                   | apportions the rate as $220.00/14 |
|                                   | = $15.71 per day instead of the   |
|                                   | correct $20.00 per day.           |

|                                   | and convert to a fortnightly      |

|                                   | the days involved.                |

|                                   | frequency (ANN)                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The system takes employment       |
|                                   | income recorded with a frequency  |
|                                   | of ANN to be the amount earned    |
|                                   | every 364 days. For example, a    |
|                                   | wage of $36,400 ANN will be       |
|                                   | assessed as $1,400 per fortnight. |
|                                   | Over 365 days, the system         |
|                                   | actually assesses $36,500 and in  |
|                                   | a leap year $36,600. However,     |
|                                   | this may be correct as it depends |
|                                   | on how the employer converts the  |
|                                   | annual rate into fortnightly pay, |
|                                   | for example, Australian Public    |
|                                   | Service (APS) fortnightly pay is  |
|                                   | annual salary x 12/313.           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Where possible, customers who     |
|                                   | advise an annual rate must be     |
|                                   | advised how Services Australia    |
|                                   | assess this. For customers who    |
|                                   | confirm they receive exactly      |
|                                   | their annual salary every year    |
|                                   | regardless of leap years etc.     |
|                                   | (usually principals of trusts or  |
|                                   | companies who arrange this via an |
|                                   | accounting process), record this  |
|                                   | amount x 364/365. However, for    |
|                                   | all the employees whose gross     |
|                                   | fortnightly pay is determined by  |
|                                   | their employment agreement,       |
|                                   | customers must be advised they    |
|                                   | may be disadvantaged if they do   |
|                                   | not advise this amount instead.   |
