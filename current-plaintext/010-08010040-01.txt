This document outlines when an ABSTUDY customer under 16 years is
impacted by the Personal Income Test.

Exemption from Personal Income Test

The Personal Income Test is applied to ABSTUDY students and Australian
Apprentices 16 years of age or over and independent Australian
Apprentices under 16 years of age.

An ABSTUDY customer is not subject to the Personal Income Test if they
are under 16 years of age and:

-   a dependent student
-   an independent student
-   a dependent Australian Apprentice

Eligibility for Income Bank

ABSTUDY customers who are exempt from the Personal Income Test are not
entitled to accrue an Income Bank. As the Income Bank only accrues if
the income is below the income free area and there is no income free
area in these circumstances, the Income Bank cannot accrue.

Parental Income Test

Dependent customers who are under 16 years of age and eligible for
Living Allowance, or who are 16 years of age and over, are also subject
to income testing on the combined taxable income of both their
parents/guardians, irrespective of whether they live at home or away
from home.
