|                                   |     Correcting the error will     |
|                                   |     have a financial impact for a |

|                                   |     error will cause a reverse    |
|                                   |     case to be created from the   |
|                                   |     role change date which was    |
|                                   |     less than 3 months ago, and   |

|                                   | applicable for example:           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   a CSP will commence soon      |
|                                   |     using a new income making MAR |
|                                   |     no longer applicable, or the  |
|                                   |     MAR amount will change, for   |
|                                   |     example one of the cases is   |
|                                   |     due to end on a known future  |
|                                   |     date and therefore the MAR    |
|                                   |     apportionment will need to be |
|                                   |     recalculated), then the 'To   |
|                                   |     Date' should be this known    |
|                                   |     future event date.            |

|                                   | However, if MAR will be           |
|                                   | applicable into the future and    |
|                                   | there is no known event that will |
|                                   | end/vary the MAR apportionment    |
|                                   | calculation, record the 'To Date' |
|                                   | as the end date of the case, not  |
|                                   | the end date of the current child |
|                                   | support period. When the parents  |
|                                   | are contacted to discuss the      |
|                                   | error correction, stress to all   |
|                                   | parties that this type of error   |
|                                   | correction does need to be        |
|                                   | monitored, as Child Support       |
|                                   | cannot guarantee that it will be  |
|                                   | automatically adjusted if         |
|                                   | circumstances change.             |

|                                   | So if circumstances do change,    |
|                                   | for example new CSP starts/new    |

|                                   | changes for a child, they should  |
|                                   | call Child Support to check that  |
