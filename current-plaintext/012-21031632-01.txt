This document outlines the process for assessing AHHCCS initial,
subsequent and S38 response applications.

AHHCCS applications

Eligible Medical Indemnity Insurers (MII) must submit an AHHCCS
application via the Medical Indemnity Online Claiming (MIOC) system. In
the event the MIOC system is unavailable for a period of time
(determined by the Director), an AHHCCS application can be submitted
with the relevant supporting documentation, via post or email.

For more information AHHCCS claiming see Medical Indemnity (MI) Schemes
Claiming.

The Resources page contains an AHHCCS Overview and other information,
including links to the Services Australia website and an external
website about MI.
