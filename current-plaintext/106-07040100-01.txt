This document outlines how to verify a customer's proof of arrival in
Australia. Proof of arrival is used for the customer's commencement of
identity when the customer is born outside Australia. The confirmation
of commencement of identity is important in the determination of a
customer's eligibility for most Centrelink administered payments.

POA for Identity

In order for a customer to obtain a Confirmed Identity they must provide
original POA documents face to face to Services Australia, see Coding
identity documents. Only where an assessment of Alternative Identity
Confirmation is required can the information from the Department of Home
Affairs datalink be used to support this assessment.

The Resources page contains contact details for Centrelink International
Services (CIS) and to Australian Citizenship verification forms for CIS
staff only. There is also a link to Old Arrival Records on the National
Archives.
