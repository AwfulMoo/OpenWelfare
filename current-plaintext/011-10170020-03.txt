Escalate an enquiry to the Centrelink/AIR Liaison Team

Table 4: How to escalate an enquiry about the immunisation link between
Centrelink and AIR. This includes checking if escalation is appropriate,
and how the Centrelink and AIR Liaison Team responds.

The AIR/Centrelink Liaison Team is made up of staff based in Centrelink
and also in the AIR in Medicare (staff based in Hobart and Perth). The
teams work together on urgent and complex issues affecting the
Centrelink/AIR link process and immunisation status data for a child.
