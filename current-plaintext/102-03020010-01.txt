This document outlines information regarding the inter-environment
change of address for a customer receiving Carer Payment (CP) and/or
Carer Allowance (CA), including explanation of how to deal with the
links between the carer and the care receiver.

Transferring records

The Centrelink system is divided into a series of geographically based
environments. When a customer changes their address from one environment
to another, their computer file record must also be transferred.

When processing an inter-environment change of address for a carer
and/or care receiver, certain carer links are to be end-dated and
restored after the inter-environment transfer is completed.
