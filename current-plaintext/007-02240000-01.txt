This document outlines the procedures for applying the income and asset
tests when assessing a customer's eligibility for Parenting Payment (PP)
and rate of PP.

Rate of Parenting Payment (PP)

The rate of PP depends on whether the customer is partnered or single:

-   Parenting Payment Single (PPS) is paid at the PPS rate and is
    subject to the PPS Income Test and the benefit/ allowance Assets
    Test
-   Parenting Payment Partnered (PPP) is paid at the benefit/ allowance
    rate and is subject to the benefit/ allowance income and assets
    tests

Working Credit

Working credits may enable the customer who is of workforce age to keep
some of their income support payment while they are working. If the
customer's income reduces their fortnightly rate to nil and some of that
income is employment income, the customer's payment may remain current
at nil rate for up to 6 fortnights and they may retain certain benefits.

The Resources page contains a link to the Parenting Payment Rates
factsheet.
