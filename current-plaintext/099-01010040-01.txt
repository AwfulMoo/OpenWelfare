This document outlines the procedures to be followed where a member of a
couple dies and neither was receiving payments from Services Australia
at the time of the death.

Assistance for surviving partner

The surviving partner may be entitled to bereavement assistance through
Services Australia.

This assistance can include:

-   JobSeeker Payment or Youth Allowance for working age customers whose
    partner has died have bereavement provisions. These include Partner
    Bereavement Payment and exemptions from waiting periods and
    participation requirements
-   Parenting Payment (PP) for single customers with a qualifying
    dependent child/children who do not have the support of a partner

Service Officer responsibilities

Service Officers should identify if a customer is eligible for an income
support payment and other products or services.

If the surviving partner is distressed at the time of advising about the
death, consider a referral to the social work service.

If the person is unable to provide information to confirm their
partner's death at the time of contact, a Service Officer must confirm
the death before any action is taken.

The person notifying of the death should be advised that information
used for Centrelink, Child Support and Medicare payments and services is
transferred within Services Australia. However, additional contact with
one of the agencies programs separately may be required to update
relevant information, depending on individual circumstances.
