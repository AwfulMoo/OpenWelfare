Child born overseas to permanent residents

Eligibility

A child born overseas who has parents who hold permanent resident status
in Australia, does not have automatic right of entry to Australia. The
child does not automatically gain permanent resident status and, as a
result, does not gain access to Medicare until they meet the usual
criteria. An application for permanent status must be lodged with the
Department of Home Affairs seeking approval for the child to migrate to
Australia.

Documentation required

Where the child’s parents have been absent from Australia for less than
one year, the following documents are required with a completed Medicare
enrolment application form:

-   child’s passport, and
-   birth certificate, and
-   evidence from Department of Home Affairs confirming the child’s
    lodgement of an application for permanent residency, or
-   evidence from Department of Home Affairs that permanent resident
    status has been granted to the child

Where the child’s parents have been absent for more than one year, the
following documents are required with a completed Medicare enrolment
application form:

-   child’s passport, and
-   birth certificate, and
-   evidence from Department of Home Affairs confirming the child’s
    lodgement of an application for permanent residency, or
-   evidence from Department of Home Affairs that permanent resident
    status has been granted to the child, and
-   two residency documents to confirm that the family has returned to
    Australia to reside along with confirmation of the parent's current
    eligibility

Note: evidence of the parent's and child’s residency status can also be
confirmed via the Immigration Data Link or VEVO.

Entitlement

Where the child is a conditional migrant and the parents are migrants,
the child must be enrolled on a separate card to the parents with the
parent/s being the group contact.

If the application for permanent residency was lodged before arriving in
Australia:

-   Start Date - date of arrival to Australia
-   End Date - 12 months from the entitlement start date
-   Entitlement Type - Conditional Migrant

If the application for permanent residency was lodged after arriving in
Australia:

-   Start Date - date of lodgement of the application for permanent
    residency
-   End Date - 12 months from the entitlement start date
-   Entitlement Type - Conditional Migrant

Where the child has been granted permanent residency status, they can be
enrolled directly onto the parent/s Medicare card.

Australia:

-   Start Date - date of arrival to Australia
-   End Date - open
-   Entitlement Type - Migrant

Application for permanent residency was granted after arriving in
Australia:

-   Start Date - Conditional Migrant until date permanent residency
    granted, once entitlement recorded as migrant, child can be
    transferred on to parent's Medicare card

Child born overseas to applicants for permanent residents

Where a child is born overseas and arrives in Australia after the
parents’ application for permanent resident status is lodged, the
parents of the child (applicants) must lodge an application for
permanent resident status for the child with the Department of Home
Affairs.

The child will hold a visa subclass 445 and this is displayed in VEVO.

Where VEVO displays visa TK/445, the child is onshore and is an
applicant for permanent resident visa, this information is sufficient to
confirm the child is eligible for Medicare and can be enrolled on the
card with the parent who holds the visa subclass 309.

Where a parent application is being appealed, the child cannot
automatically be added to the parent’s application.

If the visa subclass 445 was granted before arriving in Australia:

-   Start Date - date of arrival in Australia
-   End Date - same as parent already enrolled on the card
-   Entitlement Type - Conditional Migrant

If the subclass was granted after arriving in Australia:

-   Start Date - date of lodgement of the application for permanent
    residency (visa subclass 445)
-   End Date - same as parent already enrolled on the card
-   Entitlement Type - Conditional Migrant

Note: evidence of date of arrival or application lodgement date is
required, confirmation email from Department of Home Affairs is
sufficient.

Where the parent can't provide the confirmation letter from Department
of Home Affairs showing the parent's details and sponsor's details, a
birth certificate as well as child's passport is required. Refer to Tier
Two.
