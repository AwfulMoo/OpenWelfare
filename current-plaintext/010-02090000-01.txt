This document outlines procedures on how to negotiate Activity
Agreements for ABSTUDY students.

ABSTUDY Activity Agreements

Secondary school students will incur a breach if they have more than 5
full days of unapproved absences in a term. To retain their eligibility
for payments, they will need to enter into an ABSTUDY Activity
Agreement.

An Activity Agreement is a written commitment by the secondary school
student. To retain their entitlement, the student will need to negotiate
and agree to undertake certain activities with Services Australia.

The Activity Agreement:

-   is designed to reaffirm the student's commitment to full-time study
-   takes into account the student's circumstances
-   is based on reasonable and achievable activities that lead to
    educational outcomes, and
-   includes a requirement that the secondary school student must
    participate in full-time study, including attendance at school where
    required

Activity Agreements are not required for students:

-   getting Schooling A Award
-   less than 16 years of age receiving ABSTUDY Living Allowance
-   of any age approved for Away from home entitlements residing at a
    boarding school or hostel

Exemptions from requirement to enter ABSTUDY Activity Agreement

A secondary school student may be exempt from the requirement to enter
an Activity Agreement where:

-   circumstances make it unreasonable for the student to meet normal
    attendance requirements, for example, major personal crisis,
    homelessness, caring responsibilities, bereavement or confinement,
    and
-   the school approves the student's exemption from normal attendance
    requirements
