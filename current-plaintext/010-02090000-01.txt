ABSTUDY Activity Agreements

Where a secondary school student incurs the first breach in a year by
accumulating unapproved absences totalling more than 5 full days in a
term, they must enter into an ABSTUDY Activity Agreement in order to
retain eligibility for payments.

An Activity Agreement is a written commitment by the secondary school
student to undertake agreed activities in order to retain their
entitlement to ABSTUDY. These activities are formulated based on
negotiations between the secondary school student and Services
Australia.

The Activity Agreement:

-   is designed to reaffirm the student's commitment to full-time study
-   takes into account the student's circumstances
-   is based on reasonable and achievable activities that lead to
    educational outcomes, and
-   includes a requirement that the secondary school student must
    participate in full-time study, including attendance at school where
    required

Activity Agreements are not required for:

-   Schooling A Award students
-   students less than 16 years of age receiving ABSTUDY Living
    Allowance
-   students of any age approved for Away from home entitlements
    residing at a boarding school or hostel

Exemptions from requirement to enter ABSTUDY Activity Agreement

A secondary school student may be exempt from the requirement to enter
an Activity Agreement where:

-   circumstances make it unreasonable for the student to meet normal
    attendance requirements, for example, major personal crisis,
    homelessness, caring responsibilities, bereavement or confinement,
    and
-   the school approves the student's exemption from normal attendance
    requirements

Generating an ABSTUDY Activity Agreement

The Manage Activity Agreements for Students screen in Customer First is
a useful reference for basic information about a student Activity
Agreement. However, it does not generate a printable full Activity
Agreement or have any impact on payments. Therefore, the printable
ABSTUDY Activity Agreement form (SY072) must be used when negotiating an
ABSTUDY Activity Agreement.

The full electronic Activity Agreements accessed through Customer First
must not be used for ABSTUDY secondary school students as these
agreements include references to job seeking and contact with Employment
Services Providers, which is not appropriate for this customer group.

The Resources page contains links to the ABSTUDY Activity Agreement form
(SY072).
