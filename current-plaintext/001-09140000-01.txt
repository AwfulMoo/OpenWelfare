This document outlines how to assess whether job seekers with mutual
obligation requirements, are meeting the requirements of actively
seeking suitable work, accepting an offer of suitable work or continuing
in their current job, unless it is considered unsuitable for them.

Job search requirements

Under the Social Security Law, people receiving income support payments
with mutual obligation requirements usually must show they are actively
participating and undertaking tasks and activities which will help them
into employment, unless Services Australia has granted the job seeker an
exemption from these requirements.

A job seeker's mutual obligation requirements are generally determined
by:

-   their age
-   their assessed work capacity
-   whether they have the primary responsibility for the care of a child

Job seekers will have either full-time or part-time mutual obligation
requirements. Job seekers with full-time mutual obligation requirements
should be looking for work on a full-time basis and actively addressing
individual circumstances that may affect their capacity to undertake
paid work.

The following job seekers have part-time mutual obligation requirements:

-   Principal Carer Parents (PCP) once the youngest child in their care
    turns six years of age
-   job seekers with a Partial Capacity to Work (PCW) of 15 to 29 hours
    per week

The job seeker cohorts above are able to fully meet their part-time
mutual obligation requirements by undertaking approved requirements for
at least 30 hours per fortnight.

PCPs and job seekers with a PCW (15 to 29 hours per week) who are fully
meeting their part-time mutual obligation requirements through 30 hours
per fortnight of paid work (including self-employment) or approved study
(or a combination) cannot be required to simultaneously undertake any
Job Search or meet any other additional requirements. As such, they do
not need to remain connected with a provider and can be suspended or
exited from the provider's caseload.

Job seekers aged 55 years and over who are meeting their full-time
mutual obligation requirements through 30 hours per fortnight of paid
work (including self-employment) or approved Voluntary Work (or a
combination) cannot be required to:

-   simultaneously look for additional work
-   undertake other requirements

However, they must remain connected with an Employment Services Provider
(although they are suspended on a provider's caseload). They must attend
any notified Appointments, however provider Appointments should only be
related to employment opportunities or job referrals.

Suitable work

Job seekers must actively look for work and be prepared to accept any
offer of suitable work in a variety of fields. 'Suitable work' includes
any work that a job seeker is capable of doing, not just work the job
seeker prefers to do or is specifically qualified for. The work can be
casual or permanent and Part-Time or Full-Time work (depending on the
job seeker's assessed capacity).

Any work can be considered suitable provided it meets certain safeguards
set out in Social Security Law, such as minimum statutory conditions and
related health and safety considerations. Job seekers are therefore
required to accept suitable work that may not be their first preference
while they continue to look for work that better matches their
qualifications, expertise and interest.

The applicable statutory conditions are:

-   if the work would be covered by the Australian Fair Pay and
    Conditions Standard, the minimum terms and conditions for the work
    under that Standard
-   if the work would also be covered by a transitional award - the
    minimum terms and conditions for the work under the transitional
    award, so far as the terms and conditions relate to rates of pay and
    casual loadings, or
-   if the work would not be covered by the Australian Fair Pay and
    Conditions Standard, the minimum terms and conditions for the work
    under the relevant state or territory agreement or award

Unsuitable Work

Work will be Unsuitable if it:

aggravates a job seeker's medical illness, disability or injury

is above the job seeker's assessed work capacity within the next two
years with intervention

does not meet the applicable statutory conditions of work

requires the person to change their place of residence where they are
unwilling to move

involves unreasonable commuting time from home to work (more than 60
minutes one way for PCPs and job seekers with an assessed PCW and more
than 90 minutes one way for other job seekers)

involves skills the job seeker does not possess and appropriate training
will not be provided by the Employer

contradicts the moral, cultural or religious beliefs of the jobseeker

requires the person to get a vaccination to commence or continue the
employment and the individual:

-   is not vaccinated, and
-   does not wish to be vaccinated, or is unable to be vaccinated.
    This includes where vaccination is a requirement under applicable
    state or territory jurisdictional public health orders or directions

involves more than 15 hours per week and the job seeker:

-   has an assessed partial capacity to work, or
-   is a Principal Carer Parent

Where job seekers are undertaking education or training as an approved
requirement, the job seeker is only required to accept a job that does
not conflict with the timing of that education or training.

Unsuitable Work for Principal Carer Parents (PCP)

Principal Carer Parents (PCP) cannot be required to accept employment of
more than 15 hours a week. Additionally, consideration should be given
to whether:

-   the PCP has access to appropriate care and supervision for their
    Child/Children during the times when the PCP would be required to
    work
-   the location of either the workplace or the child care facility
    would make the total travel time to and from work unreasonable
-   the PCP will be financially better off as a result of undertaking
    the work (refer to the Financial Suitability Test)

Work will be unsuitable for PCPs if they do not have access to
appropriate care and supervision for their children at the times when
they would be required to work.

Accordingly, where a job offer would involve employment outside school
hours or on school holidays, a job is generally considered suitable if
there is appropriate care and supervision for a child during the hours
of work, including the time it would take the PCP to travel to and from
work. Appropriate care and supervision means:

-   child care provided by an approved child care service (within the
    meaning of the Family Assistance Administration Act 1999)
-   any other care or supervision arrangements that the parent deems
    suitable
-   where the child is attending school

Unsuitable work for job seekers with a Partial Capacity to Work (PCW)

Job seekers with an assessed PCW cannot be required to accept employment
that involves working more than 15 hours a week.

Additionally, work will be unsuitable for job seekers with an assessed
PCW if:

-   it does not provide appropriate support or facilities to take
    account of the illness, disability or injury
-   the total cost of participating in employment means that the job
    seeker would be financially worse off as a result of undertaking the
    work. Examples include personal care requirements incurred by the
    job seeker to get ready for work or while on the job, disability
    aids required for participation in the job that are not covered by
    the Employer and the cost of travel to and from the job by the job
    seeker's normal means of transport
