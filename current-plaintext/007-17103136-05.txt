|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Peggy lodges a Child Care Subsidy |
|                                   | claim for child Josh. Josh is     |
|                                   | coded as in Peggy’s Care on the   |
|                                   | CHC screen, however a care        |
|                                   | percentage has not been recorded  |
|                                   | for Peggy or Peggy's partner Bart |
|                                   | on the FSC screen.                |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A blank or null percentage is     |
|                                   | treated as 100% by the system.    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This means that Child Care        |
|                                   | Subsidy is granted because Peggy  |
|                                   | has Josh coded In Customer Care.  |

|                                   | Care on the CHC screen for Martin |
|                                   | and partner, Sally.               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A care percentage of 0% has been  |
|                                   | recorded on the FSC screen for    |
|                                   | Martin and no care percentage     |
|                                   | (blank) has been recoded for      |

|                                   | Child Care Subsidy will grant     |
|                                   | because Sally has In Customer     |
|                                   | Care recorded and no percentage   |
|                                   | (Blank coding is treated as       |
|                                   | 100%).                            |

|                                   | This ensures that when the claim  |
|                                   | is allocated next time, it will   |
|                                   | go to a Service Officer skilled   |
|                                   | in processing both claims.        |
