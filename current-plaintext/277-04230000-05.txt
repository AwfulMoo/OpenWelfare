| 1                                 | How does Child Support treat      |
|                                   | unallocated NAPs when the         |
|                                   | assessment ends, the roles        |
|                                   | reverse, the case is suspended    |
|                                   | due to reconciliation or the      |
|                                   | parents move into private         |
|                                   | collection?                       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If an enforceable maintenance     |
|                                   | liability or assessment ends with |
|                                   | unallocated non agency payments,  |
|                                   | these amounts must disregarded.   |
|                                   | An unallocated amount paid within |
|                                   | one child support enforcement     |
|                                   | period cannot be applied to       |
|                                   | future amounts that become        |
|                                   | payable in a different child      |
|                                   | support enforcement period.       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | For example, unallocated non      |
|                                   | agency payments cannot be carried |
|                                   | over if:                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   parent/s elect to end         |
|                                   |     collection and later make an  |
|                                   |     application to resume         |
|                                   |     collection                    |
|                                   | -   a parent moves to a           |
|                                   |     non-reciprocating             |
|                                   |     jurisdiction and later        |
|                                   |     returns to Australia or a     |
|                                   |     reciprocating jurisdiction,   |
|                                   |     or                            |
|                                   | -   parents separate again after  |
|                                   |     a period of reconciliation    |

|                                   | Unallocated non agency payments   |
|                                   | cannot be carried over where      |
|                                   | there is a change in              |
|                                   | circumstances (e.g. change in     |
|                                   | care or income) which creates a   |
|                                   | role reversal. If a subsequent    |
|                                   | role reversal occurs and a parent |
|                                   | returns to their previous role,   |
|                                   | an earlier unallocated amount     |
|                                   | cannot be credited towards the    |
|                                   | new liability because it is       |
|                                   | associated with a different child |
|                                   | support enforcement period.       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If a payee elects to move to a    |
|                                   | private collect arrangement, the  |
|                                   | payer and payee will have the     |
|                                   | option of delaying opting out of  |
|                                   | collection until no credit        |
|                                   | remains.                          |

| 2                                 | How to treat unallocated          |
|                                   | Prescribed NAPS when an           |
|                                   | assessment has ended with arrears |
|                                   | and parent is still regularly     |
|                                   | making payments towards arrears?  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | In an ended case, Prescribed NAP  |
|                                   | amounts can still be credited     |
|                                   | towards the liability that arose  |
|                                   | after the Prescribed NAP was      |
|                                   | notified to the agency.           |
|                                   | Prescribed NAPs that were not     |
|                                   | previously credited for any       |
|                                   | period between the date of        |
|                                   | notification and the case ending  |
|                                   | can be credited provided that the |
|                                   | payer makes catch up payments to  |
|                                   | meet 70% of the liability and the |
|                                   | criteria for crediting a          |
|                                   | Prescribed NAP is met.            |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 3                                 | Can NAPs be credited for a future |
|                                   | liability?                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Yes. When an amount is accepted   |
|                                   | as a NAP against an enforceable   |
|                                   | maintenance liability, it will be |
|                                   | allocated against any current and |
|                                   | future amounts payable. An        |
|                                   | intention to credit against       |
|                                   | future liabilities is not         |
|                                   | required.                         |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 4                                 | Can money that the payer pays to  |
|                                   | the child be treated as a NAP?    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | No. Child Support can only credit |
|                                   | amounts paid to the payee, or     |
|                                   | payments made to a third party to |
|                                   | satisfy a debt of either or both  |
|                                   | parents. Therefore, Child Support |
|                                   | could only credit an amount that  |
|                                   | the payer paid to the child if it |
|                                   | was in repayment of a debt the    |
|                                   | payer or payee owed to the child. |
|                                   | Also both parents would have to   |
|                                   | have intended that this be        |
|                                   | counted as child support.         |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 5                                 | Can a payer in a private collect  |
|                                   | case allow for payments that      |
|                                   | resemble prescribed NAPs when     |
|                                   | paying the payee (in other words  |
|                                   | pay the payee 70% of the monthly  |
|                                   | liability)?                       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Yes. See Applications for child   |

| 6                                 | What if the payee claims to have  |
|                                   | been coerced into agreeing to the |
|                                   | NAP?                              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Any type of NAP can be refused    |
|                                   | under section 71D if a decision   |
|                                   | has not yet been made.            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If a customer says they were      |
|                                   | coerced into making a false       |
|                                   | statement to Child Support,       |
|                                   | gather as much evidence as        |
|                                   | possible. If it seems likely that |
|                                   | coercion was involved, refuse the |
|                                   | NAP. This decision must be made   |
|                                   | by a SO4 or above. If the NAP has |
|                                   | already been accepted, suggest    |
|                                   | the customer lodge an objection.  |

| 7                                 | If a NAP is disallowed under S71A |
|                                   | can the payer object to the       |
|                                   | decision and ask for the NAP to   |
|                                   | be considered under S71C?         |

|                                   | time. If an objection to the NAP  |

|                                   | can then ask for the NAP to be    |
