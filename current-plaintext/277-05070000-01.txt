Child Support Stage 1 court orders

Child Support can register and collect a child maintenance, spousal
maintenance or de facto maintenance entitlement arising from a court
order or a court-registered agreement. These are commonly referred to as
‘stage 1 cases’.

Stage 1 court orders can be made under the Family Law Act 1975, the
Family Court Act 1997 (WA), the Matrimonial Causes Act 1959 or another
law of an Australian State or Territory.
