This document explains End of Year (EOY) processing for ABSTUDY
students.

EOY processing

EOY processing is a streamlined process for low risk ABSTUDY students to
move from one year of study to the next without interruption to their
entitlements. Their study and living circumstances will be automatically
updated for the following year.

This will apply to:

-   secondary students completing Year 11 or below
-   secondary boarding students
-   tertiary students undertaking a course of more than one year
    duration

These students may not:

-   receive an annual review letter
-   need to confirm or update their intended study and living
    circumstances

EOY process is independent of the end of course reviews (for students
whose study is recorded as finishing that year).

Automatic update letters

When updated automatically, students will receive a letter. It will
advise of the study and living circumstances that Services Australia
will use to base their entitlement on in the following year.

Customers can contact if their details are incorrect, or they have
changes.

Reviews and Manual Follow-ups

ABSTUDY Smart Centres will manage all reviews and Manual Follow-ups
(MFUs) that require a manual update to customer records.

The Resources page contains a table listing the various EOY categories
of ABSTUDY (and PES) students and the EOY processing criteria which
applies to each student category.
