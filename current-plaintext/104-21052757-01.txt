This document outlines the processes for escalating incidents to other

Escalating customer aggression incidents

When an incident involves the health and safety of staff or customers,
managing the incident takes priority over escalating it.

The Services Australia Operations Centre (Ops Centre), as part of the
Operational Response Branch, coordinates and oversees responses to
escalated incidents and business disruptions. Services Australia staff
are responsible for informing the Ops Centre about escalated incidents.

The National Manager of the area where the incident was reported will
escalate the situation to the Ops Centre. The Ops Centre will then
determine if it is necessary to escalate to the Chief Executive Officer,
Executive, or Minister’s office. This makes sure that all relevant
stakeholders find out about serious staff and customer incidents.
