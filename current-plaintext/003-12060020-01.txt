This is a Family and Domestic Violence Interaction Point. If the
customer is with another person, on speaker phone, or already identified
with family and domestic violence concerns, continue with the current
business conversation. Otherwise, go to the Family and domestic violence
procedure to conduct the risk identification and referral process.

If a child is in immediate danger or risk of harm you must act, and a
delegate must call 000.

This document explains the role Services Australia social workers have
in assessing care situations for Carer Payment (CP) and Carer Allowance
(CA) claims.

Child safe framework

Services Australia has a zero tolerance approach to child abuse.

A staff member must act when they see or hear behaviour, which raises
concern about a child or young person’s safety. Follow the agency's Risk
Identification and Reporting model when identifying and responding to
child safety concerns. See Risk identification and management of threats
to the safety or welfare of a child.

Social worker assessment

Social workers provide information that contributes to decisions about
qualification. They do not make the final decision about qualification.
Service Officers need to determine basic payment qualification before
making a Social Work referral. Social workers provide help in
determining CP/CA claims by:

Referrals undertaken by social workers in the Carer Specialist
Assessment Team (CSAT)

-   Carer Specialist assessments completed by the Carer Specialist
    Assessment Team (CSAT) for child care receivers
-   Child Terminal Reviews
-   Carer Adjustment Payments

Referrals undertaken by social workers in service and smart centres

Carers under the age of 18. A social work assessment must be completed
before finalising a claim for CP and/or CA

Care receiver at risk

Carers 80 years of age or older

Multiple and complex needs (following Service Officer investigation)
could include:

-   Multiple carers
-   Capacity to care
-   Disputed care
-   Complex care situations requiring a professional assessment

Complex grief and bereavement, including if the care receiver has passed
away before the claim is finalised and the Service Officer identifies a
need for social work support

Social worker help in determining claims

A social worker can provide information to help a delegate in making a
decision about qualification for Carer Payment (CP) or Carer Allowance
(CA). Information that a social worker can provide includes:

-   if the carer can and does, provide the care receiver with the
    constant care needed
-   the care receiver's personal care or supervision needs in the home
-   the level of care or supervision actually being provided by the
    carer
-   if the carer has the physical and/or emotional capacity to deal with
    the care receiver's care needs

Information provided by a social worker can contribute to a decision
about qualification for CA/CP, but the delegate, not the social worker,
must make the decision about qualification. CA/CP should not be rejected
or cancelled where conflicting information has been provided without
contacting the carer and/or Treating Health Professional (THP).

Note: the delegate should update the carer's record to include the
outcome/ recommendation of the social worker assessment.

A Social Work Report is needed for:

-   CSAT assessments for child care receivers
-   Child Terminal Reviews
-   Under 18 Carers
-   Adverse recommendations made by a social worker
-   Other complex circumstances

The Resources page has a template for social work assessment for CP and
CA and an attachment outlining how to attach social work reports to a
customer's record.

-   If a report is not written, social workers must make sure that
    documents on the customers’ record provides clear and sufficient
    information to help the Service Officer in making a decision
-   If it is not clear a social work report is needed, consult a Social
    Work Support Manager or a social worker in CSAT for guidance

Social worker help in carer neglect tip-off reviews

If social worker help is needed in investigating a tip off. It is
important to remember the information received via the tip-off is an
allegation only and the details of the tip-off is not to be shared with
either the carer and/or care receiver. If either the carer or the care
receiver queries the purpose of the contact, tell them a review is being
conducted.

The referral to the social worker should include clear details of the
reason(s) a social worker assessment is needed. If the referral is
unclear, the social worker should contact the referring officer. If the
need for the referral remains unclear, the social worker should contact
the Carers Level 2 Policy Help Desk via the Online Query Form for help.
The Resources page has a link to the Level 2 Service Desks - Online
Query Form.

Any entitlement issues raised during the contact, which are outside of
the investigation, should be included in the social worker’s report.

The Resources page has a template for social work assessment for CP and
CA, an attachment outlining how to attach social work reports to a
customer's record and links to Family and domestic violence referral
services.
