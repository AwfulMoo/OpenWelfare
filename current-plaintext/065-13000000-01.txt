This document outlines the Aged Care program and information about the
Aged Care Programmes Branch.

Government intent

The Aged Care program is a national program governed by Aged Care
legislation. It helps aged care providers deliver cost effective,
quality care for eligible Australians, and support for their carers
through the payment of subsidies and supplements.

The Department of Health and Aged Care administers policy under the
legislation while Services Australia manages payments to approved aged
care providers.

See the Resources page for a link to Services Australia’s Annual
reports. These reports have information and data about the:

-   number of aged care provider claims the agency processed, and
-   financial amounts paid to providers for each financial year

Aged Care Programs

There are 3 main types of Aged Care programs:

Residential Care

Provides care recipients with either permanent and/or respite care.
Residential aged care services were once known as nursing homes or
hostels.

Home Care Packages

Provides a range of aged care services delivered in the community, to
support care recipients to live independently in their own home for as
long as possible.

Flexible Care:

-   Transition Care - provides short-term, support and active management
    for care recipients after a hospital stay for up to 12 weeks, which
    can be extended up to 18 weeks. It allows care recipients to return
    home rather than prematurely enter residential care
-   Short Term Restorative Care - provides services to care recipients
    for up to 8 weeks to help them delay or avoid long-term care. It may
    be delivered in a home setting, a residential setting, or a
    combination of both

See New, combine, sales, closure and transfer processes for aged care
services for information on how to:

-   set up new,
-   transfer,
-   combine or close aged care services with Services Australia

Aged Care Programmes Branch

The Aged Care Programmes Branch is responsible for:

-   payment of subsidies to approved aged care providers who provide
    care to care recipients
-   services to approved aged care providers and their administration
    staff, Aged Care Assessment Teams (ACATS), Department of Health and
    Aged Care, Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) and software
    vendors

intranet page for more detail on the branch’s sections and
responsibilities.

Aged Care Provider Portal (ACPP) and Provider Digital Access (PRODA)

All Aged care services can use the Aged Care Provider Portal (ACPP) to
perform secure online transactions with Services Australia. The ACPP was
successfully deployed in November 2020. This resulted in all aged care
service providers moving to a single, streamlined digital claims process
for all care types. To access the ACPP, providers must have a Provider
Digital Access (PRODA) account, which allows secure access to government
online services.

Aged Care Entry Record

Aged care services can use the Aged Care Entry Record to advise whenever
a care recipient:

-   has entered into residential care, or
-   commenced receiving a Home Care Package on or after 1 July 2014

This record:

is required under Section 63-1 of the Aged Care Act, 1997

is the catalyst to allow income and/or asset testing processes through
the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) and Centrelink to commence for
those care recipients entering either:

-   a permanent residential aged care service, or
-   a home care service

is the means by which information for all permanent residential care and
home care types is passed back to MyAgedCare. This ensures that the
information held on care recipients in that database reflects their
current status

does not generate any funding in itself, but it does supply information
that is used to determine the eligibility of an approved provider in
respect of additional subsidy such as concessional resident supplement
and/or pensioner supplement

Compliance and Complaints

The Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission is the national regulator of
aged care services. They:

-   accredit, assess, and monitor aged care services subsidised by the
    Australian Government,
-   conduct home care investigations and determine provider compliance
    including whether any requirements or sanctions need to be imposed
-   manage complaints about aged care service provider’s
    responsibilities under the Aged Care Act 1997 or under the
    provider’s funding agreement with the Commonwealth
