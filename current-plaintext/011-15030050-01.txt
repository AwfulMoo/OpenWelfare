This document outlines the purpose of a Medicare history statement and
how one is requested for the purposes of Medicare Compensation Recovery.

Medicare history statement request

A Medicare history statement request is made to obtain a copy of a
person's Medicare services history from the date of injury to the date
of statement issue, so that they can indicate which services relate to
their compensation claim.

The request is processed in the Compensation Case Management System
(CCMS) and will result in the issue of a notice to claimant. This is the
first step to generate a notice of past benefits or notice of charge.

A Medicare history statement request can be submitted by:

-   Injured person, claimant or their legal representative (e.g. power
    of attorney, legal guardian)
-   Injured person's authorised third party
-   Compensation payer or insurer, or their delegate or agent
-   Notifiable person

The request must include a valid signature.

Note: an agent or administrator is another business, such as another
insurer or solicitor, who has been contracted to handle the claim e.g. a
state Worker's Compensation authority contracting work to an insurer.

A Medicare history statement can be requested before or after settlement
of the case. A request can be made:

-   In writing, and
-   On a current Medicare history statement request (MO026) form

Notice to claimant

In reply to the Medicare history statement request, a notice is sent to
the claimant.

This includes the following documents and forms which the claimant
completes and returns within 28 days:

Medicare history statement - to advise which services relate to their
injury or illness

Declaration - to advise:

-   that the identified services on the Medicare history statement are
    correct
-   if any care costs were received in relation to the injury or illness

A notice to claimant is issued in response to a request for any of the
following:

-   Medicare history statement
-   Notice of past benefits
-   Notice of charge

Do not issue the notice of claimant where the 33D due date has passed in
advance payment cases.

A notice to claimant can be issued more than once for the same
compensation case. Any subsequent notice to claimant will include
previously verified services (ticked items) on the Medicare history
statement. A copy of an existing Medicare history statement may also be
requested.

From 29 November 2021 assess subsequent requests for a Medicare history
statement for evidence of:

-   judgment or settlement
-   reimbursement arrangement
-   money received, or
-   exceptional circumstances

Unless there is evidence of the above, do not issue the notice to
claimant. Follow the steps in Table 5 on the Process page in Assess
Medicare Compensation Recovery correspondence.

When accepting a completed Medicare history statement and Declaration,
the claim must be assessed as substantially correct.

The Resources page contains links to approved forms on the Services
Australia website.
