| 1                                 | Couple – Reverse Mortgage + Read  |
|                                   | more ...                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A couple owned their principal    |
|                                   | home valued at $600,000. They     |
|                                   | took out a Reverse Mortgage and   |
|                                   | received a lump sum payment of    |
|                                   | $335,000.                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | They used $335,000 to build a     |
|                                   | Granny flat in their child's      |
|                                   | yard.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | When they move out of their       |
|                                   | former principal home, it becomes |
|                                   | an assessable asset valued at     |
|                                   | $265,000. ($600,000 - $335,000) = |
|                                   | $265,000.                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | They then rent their former       |
|                                   | principal home out. The rent they |
|                                   | received is income.               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | They have paid more than the      |
|                                   | Extra Allowable Amount ($210,500  |
|                                   | as at 1 July 2019) as the Entry   |
|                                   | Contribution for the Granny Flat, |
|                                   | so they will be assessed as       |
|                                   | homeowners. They are not eligible |
|                                   | for Rent Assistance.              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The Reverse Mortgage is assessed  |
|                                   | under the Home Equity Conversion  |
|                                   | (HEC) rules because the property  |
|                                   | mortgaged was their principal     |
|                                   | home at the time of the           |
|                                   | transaction. The $335,000 is not  |
|                                   | assessed as income. The first     |
|                                   | $40,000 received is exempt from   |
|                                   | the asset test for 90 days.       |

|                                   | Mortgage + Read more ...          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A single pensioner accessed       |
|                                   | $200,000 through a Reverse        |
|                                   | Mortgage against their principal  |
|                                   | home. The pensioner remained in   |
|                                   | the principal home and used the   |
|                                   | $200,000 to purchase shares.      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The full asset value of the       |
|                                   | shares is therefore assessable    |
|                                   | because the liability is secured  |
|                                   | against the principal home, not   |
|                                   | the shares.                       |
