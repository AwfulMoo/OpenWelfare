This document outlines information on Defence Housing Authority (DHA)
interventions which detect customers, their partners and their
dependants who may be incorrectly receiving Centrelink payments whilst
living at a DHA residence.

DHA matching

The Defence Housing Authority (DHA) matching compares DHA residence data
with Services Australia records.

The aim of these interventions is to detect instances where a customer:

-   is receiving an incorrect payment of Rent Assistance
-   who is claiming a payment on the basis of being single, is in fact
    living as the partner of a serving member of the Defence Force
-   has not declared the correct amount of income from employment with
    the Department of Defence
-   is receiving an Independent/Homeless/Away from Home rate and they
    are a dependant of a Defence Force member
-   has made a false statement about their circumstances
-   is claiming rates of payment in excess of their correct entitlement

Multiple DHA interventions

When there is more than one outstanding intervention on the customer's
record a decision is required to decide which intervention to undertake.
Compliance Officers should ensure that correct procedures for
prioritising interventions are followed.

The Resources page contains information about the 'Use of data matching
in Commonwealth Administration Guidelines' and a link to the Privacy
Guides.
