Recording JobKeeper Payment for Employees

Staff must find out the gross income earned by the customer, or their
partner, including any payments made under JobKeeper Payment.

The assessment rules to follow will depend on if the period of JobKeeper
Payment was paid before or after 7 December 2020, or paid as back pay.

Before 7 December 2020

-   Apportion the JobKeeper Payment income at a daily rate for the
    number of days the Reporting Period crosses over with the JobKeeper
    fortnight
-   Divide the relevant tier of JobKeeper Payment by 14 days to get a
    daily amount
-   Multiply the daily rate by the number of days of the JobKeeper
    Payment fortnight in the Centrelink reporting period
-   Add this income together with any employment income earned in the
    Reporting Period on the days before the fortnight that was only
    JobKeeper Payment income to find out the gross income
-   Use this method if the rate of JobKeeper Payment reduces in the
    reporting period that is, 28 September 2020 or 4 January 2021. Use
    the above calculation for each of the different JobKeeper Payment
    fortnights to come to the total amount for the reporting period

|                                   |     relevant to each day in the   |

|                                   | For example:                      |

|                                   | In this case, the customer should |

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

After 7 December 2020

The assessment of JobKeeper income is based on the relevant payslip
periods advised by the customer's employer and not the ATO fortnights.

-   Record the gross income paid to the customer/partner in the
    entitlement period
-   Record the actual hours the customer or partner has worked in the
    entitlement period. If no hours worked, record '0' (zero) hours
-   With the exception of the first and last periods of JobKeeper
    Payment income, customers will be reporting a minimum amount of
    income per fortnightly reporting period. For example, $650 or $1,000
    if their only income from their employer is from JobKeeper Payment
-   In some cases it may be apparent that a person has been underpaid
    their JobKeeper Payment. In this situation, apply these instructions
    to the gross amount paid rather than the amount they should have
    received. Note: JobKeeper Payment income should not be recorded as
    ongoing earnings as this may result in an underpayment to the
    customer if the JobKeeper Payment reduces or stops

Record any other earnings paid from non-JobKeeper employers separately
as employment income in the entitlement period.

Back pay of JobKeeper Payment

Back pay of JobKeeper received after 7 December 2020

Back pay of JobKeeper Payment, received after 7 December 2020, is
treated as a remunerative lump sum (see Treatment of lump sums).

Back pay of JobKeeper received before 7 December 2020

Back pay of JobKeeper Payment received before 7 December 2020 is treated
as a remunerative lump sum (see Treatment of lump sums) unless the
person had present legal entitlement for the period the back pay was
received for.

A customer would not have had present legal entitlement for back pay if
their employer had not yet applied for JobKeeper Payment at the time the
back pay relates to, or where the customer was not aware that their
employer had applied for JobKeeper for them.
For example, no present legal entitlement can be had for the first
period of JobKeeper Payment (30 March 2020-12 April 2020) due to there
being a delay between the announcement of the scheme and employers
claiming and then paying JobKeeper payments to their employees.

Back pay received prior to 7 December 2020, where the person had present
legal entitlement for the full period the back pay was received for:

The back pay is assessed as employment income and recorded in the
period(s) that the back pay was paid for, see Before 7 December 2020
instructions above

See Recording and correcting employment income details for instructions
on:

-   correcting the employment income already recorded for a period
-   how to record income for a period where no prior income exists

Back pay received prior to 7 December 2020, where the person did not
have present legal entitlement for the period the back pay was received
for (or it is not clear if the person did):

-   The back pay is assessed as a remunerative lump sum and is recorded
    from the date the person becomes legally entitled to receive the
    payment
-   The lump sum is assessed over a 52 week period from the date it’s
    recorded as having been received or able to be received
-   See Treatment of lump sums for instructions on how to record the
    back pay

Back pay received prior to 7 December 2020, where the person had present
legal entitlement for part of the back pay received:

-   The amounts should be separated into the portion where present legal
    entitlement existed and where it didn’t
-   Each amount should be treated as per the above based on whether
    present legal entitlement did or didn’t exist

JobKeeper Payment Fortnights

If a customer received JobKeeper Payment income, it will be for the full
14 day period (i.e. the JobKeeper Payment Fortnight determined by the
Australian Taxation Office (ATO)) it relates to as defined below.

Recording JobKeeper Payment for Self-Employed Customers

Customers who are self-employed and receive JobKeeper Payment through
their sole trader or partnership business will only need to advise of a
change of circumstances if there will be a change to the overall profit
of the business when compared to details currently recorded as JobKeeper
Payment will be included as business income.

JobKeeper Payment for Farm Household Allowance (FHA) Customers

If an FHA customer is an employee or a contractor for a business that is
not directly related to their Farm Enterprise, staff must assess
JobKeeper Payment income as Non-Farm Business Income. Per existing
arrangements, Non-Farm Business Income can be used to reduce any farm
business losses.

If an FHA customer is a contractor for a business that is directly
related to their farming enterprise or they are a sole trader, member of
a partnership or through a private trust or company, the JobKeeper
Payment will be assessed within the business income and a new estimate
via the phone or Profit & Loss will be required. See Assessing income
and assets for Farm Household Allowance (FHA).
