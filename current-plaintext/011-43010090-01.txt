This document outlines information on how to process a patient claim
that has a Provider charge that exceeds $9,999.99.

On this Page:

Processing Provider charges that exceed $9,999.99

Due to insufficient space in the Charge: field in mainframe, the
Medicare system does not allow an amount greater than $9,999.99 to be
accepted. If Service Officers key a higher amount the system returns the
message 1-INV CHG.

Where there is:

Only one item number on the account, see the Process page for procedure

More than one item number on the account, for in hospital claims see the
Process page for procedure

More than one item number on the account, for outpatient claims

-   Face-to-Face Service Officers must escalate via Multi-Function
    Device (MFD) listing, see Manage Health Services Scanning
-   Health Service Delivery (HSD) Entry Service Officers must
    re-categorise
-   HSD Experienced / Established Service Officers see the Process page
    for Procedure

Where multiple services are performed on the same day, by the same
provider, the multiple operation rule or Diagnostic Imaging Multiple
Service Rule (DIMSR) may apply.

For more information refer to:

-   Multiple operations assessing rules in Medicare, or
-   Diagnostic imaging assessment rules in Medicare

For surgical item numbers, the account may have individual charges for
each item number. The schedule fee for each surgical item number is
calculated according to the multiple operation rule. The resulting fees
are totalled and used to calculate the benefit amount. The benefit
calculated and the total charge are written to the patient history
against the item number with the highest schedule fee.

Note: Service Officers must ensure that when processing these claims any
subsequent service lines entered must show a charge equivalent to, or
higher than, the schedule fee for each item number. This avoids an
underpayment being made. Service Officers should check for CHG LOW
return message.

Safety Net

This applies for out of hospital services only.

Where an out-of-hospital claim exceeds $9,999.99, Service Officers must
confirm the Medicare Safety Net before processing or escalating the
claim.

Where a provider has charged over $9,999.99, the system will only
calculate the Safety Net benefit up to $9,999.00.

-   Face-to-Face Service Officers must escalate via MFD listing. See the
    Resources page in
    Manage Health Services Scanning
-   Health Service Delivery (HSD) Entry Service Officers must raise the
    Proficiency to Established/Experienced
-   HSD Experienced / Established Service Officers, see the Process page
    for Procedure

Health Service Delivery Experienced Service Officers are required to
manually calculate the Safety Net benefit for the portion of the charge
greater than $9,999.00 that is the amount keyed in the service line
(0000). A manual Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) payment is to be issued
for any difference between the system generated benefit and the manually
calculated Safety Net amount

Benefits team and a link to the Z2261 – Your statement of Medicare
Benefits letter.
