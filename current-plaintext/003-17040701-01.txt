This document outlines alternative assistance options staff discuss with
customers requesting immediate payment. This must be offered before

denied.

Decisions about immediate payments

Customers can request immediate payment when experiencing severe
financial hardship.

Eligibility for Crisis Payment (CrP)

When to offer alternative assistance

Offer alternative assistance to the customer:

when they first apply for an urgent payment, before any decision is
made. As part of the process, remember that:

-   customers can generally access only 2 urgent payments due to
    exceptional and unforeseen circumstances in 12 months
-   an urgent payment (of any type) may put the customer in further
    financial hardship on their next payday due to the reduced funds

after the decision is made that they are not eligible for an urgent
payment and their request is denied

The Resources page contains a link to the Payment and Service Finder,
contact details for social worker referrals and a link to the Transport
for New South Wales, Transport for Aboriginal communities website.
