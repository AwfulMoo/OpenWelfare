Carer Adjustment Payment (SS454) claim form

The CAP claim form is used by:

-   Services Australia to ensure families are offered all payments and
    services they may be entitled to
-   Department of Social Services (DSS) to determine eligibility and the
    amount to be paid

Advise eligibility criteria but do not discourage carers from claiming.
If there is any doubt, a CAP claim form should be lodged.

The form contains a number of Stop questions that prompt the carer to
call Services Australia.
