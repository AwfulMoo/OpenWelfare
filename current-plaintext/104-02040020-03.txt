|                                   | A vulnerable customer is someone  |
|                                   | who, due to their personal        |
|                                   | circumstances, is especially      |
|                                   | susceptible to disadvantage.      |
|                                   | Complaints are prioritised based  |
|                                   | on the customer's circumstances.  |
|                                   | A high priority issue is when the |
|                                   | customer is at risk or vulnerable |
|                                   | or the impact on the customer is  |
|                                   | significant.                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the complaint does not meet an |
|                                   | escalation reason, the complaint  |
|                                   | is managed at the first point of  |
|                                   | contact. High priority complaints |
|                                   | are managed with urgency or as    |
|                                   | immediately as possible.          |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | to a complainant if they are      |

|                                   | appropriate to consult with or    |
|                                   | refer the customer to specialised |
