This document outlines the process for the External Complaints - Child
Support (ExCCS) team to manage complaints made by Parliamentarians and
their staff on behalf of constituents.

Parliamentarian complaints to ExCCS

Complaints can be received from the electorate office on behalf of their
constituents via:

-   email in the ExCCS - APH mailbox, or
-   phone on the Child Support Parliamentarian Advice Line (CSPAL)

The ExCCS mailbox is a centralised allocation mailbox where all ExCCS
incoming work is sent.

The CSPAL is answered by ExCCS Service Officers.

Parliamentarians and their staff making representations on behalf of
their constituent are automatically deemed a representative with
ordinary authority.

Occasionally a Parliamentarian emails an ExCCS Service Officer directly
with a new complaint. If this occurs the officer must forward the email
directly to the APH mailbox for allocation by the ExCCS Program Support
Officer.

For customers who write directly to a Minister or the Prime Minister, or
when a Parliamentarian writes to the Minister on behalf of a
constituent, see Ministerial complaints regarding Child Support
customers.

Responding to Parliamentarian complaints

Contact must be made with the electorate office to acknowledge receipt
of the complaint within 48 hours of being received by the ExCCS team.

There is a 14 day timeframe for resolving Parliamentarian complaints
from the date of receipt. All complaints must be treated with urgency
and resolved as soon as possible

Providing feedback to the business

Compliments and complaints provide the agency with a valuable source of
information to:

-   assess performance
-   identify systemic issues
-   assist in the training, development and support of staff
-   provide written feedback on all staff compliments and upheld and
    partially upheld complaints using the Staff Feedback Tool

The Resources page contains links to macros and Intranet pages to manage
external complaints, guides to preparing written responses and Child
Support forms and facts sheets.
