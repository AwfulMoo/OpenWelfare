section 150F, Care suspension period

The following sections of the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 (the
Act) revoke the previous care percentage:

-   section 54F, revokes existing care where the new care percentage
    will affect the cost percentage
-   section 54G, revokes existing care in Below Regular care decisions.
    Defines Below Regular care retrospective powers
-   section 54H, revokes existing care where the new care percentage
    will not affect the cost percentage

Note: Sections 54FA and 54HA suspend, rather than revoke, the previous
actual care determination for the first change of care during the
maximum interim period. Subsequent changes of care within the maximum
interim period are subject to sections 54F and 54H.

All new care decisions are then made under one of the following two
sections of the Act:

-   section 49, the person’s care percentage is 0%

or

-   section 50, the person’s care percentage is anything other than 0%,
    that is 1% - 100%

Interim care decisions are made under the following sections of the Act:

section 51, the actual care differs from the care arrangement and the
person with reduced care is taking reasonable action to ensure the care
arrangement is complied with. Section 51 also applies to actual care in
special circumstances where a customer is withholding care due to a
substantial risk to the wellbeing of the child. Examples include:

-   withholding essential medical care from the child
-   substantially failing to comply with legal schooling requirement
-   neglecting the child’s basic needs

section 53, must also be considered when making an interim care
decision. An interim care determination cannot be made if:

-   the change in care is notified after the end of the maximum interim
    period,
-   the care percentage decision made in relation to the care
    arrangement has been revoked That is the care arrangement does not
    apply, or
-   a previous interim care determination has been made in respect of
    the care arrangement.

section 53A, sets out when interim periods start and end, including when
later interim periods begin if the person with increased care stops
taking ‘reasonable action’.

    have a pattern of care for a child (more than 0% care) (s50)

    percentage determination under section 49 or section 50 does not
    affect the cost percentage but would affect the care percentage
    (s54H)

-   the care percentage is to be determined for a period where a person
    unexpectedly gains 100% care of the child for a specific period
    (one-off block of 100% care)

    interim care determination

    100% care)
-   make a decision that the care that is actually occurring for a child
    does not comply with an existing care arrangement that applies in

    arrangement is complied with (s51)make a determination of actual
    care that is notified within the maximum interim period of an
    interim care determination

    or a pattern of care that is less than regular care (s54G). Note:
    most revocation decisions where care falls below regular care will
    actually be made under section 54F

except where:

Note: sections 54F, 54FA, 54G, 54H and 54HA apply only where a new
determination of a responsible person’s care percentage has been made
under sections 49 and 50. The decision maker must be authorised under
sections 49 and 50 to make a new care determination even where the
authorisation to revoke the existing care determination is at a lower
level.

An officer at a lower level may still carry out the preliminary steps in
making care decisions with the support of their team leader, as long as
an officer with the appropriate level of authority makes the final
decision.
