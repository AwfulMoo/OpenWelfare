This document outlines the frequency and type of reviews completed with
Income Management customers.

Purpose of a review

The purpose of a review is to ensure the customer is continuing to meet
their priority needs and those of their families.

Customers may also contact to query their Income Management, including
when Income Management is likely to end, what options are available to
exit Income Management and ask for a review of a decision relating to
Income Management.

Conducting a review or discussing a customer's Income Management is also
an opportunity to provide other assistance such as:

-   referral to a social worker - see Social Work Services
-   referral to a specialist officer - see Specialist officers and other
    internal supports for customers
-   providing information and referrals to Financial Wellbeing and
    Capability Activities
-   where to find more information to help with managing their finances.
    Customers can visit the 'Managing your money' page at
    servicesaustralia.gov.au which offers useful information and
    resources

Review cycle

A customer's priority needs are reviewed throughout the period of Income
Management to identify if there are any changes to their priority needs.
Income Management expenses are updated accordingly. These reviews take
place when:

-   a Work Item has been raised that indicates a customer's Income
    Management should be reviewed due to a change in circumstances, or
-   the customer requests a review, or
-   an Income Management referring authority requests a review

Social work reviews for VWPR customers

Customers income managed under the Vulnerable Welfare Payment Recipient
(VWPR) measure will have a review of their circumstances conducted by a
social worker as follows:

VWPR Notice:

-   at dates specified by a social worker at the time the Vulnerable
    Notice commenced
-   upon request for reconsideration by the customer
-   28 days prior to the Vulnerable Notice end date
-   when the customer moves out of an Income Management area

Automatically triggered VWPR customers:

-   when a customer has requested an exclusion from Income Management

Referring authority reviews

Reviews of Income Management are also held as appropriate between
Services Australia and Income Management referring authorities:

-   the Family Responsibilities Commission
-   a State or Territory Child Protection Authority
-   an approved referring authority for Supporting People at Risk Income
    Management

For more information about when these reviews are held and the process
to conduct these reviews, see Ongoing reviews for Cape York, Child
Protection and Supporting People at Risk Income Management.

Completing a review

When completing a review of a customer's priority needs, Service
Officers must take into account information readily available on the
customer's record (for example, accommodation details, children in care,
age of children). Service Officers should also review any voluntary
deductions (that is, Centrepay and Rent Deduction Scheme payments) when
discussing priority needs with the customer. Customers may elect to
change the voluntary deductions to Income Management expenses or
maintain/vary/cease the deductions.

Further reviews are completed for customers who volunteer, or are
referred to Income Management by an external authority or a Services
Australia social worker.
