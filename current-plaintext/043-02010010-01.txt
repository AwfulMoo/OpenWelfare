This document outlines information to assist in matching a suitable
income support payment to a customer who is self employed.

Eligibility for payment

When looking at whether a self- employed customer is eligible for
payments, consider the following circumstances regarding their self
employment:

-   A customer who is looking for work can claim JobSeeker Payment (JSP)
    or Youth Allowance (YA). It will need to be established that they
    are unemployed and willing to look for all types of suitable work
-   A customer who has had an Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) and
    assessed as having a Partial Capacity to Work or Temporary Reduced
    Work Capacity may be eligible for JSP or YA (job seeker) with
    suitable mutual obligation requirements. It will need to be
    established that the customer is unemployed while in self-employment
    and that they are able to satisfy their mutual obligation
    requirements
-   A customer who is permanently incapacitated may claim Disability
    Support Pension (DSP), or Age Pension if they are Age Pension age.
    Their assets from the business will be assessed. The income may be
    assessable as well, depending on whether the self employment has
    fully ceased or if someone else is running the business for them
-   A farmer and their partner experiencing financial hardship may be
    eligible for Farm Household Allowance (FHA) which provides financial
    assistance and support to improve their long term financial
    situation
-   A customer who is a parent or guardian will need to provide income
    and asset details for the business. These will be assessed before
    payments are made
-   If a customer just requires a Health Care Card to cover themselves
    or their family for any medication, they would need to provide
    income details for the self employment. This income would be
    assessed before the card is granted to the customer
-   If a customer needs to cease self employment as they are caring for
    someone, consider their eligibility for Carer Payment (CP) and/or
    Carer Allowance (CA)

A customer can be provided with more information about:

-   Additional agency services
-   Services available from external providers, for example, grants,
    rebates, subsidies and advice
