This document outlines the details to calculate the start day for the
Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) Scheme.

Start day

Normally, if an AIC applicant for a student who is qualified for
assistance for a year lodges their claim by 1 March in the year
following which assistance is sought, the Entitlement Start day for the
student is 1 January of that year.

Short term boarders

Short-term boarders are entitled to payments from the date they commence
to board.

Students who are not short-term boarders

For students who are not short-term boarders, the eligibility start day
is normally 1 January where the student satisfies the general
eligibility conditions for AIC, commenced the approved course on time
and, where relevant, they commence to live at the board or second home
location on time.

The eligibility start day may be a date other than 1 January if certain
circumstances apply.

Commencing studies in the first term or semester

The start date for students commencing their course in the first term of
the school year is 1 January if all eligibility conditions and
requirements were met at the start of the term or, in other cases the
later of:

-   the date the student satisfied the general eligibility conditions
    for AIC
-   the date the student commenced the approved course (if they did not
    commence study on time)
-   if students need to live away from home to undertake the approved
    study, the date the student commenced living at the board or second
    home location (if they did not commence to live away on time)
-   the date the student commenced the approved course where the student
    needs to undertake approved study from home (that is the student is
    enrolled in distance education, undertaking home schooling or other
    approved study)

Note: for students that require a home schooling/education registration
certificate or letter the start date is:

-   the registration date it advises or the date the certificate was
    issued (as appropriate), or
-   the first day of the relevant term entitlement period if the
    registration date or certificate issue date is within 14 days of the
    school start date for their state or territory

Commencing studies at a different time

Some students may not start the course at the commencement of the school
year, but have a late start to the first term or at the commencement of
another term. In those cases, the start date will be determined by
taking the later of:

-   the first day of the relevant term instalment period if they start
    that term no later than the 14th day of the commencement of the
    relevant term. The first date of the relevant term instalment period
    can also apply where the student is eligible for fortnightly AIC
    payments (that is, Second Home Allowance or is a private boarder) if
    they start that term no later than the 14th day of the commencement
    of the relevant term
-   the date they satisfy the general eligibility conditions for AIC
-   if students need to live away from home to undertake the approved
    study, the date the student commenced living at the board or second
    home location (if they did not commence to live away by the 14th day
    of the commencement of the relevant term)
-   the date the student commenced study where the student needs to
    undertake approved study from home (that is the student is enrolled
    in distance education, undertaking home schooling or other approved
    study) and they did not commence study by the 14th day of the
    commencement of the relevant term

Note: students who did not commence their course or to live away within
14 days of the commencement of the school year or the relevant term may
be granted a concession for a late start if they were prevented from
doing so by illness or other circumstances beyond the family's control
(for example, impassable roads, COVID-19 isolation or restrictions).
Their date of commencement can be backdated to 1 January or the
beginning of the relevant term (as applicable).
