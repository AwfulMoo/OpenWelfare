This document outlines how to calculate the start day for the Assistance
for Isolated Children (AIC) Scheme.

Starting studies in the first term or semester

One January is the usual entitlement start date for a student if:

-   the AIC applicant lodges their claim by 1 March in the year
    following which assistance is sought, or
-   vulnerable circumstances exist for claim backdating, and
-   both the student and applicant meet the AIC eligibility criteria for
    the year claimed.

Starting studies at a different time

Some students may not start the course at the start of the school year.
In those cases, the start date will be determined by taking the later
of:

the first day of the relevant term instalment period if they start that
term no later than the 14th day of the relevant term

the date they satisfy the general eligibility conditions for AIC

the date the student started living at the board or second home location

the date the student:

-   enrolled in distance education
-   received home schooling registration, or
-   undertook other approved study

The start date may be backdated to 1 January or the beginning of the
relevant term in some circumstances including:

-   illness of the student or a family member, or
-   circumstances beyond the family's control (for example, impassable
    roads)

Short term boarders

A short-term boarder usually needs to access a boarding facility for
less than a term due to a temporary reason.

This may be due to:

-   a medical condition
-   no transport/access to the local school due to flooding

Short-term boarders are entitled to payments from the date they begin
boarding until the day they cease to board.
