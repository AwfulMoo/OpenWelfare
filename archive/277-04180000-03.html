<p><strong>Consolidated revenue debt occurring in March 2002 (Conversion to Cuba)</strong> <a title="Read more 14" class="showhead bp03_tbl_Corrective_acti01_Step10" onclick="erefshow(this)" href="javascript:;"><span class="showhead bp03_tbl_Corrective_acti01_Step10" onclick="erefshow(this)" href="javascript:;">+</span> Read more ...</a></p>

<p>In March 2002 all Child Support records were transferred from the old mainframe system into Cuba. Due to implementation issues, payments on employer accounts that were not allocated between 13 - 15 March, were not available to allocate following conversion. These payments are referred to as conversion gap postings.</p>

<p>This resulted in Child Support having to manually create consolidated revenue debts. The payments were reassigned from the payments list to unallocated cash to enable disbursement.</p>

<p>ICT rectified the consolidated revenue debts by crediting excess cash on the 5th April. This excess cash should then have been used to pay back the consolidated revenue debt.</p>

<p>If the employer has a consolidated revenue debt that generated in March 2002, check the postings to ensure&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
all conversion gap postings occurring from 13 -15 March 2002 have been correctly credited with an excess cash posting dated 5 April 2002, and</li>
		<li>
the excess cash posting was correctly reallocated to the consolidated revenue account. This can be checked both on the Employer Account Summary window and on the Employer Top Up List window</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the excess cash was used in the reconciliation process and disbursed instead of being reallocated to clear the consolidated revenue account, it indicates cash has been used when none was available. This is the reason the consolidated revenue debt has been created.</p>

<p>If the excess cash was used in the reconciliation and reallocated, check the customer was not credited twice for February 2002 deductions. If there has been a double credit for this period, an adjustment to reduce the appropriate Reconciliation Report by the overpaid amount will be required see <a href="../separated-parents/277-04180000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Corrective_acti01_Step04">Step 4 in Table 3</a>.</p>

<p>If the excess cash was used in the reconciliation and reallocated, check the customer was not credited twice for February 2002 deductions. If there has been a double credit for this period, adjust/reduce the appropriate Reconciliation Report by the overpaid amount. This will create excess cash on the employer account that must be reallocated to clear/reduce the consolidated revenue debt. A consolidated revenue debt will create on the customer's account that is equal to the amount of adjustment on the Reconciliation Report.</p>

<p>Record a notepad on the customer's Communication window explaining how and why the consolidated revenue debt occurred.</p>

<p>If there is a consolidated revenue debt with a posting date that does not refer to the period of conversion, and the posting refers to 'Use conrev for reassignment' this indicates that a single payment has been used twice.</p>

<p>This occurs where an unallocated payment has been matched to a Reconciliation Report and disbursed - which makes the payment allocated. The same allocated payment has then been either&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
reassigned to another employer account</li>
		<li>
reassigned directly to a customer account, or</li>
		<li>
reallocated to pay Top Up</li>
		</ul>
<p>As the payment has previously been used, the system automatically uses consolidated revenue for the reassignment/reallocation. If the reassigned payment was used to credit the Top Up account, contact an SSO as the consolidated revenue posting may need to be reversed by systems to recreate the previous Top Up debt.</p>

<p>If the outstanding debt has been cleared this is the end of the process. Where a debt is still outstanding, continue to investigate and correct the debt.</p>

<p>Tell the employer the total debt amount and request payment in full every time. Do not assume that the employer cannot or will not pay in full.</p>

<p>If the employer indicates they cannot pay in full, discuss the reason and explore all possible avenues to help negotiate payment in full, including&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
using available funds on their credit card</li>
		<li>
selling assets, or</li>
		<li>
obtaining a loan from a financial institution</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the employer agrees to pay in full, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-04180000-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Recording_the_p01">Step 1 in Table 5</a>.</p>

<p><strong>2. Negotiate payment in 3 instalments</strong></p>

<p>Negotiate payment in 3 instalments, or an initial lump sum plus up to 3 instalments.</p>

<p>The repayment frequency may be weekly, fortnightly or monthly; however, the maximum repayment period is 3 months.</p>

<p>If the employer agrees to pay in 3 instalments, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-04180000-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Recording_the_p01">Table 5</a>.</p>

<p><strong>3. Negotiate an ongoing payment arrangement</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="../separated-parents/277-04180000-04.html">References</a> page contains a link to the Child Support Guide, Chapter 5.2.3 Collection from salary or wages.</p>

<p>Tell the employer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
any payment arrangement covering a period greater than 12 months will be reviewed within 12 months from the date the arrangement was made</li>
		<li>
if the employer suffers a significant change in circumstances which affects their capacity to make the agreed payments, the employer may negotiate a new arrangement</li>
		<li>
if circumstances improve significantly, the employer <strong>must</strong> contact Child Support to renegotiate the arrangement</li>
		<li>
any default in the arrangement without contacting Child Support could result in legal action</li>
		</ul>
<p>After negotiating a debt repayment, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-04180000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Recording_the_p01_Step01">Step 1 in Table 5</a>.</p>

<p>Document the details of the payment arrangement and include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
name and role of the person who negotiated the arrangement</li>
		<li>
type of arrangement&#58;</li>
		<li>
lump sum</li>
		<li>
3 instalments</li>
		<li>
lump sum plus instalments, or</li>
		<li>
ongoing instalments</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the payment arrangement includes instalments, provide details of how the payment plan was determined, including calculations.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
start date of the arrangement</li>
		<li>
frequency of instalments</li>
		<li>
amount of each payment</li>
		<li>
details of any remaining balance that may be subject to a further arrangement</li>
		<li>
total amount of payments required including the payment arrangement amounts and current deductions</li>
		<li>
consequences of non-payment discussed with the employer, and</li>
		<li>
any commitment given to remit penalties</li>
		</ul>
<p>Documentation may form evidence in any legal action. </p>

<p>Record all discussions with the employer including employer obligations and default consequences. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-04180000-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Miscellaneous_t">Resources</a> page for Employer Services documentation – Where to document.</p>

<p>Where other customers are linked to the employer, discuss with an SSO whether collection by employer withholding is the most appropriate method, or if the customer(s) should be delinked. When considering if this action is appropriate, take into account whether the employer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
is remitting current child support deductions in a timely manner and has defaulted on a payment arrangement only, or</li>
		<li>
has defaulted on a payment arrangement and is failing to remit current deductions as well</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> delinking must not occur without prior discussion with Fraud. See <a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-09110000-01.html">Report Suspected Fraud and Corruption</a>.</p>

<p>If the employer is continuing to remit current deductions for the customers, collection by employer withholding should be maintained. End the current payment arrangement and contact the employer to negotiate a new payment arrangement. Impose all penalties for failure to remit up to the current date. See <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-30010470-01.html">Penalties Cuba Process Help</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Do not continue to use</strong> Top Up in the reconciliation process if the employer is failing to remit. For information about the appropriate use of Top Up see the <a href="../separated-parents/277-04170000-01.html">Employer withholding reconciliation and top up</a>.</p>

<p>Where a decision is made to delink customer(s) from an employer and the customer is locked to a Service Officer, phone to advise that follow up action is required.</p>

<p>Advise the Service Officer to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
advise the customer that collection by employer withholding is no longer available</li>
		<li>
explain to the customer that further payment of child support will be their responsibility</li>
		<li>
apologise for any inconvenience this may cause and that there is no alternative decision that could be made</li>
		<li>
provide other alternatives to the customer for the payment of child support</li>
		</ul>
<p>Because of Top Up payments,<strong> customer(s) will not be aware</strong> that deductions have not been remitted. Do <strong>not</strong> breach the employer’s privacy by advising the customer of the reasons that lead to delinking.</p>
