		</ul>

<p>If a customer has an RNN, NOTNEC, FRNN or NRL indicator on their ATO income tax records, see <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-07010010-03.html#bp03_L2GT_Not_required_to">Australian Tax Office (ATO) income for Child Support customers - Not required to lodge</a>.</p>

<p>If a customer has an RNN indicator it does not mean their income is zero. Recording RNN incomes as zero is not best practice. Income should be derived or an income tax declaration taken. Backdating should only occur if they meet the criteria under Section 11 (special circumstances), see <a href="../separated-parents/277-17102600-01.html">Exceptions to the income date of effect rules in certain circumstances</a>.</p>

<p>When a customer lodges their tax return via a tax agent, the lodgement date and income fields will auto populate in the Client Income window.</p>

<p>The department may receive notification that a customer’s taxable income has been amended. From 23 May 2018 the amended income will be taken into account in the child support assessment (including estimate reconciliations) in most circumstances. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-07010010-01.html">Australian Tax Office (ATO) income for Child Support customers</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> different rules apply for amended incomes initiated on or after 1 July 2008 and issued before 23 May 2018. In most cases, an amended income (initiated and issued during that period) will not be taken into account in a child support assessment that has already been made. </p>

<p>If an amended income issued prior to 23 May 2018 and the relevant child support period had already commenced, the amended income should only be used in the child support assessment if the parent’s income was amended from nil or if the amendment was due to one of the reasons in subsection 56(2) of the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 as it existed prior to 23 May 2018. </p>

<p>When notification of an amended income is received with an issue date before 23 May 2018, the amended income will be recorded with a status of FOR INFORMATION but will not change the assessment.</p>

<p>Determine whether the assessment should be amended&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If, at the time an estimate of income is to be reconciled, the parent’s taxable income for the relevant year has been amended by the ATO (and that amended income is available to the Registrar), the amended income will be used in the reconciliation</li>
		<li>
Where the Service Officer is satisfied that the amendment to the income occurred due to one of the reasons specified in sub-section 56(2) of the Assessment Act as it existed before 23 May 2018 (for example, the amendment was due to tax evasion or fraud)</li>
		</ul>
<p>If an amended taxable income is already being used in a child support assessment and the amendment to the income was initiated&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
before 1 July 2008, the amended income will remain in use in the relevant assessment</li>
		<li>
on or after 1 July 2008 and issued before 23 May 2018, the amended income will remain in use until action is taken to manually remove it from the relevant assessment</li>
		</ul>
<p>There may be circumstances where a parent advises their income tax assessment amendment of their tax assessment was initiated prior to 1 July 2008 and the amendment was not due to tax evasion or fraud (or any other reason set out in sub-section 56(2)). Escalate these to a Program Support Manager (PSM) to seek Program Advice clarification.</p>

<p><strong>Amended taxable income due to tax evasion or fraud</strong></p>

<p>An amended taxable income issued prior to 23 May 2018 should be used in a child support assessment where the amendment occurred due to 1 of the reasons set out in sub-section 56(2) of the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 as it existed before 23 May 2018. For incomes issued prior to 3 May 2014, amendments were considered to have been due to tax evasion or fraud if they resulted in a higher income. These higher amended incomes were automatically applied to the assessment. For incomes issued from 3 May 2014 to 22 May 2018 we required verification of the reason for the amendment. These amended incomes had to be manually applied to the assessment. For example, tax evasion or fraud.  See <a href="../separated-parents/277-07020000-03.html#bp03_L2GT_Obtain_a_taxabl">Table 3 Obtain an ATO issued taxable income</a> in Income processing for Child Support customers 1 July 2008 to 29 June 2011 (21 November 2012 for WA ex-nuptial cases)</p>

<p>Unless there is reliable information to suggest otherwise, an amendment to a person’s income tax assessment will not be considered to be due to tax evasion or fraud if the amendment was&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
initiated by the person; or</li>
		<li>
made within the person’s statutory time limit for an amendment</li>
		</ul>
<p>The statutory time limit from the date of the original tax assessment for an amendment is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Two years for most individuals or very small business taxpayers (small business entities) and</li>
		<li>
Four years for all other business taxpayers, trustees, beneficiaries of certain types of trusts, taxpayers who entered into or carried out a scheme for the sole or dominant purpose of obtaining a scheme benefit and taxpayers in other high-risk categories prescribed by regulation</li>
		</ul>
<p>The ATO have advised that amendments made within the statutory time limits are not made due to tax evasion or fraud.</p>

<p>Escalate these amendments to the PSM for further assistance.</p>

relevant year ATO income</li>

<p>If a deemed or indexed default income has previously been calculated and the income used in the initial calculation has been replaced or a more recent taxable income becomes available, the new taxable income may be used to re-calculate the deemed or indexed default income.</p>

<p>If the re-calculated figure is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
higher than the income currently used in the assessment; or lower than the income currently used in the assessment but the parent still has time to lodge&#58;</li>

			<ul>			<li>

			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> once the tax assessment for a Last Relevant Year of Income (LRYI) has been received, no new provisional income can be created for that LRYI. The system may incorrectly create new provisional incomes after the tax assessment has been received for that year, particularly when multiple tax assessments are received on the same day. Investigate these incomes and remove any incorrect provisional incomes.</p>

<p>Review the case to identify if Cuba incorrectly created and applied new provisional incomes if a case is identified where&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a provisional income may have been created after the tax assessment for the LRYI was received, or</li>
		<li>
any instance where multiple tax assessments were received on the same day</li>
		</ul>
<p>This can be identified by comparing the date a provisional income was created to the date the tax assessment was received from the ATO. Where a new provisional income has been created on or after the same day the tax assessment was received, check the relevant assessment to determine whether the incorrectly created provisional income is being used.</p>

<p>If incomes are to be removed from the assessment, follow the <a href="../separated-parents/277-09030020-03.html">Correcting a complex Child Support Error</a> instructions and refer the submission to a Service Support Officer.</p>

<p>If unsure if provisional incomes should be removed from the records, seek support from a Service Support Officer.</p>

<p><strong>Date of effect</strong></p>

<p>If an assessment uses a provisional income and later a better provisional income is calculated, Cuba automatically amends the assessment based on the income accordance with the key lodgement dates. For example, if a customer provides an ITD before 31 October, the assessment will be amended from the first day in the child support period, otherwise the amendment to the assessment will take effect from the date the new provisional income was determined for the remainder of the child support period.</p>

<p>If the re-calculated figure is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
higher than the income currently used in the assessment&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the amount will be applied to the assessment from the first day the previous income was used</li>		</ul>
		<li>
lower than the income currently used in the assessment&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the amount will be applied from the date of notification to the end of the child support period</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Cuba will not always apply a lower provisional income from the correct date based on the key lodgement dates. Refer to Derived income for Child Support customers for instructions on how to have Cuba apply the income from the correct date</p>

<p>See <a href="../separated-parents/277-30010360-01.html">Income Cuba Process Help</a>.</p>
