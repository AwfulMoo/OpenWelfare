<p>This page contains information about processing derived income for Child Support customers.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; adding an income auto saves all eligibility information ‘I’ and warning ‘W’ changes, however the eligibility window is not visible in the income window.</p>

<p>Before adding manual income, Service Officers must check the eligibility window for accuracy. Review the assessment includes total number of children / relevant dependents in the calculation, complete and uncorrupted care records for all of the children / relevant dependents, reverse case has applied correctly with aligned CSPs and estimates.</p>

<p>If unable to resolve any ‘I’, ‘W’ or ‘E’ or the assessment or reverse case is not correct, do not add the derived income. Resolve the issues first, if required seek peer support or advice from a Service Support Officer (SSO).</p>

<p><strong>Not required to lodge tax return</strong></p>

<p>A Child Support customer may not be required to lodge a tax return and may lodge a non-lodgement advice with the ATO. For more information, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-07010010-01.html">Australian Tax Office (ATO) income for Child Support customers</a>.</p>

<p>Customers who have completed a non-lodgement advice with the ATO will have a 'Return not Necessary', 'Not Required to Lodge', or a 'Further Return not Necessary' (RNN, NRL or NOTNEC) indicator recorded against the relevant income tax years on their ATO records. </p>

<p>This indicates that the customer is not required to lodge a tax return as they have a taxable income below the tax-free threshold and therefore below the self-support amount. This does not necessarily mean their income is zero. The customer's actual income information should be obtained via customer contact (lodgement of a customer derived income) and/or relevant investigation and system searches.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> NOTNEC and NRL are historical codes no longer used by the ATO.</p>

This means Cuba treats it as being similar to an ATO assessed income instead of a derived income and automatically applies it to the customer's record and the usual <a href="../separated-parents/277-07010050-01.html">lodgement rules for income in Cuba</a> apply. </p>

<p>A <strong>CS ONLINE ITD</strong> intray creates where management of the customer is by&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
deceased customers</li>
		<li>
personalised services</li>
		<li>
debt enforcement</li>
		</ul>
<p>The intray automatically allocates to the owning business area. The case manager will then manually record the income in Cuba, from the notepad in the customer Communication window.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; adding an income auto saves all eligibility information ‘I’ and warning ‘W’ changes, however the eligibility window is not visible in the income window.</p>

<p>Before adding manual income, Service Officers must check the eligibility window for accuracy. Review the assessment includes total number of children / relevant dependents in the calculation, complete and uncorrupted care records for all of the children / relevant dependents, reverse case has applied correctly with aligned CSPs and estimates.</p>

<p>If unable to resolve any ‘I’, ‘W’ or ‘E’ or the assessment or reverse case is not correct, do not add the derived income. Resolve the issues first, if required seek peer support or advice from a SSO.</p>

<p><strong>Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA)</strong></p>

<p>DVA pensions and benefits are only included in ATI if they are classified as taxable income or a specified tax-free pension or benefit. Some DVA pensions and benefits can be either taxable or non-taxable depending on the customer’s circumstances. </p>

<p>The only tax-free pensions and benefits specified for inclusion in ATI are paid through Centrelink or DVA and are&#58;</p>

		</ul>
<p>If a customer reports DVA income as part of a customer derived income or a DVA income is identified when manually deriving an income, determine the type of pension or benefit received. The customer will likely only know the name of their payment, not whether it falls into 1 of the categories of payment types listed above. Check whether the customer can confirm the payment type, check the parent’s Income Details window for income information received from Centrelink and DVA and check the<strong> </strong>External Information window in Cuba for information sourced from CIDC to assist in determining the income type.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the parent has an existing Cuba record when the DVA income exchange is performed at the end of each financial year, their income details will have been received and loaded into the income details window for that financial year. If the parent's Cuba record has been created after the data exchange occurred, the DVA income will not be available in Cuba for that year.</p>

<p>If there is any doubt a direct request to DVA must be issued before updating the income. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-03030000-01.html">Direct requests for information from Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) (CS)</a> for information about the process for making a request. Also to see a list of payment names included in the data exchange (only incomes that are included in a parent’s ATI are part of the data exchange, DVA payments which are not a component of ATI are not provided). </p>

<p>If information needs to be requested about Centrelink income, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-04080010-01.html">Manual information request about a Centrelink customer record</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Example&#58;</strong> TPI (Total and Permanent Incapacity payment) is a term commonly used to refer to a number of different payment types. For example, special rate disability pension, superannuation, insurance. If a customer identifies they receive substantial income such as a TPI payment, make appropriate enquiries/investigation to determine whether their specific payment is a type which is included in ATI. If it is not, exclude it from the ATI being determined. Ensure the customer is aware that income which is not ordinarily included in their ATI may still be taken into account during&#58; </p>

<p>Explain to the customer that a customer derived income is a formal declaration of their income for a past financial year and should include <strong>all</strong> sources of income.

<p><strong>Example</strong>&#58; information is located indicating the customer received $50,000 from a sole employer. Ask the customer if this was the only source of income they received or if they received additional income.</p>

<p>If there are any discrepancies in the information provided by the customer, investigate and verify the information before accepting the customer derived income. This may involve clarifying the information provided with the customer or contacting third parties such as employers, Centrelink, or checking ATO systems.</p>

<p>If not satisfied after further investigations that the customer derived income is accurate, do not use that customer derived income. For example, other income the customer is unwilling to include in their customer derived income or cannot explain, is found. Manually derive an income based on a combination of the customer derived income and the other information located. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-07010020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Processing_deri02_Step">Table 3</a>.</p>

If a parent advises of the customer derived income after the ordinary lodgement period (that is, 31<sup>st</sup> of October) and the parent states they are going to lodge via a tax agent, and their taxable income can still be lodged on time, the customer derived income should apply from the first day the previous income was used.

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> a period of incarceration counts towards 10 months of income. A period of full time study also counts towards 10 months of income for parents or carers under the age of 18 who have not yet begun earning income. This can be established if&#58; </p>

<p><strong>Not required to lodge tax return</strong></p>

<p>If a customer has a 'Return not Necessary', 'Not Required to Lodge', or a 'Further Return not Necessary' (RNN, NRL or NOTNEC) indicator recorded against the relevant income tax years on their ATO records, this indicates they have a taxable income below the relevant year's self-support amount. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-07010010-01.html">Australian Tax Office (ATO) income for Child Support customers</a> - Not required to lodge. This does not necessarily mean the customer's income is zero. The customer's actual income information should be obtained from a customer derived income and/or relevant investigation and system searches</p>

<p><strong>Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA)</strong></p>

<p>If a customer reports a DVA income, <a href="../separated-parents/277-03030000-01.html">request the information directly from DVA</a> to determine the tax-free pension or benefit component of a customer's adjusted taxable income (ATI). See <a href="../separated-parents/277-07010020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Processing_deri01_Step03">Step 3 in Table 2</a>. </p>

<p><strong>National Disability Insurance Scheme and National Redress Scheme</strong></p>

<p>Payments (either ongoing or as a lump sum) received by customers under the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) or the National redress Scheme are not considered as income for Child Support purposes. If a customer provides NDIS or National Redress Scheme payment(s) as an income source, or it is established the customer is receiving these payments, document for information only, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-01030000-01.html">Documenting Child Support information in Cuba</a>. <strong>Do not include</strong> in any income calculations. For more information, see National Disability Insurance Scheme or <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-18050700-01.html">National Redress Scheme</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Allowable deductions</strong></p>

<p>Reasonable allowable tax deductions must be taken into account. When no current allowable deduction information is available, the decision maker may make a reasonable estimate of likely allowable deductions based on previous allowable deductions claimed by the customer.</p>

<p>The decision maker may inflate allowable deductions from the most recent previous tax return as if indexing an income, or use inflated allowable deductions information from particular previous tax returns where the pattern of earning is similar to the pattern of earning used to derive an income.</p>

<p>The reasons for determining the amount of likely allowable deductions must be clearly documented.</p>

<p>Example</p>

<p>John's previous tax assessments show 2 distinct patterns of earning. When John performs contract work allowable deductions are significantly higher than periods where John is an employee. The income information being used to derive John's 2015/16 income shows John performed mostly contract work in that year. John's most recent tax assessment for a year where mostly contract work was performed was 2012/13. The allowable deductions of $8,950 from that year are inflated and used as the allowable deductions in the derived income&#58;</p>

<p>AWE amount for the December quarter of 2015/16 ÷ AWE amount for the December quarter of 2012/13 = $1,145.60 ÷ $1,080.30 = 1.060.</p>

<p>$8,950 x 1.060 = $9,487 allowable deductions for 2015/16.</p>

<p><strong>Understanding Payment Summaries</strong></p>

<p>When deriving a parent's income, the best source of information about their adjusted taxable income (ATI) is the parent themselves. Some payments may be taxable income in 1 parent's circumstances and not in another parent's circumstances. As a guide, see the Guide to understanding payment summaries table on the <a href="../separated-parents/277-07010020-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Income_processi">Resources</a> page. Also consider information provided by the parent, or about the parent, from other sources such as third parties. For example, an employer and the ATO.</p>

<p>Deriving an income with <strong>less than</strong> 10 months income information should only be considered where there is evidence that the default or deemed income is significantly higher or lower than the customer's likely actual income.</p>

<p>The Service Officer <strong>must</strong> be satisfied that the information found represents the only source/s of income the customer has received during the financial year. General and specialised system searches must be undertaken, see the <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-04370000-01.html">External searches guide</a>.</p>

<p>Ensure the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
all possible sources of income have been checked</li>
		<li>
any confirmed or likely allowable tax deductions have been considered</li>
		<li>
the available income is significantly higher or lower than the deemed or the customer's past income history/occupation is, for example seasonal worker, supported by partner</li>
		</ul>
<p>Discuss the decision with a Service Support Officer before finalising.</p>

<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>

<p>Frank is currently assessed on 2/3 Male Total Average Weekly Earnings (MTAWE). Searches conducted have revealed that Frank earned $60,000 during 8 months of the LRYI. The Service Officer is unable to contact Frank to obtain a customer derived income. Frank's previous income history indicates the income earnt during part of the year is due to employment as Frank is a seasonal fruit picker. As there is no other income information available, the Registrar is satisfied that $60,000 is a more accurate income than 2/3 MTAWE.</p>

<p>Bella is currently assessed on 2/3 MTAWE. Search results revealed that Bella received $11,000 over a few months of the LRYI. Bella's previous incomes have been very low and there is no other information to suggest that any additional income is received during the LRYI. The Service Officer is unable to contact Bella to discuss the income or obtain a customer derived income. The Registrar is satisfied that $11,000 is a better income than 2/3 MTAWE.</p>

<p>When an income has been manually derived, <a href="../separated-parents/277-07010020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Processing_deri02_Step03">go to Step 3</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; adding an income auto saves all eligibility information ‘I’ and warning ‘W’ changes, however the eligibility window is not visible in the income window.</p>

<p>Before adding manual income, Service Officers must check the eligibility window for accuracy. Review the assessment includes total number of children / relevant dependents in the calculation, complete and uncorrupted care records for all of the children / relevant dependents, reverse case has applied correctly with aligned CSPs and estimates.</p>

<p>If unable to resolve any ‘I’, ‘W’ or ‘E’ or the assessment or reverse case is not correct, do not add the derived income. Resolve the issues first, if required seek peer support or advice from a SSO.</p>

<p>Add the income in the Client Income window. </p>

<p>Select the <strong>Includes ISP</strong> checkbox if the <strong>Income</strong> field includes&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
income from taxable pensions and benefits and/or</li>
		<li>
specified tax-free pensions or benefits</li>
		</ul>
<p>For more information about income support payments (ISP) and specified tax-free pensions or benefits, See <a href="../separated-parents/277-07010020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Processing_deri01_Step03">Step 3 in Table 2</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Updating a derived income</strong></p>

<p>If contact attempts were unsuccessful and new information has been located through searches, update the derived income.</p>

<p>If updating a derived income, <strong>delete</strong> the original derived income before adding the updated derived income.</p>

<p>If the <strong>Delete</strong> button is&#58;</p>

<p><strong>Not enabled</strong> - EL2 approval is required to delete the original derived income or to modify the effective date.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Add the updated derived income, which takes effect from the keying date.</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Create a CSO – Potential Error in-tray on the customer whose income needs correction adding a <a href="../separated-parents/elements/macros/CorrectingErrors.html">correcting errors submission</a> notepad (Cuba limited to 3,900 characters). </li>
			<li>
Create a TSO online request with the copied notepad in the issue text field (Cuba limited to only 3,800 characters). </li>		</ul>
		<li>
The SSO verifies the TSO online request. If EL2 approval is required, the SSO will escalate to their Team Leader, the Team Leader will escalate to an ICT approved EL2.</li>
			<ul>			<li>
The SSO will roll the CSO – Potential Error in-tray into a TSO –Error Correction in-tray to capture the existing notepad/s. Rolling is enabled by opening the existing in-tray notepad, closing the notepad but still staying in the original CSO – Potential Error in-tray, clicking on the New icon or File New and selecting the TSO –Error Correction and saving. SSO checks the existing notepad/s have rolled into the TSO –Error Correction in-tray notepads before routing the TSO –Error Correction in-tray to their relevant team SSO position for monitoring and Team Leader visibility.</li>
			<li>
Once the SSO receives the EL2 approval, the SSO lodges a mySupport Cuba Service Request form and attaches the EL2 approval. Only one request is required with both issues listed, that is, the <strong>Delete</strong> button is not enabled and the effective date must be overridden</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Enabled</strong> – delete the original derived income, add the new derived income and follow the above ‘<strong>not enabled</strong>’ process to update the effective date.</p>

<p>When a new assessment is generated, Cuba has been programed to automatically derive an income for the Last Relevant Year of Income (LRYI) if 10 months of pension or benefit income information is available.</p>

<p>This information is received from Centrelink (CLK) or the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) and can be viewed in the parent’s Income Details window. The<strong> </strong>External Information window shows incomes information sourced from CIDC. CIDC may record incomes that are not component of an ATI. </p>

<p>Check the derived income to ensure it is correct as the payment received may be a one off lump sum, or the parent may have received other income during the period they were eligible for benefits.</p>

<p>Non-taxable income information received from Centrelink or the Department of Veterans' Affairs is displayed in the Client Income window as non-taxable incomes. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-07010020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Processing_deri01_Step03">Step 3 in Table 2</a>. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-03030000-01.html">Direct requests for information from Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if on review of a Cuba derived income, additional income has been sourced and a manually derived income has been determined as per <a href="../separated-parents/277-07010020-03.html#bp03_tbl_01_Step02">Step 2 in Table 1</a>, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-07010050-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Provisional_inc">Lodgement rules for incomes in Cuba, Provisional income replacing a provisional income</a>.</p>

<p>Income correction may be required if a customer received pension or benefit income in the LRYI, and the assessment is based on a deemed (or 2/3 MTAWE or indexed default) income.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Follow the process in <a href="../separated-parents/277-07010020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Processing_deri02_Step">Table 3</a>. Prior to applying the income to the customer's assessment determine the effect on the account if the manually derived income was backdated to the start of the Child Support Period (CSP)</li>
		<li>
Retrospective income correction using a lower income should not occur if at the time of income correction the parent can no longer lodge a tax return on time and&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
replacing the income would result in no effect on the amount payable under the assessment, or</li>
			<li>
an overpayment would result, or</li>
			<li>
arrears would be created (receiving parent income replacement) <strong><br>Note&#58;</strong> these guidelines apply for non-collect and collect cases</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Check the case to identify any issues that may have prevented Cuba from auto deriving the income such as a customer mismatch with CLK/DVA preventing the pension and benefit information from loading onto the customer's records. If this is the case seek SSO support to escalate the data transfer issue, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-09140000-01.html">Technical Support in Child Support</a></li>
		<li>
If the customer was not in receipt of a pension or benefit for 10 months or more of the financial year, and insufficient other information is found to correct the income, no further action is required</li>		</ul>

<p>Where Cuba has automatically derived an income, check the income information is accurate.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the customer has not lodged a tax return in a number of years but receives income from Centrelink, Cuba will derive the customer's income based only on this income. Conduct searches to determine whether the customer has any other form of income.</p>

<p>If additional income is identified, attempt to contact the customer to obtain a customer derived income.</p>

<p>Centrelink administers payments of Paid Parental Leave. These payments are not an income support payment and the ISP checkbox must not be selected. This will allow a FAR assessment to generate if appropriate.</p>
