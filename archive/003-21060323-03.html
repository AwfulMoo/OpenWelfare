		<ul>		<li>
For a person born in Australia (or migrated to Australia) after approximately</li>
			<ul>			<li>
<strong>1959</strong>, Historical Family Allowance (HFA) records may exist. For help, see&#58;<strong><br></strong><a target="_blank" href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-11030010-03.html">Gathering information from internal sources</a><br><a target="_blank" href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-06030000-03.html">Online Search (OLS) facility</a> <br>If they do not have access to OLS, Service Officers should speak with their Team Leader</li>
			<li>
<strong>1988</strong>, links to a parent should exist, for example, family assistance, child care payments, maternity payments</li>		</ul>
		<li>
The person could have been linked as a partner or nominee to a person who previously received a payment from Services Australia</li>
		<li>
Complete a <strong>SMS/Email (SMEM)</strong> search&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
A SMEM search can help to identify an existing record or if a customer has multiple records&#58;<br>- Key <strong>SMEM </strong>in the <strong>Next</strong> field<br>- Key the customer’s mobile phone number in the <strong>SMS number</strong> field<br>- Press <strong>Enter </strong>and the results will show</li>		</ul>
		<li>
If, after completing a SMEM search, there are concerns about a customer’s identity, see <a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-09110100-03.html">Identity Fraud</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>If extensive checks and searches return no existing customer record, staff must make sure they are satisfied the caller is who they say they are and the information is genuine before <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07030030-01.html">adding a customer to the system</a>. </p>

<p>Create the record in the correct environment. This avoids the need to complete an <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-03020000-01.html">Inter-environment change of address (ICoA)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the record is created in the incorrect environment and a claim is granted, the customer will <strong>not</strong> receive a payment. Where this has occurred, contact the Technical Peer Support who must contact the Level 2 Helpdesk using the <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-21060323-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Template">payment query template</a>.  </p>
		<ul>		<li>
The Inter-Environment Change of Address Log Information (<strong>ITLG</strong>) screen shows when environment transfers were done. </li>
		<li>
The Payment Summary (PS) screen will not show a payment has released. </li>
		<li>
Running the workflow again will not fix the error.</li>
		</ul>
<p>Check the customer's identity by completing an Immigration Enquiry (RSIMME) update. If the customer has a passport and has travelled or lives outside Australia, the RSIMME update will help to complete PoRO.</p>

Only the employer with 7 hours per week can be considered, as the customer does not live in Southern Tasmania</li>
			<li>
for an Australian Capital Territory (ACT) claim, where the whole territory is considered a COVID-19 hotspot, a customer lives in an LGA <strong>not </strong>included in the ACT and has 2 employers - one located in an LGA in the ACT (7 hours per week) and one not included in those LGAs (20 hours per week). Only the employer with 7 hours per week can be considered as the customer does not live in the ACT</li>

unless a customer lives in or was present in a relevant area, do not include hours lost from an employer where the employer’s address is not in a ‘relevant area’. For example&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
for a Tasmania (Southern Tasmania) claim, where the whole state is <strong>not</strong> considered a COVID-19 hotspot, a customer lives in an LGA not included in Southern Tasmania and has 2 employers - one located in an LGA included in Southern Tasmania (7 hours per week) and one <strong>not</strong> included in those LGAs (20 hours per week). Only the employer with 7 hours per week can be considered, as the customer does not live in Southern Tasmania</li>
			<li>
for an Australian Capital Territory (ACT) claim, where the whole territory is considered a COVID-19 hotspot, a customer lives in an LGA <strong>not </strong>included in the ACT and has 2 employers - one located in an LGA in the ACT (7 hours per week) and one not included in those LGAs (20 hours per week). Only the employer with 7 hours per week can be considered as the customer does not live in the ACT</li>		</ul>
		<li>
calculate the total number of all hours lost that can be included in assessing the customer's claim</li>
			<ul>			<li>
if the total number of hours lost is different to what is under 'Payment being claimed' staff must select the correct '20 hours or more' or 'less than 20 hours' workflow based on their calculation (not the online claim the customer has selected)</li>
			<li>
<strong>do not </strong>reject a claim as a customer has chosen the incorrect option - for example, the customer has chosen '20 hours or more' instead of 'less than 20 hours'</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Note&#58;</strong> if there are no hours lost or employer details under this sub-heading, this means the customer is not eligible to receive a COVID-19 Disaster Payment. This is because they have answered 'No' to the question 'If the restricted movement did not occur, were you expecting to work and earn an income? /Did the restricted movement impact your ability to work and earn an income?'</li>
