<p>NBS eligibility is assessed as part of a customer's Family Tax Benefit (FTB) instalment or lump sum claim.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>

<p>Sally is eligible for NBS from the child's date of birth on 1 January 2020 and has chosen to receive nil rate FTB Part A. Sally will not receive the NBS fortnightly or the NBU payment. On 1 May 2020, Sally cancels the payment choice. As this can only be changed from date paid to + 1 and Sally's NBS period of 13 weeks (91 days) is passed, the NBS and NBU will be paid when reconciliation occurs at the end of the financial year.</p>

<p>If Sally had changed the payment choice anytime within the NBS period, any remaining NBS would be paid with the FTB Part A instalments but the NBU would be paid at reconciliation.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>

<p>Nicole is receiving the full entitlement of FTB Part A, NBS for 13 weeks (91 days) and NBU from the child's date of birth. After 2 instalments (28 days) Nicole makes a payment choice of nil rate FTB Part A. Nicole has received the NBU payment, the remaining NBS (91 - 28 = 63 days) will be paid when reconciliation occurs at the end of the financial year.</p>

<p><strong>Example 3</strong></p>

<p>Maria is eligible for FTB Part A and NBS for 13 weeks (91 days) from the child's date of birth. Maria has chosen to receive nil rate FTB Part A and will not receive NBS fortnightly or the NBU payment. Four months later Maria wants to revoke the payment choice because the baby requires medical treatment. After careful consideration, it is determined that Maria would experience considerable financial hardship if arrears were not paid, to meet the medical expenses. Due to revoking the choice, Maria is paid FTB Part A arrears from the child's date of birth. As this is also the first day of eligibility for NBS, the full 91 days of NBS and NBU would be included in the arrears payment.</p>

<p><strong>NBS paid for full 13 weeks</strong></p>

<p>Jan has a baby on 30 May 2020. Jan is not eligible for FTB Part A in the 2019-20 financial year.</p>

<p>Jan becomes eligible for FTB Part A from 1 July 2020 and lodges a claim and is eligible for FTB Part A. Jan is also eligible for the NBU and the full 13 weeks of NBS as the child does not turn 1 until 30 May 2021.</p>

<p><strong>NBS ceases when child turns one</strong></p>

<p>Mary has a baby on 4 July 2019. Mary is not eligible for FTB Part A in the 2019-20 financial year.</p>

<p>Mary becomes eligible for FTB Part A from 1 July 2020. Mary is eligible for the NBU and 3 days of the NBS as the child turns 1 on 4 July 2020.</p>

<p><strong>FTB claim lodged after child turns one</strong></p>

<p>Jillian has a baby on 3 January 2018. Jillian is not eligible for FTB Part A in the 2017-18 financial year. On 1 May 2020 Jillian lodges an FTB Lump Sum claim for the 2018-19 financial year.</p>

<p>Jillian is eligible for FTB A for the entire 2018-19 financial year. Jillian receives NBU and the full 13 weeks of NBS in her Lump Sum Claim starting from 1 July 2018 as the child did not turn one until 3 January 2019.</p>

<p><strong>NBS ceases at end of financial year</strong></p>

<p>Deb has a baby on 30 May 2019. Deb is eligible for FTB Part A and NBS from the child's date of birth. The NBS period would be for 30 May to 28 August 2019 (91 days).</p>

<p>Deb receives the NBU and NBS commences from 30 May 2019. Deb ceases to be eligible for FTB Part A from 10 July 2019 due to an increased income estimate. NBS also ceases from 10 July 2019.</p>

<p>On 1 August 2019, Deb provides a new reduced income estimate and FTB is restored from that date. As Deb is eligible for FTB Part A and this is still within 52 weeks from the child's date of birth, and is within the 13 weeks from when Deb first became eligible for NBS (30 May 2019), Deb will receive NBS for the remaining days in the NBS period (1 August to 28 August 2019).</p>

<p>At reconciliation for 201920, Deb was eligible for FTB Part A for the entire financial year. Deb will receive a top-up including NBS for the period 10 July to 31 July 2019.</p>

<p><strong>Start date backdated to child's date of birth at FTB reconciliation</strong></p>

<p>Helen's child is born on 1 April 2018, but Helen is not eligible for Family Tax Benefit (FTB) from 1 April to 30 June 2018 due to estimated income.</p>

<p>Helen is eligible for FTB Part A from 1 July 2018 based on the new income estimate, so NBS eligibility is determined from this date for 91 days and NBU is also paid.</p>

<p>FTB reconciliation occurs for the 2017-18 financial year and Helen is determined as eligible for FTB Part A from the child's date of birth, so the NBS eligibility date changes to the child's date of birth. Reconciliation will result in the difference of the rate paid for 2018-19 compared to the rate for 2017-18 being calculated as an overpayment.</p>

<p><strong>Start date changed to 1 July of new financial year at FTB reconciliation</strong></p>

<p>Sarah's child is born on 1 April 2018 and Sarah is eligible for FTB Part A from 1 April to 30 June 2018. Sarah's NBS eligibility date is 1 April 2018.</p>

<p>FTB reconciliation occurs for the 2017-18 financial year and Sarah is determined as not eligible for FTB Part A based on Sarah's actual income.</p>

<p>Sarah is eligible for FTB Part A again from 1 July 2018 and so the NBS eligibility date is now 1 July 2018. Sarah has NBU and NBS amount paid for 2017-18 calculated as an overpayment and NBU and NBS paid again for the 2018-19 financial year. The application of debt offsetting of the 2017-18 overpayment against the higher 2018-19 rate will result in a small arrears payment due to the CPI increase.</p>

<p><strong>One parent has received NBS for a child and the other parent is now claiming</strong></p>

<p>Simone and Fred have a child Tommy born 1 August 2019, but are not partnered to each other. Simone has 100% care of Tommy. Simone has claimed FTB and received NBU and NBS for the full period of 91 days from Tommy's date of birth.</p>

<p>From 1 February 2020, Fred has 100% care of Tommy and is claiming FTB. As Fred and Simone were not a couple when Simone received the entitlement to NBU and NBS, Fred can be assessed for NBU and NBS for up to 91 days.</p>

<p><strong>Customer's partner claims FTB during NBS period</strong></p>

<p>Jenny and Steve are partnered. Jenny is receiving FTB and NBS for their child Billy. Jenny was paid the NBU and the NBS period was determined as 91 days.</p>

<p>Steve is now claiming FTB for Billy from day 45. From that day, Jenny's FTB and NBS cease and Steve is entitled to FTB and NBS for 46 days (91 minus 45 days), which is the remainder of Jenny's original NBS period. Steve is not paid the NBU as it has been paid to Jenny.</p>

<p><strong>Couple separate during NBS period, share care</strong></p>

<p>Karen and Rob separate when Tommy is 45 days old. Karen and Rob have equal shared care of Tommy from the date of separation. Karen was paid the NBU and the NBS period was determined as 91 days, starting from Tommy's birth.</p>

<p>Rob claims the shared care rate of FTB for Tommy and is eligible for NBS. Rob's NBS period is determined as 46 days (91 minus 45 days while partnered to Karen). Rob is not paid the NBU as it was paid to Karen when they were partnered.</p>

<p>Karen also continues to be eligible for NBS for Tommy until the end of the NBS period. The NBS rate is not affected by the shared care percentage.</p>

<p><strong>Couple separate during NBS period, new partner claims FTB</strong></p>

<p>Jan and Tom have care of their son, Harry. Tom claims FTB, and is paid the NBU and assessed for 91 days of NBS. Jan and Tom separate after Tom received 60 days of NBS.</p>

<p>Jan becomes partnered to James and Harry is now in shared care. James claims FTB Part A for stepchild Harry, and is also eligible for NBS. NBS has already been paid to Tom for 60 days, so James will only be paid the remaining 31 days (91 minus 60 days). James is not entitled to the NBU as partner Jan has already benefited from the NBU while partnered to Tom. Tom will continue to be paid NBS for the full 91 days entitlement.</p>

<p><strong>Couple separate after NBS period</strong></p>

<p>Anne and Peter have separated after Anne received the NBU and 91 days of NBS for their son Joe.</p>

<p>Anne becomes partnered to John who is now claiming FTB Part A for stepchild Joe. John is not eligible for NBS for Joe because Anne has already received NBS for Joe for the maximum period of 91 days.</p>

<p><strong>Change of care to a non-parent</strong></p>

<p>Sasha has a child Jack born 1 August 2018, and has claimed FTB and received NBU and NBS for the full period of 91 days from Jack’s date of birth.</p>

<p>From 1 February 2019, Sasha’s sister Evie will have care of Jack for more than 13 continuous weeks as Sasha is unable to care for Jack. Evie is eligible for FTB Part A for Jack, and will be paid NBU and NBS for up to 91 days.</p>

<p>As Sasha was entitled to the NBS/NBU, there will not be any overpayment.</p>

<p><strong>First newborn child</strong></p>

<p>Mary gives birth to Josie on 4 April 2018. Josie is Mary's first child.</p>

<p>Mary claims and is eligible for FTB Part A for Josie. Mary is paid the NBU and the <strong>higher</strong> NBS rate for the full 91 days from Josie's date of birth.</p>

<p><strong>Second newborn child</strong></p>

<p>Kim and John have a child, Grace, born on 10 May 2018. They are also the natural parents of their child Alex who is almost 2 years old.</p>

<p>As Grace is Kim's second newborn child, Kim is paid the NBU and the <strong>lower</strong> NBS rate.</p>

<p><strong>Second or subsequent child dies prior to first birthday</strong></p>

<p>Kristine and Tom have a child, Bella, born on 10 January 2021. They are also the natural parents of their child Thomas who is 3 years old.</p>

<p>As Bella is Kristine's second newborn child, Kristine is paid the NBU and the <strong>lower </strong>NBS rate from Bella’s date of birth. Tragically, Bella passes away on 10 June 2021. As Bella has died prior to the first birthday and this occurred on or after 1 January 2021, Kristine is eligible for a top-up of the difference between the lower and higher rate of NBS.<strong>First newborn child, 1 child in care from previous relationship</strong></p>

<p>Trish gives birth to first child, Kate, on 10 March 2018. Trish's partner Dave has a child from a previous relationship. Dave shares the care of Tommy with a previous partner.</p>

<p>As Kate is Trish's first newborn child, Trish is paid the NBU and the <strong>higher</strong> NBS rate.</p>

<p><strong>Child entrusted to care of non-parent</strong></p>

<p>Billy was born on 13 March 2018. Billy's parent, Carol, claimed and was eligible for FTB Part A for Billy. As Billy was Carol's second newborn child, NBU and the <strong>lower</strong> NBS rate for Billy was paid for the full 91 days from Billy's date of birth.</p>

<p>Billy is entrusted to the long term care of grandparents, Bob and Joan, from 15 August 2018. Bob and Joan have also been caring for their grandchild Clare from the age of 6 months. Clare is now 2 years old.</p>

<p>Joan claims FTB on 20 August 2018. Joan is eligible for FTB Part A for Billy and is paid the NBU and the <strong>lower</strong> NBS rate for the full 91 days from the date Billy was entrusted to Joan's care. The lower NBS rate is paid because Billy is the second child under 1 year of age entrusted to their care (Clare was 6 months old when entrusted to their care).</p>

<p><strong>Adopted child</strong></p>

<p>As part of an adoption process, Sam is entrusted to the care of Jim and Alice on 19 April 2018. Sam is 3 years old. Jim and Alice are currently receiving FTB for their child Anna.</p>

<p>Alice claims and is eligible for FTB Part A for Sam. Alice is paid the NBU and the <strong>higher</strong> NBS rate for Sam. The higher rate is paid because Sam is the first child Jim and Alice have adopted.</p>

<p>For further information (including examples) on adopted children, see the Resources page of <a target="_blank" href="../families/007-07010010-05.html">Claiming payments for children entrusted to care as part of the process of adoption or a surrogacy arrangement</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Twins born</strong></p>

<p>Mary gives birth to twins, Harry and Marcie, on 4 April 2018. Mary and partner Rick have 2 other children aged 3 and 5.</p>

<p>Mary claims and is eligible for FTB Part A for Harry and Marcie and is paid the NBU and the <strong>higher</strong> NBS rate for <strong>each</strong> child. The higher rate is paid for each child because they were born as part of a multiple birth.</p>

<p><strong>Two children entrusted to care of non-parents at the same time, plus another child entrusted to care at a later date</strong></p>

<p>Ben was born on 13 March 2018. Sally was born on 20 April 2018.</p>

<p>On 15 August 2018, both children are entrusted to the care in the same process to foster carers, David and Judith.</p>

<p>Judith claims FTB on 20 August 2018. Judith is eligible for FTB Part A and is paid the NBU and the <strong>higher</strong> NBS rate for the full 91 days for <strong>each</strong> child from the date they were entrusted to Judith's long term care. The higher NBS rate is paid because Ben and Sally were entrusted to care as part of the same process.</p>

<p>Judith also cares for another child, James. James has been entrusted to Judith's long term care from birth (on 1 July 2019). When Judith’s FTB Part A is reassessed, NBU and the <strong>lower</strong> NBS rate are paid for James as Judith has previously had a child aged under 1 entrusted to Judith's care (Ben and Sally).</p>

<p><strong>Second newborn child - first newborn not eligible for NBS/NBU</strong></p>

<p>Alannah gave birth to Toby on 7 March 2019. After Toby's birth, Alannah received Paid Parental Leave (PPL) and was not entitled to NBS or NBU. Three years later, Alannah gave birth to her second child Seth. As Alannah has not met the PPL work test, she is not entitled to PPL for Seth.</p>

<p>As Seth is Alannah's second newborn child, Alannah is paid NBU and the <strong>lower</strong> NBS rate.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>

<p>Sarah's child is born on 1 April 2021 and Sarah is eligible for FTB Part A from 1 April to 30 June 2021. Sarah's NBU/NBS eligibility date is 1 April 2021.</p>

<p>In July 2022, Sarah is assessed as FTB potential non-lodger for the 20/21 financial year. As Sarah received NBU/NBS, the NBS paid in that financial year will be included in the non-lodger debt. The NBU is raised as a separate qualification debt in July 2022 due to being assessed as a potential non-lodger.</p>

<p>If Sarah’s actual income details are later received, reconciliation will occur and the reconciliation result will replace the non-lodger debt including the NBU debt.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>

<p>Sarah's child is born on 1 April 2021 and Sarah is not eligible for FTB Part A for the 20/21 financial year.</p>

<p>Sarah becomes eligible for FTB Part A from 1 July 2021 and lodges a claim and is eligible for FTB Part A. Sarah is also eligible for the NBU and the full 13 weeks of NBS from 1 July 2021.</p>

<p>In July 2023, Sarah is assessed as FTB potential non-lodger for the 21/22 financial year. As Sarah received NBU/NBS in the 21/22 financial year, the NBS paid in that financial year will be included in the non-lodger debt. The NBU is raised as a separate qualification debt in July 2023 due to being assessed as a potential non-lodger.</p>

<p>If Sarah’s actual income details are later received, reconciliation will occur and the reconciliation result will replace the non-lodger debt including the NBU debt.</p>
