		<div class="block">

<p>A school that offers tuition at the level in which the student is qualified to enrol. If the student has a special need, the appropriate school may be one that has or can provide access to a special program, facilities or environment required for the student.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Limited_program">Limited program school</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A secondary school that cannot offer a full program at the year or grade in which the student is qualified to enrol. A school has a limited program if it does not provide adequate facilities or programs to enable a student to gain a year 12 certificate or tertiary entrance score, such as an Australian Tertiary Admission Rank. For example, some high schools may only have the resources to provide study up to year 10.</p>

<p>Primary and secondary schools where the syllabus and teaching arrangements are specifically geared to Indigenous students may be considered limited compared to the general curriculum of the state or territory.</p>

<p>Each state or territory government Department of Education determines which schools offer an adequate education for students in their state or territory. Some schools offer education for students from prep to year 12, but do not deliver subjects that allow a student to enter higher education. In such cases, the Department of Education may deem years 11-12 to be limited programs.</p>

<p>The Departments of Education in WA, SA and NT have classified their remote community schools that mainly cater for Indigenous students as limited program schools.</p>

<p>The state or territory government Department of Education decide whether a school or years of study are consider to have limited programs.</p>

<p>If the state/territory government Department of Education places a school on the limited program school list and a student is studying in a year in which the school offers a limited program, then this school is <strong>not</strong> counted in the Geographic Isolation Rules. The next closest appropriate state school is then taken into account.</p>

<p>For a list of schools offering limited programs, see the <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-03030040-05.html">Resources</a> page.</p>

<p>There are 3 general rules which define Geographic Isolation.</p>

<p>If there is a transport service to the school, or could be made available if requested, the shortest practical route is the distance from the&#58;</p>

home to the nearest available transport service, <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
transport service to the school by the route used by the service (or connecting services)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where morning and afternoon transport services differ in length, the average of the 2 is taken to be the shortest practical route.</p>

<p>1. The distance between the principal family home and the nearest appropriate state school is at least <strong>56 kilometres</strong> via the shortest practical route.</p>

<p>2. The distance between the principal family home and the nearest appropriate state school (via the shortest practical route) is at least <strong>16 kilometres</strong>, <strong>and</strong>&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the distance between the principal family home and the nearest available transport service to the nearest appropriate state school is at least <strong>4.5 kilometres</strong> via the shortest practical route, or</li>
		<li>
there is no available transport service between the principal family home and nearest appropriate state school</li>
		</ul>
<p>3. The student does not have reasonable access to an appropriate state school for at least <strong>20 school days</strong> in the year because of adverse travel conditions (for example, impassable roads, or a return journey that us at least three hours) or other circumstances beyond the family's control.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>A student may be regarded as not having reasonable daily access to appropriate schooling without meeting a geographical isolation rule under certain circumstances&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The student has a disability or other health-related condition and needs to live in a special institution</li>
		<li>
Parental work requires frequent moves</li>
		<li>
The occupation of the student's sole parent involves frequent overnight absences. This criterion was removed from 1 January 2006. Before 2006, certain students could be deemed geographically isolated where the occupation of their sole parent, by its nature, required frequent overnight absences. Any student who attracted AIC allowances on this basis in 2005 will continue to be deemed geographically isolated until they complete or discontinue their course of study, or their parent changes occupation (whichever is earlier)</li>
		<li>
The student lives in a second family home with a sibling who meets an isolation condition, or with a sibling receiving Youth Allowance (YA) or ABSTUDY who was qualified for AIC in a previous year or earlier in the current year or has a special need</li>
		<li>
The student previously met, but due to a change of circumstance no longer meets, an isolation condition. However as they continue to study at the same school, they can remain eligible under a continuity of schooling concession. Where the student's circumstances change during the school year and this makes them no longer eligible under an isolation condition and they still board away from home, live in a second home, study by distance education or other approved education, and go to the same school, AIC payments continue&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
until the end of the year for students below year 11, or</li>
			<li>
until the end of the following year for students who continue to year 12</li>		</ul>
		<li>
The student commenced board, living in a second home or undertook study by distance education or other approved education in anticipation of a (later) change of circumstance resulting in him or her meeting an isolation condition (retrospective continuity of schooling concession)</li>
		</ul>
