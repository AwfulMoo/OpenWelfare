<p>When the Commonwealth Ombudsman's office commences an investigation into a complaint, notice is provided to Services Australia Ombudsman Relationship Management Section (ORMS) under section 8 or section 12(4) of the Ombudsman Act 1976. Upon receipt of the notice, ORMS refer the complaint to the most appropriate line area to prepare a response.</p>

<p>The Commonwealth Ombudsman's office sets out dates in which it requires a formal response to a complaint. If the Ombudsman requests a verbal response, go to Step 2.</p>

<p>To manage the complaint the Complaints Officer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
creates a <a target="_blank" href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-03070000-01.html">Customer Feedback Tool</a> entry</li>
		<li>
assesses the complaint to ensure their team is responsible and best placed to respond</li>
		<li>
notifies ORMS if the complaint should be referred to another area</li>
		<li>
seeks input from business areas where a response is required (The Commonwealth Ombudsman's office provides a summary of the issues as related to them by the complainant and provides a number of questions for the agency's response)</li>
		<li>
gathers all relevant information to provide a thorough response, checking for relevant information in&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
agency files (paper and electronic)</li>
			<li>
customer records and files (paper and electronic)</li>
			<li>
Government records</li>		</ul>
		<li>
prepares a response that explains the circumstances surrounding the complaint and the action taken. When drafting the proposed response, the information provided must answer the questions asked</li>
		</ul>
<p>When responding to the complaint undertake the following actions&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Provide sufficient information to the Commonwealth Ombudsman's office to enable them to carry out their investigation. It is particularly helpful if evidence, which is relevant and compelling, is attached</li>
		<li>
Send all communication, including proposed responses and attachments, to ORMS</li>
		<li>
The proposed response needs to be reviewed by ORMS Quality and Clearance Team. ORMS will then manage the clearance and sign-off process by the appropriate SES Officer</li>
		</ul>
<p>If unable to meet any deadline, notify the manager so that if possible, an extension can be sought</p>

<p>Return to <a target="_blank" href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-02040010-01.html">Level 2 complaints (CLK)(MED)</a> to continue managing the complaint.</p>

<p>A verbal response is sometimes requested when the Ombudsman's office is undertaking a section 8 investigation and has identified a customer as vulnerable.</p>

<p>A verbal response is an interim response that occurs prior to the completion of a request for a written response and is required by the Ombudsman's office in 48 hours.</p>

<p><strong>On receipt of the questions requiring verbal response the Complaints Officer&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
reviews, assesses and investigates the questions requiring verbal response</li>

seeks clarification immediately if a question from the Ombudsman's office is not clear. Consults with the manager and if further clarification is required the Complaints Officer contacts the ORMS team</li>
		<li>
investigates and utilises all current and relevant reference material, technical support, customer record information in determining an appropriate response</li>
		<li>
prepares a draft response to the questions and forwards this to the manager</li>

<p><strong>On receipt of the draft responses the manager&#58;</strong></p>

reviews and assesses the responses provided for accuracy, correctness, appropriateness and addresses questions asked</li>

requests clarification of information provided in the draft response from the Complaints Officer if required</li>
		<li>
refers all suggested changes or additional information for insert to the Complaints Officer for review and amendment</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>On completion of the verbal response process&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
ORMS issues a verbal response File Note to the Complaints Officer</li>

the Complaints Officer confirms or edits the content for accuracy of the File Note and returns it to the manager</li>

the manager forwards the file note to the EL2 Service Manager for clearance to ORMS</li>

the Complaints Officer attaches the File Note to the section 8 written response request on receipt of the approved File Note</li>

<p>Failure to report a privacy incident in a timely manner can result in serious consequences. Timely action can reduce the risk of physical harm to customers or other negative consequences.</p>

<p>On day 1 of receiving the privacy complaint, ensure the Privacy Incident - notification form is completed and forwarded to privacy@humanservices.gov.au, from the Escalated complaints mailbox, with a cc to your team leader.</p>

<p>A copy of the Privacy Incident - notification form is located on the <a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-02040030-05.html">Resources</a> page.</p>

<p>All alleged privacy incidents <strong>must</strong> be referred to the Privacy team for review. The Privacy team will triage the privacy complaint within 24 (working) hours and provide a lexid number and advice on the next steps as soon as practicable to the Escalated Complaints mailbox. The complaints officer will liaise with privacy (via privacy@humanservices.gov.au quoting the lexid number) as to status of the complaint every 5 days and ensure the customer is kept updated.</p>

<p><strong>Privacy complaints which can be resolved within a reasonable timeframe</strong></p>

<p>In these cases, Privacy will liaise with the originating business area to obtain a business contact, for the complaints team to liaise with and determine how the customer will be managed. If there is nothing more you can action on the complaint pending the business area response, change the status of the complaint to &quot;waiting response&quot; and place the complaint on hold.</p>

<p><strong>Privacy complaints which are complex and the Privacy team has advised the review process will be lengthy</strong></p>

<p>The Privacy team will liaise with the business area where the privacy incident originated to ensure you can be provided with a business contact.</p>

<p>Advise the customer that&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the agency treats any allegation of privacy incidents seriously</li>
		<li>
the privacy incident has been referred so enquiries can be conducted</li>
		<li>
you will be closing their complaint</li>
		<li>
the business area will be advised of the outcome of the privacy incident complaint and the business area will contact the customer</li>
		</ul>
<p>Confirm how the customer would like to be contacted by the business to be advised of the outcome of their complaint - note details such as telephone number or email address</p>

<p>Finalise the complaint on the CFT.</p>

<p><strong>Complains which present with both a privacy and another complaint issue</strong></p>

<p>If there are additional issues to be investigated manage as per the usual <a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-02040010-01.html">Level 2 complaints (CLK) (MED)</a> process.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a written response is to be provided to the customer regarding their privacy complaint, the Privacy team will draft or clear any privacy related content in your outcome letter. Forward all draft correspondence containing privacy matters to privacy@humanservices.gov.au (quoting the lexid number), with a cc to your team leader, via the Escalated complaints mailbox for clearance.</p>
