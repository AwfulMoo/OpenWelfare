		<div class="block">

<p>The National Residential Medication Chart (NRMC) and compliant equivalents may now be used in <strong>all</strong> Australian states and territories. Claims from approved pharmacists in all jurisdictions are now valid. Under this initiative, prescribers are able to use the NRMC to prescribe most PBS medicines to patients in Residential Aged Care Facilities (RACFs), instead of a traditional PBS prescription. Pharmacists are also able to use a copy of the NRMC to supply and claim most PBS /Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (RPBS) medicines.</p>

<p>Standardisation of charts was designed to improve resident safety, and reduce the administrative burden for pharmacists and pharmacy staff. The NRMC was developed by the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care, in consultation with the aged care sector, medical practitioners, pharmacists and other stakeholders.</p>

<p>Approved PBS prescribers no longer need to complete a traditional PBS/RPBS prescription form for most PBS/RPBS items ordered for residents when using the medication chart.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>The National Residential Medication Chart (NRMC) is used as a medication order <strong>and</strong> a prescription for most medicines. It initiates supply and claiming of most PBS /Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (RPBS) medicines directly from the chart without the additional need for a written prescription. It is also intended to improve safety throughout standard fields, layout and an intuitive design.</p>

<p>As at 31 October 2014, all states and territories had enacted legislation to enable the prescribing, supply and PBS claiming from a national residential medication chart (NRMC) in a residential aged care facility. The NRMC was initially trialled in 22 RACFs across NSW.</p>

<p>The National Residential Medication Chart (NRMC) complies with PBS, and state based legislation and may be used by a RACF for PBS/RPBS prescribing, supply and claiming purposes.</p>

<p><strong>Electronic NRMC</strong></p>

<p>From 1 October 2019, legislative amendments introduced electronic prescribing which includes from the NRMC. The electronic NRMC is a fully digital medication chart to consider as an alternative to a paper-one.</p>

<p>Services Australia are able to receive and assess PBS reimbursement claims for prescriptions prescribed and dispensed from the electronic NRMC.</p>

<p>The National Residential Medication Chart (NRMC) has been designed and tested for use in residential aged care facilities only. Managers of residential aged care facilities who wish to consider changing from their present medication charts to an NRMC or a compliant equivalent chart, will need to consider a range of processes, including&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Change management processes for facility staff</li>
		<li>
Securing commitment from residents' general practitioners regarding new medication ordering systems</li>
		<li>
Liaison with supplying pharmacy about new systems to order, reconcile, and manage medicine usage in the facility; and</li>
		<li>
Working with aged care groups or peak bodies for support during the process.</li>
		</ul>
<p>Neither the Aged Care Act 1997, under which Commonwealth subsidies are paid for providing aged care services, nor the National Health Act 1953, which governs the operation of the PBS, requires operators of residential aged care services to use the NRMC in their services. However, there are benefits in doing so. Some of these are outlined below.</p>

<p>A key feature of the National Residential Medication Chart (NRMC) is that 'prescriptions' and the record of medicine administration are co-located on the NRMC. The resident's details, including their photograph and known adverse drug reactions, are visible from each page of the NRMC to enable correct identification when prescribing, supplying and administering medicines. Faxed, photocopied and emailed scanned images of the NRMC will also contain this information to assist pharmacists in identifying the correct resident and their medication orders.</p>

<p>Relevant pathology (such as results to support warfarin dosing, and blood glucose levels), medical practitioners' instructions, and special considerations applying to the administration of medicines to a resident, are all included in the NRMC. The layout supports informed prescribing, accurate medicines dispensing and administration, and improved clinical monitoring of residents.</p>

<p>The NRMC 'charting cycle' is a maximum of 4 months for paper and 6 months for electronic. As the NRMC nears its expiry date, there is a reminder in the administration area of the NRMC for RACF staff to contact the medical practitioner to review the resident and re-chart their medicines. If the medicines are not re-charted, all orders on the NRMC cease to be valid for supply and administration after the chart expiry date. Unlike the existing process for supplying medicines from prescriptions, the amount of each medicine supplied by the pharmacy will not be determined by a maximum quantity and 'repeats'. For each medicine order, the medical practitioner must specify a period of time that a medicine is to be administered and supplied, thereby removing the requirement for PBS repeat authorisation forms.</p>

<p>Each time a patient needs a supply of a PBS/RPBS item from the standardised NRMC, the approved pharmacist must&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
get the most recent copy of the patient's standardised NRMC from the residential aged care facility (RACF)</li>

identify the medication chart entry for the PBS/RPBS item</li>

			<li>

			<li>

			<li>
date on which the pharmaceutical benefit was supplied</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>Approved pharmacists may use a prescription duplicate sticker and coding sticker to endorse each supply of an item from the standardised NRMC.</p>

<p>As each supply of an item is made at the PBS maximum quantity, prescribers don't need to write the quantity on the standardised NRMC, unless where different PBS maximum quantities exist for the medicine or where less than the PBS maximum quantity is specifically required.</p>

<p>This process is repeated for each subsequent supply of the item up until either the chart expiry date or stop date (whichever is indicated by the prescriber).</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Where the 'ongoing' or 'stop date' fields have not been filled by the prescriber, the approved pharmacist is authorised to supply only one PBS maximum quantity for the item in total</li>
		<li>
The same date of prescribing can be used each time a supply is made using the same medication chart entry of the standardised NRMC</li>
		</ul>
<p>To make sure there is a continuous supply of the item for the patient, prescribers must write a new standardised NRMC before the chart expiry date.</p>

<p>Paperless claiming does not require pharmacists to provide a copy of the National Residential Medication Chart (NRMC) to Medicare as evidence of supply. However claiming from the NRMC is only available to pharmacies using PBS Online. When dispensing from the NRMC, you will enter the RACF ID and indicate that this is a supply from a medication chart. The pharmacy dispensing software system will allocate serial numbers to supplies marked in this way which are in a different batch to other prescriptions, with serial numbers from 10000 to 10999 (for example, C10000 to C10256). This will prevent gaps in regular prescription bundles.</p>

<p>A supply certification, generated by the pharmacy dispensing software system, will indicate the range of serial numbers supplied as paperless claims from the NRMC.</p>

<p>A Residential Aged Care Facility (RACF) will need to organise their own printing and supply channels for National Residential Medication Chart (NRMC) charts, or use commercial suppliers of medical charts. While high resolution printer files for the NRMC (link to PDFs) are available free of charge from the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care, neither the Commission nor the Department of Health and Aged Care coordinates NRMC printing and logistics. Aged care peak bodies may also be able to advise on some aspects of chart supplies.</p>

<p>'Compliant charts' in this context are those that comply with relevant state legislation, and the Commonwealth National Health (Residential Medication Chart) Determination 2012, as amended. For residential aged care service operators who wish to take advantage of the NRMC, but use a commercial version of the chart, it is important to ensure that any commercial products used are compliant with both state and Commonwealth legislation. Use of a non-compliant chart may prevent, for example, pharmacists being able to make PBS claims for medicines supplied directly from the medicine order on the chart.</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of aged care facility operators to obtain relevant advice on the compliance, or otherwise, of a medication chart before considering introducing it in their facilities. Chart producers should be asked to provide written confirmation of their products' compliance with applicable legislation.</p>
