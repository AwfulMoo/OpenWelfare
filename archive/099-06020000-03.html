<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> for JobSeeker Payment (JSP) and Youth Allowance (YA) customers, suitably skilled Service Officers are to key the Bereavement Payment using the Bereavement Assistance <strong>task selector</strong> in Process Direct.</p>

<p>In this case, the LBP is worked out for 6 entitlement periods <strong>plus</strong> the number of days between the date of death and the end of the first period.</p>

<p><strong>LBP</strong> = [(<strong>CMCR - NR</strong>) x 6] <strong>plus</strong> [(<strong>CMCR - NR</strong>) x <strong>NDEP</strong>/14]</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>CMCR</strong> is the couple's combined fortnightly member of a couple rate payable had the person not died. For illness separated couples where the survivor receives a pension payment, Partner Allowance or Parenting Payment, the CMCR is the couple's fortnightly member of a couple rate payable had they been living together before the person died. Refer to How to work out the CMCR for an illness separated couple. The CMCR does not include the Coronavirus Supplement if the customer or deceased partner received it prior to the bereavement period<br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the deceased was receiving War Widows Pension (WWP) and Income Support Supplement (ISS), the WWP from the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) is not included in the CMCR part of the calculation. See the <a href="../bereavement/099-06020000-05.html">Resources</a> page for an example</li>
		<li>
<strong>NR</strong> is the surviving partner's new fortnightly single rate. If the deceased also received Family Tax Benefit (FTB) and the survivor is expected to be granted FTB, do not include in the survivor's new single rate the Rent Assistance (RA) component. When the survivor's claim for FTB is finalised RA will be paid with FTB rather than the income support payment. The NR also does not include the Coronavirus Supplement, where the survivor received it prior to the bereavement period</li>
		<li>
<strong>NDEP</strong> is the number of days from and including the date of death until the end of the entitlement period in which the death occurred</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>To calculate the LBP</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Work out the difference between the CMCR and NR</li>
		<li>
Multiply the difference by 6 to get the LBP payable for 6 entitlement periods</li>
		<li>
Multiply the difference in the rates by <strong>NDEP</strong> and divide by 14 to get the LBP payable for the first entitlement period</li>
		<li>
Add the results from steps 2 and 3 to get the total LBP</li>

<p>In this case, the LBP that would have been payable to the surviving partner may be paid to an appropriate person (e.g. a relative or executor of the estate). This would occur if the appropriate person has contacted Services Australia to advise they have not received the LBP or not been able to access it from the deceased's bank account.</p>

<p>The LBP is worked out differently from that normally payable to a surviving partner, If both members of the couple are pensioners, the LBP is automatically issued to the surviving partner.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if both members of a couple die at the same time (e.g. in an accident), the younger partner is considered the surviving partner when working out the LBP.</p>

<p>For pensioners and Parenting Payment customers, the LBP is worked out <strong>as if the couple were living together</strong>.</p>

the combined illness separated rates already paid since the date of death, and</li>

the combined member of a couple rates which would have been paid, if not illness separated.</li>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> other than Parenting Payment, this adjustment does not apply if the survivor receives an allowance or benefit type payment, e.g. JobSeeker Payment (JSP). Refer to item 6 above. For JSP and YA customers, suitably skilled Service Officers are to key the Bereavement Payment using the Bereavement Assistance <strong>task selector</strong> in Process Direct.</p>

<p>The calculation may result in an overpayment if there is a delay in notifying or recording the death. The overpayment is a recoverable debt.</p>

<p>First check if the care receiver was partnered. If so, check if the surviving partner is entitled to an LBP. The LBP is worked out differently for a surviving partner. If the non-carer partner is entitled to an LBP, the carer will not be entitled to an LBP as well, but will continue to receive CP for the bereavement period.</p>

<p>If the care receiver was a child with a severe disability or medical condition, or the care receiver child was in a short-term or episodic care situation, the carer may be entitled to an LBP.</p>

<p>Complete the death action in the <strong>care receiver's record</strong> for the 'ripple' to initiate any lump sum payment to be paid on the carer's record.</p>

<p>If the Carer is entitled to an LBP, the LBP payable to the CP customer is <strong>the</strong> <strong>lesser of</strong>&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
7 times the partnered maximum basic pension rate</li>
		<li>
7 times the amount of the actual last instalment of CP paid before the care receiver's death</li>
		</ul>
<p>Generally, the LBP is automatically calculated when a customer is recorded as deceased. A Manual Follow-up (MFU) is created when this is unable to occur with the keywords <strong>DEA</strong>, <strong>*REVIEW</strong> and <strong>@CAR</strong>. Eligibility for bereavement payment needs to be established manually and the activity will need to be completed from the Activity List (<strong>AL</strong>) screen. See <a href="../carers/009-03090010-01.html">Death of an adult or child care receiver and the effect on CP</a> for information on how to code the LBP manually on the One Off Payment (<strong>OOP</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>Use the Bereavement payment taxation exemption job aid to calculate if LBP is above the tax free amount and therefore a <a href="../payment-delivery/103-08010000-01.html">tax adjustment is required</a>.</p>

<p>The customer may be eligible for both PBV and LBP, but they can only receive one bereavement payment.</p>

<p>Always issue the LBP to the customer first.</p>

<p>If the PBV will be greater than the LBP, issue a Partner Bereavement Payment application (SA490) inviting the customer to request to be paid PBV. On the form the customer will relinquish their LBP entitlement in writing before they can be paid PBV. The <a href="../bereavement/099-06020000-05.html">Resources</a> page contains a link to the Partner Bereavement Payment application (SA490).</p>

<p>When the form is processed, an adjustment to the bereavement payments is made by offsetting the LBP already paid with the PBV.</p>

<p>Extra care must be taken to only invite customers who will be paid more PBV than they received of LBP. This is because if PBV is less than LBP, an overpayment may occur.</p>

<p>See <a href="../bereavement/099-19100838-01.html">Assessing entitlement to a PBV</a> and <a href="../bereavement/099-06010000-01.html">Assessing entitlement to LBP</a>.</p>
