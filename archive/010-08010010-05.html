There is no Income Bank accrual as Sylvia’s employment income is above the income free area of $480.00 per fortnight</li>

Sylvia's income is greater than $575.00. Each dollar of income above this value will reduce Sylvia's rate of payment by 60 cents</li>
		<li>
Additionally, as Sylvia's income is greater than $575, the rate reduction of 50 cents for each dollar between $480 and $575 will need to be applied. This is done by adding $47.50 to the calculated rate reduction of income greater than $575</li>

<p><strong>Calculating the affecting income</strong>&#58;</p>
