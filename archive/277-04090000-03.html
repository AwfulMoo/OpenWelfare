<p>The payee or the payee and payer jointly can elect to opt-out of collection verbally, electronically or otherwise in writing.</p>

<p>In certain circumstances, the Child Support Registrar can make a case private collect. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-04320000-01.html">Registrar Initiated Private Collection (RIPC).</a></p>

<p>If an opt-out has already been processed and arrears remain on a case, a payee can choose to collect all or part of the arrears privately (discharge). See <a href="../separated-parents/277-04090000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Election_to_dis_Step01">Step 1 in the Election to discharge arrears received</a> table.</p>

<p>Where family and domestic violence concerns are identified, refer the customer to the <a href="../utils/CustomerReferralGuidelines/Customer-Referral-Guidelines.html?parent-support-team.html">Parent Support Team</a>.</p>

<p><strong>For New Zealand ‘In’ cases, </strong>do not make NZ in cases private collect. Refer the customer to NZIRD to discuss their options. </p>

<p><strong>For other International cases</strong>&#58; check the case for disbursement options. If funds are disbursed directly to the Central Authority (CA), the case may be 'agency reimbursement', meaning the CA is in fact the payee. In these cases, obtain confirmation from the CA that an opt-out is an option. The Central Authority team make contact with the CA. Create and route an <strong>International response required</strong> intray to the Central Authority team and record details of the information they are seeking in the intray notepad.</p>

<p><strong>Zero annual rate&#58;</strong> do not make cases that have had a zero annual rate since they started private collect. Neither party has the role of payee, so there can be no election to opt-out of collection. For more information about cases with an initial zero annual rate see <a href="../separated-parents/277-19061119-01.html">Application for assessment - record a decision and finalise</a>.</p>

<p>The start date of the opt-out can be any date outside a Low Income Non-Enforcement (LINE) period. For more information about LINE periods, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-05050000-01.html">Stage 1 cases – Low Income non-enforcement periods.</a></p>

<p>Check the Case Collection Details window to see if the opt-out date falls within a LINE period. If the opt-out date is within a LINE period, advise the payee to select another date either before or after the LINE period. This date cannot be more than 60 days after receiving the opt-out.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the opt-out takes effect from the 1st of the next month, the payer needs to pay the previous month’s liability to Child Support. If the opt-out takes effect before the end of the month, the payer needs to pay a pro rata liability payment.</p>

<p>A backdated opt-out is not a discharge of arrears. Where a payee has opted out of collection from a date in the past (a backdated opt-out, not a discharge) any arrears arising from the date the case was opted out will not be collectable even if a subsequent variation increases the liability. Arrears that accrue prior to the date of the opt-out will be collectable by Child Support. If the payee does not want the new debt collected, they will need to make an election to discharge the debt. </p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> a backdated opt-out may effect a customer’s Family Tax Benefit Part A entitlement. Refer the customer to Centrelink as this may influence their decision.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>The payee calls on 3 October 2016 and opts their case out of collection from </p>

<p>1 January 2016. In November 2016, after the election to opt-out has been finalised, an ATO taxable income replaces a default income. The liability from 1 July 2015 to 30 September 2016 increases. </p>

<p>The variation of the liability from 1 January 2016, that is the opt-out date to 30 September 2016 will not be collectable by Child Support. It <strong>will not accrue</strong> on the payer's account because this is a private collect period. The variation to the liability from 1 July 2015 to 31 December 2015, that is the period prior to the opt-out <strong>is</strong> collectable by Child Support and <strong>will accrue</strong> on the payer's account. If the payee does not want these arrears collected by Child Support, they must make an election to discharge.</p>

		<li>
delaying opting out of collection until no credit remains</li>

<p>Where the parents cannot agree or cannot be contacted, the uncredited NAP will be removed from the account when the opt out is processed. </p>

<p>This is because a NAP amount paid within one enforceable period cannot be applied to future amounts that become payable in a different child support enforcement period.  </p>

<p class="info-box warning">If family and domestic violence is an issue and/or the payee is being coerced into making an election for private collect, ask the payee if they would like to discuss their options of gaining an exemption from taking reasonable maintenance action with a Centrelink Social Worker. See the <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-15000000-01.html">Family and domestic violence</a> procedure.</p>

<p>To assist in managing sustainable private collect arrangements discuss the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
What payment methods they will use when the case is opted out. The customers should make arrangements about the amount, frequency, period of the payment(s) and a method of record keeping</li>
		<li>
If the payee chooses to discharge arrears, they are still legally entitled to collect the amount from the payer and can pursue collection privately, or through a court if necessary. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> once discharged, arrears cannot be collected</li>
		<li>
The payee can ask Child Support to collect child support again in the future, including up to 3 months’ unpaid arrears (up to 9 months in exceptional circumstances) if the private arrangement is not working</li>
		<li>
For FTB purposes, customers are deemed to have received 100% of their child support assessment for private collection periods, even when the amount is increased from a date in the past. The child support assessment could be subject to amendment from a date in the past and the change may result in an increased entitlement. This can be due to Change of Assessment decisions or to replacement of provisional incomes where the payer does not regularly lodge income tax returns. <br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Private collect may not suit customers where the child support assessment may be subject to retrospective change</li>
		<li>
If the customer is in receipt of FTB Part A for periods of private collect, Centrelink deems the customer receives their full entitlement. For this reason, they should not delay a request for collection if the private arrangement does not work out</li>
		<li>
The customers must continue to notify Child Support of any changes in income, care arrangements or other circumstances that may affect the rate of child support payable</li>
		<li>
Child Support will continue to issue assessment notices advising of the rate of child support payable</li>
		<li>
Child Support will continue to provide assessment information to Centrelink. The payee’s FTB will not be adjusted if the full amount is not collected</li>		</ul>

<p>A payee cannot discharge arrears unless the case is ended or opted out. A payee can choose to have arrears removed from collection in 3 ways&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
They can choose to opt-out of collection from a date in the past (backdated opt-out)</li>
		<li>
Where a case is ended or has been opted out they can elect to have all or some of the arrears discharged</li>
		<li>
When opting out of collection they can choose to have arrears unpaid on that day discharged</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when <strong>employer withholding is in place for the payer</strong>, ensure the payee is aware of expected employer deductions not yet recorded on the payer account summary. Delay the discharge process until after the employer remits any final deductions to enable these amounts to be disbursed to the payee. After the discharge of arrears is processed, the payee will no longer have a child support entitlement therefore no disbursement can take place.</p>

<p>Ensure privacy when discussing the payer's employer withholding with the payee, see<a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-01010020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Disclosing_info04_2"> Table 7 Step 2 in Disclosing information under child support law</a>.</p>

<p>Where family and domestic violence is identified, refer the customer to the <a href="../utils/CustomerReferralGuidelines/Customer-Referral-Guidelines.html?parent-support-team.html">Parent Support Team</a>.</p>

<p>An election to discharge arrears can be accepted verbally, electronically or otherwise in writing. <strong>Before accepting the election</strong> ensure&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the payee's intention is clearly established, <a href="../separated-parents/277-04090000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Election_to_dis_Step03">go to Step 3</a></li>
		<li>

<p>A payee must clearly advise that they wish to discharge all or part of the arrears owing and Service Officers must discuss the reasons for their decision with them. Ensure that they are using the most appropriate method to address their needs and minimise the chance of unintended consequences of the decision.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>If the payee has no intention of collecting the discharged arrears privately, they might not realise their Family Tax Benefits (FTB) entitlement will still be worked out on the basis that the arrears will be paid.

<p>Ensure parents have a realistic understanding of the options available to them, including Child Support's collection powers. Customers do not need to elect to discharge arrears simply because Child Support has been unable to collect. Payees have been able to privately enforce child support debts at the same time that the liability is collectable by Child Support since 1 January 2007.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>The customer may have decided to discharge the arrears because only a small amount is owed due to a minimum assessment being in place for several years and Child Support has been unable to collect even this small amount. If the minimum assessment is the result of very low default incomes being used, this situation could change significantly when tax returns are lodged.</p>

<p>A payee can discharge an amount of arrears from their case when it is ended, opted out or in conjunction with an opt-out. All discharge of arrears are by amount. Cuba calculates arrears to be discharged by&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
amount</li>
		<li>
period, or</li>
		<li>
amount and period</li>
		</ul>
<p>Despite these options being available in Cuba, Service Officers are always discharging arrears by amount, even if they use the period function to calculate the amount.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> a discharge by period is not a back dated opt-out. If the assessment is later varied it may result in additional arrears. In this case contact the customer to determine if they want the additional arrears collected or discharged, even if the period function has been used.</p>

<p>Take into account child support that is not yet due when helping a parent decide on an amount to discharge. For example, opting a case out from 6 February, the amount outstanding on the case may not reflect the liability due for the 5 days of February.</p>

		</ul>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>The payee calls on 3 October 2016 and opts out their case from that day. The payee also requests that arrears on the case be discharged. A Service Officer uses the ‘period’ discharge function in Cuba to establish the amount of arrears from 1 January 2014 (SDOL) to 3 October 2016 and this is discharged. The liability from 1 August 2015 to 31 August 2015 is increased when a default income is replaced by an ATO taxable income. Arrears are created on the account for this period. </p>

<p>The payee is contacted and confirms they want the new arrears to be discharged. If the payee wishes for Child Support to collect these arrears they must remain on the account until collected.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> it is incorrect to discharge arrears without consulting the payee because the original discharge was actioned using Cuba’s period function. Service Officers <strong>must not</strong> discharge arrears unless requested by the payee.</p>

<p>When a subsequent variation to a child support account reduces the liability in a period before the case was opted out consider the effect. If the effect is to reduce the amount that was unpaid and able to be discharged by the payee, the discharged amount must be adjusted in the Discharge Arrears window. Include a documented explanation of the adjustment in the window's notepad. For assistance to adjust the discharge amount seek technical support see <a href="../separated-parents/277-09140000-01.html">Technical support in Child Support</a>.</p>

<p>Is the customer is in receipt of FTB Part A?</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>, contact the payee to explain&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the adjustment to the discharged amount</li>
			<li>
the updated amount <strong>must</strong> be reported by the payee to Centrelink for FTB Part A purposes</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>No</strong>, procedure ends here</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>The payee calls on 15 February 2016 to opt-out their case from that day. The payee also elects for the $500 arrears owing to them as at 15 February 2016 to be discharged resulting in the payer’s account balance reducing to nil.</p>

<p>On 27 April 2016 a default income for the payee is replaced with a higher income and the liability for the period 1 August 2015 to 30 September 2015 is retrospectively varied resulting in&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a new liability reduction of $800 which appears on the account as a payee overpayment. As there is no longer any child support arrears owing due to the payee’s prior discharge election, a manual adjustment needs to be made to the discharge amount. In this scenario, the $800 liability reduction exceeds the $500 discharged arrears amount, therefore the original discharge amount of $500 is adjusted to nil. The net outcome is a payee overpayment of $300, that is $800 liability reduction less the $500 discharge amount = $300 payee overpayment, or</li>
		<li>
a new liability reduction of $100 which appears on the account as a payee overpayment. As there is no longer any child support arrears owing due to the payee’s prior discharge election, a manual adjustment needs to be made to the discharge amount. In this scenario, the $100 liability reduction is less that the $500 discharged arrears amount, therefore the original discharge amount of $500 is adjusted to $400. The net outcome is there is no payee overpayment, that is $500 original discharge less the $100 liability reduction = $400 adjusted discharge amount</li>		</ul>
