<p>This document outlines the policy and procedures that apply when a job seeker voluntarily ceases suitable employment without reasonable excuse or becomes unemployed due to misconduct as a worker.</p>

<p></p>
<div class="twisty">
	

<h2 id="Policy context">Policy context</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Australia's welfare system is designed to provide a strong safety net for those who are unable to support themselves.</p>

<p>For people of working age who have the capacity to work, these payments are intended to support those who are actively seeking and prepared to move into suitable paid work as this becomes available.</p>

<p>The job seeker compliance system helps to reinforce these expectations. Penalties may apply if a job seeker has contributed to their unemployment, through voluntary unemployment or dismissal for misconduct.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>If unemployment due to a voluntary act or misconduct occurs, Services Australia staff are required to apply legislation and policy in a firm but fair manner to ensure that the serious nature of this behaviour is appropriately reinforced.</p>

<p>If a customer or job seeker leaves suitable work voluntarily (without a reasonable excuse), or is dismissed from suitable work due to misconduct, the consequence depends on which compliance system applies.</p>

<p>Under the&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Targeted Compliance Framework, an unemployment failure has been committed&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
customers incur a 4 week unemployment preclusion period or 6 weeks if they received relocation assistance</li>
			<li>
job seekers receiving a participation payment will have this payment cancelled. A post cancellation non-payment period prevents them from receiving payment for the preclusion period if they reapply</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Job Seeker Compliance Model, an 8 week Unemployment Non-payment Period (UNPP) applies, or 12 weeks if they received relocation assistance</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> ParentsNext participants are not subject to compliance action if they are unemployed due to a voluntary act or due to misconduct.</p>

<h2 id="Voluntary unemployment">Voluntary unemployment</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Voluntary unemployment refers to a situation where a job seeker becomes unemployed as a result of a voluntary act. Compliance action is required where the job seeker has left suitable employment and their reason for leaving is not considered reasonable.</p>

<p>Voluntary unemployment does not include leaving work as a result of&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
an employment contract ending</li>
		<li>
no further work available (for example, factory closures or a voluntary redundancy is accepted), or</li>
		<li>
being within 6 weeks of the date of confinement but not having access to Maternity Leave</li>

<p>Unemployment due to misconduct refers to situations where a job seeker has contributed to their unemployment, either due to having been dismissed or being given the option of resigning from suitable work, as a result of inappropriate actions as an employee.</p>

<p>The reason for termination must be a result of misconduct as an employee and not because of their general behaviour. The incident must have either occurred in their place of work or be directly related to their work.</p>

<p>Examples of unemployment due to misconduct include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
deliberate failure to produce or deliver a reasonable amount of work</li>
		<li>
unauthorised absences from duty without good reason</li>
		<li>
inappropriate behaviour or practices such as theft, assault or harassment of other employees or customers, inappropriate use of company credit cards, cars or information technology, or confidentiality breaches</li>
		<li>
actions that cause serious risk to the health or safety of other employees or customers</li>
		<li>
actions that threaten the reputation, viability or profitability of the business</li>

<h2 id="Identifying unemployment due to voluntary act or misconduct">Identifying unemployment due to voluntary act or misconduct</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>All Service Officers have an important role in the identification of potential non-compliance where the job seeker became unemployed voluntarily or as a result of misconduct.</p>

<p>If an Employment Separation Certificate (SU1) has been provided (including collected verbally by the Service Officer) and the employer has indicated the reason for separation as employee ceasing work voluntarily, misconduct as an employee, unsatisfactory work performance, or other, the Service Officer must consider whether compliance action should be generated for further investigation. Where compliance action is generated, the job seeker must be advised that their reason for unemployment will be further investigated and a penalty may be applied.</p>

<p>If a non-compliance event is generated when a person is commencing or lodging a claim, the compliance investigation and decision must occur before the claim can be finalised. This decision may have a direct impact on the job seeker's income support payment start date.</p>

<p>An Employment Services Provider may submit a report to Services Australia if they identify that while receiving a participation payment a job seeker&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
voluntarily ceases suitable employment</li>
		<li>
becomes unemployed due to misconduct</li>
		</ul>
<p>The provider must have considered the suitability of work and reasons for leaving before submitting the report. The Participation Solutions Team (PST) is responsible for undertaking these compliance investigations.</p>

<p>Although ParentsNext participants receive a participation payment they are not required to look for work and are therefore not subject to unemployment failures.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>


<p></p>
<div class="twisty">
	

<h2 id="Evidence to be collected before generating compliance action">Evidence to be collected before generating compliance action</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>If a Service Officer identifies unemployment due to a voluntary act or misconduct may have occurred, they should gather sufficient evidence before generating any compliance action. For example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Employment Separation Certificate (SU1)</li>
		<li>
job seeker statement or</li>
		<li>
additional employer statement</li>
		</ul>
<p>Compliance action does not need to be generated where&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
an employee was genuinely unable to produce a satisfactory standard of work</li>
		<li>
had a good reason for unauthorised absences (although not advising absences may constitute misconduct on its own)</li>
		<li>
the employer is unable or unwilling to substantiate their allegations</li>
		<li>
there is evidence that the job seeker was acting in self-defence rather than being the instigator</li>
		<li>
any potential non-payment period has been self-served by the job seeker</li>
		<li>
any potential non-payment period is entirely overlapped by another waiting period (e.g. Income Maintenance Period)</li>
		<li>
end of contract</li>
		</ul>
<p>If a decision is made not to generate compliance action, this must be clearly documented. For example, the Service Officer assessing the new claim can note in the Progress of claim <strong>DOC</strong> that a potential non-compliance event has already been considered and further investigation is not required as the potential non-payment period has been self served.</p>

<p>If the information contained in the Employment Separation Certificate (SU1) is obtained verbally from the employer and there is an indication that further investigation will be required, the employer should be advised another Service Officer may make contact to obtain more details about the reason for the voluntary unemployment or dismissal due to misconduct. Contact details of the most relevant person to speak with should be recorded when generating compliance action.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>


<p></p>
<div class="twisty">
	

<h2 id="Generating compliance action">Generating compliance action</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Compliance action must be generated once there is sufficient evidence to identify that a non-compliance event is likely to have occurred. </p>

<p>For current job seekers, Special Benefit (SpB) and Parenting Payment (PP) claimants, the Service Officer must generate the compliance action using the <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-15060000-01.html">Participation Compliance workflow</a> in Customer First.</p>

<p>Compliance action for JobSeeker Payment (JSP) and Youth Allowance (YA) new claims must be generated in Process Direct using the <strong>More Options UNPP</strong> workflow. This includes documenting the evidence gathered.</p>

<p>The workflow will identify the job seeker compliance system the job seeker is managed under. If at the time the compliance action is generated the job seeker is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
not a declared programme participant they are managed under Targeted Compliance Framework and an <a href="../job-seekers/001-18030206-01.html">unemployment failure</a> will be generated</li>
		<li>
a declared programme participant they are managed under the Job Seeker Compliance Model and an <a href="../job-seekers/001-10060040-01.html">Unemployment Non-Payment Period</a> will be generated</li>
		</ul>
<p>Once the compliance action is generated, the compliance investigation is undertaken by an appropriately skilled Service Officer.</p>

<p>If the compliance action is generated&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
before the job seeker's claim for a participation payment is finalised, a Service Officer with a UNPP IT security resource is responsible for undertaking the compliance investigation (except where the job seeker received relocation assistance)</li>
		<li>
and the job seeker is receiving a participation payment or where it is identified that they may have received relocation assistance for the position, the Participation Solutions Team is responsible for undertaking the compliance investigation</li>

		<div class="block">

<p>Service Officers with a UNPP IT security resource and Participation Solutions Team (PST)-skilled Service Officers are responsible for undertaking the compliance investigation and making a decision to apply or reject the compliance action. The investigation will focus on the matters that are relevant to making an evidence-based decision that is in line with the legislative framework and policy intent.</p>

<p>These matters are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the circumstances that led the job seeker becoming unemployed</li>
		<li>
whether the employment was suitable work, and</li>
		<li>
whether there were any factors that made it reasonable for the job seeker to leave employment voluntarily, or</li>
		<li>
whether an incident of misconduct that led to dismissal actually occurred</li>
		</ul>
<p>Service Officers with a UNPP IT security resource and PST-skilled Service Officers have responsibility for&#58;</p>

investigating unemployment due to a voluntary act or dismissal due to misconduct</li>
		<li>
delivering strong messages that reinforce the expectation that job seekers remain in suitable work</li>

<p>Consultation with a PST Service Support Officer (SSO), PST-skilled social worker or other <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-05000000-01.html">specialist officer</a> may be required to assist with assessing the impact of job seeker circumstances on the suitability of work, their reason for leaving or behaviour at the time of dismissal. A PST skilled Service Officer <strong>must</strong> consult with a social worker where the job seeker presents with family and domestic violence or has a current Family relationships/Domestic violence circumstance recorded. See <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-12080010-01.html">Accessing a PST-skilled social worker</a>.</p>

<p>PST-skilled Service Officers with the WNPPD IT security resource are responsible for explaining the decision to the job seeker. They will also record the job seeker's application for a formal review by an Authorised Review Officer (ARO) if required. See <a href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/109-03000000-01.html">Reviews and Appeals</a>.</p>
