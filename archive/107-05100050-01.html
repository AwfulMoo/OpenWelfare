A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999</li>

Social Security Act 1991</li>

<p>Determined (DET) and Determined with a Collection Agent (DMC) are eligible for IC. The system applies an IC to the total amount of the DET or DMC debts.</p>

<p>Components used to calculate the IC include supplements and allowances paid with the basic rate.</p>

<p>Debts for payments made under different legislation but recoverable under the above Acts, may be subject to IC. For example, Farm Household Allowance debts.</p>

<p><strong>No acceptable recovery arrangement</strong></p>

<p>If the first repayment is not made on the debt due date (day 28), the system will calculate an IC from day 29.</p>

<p>IC will calculate from day 15 if the debtor does not enter into an arrangement within 14 days after,</p>

a temporary write off ceases</li>
		<li>
a pause of debt ceases, or</li>
		<li>
a withholding arrangement ceases</li>

<p><strong>Acceptable repayment arrangement, but fails to make the first agreed payment</strong></p>

<p>If a debtor enters into an arrangement with the first agreed payment due before the debt due date and the payment is not made, the system will calculate IC from the day after the due date.</p>

<p><strong>Acceptable repayment arrangement, but misses an agreed payment</strong></p>

<p>IC will be applied if a debtor has been making the agreed repayments, then misses a payment. Interest is charged daily from the day after the last repayment was due. Interest will cease when&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the total debt amount and any calculated interest is paid in full</li>
		<li>
the debtor makes up the missed payment and continues to make agreed payments</li>
		<li>
Services Australia agrees to skip the missed payment and the debtor continues to make payments</li>
		<li>
the debtor enters into a new recovery arrangement <strong>and</strong> makes their first agreed payment</li>
		<li>
the debtor has a reasonable excuse exemption applied, or</li>
		<li>
the debtor has at least 1 debt temporarily written off or has a pause on debt recovery in place</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the Debt Management Information System (DMIS) will re-calculate interest payable where the debt status changes. No manual action required. DMIS will adjust all records via overnight processing.</p>

<p><strong>Debtors referred to an External Collection Agent (ECA)</strong></p>

<p>External Collection Agents (ECA) inform Services Australia when a debtor has or has not entered into an acceptable arrangement. Interest is charged when the ECA advises the debtor or organisation has not entered into an acceptable arrangement.</p>

<p>Interest is charged for each day the debtor does not have an acceptable arrangement with the ECA.</p>

<p>The system will use the ECA indicator in the following instances. Where the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
is in an acceptable recovery arrangement and no IC is to apply, set the indicator to ON</li>
		<li>
is not in an acceptable recovery arrangement and an IC is to apply, set the indicator to OFF. Interest applies from the date the indicator is set to OFF</li>

<p><strong>Debt amount decreases</strong></p>

<p>When a debt amount has reduced due to a debt amendment, the system will recalculate the interest from the original debt due date. This includes any periods where IC has been applied using the new reduced debt balance.</p>

<p><strong>Debt amount increases</strong></p>

<p>When a debt amount increases due to a debt amendment, the system will continue to calculate interest on the previous (lower) amount for 28 days. From the 29th day, the IC is calculated on the new amount.</p>
