Such an agreement is at the discretion of the school's principal. The school may require the parent pay a fee for any access. Any participation at a school can only be minimal. If the parent considers their child needs to attend a school for more than a few hours per week they should discuss an enrolment or flexible enrolment with the school and surrender their home education registration.</p>

<p>Non-school forms of education such as TAFE may be accessed part-time without affecting registration. To access a TAFE component the student needs to be eligible under the institution's enrolment conditions. For more information, the parent should contact their local TAFE.</p>

As per the <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-03040020-05.html#bp05_L3TT_Homebased_stud">Home-based study percentages - study days per week</a> table, the AIC DED entitlement is 60% of the distance education rate.</p>

<p>In 2019, Annabelle was studying full-time by distance education, but from partway through Term 2 Annabelle is also doing some subjects at the local New South Wales school as part of a re-integration program. The information supplied by the local school confirms that Annabelle started on 22 May 2019 and is studying 3 subjects out of 8 by face-to-face studies and this is expected to continue for the rest of this year. Annabelle's parent confirms Annabelle is still studying the rest of the subjects via the approved distance education provider.</p>

<p>Annabelle is therefore studying 37.5% workload by face-to-face and 62.5% workload by distance education. The Term 2 instalment period has 91 days and runs from 1 April to 30 June 2019.</p>

<p>In the Term 2 instalment period&#58;</p>

the full distance education allowance was payable from 1 April to 21 May 2019 (51 days), and</li>
		<li>
the pro-rata rate takes effect from 22 May to 30 June 2019 (40 days)</li>

<p>The DED entitlement for Annabelle in Term 2 is&#58; $588.39 ($4211/365 x 51) + $288.42 ($4211/365 x 40 x 0.625) which is a total of $876.81.</p>

In the period 8-30 June 2019 Charlie was studying 20% workload by face-to-face and 80% by distance education. As this is considered full-time distance education the full rate of DED was payable, that is $265.35 ($4211/365 x 23 days x 1.0)</li>

<p>Terms 3 and 4 should not be paid until the verification has been supplied of the actual face-to-face and distance education percentages undertaken.</p>

<p>As this is a complex case, Service Officers should collect all the evidence and make their calculations. Results should be checked with a Service Support Officer, or via Technical Peer Support, or refer it to Policy for a decision via ABSTUDY and Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) Team.</p>

<p>All HLC students should be assessed and paid as any other claim unless there is uncertainty about the continuity of a HLC. The individual HLCs may open/close without notice depending on weather, number of students attending, presence of a teacher. They may also close if there are no families with school age students living in that community. When in doubt, check with the Hub School or your Service Support Officer before paying AIC.</p>
