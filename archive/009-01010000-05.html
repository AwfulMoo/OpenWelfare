<P>Health Care Card (HCC), in the child care receiver's name, is available to <STRONG>carers</STRONG> of children under 16 where the child is a disabled child who has a physical, intellectual or psychiatric disability which is permanent or to last for an extended period (more than 12 months) or requires extra care and attention for 14 hours or more per week.</P>
<P>Once a care receiver child turns 16, they may be eligible for an ex-care receiver Health Care Card (SS456). To be eligible, they need to be aged 16-25 years, a full-time student who has a disability or medical condition that previously qualified their carer for CA (child) on the day before they turned 16.</P>
<P>Child care receivers who qualify their carer for CA (auto) are eligible for an HCC in their name in <STRONG>addition</STRONG> to any Pensioner Concession Card (PCC) that is issued to the carer.</P>

<P><STRONG>What income and assets tests apply?</STRONG></P>
<P></P></TD>
<TD>
<P>The <STRONG>carer</STRONG> is subject to the Pensions Income and Assets Test. If Services Australia does not have current information about the carer (and their partner's) income and assets, the person claiming CP must complete an Income and Assets form (SA369).</P>
<P>If the <STRONG>care receiver</STRONG> (16 years and over) is not in receipt of an income support payment from the agency or the Department of Veterans' Affairs, they are also required to supply their income and assets details (form SA304A).</P>
<P></P></TD>
<TD>
<P>CA is not taxable or assets tested. There is an income test. To be eligible for CA, the carer’s and their partner’s combined adjusted taxable income must be under $250,000 a year. This includes deemed amount from account-based income streams if the account holder is 60 years of age or older. The same income limit applies if the carer does not have a partner.</P>
<P>The income test does not affect the rate of CA that is paid.</P>
<P>CA can be paid in addition to wages or an income support payment. The CA income test does not apply to carers who are <A href="../carers/009-18091105-01.html">exempt from providing their CA income details</A>.</P>
