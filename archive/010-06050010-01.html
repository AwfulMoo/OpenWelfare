<LI>Since last leaving secondary school, you have worked to support yourself in part-time paid employment</LI></UL>
<P>As a result, customers were not able to:</P>
<UL>

<H2 id=_Toc344898764>Self-supporting criteria</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Customers whose parental home is in a regional or remote area, are considered independent if they meet <STRONG>either</STRONG> of the following self-supporting criteria:</P>
<P>Since last leaving secondary school they have:</P>
<UL>
<LI>earned at least 75% of the <A href="https://guides.dss.gov.au/social-security-guide/1/1/n/12" target=_blank>National Training Wage schedule rate</A> included in a modern award in any 14 month period, <STRONG>or</STRONG></LI>
<LI>had part-time employment of at least 15 hours per week for at least 2 years in a row at any time</LI></UL>
<P>As well as meeting <STRONG>one</STRONG> of the above criteria, the customer must meet <STRONG>all</STRONG> of the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Be required to live away from home to study</LI>
<LI>They are undertaking a full-time or concessional study-load</LI>
<LI>The location of their family home (as determined by the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS)), is in an area classified as:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>Inner regional</LI>
<LI>Outer regional</LI>
<LI>Remote, or</LI>
<LI>Very Remote</LI></UL>
<LI>Their combined parental income in the appropriate tax year is less than $160,000, plus $10,000 for each additional child<STRONG> included in the Family Unit Regional</STRONG> (FUR)</LI></UL>
<P>The FUR counts anyone aged under 22 who has a <A href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-02010020-01.html">parent</A> in common with the YA or ABSTUDY customer. This is regardless of whether the child is employed, unemployed, studying, or whether they live at home, away from home or are overseas. This is for the purpose of calculating the parental income threshold. However, the following exclusions apply if they are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>in State care</LI>
<LI>receiving ABSTUDY, YA or Disability Support Pension (DSP) as independent because it is unreasonable for them to live at home</LI>
<LI>living away from the family home and is/was a member of a couple, or</LI>
<LI>living away from the family home and has/had a dependent child</LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> do not count the YA or ABSTUDY customer as an additional child.</P>
<P>If a student's family home is outside of Australia and not in one of the qualifying areas, they <STRONG>do not qualify</STRONG> under this criterion.</P>
<P>There is also a safety net for disadvantaged customers. See <A href="../job-seekers/001-04060040-01.html">Assessing independence when a customer is self-supporting through full-time paid employment</A>.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
