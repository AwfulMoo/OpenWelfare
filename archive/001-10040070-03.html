		<ul>		<li>
access to safe, secure and adequate housing, see <a href="../job-seekers/001-10040070-03.html#bp03_tbl_Reasonable_excu01_3">Item 3 in Table 3</a></li>

<p>Participation Solutions Team (PST)-skilled Service Officers should consider all other relevant factors when assessing a reasonable excuse, for example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
What reason/s has the job seeker provided for failing to comply with the requirement?</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Have they discussed these reasons with their provider?</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Did the reason/s for failing to comply directly prevent the job seeker from meeting the requirement?</li>
		<li>
Was the reason for failing to comply with a requirement foreseeable or within the job seeker's control?</li>
			<ul>			<li>
When did the job seeker become aware they could not comply?</li>
			<li>
What did the job seeker do to try to comply?</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Would the reason/s provided for non-compliance be considered acceptable by the general public? For example, would an employer accept the reason from an employee?</li>
		<li>
Did the job seeker make prior contact to advise they could not meet the requirement?</li>
			<ul>			<li>
If not, what prevented prior contact?</li>
			<li>
Check the job seeker's attempts to make prior contact</li>
			<li>
Was it unreasonable to expect the job seeker to make prior contact?</li>		</ul>
		<li>
When drug and/or alcohol misuse or dependency issues directly impacted non-compliance, more information is needed. See <a href="../job-seekers/001-10040070-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Targeted_Compli">Table 2</a></li>		</ul>

<p>Prior contact is met when the job seeker contacts&#58;</p>

another organisation or person identified in their Job Plan, for example the Job Plan may require a job seeker to contact their Work For the Dole (WFD) co-ordinator if they can't attend WFD</li>

		<ul>		<li>
How recently were they notified?</li>
		<li>
How similar are the requirements they confused?</li>
		<li>
Did the job seeker attend either requirement? For example, it is not an excuse to say you thought the appointment was at the time of another appointment if they did not attend either appointment.</li>

Whether the job seeker has recently moved to the area/changed provider?</li>

How long has the job seeker been attending their various requirements?</li>

How recently the notification occurred</li>

<p>As a general rule, job seekers must accept any suitable job offer. This includes circumstances where the job seeker is able to start the job on offer but will likely leave the job within a short period of time, for example, the job seeker is a principle carer and their childcare arrangements are temporary.</p>

<p>If a job seeker advises they have a firm job offer starting in the future, the reasons why the job seeker has refused suitable work must be assessed on a case by case basis.</p>

<p>Job seekers who are declaring either hours worked or employment income received must continue to look for and accept suitable work, unless all of the following apply&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the job seeker is not able to undertake both jobs, due to overlapping work hours</li>
		<li>
the job on offer hourly rate is lower</li>

the hours on offer mean the employment income is less than their current job</li>		</ul>
