<p>This document outlines information about unspent home care amounts and processing the Commonwealth (CW) portion of unspent home care amounts (CW unspent amount). </p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Unspent_home_ca">Unspent home care amounts</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>From 27 February 2017, a home care package follows the care recipient. Care recipients are able to choose a provider who best meets their goals and needs, and to change their provider if they wish.</p>

<p>The unspent home care amount is the total amount of home care subsidy and home care fees paid to the provider that have not been spent on a care recipient’s care. The unspent home care amount may consist of a care recipient portion and a Commonwealth (CW) portion. Up until 31 August 2021, both the care recipient and the CW portion accrued with the provider. From 1 September 2021, the CW unspent accrues with Services Australia.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; the term ‘Commonwealth’ is often referred to as ‘CW’ in this procedure and system menus.</p>

<p>Unspent home care amounts can occur at any time. Providers should be working with the care recipient to ensure they are getting the full benefit of their home care package. This can occur as part of providers’ ongoing discussions with the care recipient and reflected in their individualised budget statements.</p>

<p>If the care recipient departs from the service, the provider may deduct an exit fee from the unspent home care amount. The exit fee is deducted from the care recipient portion of unspent amount if available. This is subject to the exit fee being fully disclosed to the care recipient in the home care agreement and through publication on My Aged Care.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> an exit fee helps cover the cost of administration when a care recipient departs a provider. The care recipient and the provider work out this amount.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The way unspent home care amounts are managed changed from 1 September 2021. The changes were&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
All home care recipients have a home care account. See <a href="../older-australians/065-21081745-01.html">Home care account</a> for further information </li>
		<li>
The Government collects and holds the Commonwealth (CW) unspent amount in each care recipient’s home care account </li>
		<li>
The unspent funds continue to be available to pay for a care recipient’s care and services when needed</li>
		<li>
Providers must report the CW unspent amount for each care recipient calculated as at the end of the month preceding the claim month. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> while reporting was initially optional, providers had to report at least once in either the September 2021, October 2021 or the November 2021 claim. From the December 2021 claim month onwards, reporting the CV unspent amount was mandatory</li>
		<li>
Providers had the choice to return the CW unspent fund amounts as part of the home care monthly claim process from 1 September 2021 for a 6 months period</li>
		<li>
For care recipients currently in care, providers continue to have a limit of 2 years after the end of a payment period to make changes to a home care event</li>
		<li>
For care recipients who departed home care, providers can only make changes within 70 days after the care recipient’s departure date</li>
		<li>
If providers believe a significant error on the part of Services Australia has impacted their payments requiring a change beyond the 70 days, they can submit supporting evidence to the Aged Care Payments Team (Aged Care and Allied Health Branch) for escalation to Aged Care Programmes Branch </li>
		<li>
All requests for changes greater than 70 days or 2 years period must include relevant supporting evidence. See <a href="../older-australians/065-18052200-01.html">Maintain claims in Aged Care Management Payment System (ACMPS)</a> for further information</li>
		<li>
Transfers of unspent funds between providers no longer occurs from 1 September 2021</li>
		</ul>
<p>There are no changes to how and when providers inform Services Australia of the CW unspent amounts. Providers can continue to inform Services Australia of the CW unspent amount within 70 days after the departure date via the home care monthly claims reconciliation process. The claim can be submitted via either the Aged Care Provider Portal (ACPP) or the paper format channel. </p>

<p>There are no changes to the calculation and administration of the Care Recipient portion of the unspent amount. Services Australia has no visibility of the Care Recipient portion of the unspent amount upon the care recipient’s departure. See <a href="../older-australians/065-13010010-01.html#bp01_L2GT_Care_Recipient_01">Care Recipient portion of unspent home care amount</a> for further information. </p>

<p>Prior to 1 September 2021, an unspent home care amount was broken down into 3 categories&#58;</p>

The CW portion </li>
		<li>
The Care Recipient portion</li>

<p>The Commonwealth (CW) portion is the unspent amount attributed to the home care subsidy paid to a provider for a care recipient.</p>

<p>The provider is responsible for the identification and management, including the calculation, of any CW unspent amount in respect of the care recipient.</p>

<p>If the service opts to return the CW unspent amount, or if the care recipient departs from the service (for any reason including transfer to another service of the same provider) the provider must calculate the unspent amount(s) to determine the portion to be returned to the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>The provider must inform Services Australia of the CW unspent amount within 70 days after the departure date via the home care monthly claims reconciliation process. </p>

<p>On 1 September 2021, the time providers have to make changes to a home care event changed. Providers have a limit of 70 days after the departure date. This applies to care recipients who have departed from home care and all home care event types. </p>

<p>For changes to an event prior to 1 September 2021, providers have a limit of 2 years after the end of a payment period. This applies to all care recipients, regardless of the care recipient’s care status.  </p>

<p>For changes beyond the 70 day or 2 year periods, providers can email their request to the Aged Care Payments Team (Aged Care and Allied Health Branch). All requests must include relevant supporting evidence. </p>

<p>Service Officers must be satisfied the request to change an event beyond the 70 days or 2 years period is a result of&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
an administrative error made by the Commonwealth or an agent of the Commonwealth, or</li>

determining the circumstances of a care recipient are different from those on the basis the subsidy was claimed </li>

<p>Transfers of Commonwealth (CW) portion of unspent funds between providers no longer occur from 1 September 2021. This includes transfers between services under the same provider. </p>

<p>Prior to 1 September 2021, the Transfer portion was the sum of the CW portion and Care Recipient portion. The existing provider transferred the Transfer portion to the new provider in specified circumstances. The aged care legislation did not regulate how this transfer occurred. The Transfer portion was a matter for both providers, with no direct involvement of the Commonwealth. The Transfer portion amount was not reportable and/or viewable to Services Australia.</p>

<p>Where an existing provider was notified within 56 days that the care recipient had entered into a new home care agreement with another provider&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the ceasing provider had paid the Transfer portion of the unspent home care amount and issued a copy of the written notice to the new provider within 70 days after the departure date, and</li>
		<li>
on receipt of the Transfer portion, the new provider had identified the transferred funds in the care recipient’s next monthly statement</li>
			<ul>			<li>
This allowed transparency for care recipients that is, the care recipient being advised that their new provider had received the Transfer portion </li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> in the event that the care recipient moved again to a different provider prior to 1 September 2021, the accumulated unspent amount was transferred to the new provider.</p>

<p>After 1 September 2021, any remaining CW portion of unspent funds must be returned to Services Australia when a care recipient departs for any reason (including transfers between services under the same provider). Providers will continue to transfer the Care Recipient portion of unspent amount if the care recipient moves to another home care service. </p>
