<p>If a customer contacts to check the progress of their new claim the Service Officer is to view the YAL OLC Claim Progress or the AUS OLC Claim Progress <strong>DOC</strong> on the Document List (<strong>DL</strong>) screen. This <strong>DOC</strong> will provide information on the progress of the claim. Encourage customers to subscribe to Electronic Messaging in order to receive targeted messaging relating to their claim progress and advised to monitor their claim tracker in their online account or Express Plus Centrelink mobile app.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> following the release of Process Direct, staff can no longer view claim details via the Activity List (<strong>AL</strong>) screen.</p>

<p><strong>Identifying if a claim is for a student, Australian Apprentice or Youth Allowance (YA) job seeker</strong></p>

<p>Claim progress <strong>DOC</strong>s for online and Assisted Customer Claims (ACC) includes identical text for different claim types, making it difficult to identify the claim type for that customer.</p>

<p>For YA claims, <strong>DOC</strong>s will display in the <strong>Extra Details Summary Line</strong>, as either&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
YAL OLC Claim Progress, or</li>
		<li>
YAL OLC Claim Progress YAAA for YAL STU with digital Activity Agreement included</li>
		<li>
YAL ACC Claim Progress for YA (job seeker) Assisted Customer Claims (ACC), and</li>
		<li>
AUS OLC Claim Progress for Austudy claim</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>To view claim details</strong></p>

<p>The information provided by the customer in the online claim or ACC can be viewed by Service Officers. See <a target="_blank" href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-12000000-01.html">Process Direct</a> for information about how to access this.</p>

<p><strong>Claim Tracker</strong></p>

<p>When a customer submits a claim online, they receive an estimated date of completion. Whenever a customer accesses their Centrelink online account, if they have an outstanding student claim they can monitor its progress via a claim tracker, which is on <strong>My online claims</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Customer identified as being in hardship</strong></p>

<p>If a customer advises they are in financial hardship, Service Officers must follow the process outlined in <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-03020070-01.html">Request for urgent processing of a new claim when experiencing financial hardship</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Customer wishes to withdraw claim</strong></p>

<p>Where the customer wishes to withdraw their online claim, encourage the customer to withdraw their own claim via online services.</p>

<p>To withdraw a claim on behalf of a customer, see <a target="_blank" href="../initial-contact-general/106-03040050-01.html">Withdrawal of claims</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Rejected claim</strong></p>

<p>When the claim is rejected, explain the decision to the customer. It is important the customer understands why their claim was rejected.</p>

<p>If the customer provides more information to support their claim within 13 weeks of the date they were notified of the decision to reject, the claim will be reassessed automatically. There is no need for the customer to apply for a formal review of the decision.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; where a claim is rejected and a customer submits a subsequent claim within 13 weeks of the initial claim rejection&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
check that the customer maintained qualification throughout, and if so&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
reassess the rejected claim</li>
			<li>
mark the subsequent claim as <strong>Not Required</strong></li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>The customer <a href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/109-02000000-03.html">may request a further explanation or apply for a formal review of the decision</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Activity Agreement</strong></p>

<p>YA tertiary students, who advise within the online claim&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they have only 1 previous uncompleted tertiary course, and </li>
		<li>
they have not withdrawn or failed due to exceptional circumstances </li>

<p>will be subject to a YA Activity Agreement within the online claim. If a YA Activity Agreement is required, the system will display a personalised agreement with a declaration and allow the customer to agree/disagree. All information is available within the <strong>Claim Overview</strong> in Process Direct.</p>

<p>In the following circumstances Service Officers must negotiate the Activity Agreement manually </p>
		<ul>		<li>
the study information provided in the online claim is incorrect,</li>
		<li>
where the customer withdrew/failed due to exceptional circumstances or</li>
		<li>
there are multiple uncompleted tertiary courses</li>
		</ul>
<p>See <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-06090030-01.html">Negotiating an Activity Agreement for Youth Allowance (YA) students returning to study after discontinuing a previous course</a> for more information.</p>

<p><strong>Independence</strong></p>

<p>The questions in the Independence Module are dynamic, and may display differently for different customers. This is because the online claim can identify some information already on the customer file, or information provided by the customer in another part of the claim.</p>

<p>The independence question set will not be asked if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer has previously been assessed as independent for a non-reviewable reason, or</li>
		<li>
earlier answers provided within the claim indicate the customer is independent, for example they are married or member of a de facto relationship lasting 12 months or more</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Unreasonable to Live at Home (UTLAH) under 18</strong></p>

<p>Initiate <a target="_blank" href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-12030020-01.html">case consultation with the service centre social worker</a> if the customer is aged 15 years or under as soon as possible prior to any assessment of the claim being made.</p>

<p>If the customer is 16-17 years of age and indicates it is unreasonable to live at home the customer will usually be required to book a UTLAH appointment with the Social Work Assessment Network (SWAN) as a mandatory task on the <strong>Next Steps</strong> page. A <strong>DOC</strong> with the unique identifier of <strong>SUBOCUTL</strong> will create on claim submission.</p>

<p>An alternate UTLAH independence question set will be asked if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer claims within 52 weeks of last receiving YA, and</li>
		<li>
they have a previous UTLAH assessment (which has not been end dated), and</li>
		<li>
it is still unreasonable for the customer to live at home</li>
		</ul>
<p>The customer will be asked if they have returned home to live with parent(s) or guardian(s) for a period greater than 14 days and if they have received continuous support from their parent(s) or guardian(s). Customers who are subject to the alternate question set and have not returned to the parental home for more than 14 days, and indicate they are not receiving continuous support from their parent/s will have UTLAH automatically re-applied and will not have to attend an appointment with a social worker.</p>

<p><strong>UTLAH over 18 but under 22</strong></p>

<p>If the customer is 18 years or over and indicates it is unreasonable to live at home, the Over 18 UTLAH team will conduct an assessment. A <strong>DOC</strong> with the unique identifier of O18 will create on claim submission.</p>

<p>An alternate UTLAH independence question set will be asked if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer claims within 52 weeks of last receiving YA, and</li>
		<li>
they have a previous UTLAH assessment (which has not been end-dated), and</li>
		<li>
it is still unreasonable for the customer to live at home</li>
		</ul>
<p>The customer will be asked if they have returned home to live with parent(s) or guardian(s) for a period greater than 2 weeks and if they have received continuous support from their parent(s) or guardian(s). Customers who are subject to the alternate question set and have not returned to the parental home for more than 14 days, and indicate they are not receiving continuous support from their parent/s will have UTLAH automatically re-applied and an assessment by the O18 UTLAH team will not be necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Providing evidence of independence</strong></p>

<p>The customer may be asked to provide evidence of their independence at <strong>Next Steps</strong>. The claim will automatically determine if evidence is required. For example, a customer will not be asked to provide evidence if, for independence through work reasons, they indicate the only evidence type is payslips/payroll report. They will be asked to retain the evidence for a period of 2 years.</p>

<p><strong>Dependent upon a parent(s)/guardian(s)</strong></p>

<p>If the customer has indicated they are not independent and are dependent upon a parent(s)/guardian(s), questions will be presented to determine who their parent(s) is/are for the purpose of the Parental Means Test.</p>

<p><strong>Away from home rate</strong></p>

<p>If the customer has indicated in their address details questions they are living away from home, questions will be presented to determine if the away from home rate is payable. See <a href="../job-seekers/001-04040000-01.html">The away from home rate for Youth Allowance (YA) customers</a>.</p>

<p>Based on their selection, the customer will be asked further questions on following pages.</p>

<p>If they select any of the work related circumstances, they must indicate if they are still employed, date they last worked (if they have ceased work) and details of their former employment such as the employer's name and contact details.</p>

<p>The activity they were engaged in prior to claim may affect the start date of their payments, see <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-05010010-01.html">Calculating the start day general rule</a>.</p>

<p>If the customer was previously working and has received a termination payment, they may be subject to an <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-05020020-01.html">Income Maintenance Period (IMP)</a>.</p>

<p>Customers are only required to provide an Employment Separation Certificate (SU001) for a Student or Apprentice claim if they or their partner (if applicable), have indicated in their online claim they have received or are expecting to receive leave or redundancy payments from an employer.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> a customer may have to provide multiple separation certificates if they received or expect to receive leave or redundancy payments from more than 1 employer.</p>

<p>The online claim will identify if an Employment Separation Certificate is required and request this as part of the Next Steps process within the online claim. However, within the online claim questions, if a customer indicates they do not have an Employment Separation Certificate, the online claim will display a message stating, &quot;I understand I need to provide this as soon as possible.&quot;</p>

<p>To determine if there is a requirement to obtain an Employment Separation Certificate, check what information has been requested under the <strong>Tasks</strong> icon within Process Direct.</p>

<p>The <strong>Tasks</strong> screen icon displays tasks, for example, documents the customer has been requested to provide. If the document has been returned online, a hyperlink will display in a blue box. Online modules submitted for the claim will also display. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> scanned documents or those submitted through Upload documents online will display on the <strong>Documents</strong> screen.</p>

<p>The <strong>Documents</strong> screen icon displays scanned documents. This includes documents received through Upload documents online.</p>

<p>If there are nil requests for an Employment Separation Certificate, this confirms the customer has advised leave or redundancy payments have not been received and as a result, an Employment Separation Certificate is not required.</p>

<p><strong>An Employment Separation Certificate is required</strong> if the response shows&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
'I have received, or expect to receive, leave or redundancy payments from this employer', or if partnered</li>
		<li>
'&lt;partner's name&gt; has received, or expects to receive, leave or redundancy payment from this employer'</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>An Employment Separation Certificate is not required</strong> if the response(s) shows&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
'I have not received nor expect to receive any leave or redundancy payments from this employer', and if partnered</li>
		<li>
'&lt; partner's name&gt; has not received nor expects to receive any leave or redundancy payments'</li>
		</ul>
<p>If a customer who is over 21 and completed full-time or part-time student in the previous study period, and now intends to be a full-time student in the next study period, will be entitled to receive payment as an intending student from the date of claim. New students can only be paid from the date the course starts.</p>

<p>Australian Apprentices can only be paid from the later of the date of claim or the date they have a current Commonwealth registration number.</p>

<p>This page displays&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a list of <strong>Required</strong> and <strong>Supplementary</strong> tasks</li>
		<li>

<p>Parents do not have to be authenticated or provide a Customer Reference Number (CRN) to complete the online MOD JY.</p>

<p>Parents who are authenticated must search for <strong>Advise Parental Income</strong> in the menu. They will be taken directly to the <strong>Verification Code</strong> page and will have any known data re-used or pre-populated. The verification code provided to the customer on the <strong>Next steps</strong> page is used to identify the child for which the parent is providing the information.</p>

<p>Parents who are unauthenticated must search for Advise Parental Income in the search field from the homepage. They will have to enter their personal details, and CRN (if available), before the <strong>Verification code</strong> page displays.</p>

<p>The number of questions asked will vary depending on if the parents are in receipt of an Income Support Payment (ISP) and if the parents have previously provided parental income for the appropriate tax year. Income information already held on record will not display to the parent but will upload during claim processing.</p>

<p>This service replaces the paper Mod JY and gathers the following details&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
other dependent children</li>
		<li>
payment destination (if the YA customer is under 18)</li>
		<li>
income details, unless parent(s)/guardian(s) currently on ISP or their income has been verified as part of Family Tax Benefit reconciliation</li>
		<li>
maintenance income</li>		</ul>
