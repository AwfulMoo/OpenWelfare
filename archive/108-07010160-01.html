<P>This document outlines the eligibility requirements of the employment income nil rate period provision. This provision enables a customer to retain certain benefits, such as a concession card when their rate of income support payment is nil due to the effect of the Income Test. This only occurs when the customer's total ordinary income <STRONG>includes</STRONG> employment income.</P>

<H2 id=_Toc344898764>Eligibility and duration of employment income nil rate period</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>A customer may qualify for an employment income nil rate period if their social security pension or benefit is not payable because of ordinary income, made up entirely or partly of employment income and they:</P>
<UL>
<LI>are receiving a social security pension or benefit, except:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>Special Benefit (<A href="https://guides.dss.gov.au/social-security-guide/acronyms#spb">SpB</A>) customers, or</LI>
<LI>Parenting Payment Partnered (PPP) customers of Age Pension age</LI></UL>
<LI>remain qualified for their social security pension or benefit, including meeting the employment qualifications (employment qualifications exist for Jobseeker Payment (<A href="https://guides.dss.gov.au/social-security-guide/acronyms#jsp">JSP</A>), Carer Payment (<A href="https://guides.dss.gov.au/social-security-guide/acronyms#cp">CP</A>), Disability Support Pension (<A href="https://guides.dss.gov.au/social-security-guide/acronyms#dsp">DSP</A>) and Youth Allowance (<A href="https://guides.dss.gov.au/social-security-guide/acronyms#ya">YA</A>) (job seeker)), and</LI>
<LI>continue to satisfy the payability provisions for their social security pension or benefit, except for being not payable due to the income</LI></UL>
<P>A zero rate applies for 6 full fortnights of the employment income nil rate period, see <A href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010160-05.html">Resources</A> for examples.</P>
<P>A customer may have multiple income nil rate periods without having to reclaim if basic qualification for the income support payment is still met.</P>
<P>There is no limit to how many times a customer can enter an employment income nil rate period.</P>
<P>The employment income nil rate period applies to other payments including Austudy and Youth Allowance (YA) students.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<P>The employment nil rate period applies to Age Pension age customers in receipt of a pension.</P>
<P>Pensioners of Age Pension age who are not payable under the Income Test due to employment income will have their:</P>
<UL>
<LI>payment automatically suspended, and</LI>
<LI>status shows as CZR (Current Zero Rate)</LI></UL>
<P>If a customer over Age Pension age is paid employment income that is enough to pay a nil rate, they are to be offered the choice of cancellation or temporary suspension (CZR). Tell the customer of the benefits and disadvantages of each.</P>
<P><STRONG>Cancellation:</STRONG></P>
<UL>
<LI>Pensioner Concession Card (PCC) is cancelled, but the customer may access:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card (CSHC)</LI>
<LI>the quarterly supplement, and</LI>

<LI>PCC remains current but the customer may miss out on bonuses targeted to customers getting a pension and CSHC holders only</LI>
<LI>The customer does not need to reclaim when payable, but payment will cancel if still not payable after 12 weeks</LI></UL>
<P>The employment income nil rate period allows for 6 <STRONG>full</STRONG> fortnights at nil rate after the first affected entitlement period due to income, that is:</P>

<P>Customers who get loan payments under the <A href="../older-australians/065-08000000-01.html">Home Equity Access Scheme</A> will continue to get their regular fortnightly loan payments even if the qualifying pension payment stops due to employment income.</P>
<P>Where the pension payment cancels, suspends or reduces to nil rate due to employment income, the pension status will automatically adjust to CZR (Current Zero Rate) for reason PLS.

<P>If the customer is:</P>

This is applied before the employment nil rate period is applied</LI></UL>
<P>A job seeker who is in a current employment income nil rate period, whether due to their own or their partner's income does not have mutual obligation requirements. In other words, if the customer's income support payment reduces to nil, all their mutual obligations requirements are deemed to be satisfied.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<H2 id=_Toc344898764>During the employment income nil rate period</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>The customer must remain qualified for their income support payment during the employment income nil rate period. If qualification is lost during the employment income nil rate period, the payment is to be cancelled from the date that qualification stops. For example:</P>
<UL>
<LI>If a JobSeeker Payment (JSP) customer starts working in a full time job expected to last for at least 6 fortnights, they are no longer unemployed and payment should be cancelled once any <A href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07020000-01.html">Working Credits are depleted</A><BR><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> this does not apply to JSP or YA (Other) customers who are employed under the <A href="../job-seekers/001-17030800-01.html">Youth Bonus Wage Subsidy (YBWS)</A> initiative. These customers will automatically suspend for 26 weeks instead of cancelling</LI>
<LI>If a <A href="../people-with-disability/008-03100010-01.html">Disability Support Pension (DSP) customer commences working</A> for 30 hours per week or more at the relevant minimum wage, they will not be entitled to the employment income nil rate period. However, <A href="../people-with-disability/008-03100010-01.html">payment may be suspended for up to 2 years</A></LI></UL>
<P>For Parenting Payment (PP) customers (under Age Pension age):</P>
<UL>
<LI>an employment income nil rate period can continue if their relationship status changes, and</LI>
<LI>their PP is reassessed (transfers between PPS and PPP)</LI></UL>
<P>However, an employment income nil rate period ends if a customer loses qualification for their payment and transfers to another income support payment. For example, a PPS customer's youngest dependent child turns 8 and they transfer to JSP.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<H2 id=_Toc344898764>Reporting income</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>During the employment income nil rate period a customer who would normally report fortnightly must continue to report fortnightly. Failure to report will result in the cancellation of payment. The payment can be restored if they report their employment income at a later date. An exemption to this is for payments that can no longer be claimed.</P>
<P>Care needs to be taken for payments that can no longer be claimed. If the customer's payment is cancelled due to a failure to report income these payments cannot be reclaimed even if it is still within the employment income nil rate period. This applies to payment of JSP at the transitional Wife Pension (WP) rate. In this case, the customer will need to test their eligibility for another payment.</P>
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> if the customer's payment cancels due to failure to report income <STRONG>due to staff error</STRONG> (for example, the income was coded but the payment was not stimulated) then the payment can be restored.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>If an allowance customer has returned to full time work, their payments will cancel once their Working Credits have been depleted. This is because they are no longer entitled to the employment income nil rate period due to a lack of qualification. If their partner is on Parenting Payment Partnered (PPP), the system will:</P>
<UL>
<LI>SUS-INV the PPP customer's payments</LI>
<LI>automatically send an income estimate form for customer to complete for FTB and CCS estimate of income details update</LI>
<LI>create a manual follow up to check PPP entitlement</LI></UL>
<P>As the PPP customer <STRONG>is</STRONG> entitled to the employment income nil rate period if under Age Pension age, the PPP will need to be restored if there are no other changes to their entitlement. Smart Centre Call Service Officers can do this once the customer's entitlement is established.</P>
<P>If the partner's payment is not dependent on the customer being current, the partner's entitlement needs to be assessed based on the payment that they are getting for:</P>
