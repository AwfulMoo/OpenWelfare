<p>A couple is considered to be an <strong>illness separated</strong> couple where&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they are unable to live together in their home, and</li>
		<li>
the inability to live together&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
is due to illness or infirmity of either or both of them, and</li>
			<li>
results in their living expenses being greater or are likely to be greater than otherwise, and is likely to continue <strong>indefinitely</strong></li>

<p><strong>Aspects to consider when assessing if the customer is a member of an illness separated couple&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Inability to live at home due to illness or infirmity&#58;</strong></li>
			<ul>			<li>
it is not the intention that medical evidence is required for the majority of assessments</li>
			<li>
for entry to an aged care home, the RCA Institution (<strong>RIS</strong>) screen can be used to verify entry into residential care by checking <strong>Admission Date</strong> and <strong>Care Type&#58;</strong> Residential</li>
			<li>
for a <strong>Supported Residential Service (SRS)</strong>, a copy of the Residential Statement should be requested to confirm the level of care provided to the customer</li>
			<li>
retirement villages do not usually provide care. If the customer advises they are receiving care from a retirement village, a copy of the care plan should be requested</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Living expenses&#58;</strong></li>
			<ul>			<li>
ask the customer if their living expenses have increased or are likely to increase due to illness separation, noting that it is not the intention that evidence of the customer's living expenses pre and post illness separation be obtained</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Indefinite separation&#58;</strong></li>
			<ul>			<li>
determine if the illness is indefinite, noting that 'likely to continue indefinitely' generally means it is highly probable, based on available evidence that the term of the separation is for a period of time that is unknown or unstated</li>
			</ul>			</ul>

<p>When assessing the customer's circumstances it may become apparent that the customer is not simply an illness separated couple but they may be either living separately and apart due to 1 member of a couple being institutionalised due to a severe and debilitating illness <strong>or</strong> they are genuinely living separately and apart on a permanent or indefinite basis.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Living separately and apart due to 1 member of a couple being institutionalised due to a severe and debilitating illness.</strong> An assessment of living separately and apart in this circumstance can <strong>only</strong> be made if&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the incapacity of the institutionalised partner is severe, debilitating and of a permanent nature, for example, Huntington's disease, advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease, and</li>
			<li>
the institutionalised partner is totally and permanently incapable of providing their partner with such things as companionship, comfort, physical, intellectual or emotional support</li>
			<li>
evidence of the permanent or indefinite separation must be provided from the nursing home or approved institution, together with medical evidence on the type and severity of the illness</li>
			<li>
separation can be a sensitive topic for some customers, particularly elderly couples who may not be able to emotionally disconnect from their partner, regardless of the financial impacts. If a customer still strongly believes and states that they are a member of a couple with their partner, the records are not to be unlinked. In these situations, the customer and partner will still be considered to be an illness separated couple</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Genuinely living separately and apart</strong> on a permanent or indefinite basis as there has been an estrangement or breakdown in their relationship - this requirement must consider both a physical and emotional separation between the customer and their partner</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Considerations when assessing a customer as living separately and apart due to 1 member of a couple being institutionalised due to a severe and debilitating illness</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
'Living separately and apart on a permanent or indefinite basis' should not generally be accepted if the couple are living apart solely due to ill health. All other options should be explored before it has been determined that the couple are living separately and apart. <a href="../separated-parents/277-50070020-04.html#bp04_L2GT_Policy">References</a> has links to the Social Security Guide</li>
		<li>
Careful consideration <strong>must</strong> be given to correctly assess the customer's circumstances as it directly impacts on their entitlements and rate of income support payment</li>
		<li>
Care <strong>must</strong> be taken to ensure the consequences of the decision when assessing a customer <strong>as living separately and apart due to 1 member of a couple being institutionalised due to a severe and debilitating illness</strong> are discussed with the customer prior to unlinking.
