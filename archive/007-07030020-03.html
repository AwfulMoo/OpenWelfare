<p>A customer can select a NSD for their PPL period that is after their JobKeeper Payment period, <strong>only </strong>where they have not returned to work.</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of PPL customers who are eligible for JobKeeper Payment to advise their employers the <strong>start date</strong> and <strong>end date</strong> of their <strong>PPL period</strong> (not the dates PPL was received) to ensure they are not overpaid JobKeeper Payment.</p>

<p>If a customer currently receiving PPL advises they are receiving JobKeeper Payment for the same period, advise the customer that they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
are <strong>not</strong> entitled to receive the payments at the same time, and</li>

customer's PPL is not yet current, they may request to change their NSD. See <a href="../families/007-05040020-01.html">Customer notifies a change of circumstances for Parental Leave Pay (PPL)</a></li>
		<li>
customer wants to receive JobKeeper Payment instead of PPL and their PPL claim has not yet been determined, the customer can withdraw their claim. See <a href="../families/007-07030160-01.html">Not effective, rejection or withdrawal of claim for Parental Leave Pay (PPL)</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>Service Officers are not required to contact the customer to discuss PPL entitlement in relation to JobKeeper Payment. JobKeeper Payment does not preclude PPL entitlement, however, PPL does preclude entitlement to JobKeeper Payment for the same period. Customers with queries in relation to JobKeeper Payment entitlement are to be directed to discuss with their employer.</p>

<p>A customer cannot receive a COVID-19 Disaster Payment if they are receiving PPL on any day during the COVID-19 Disaster Payment relevant period.</p>

<p>For more information on eligibility for COVID-19 Disaster Payment, see <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-21071931-01.html">COVID-19 Disaster Payment</a>.</p>

<p>If a customer is claiming PPL as a primary claimant and it is identified that they are, or have been, receiving a COVID-19 Disaster Payment since the date of birth/adoption of their child, contact them to advise&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they are not entitled to receive COVID-19 Disaster Payment at the same time as PPL, and</li>
		<li>
if they have been on paid or unpaid leave from their employer for any period before or since the birth of their child, they are not entitled to COVID-19 Disaster Payment for any relevant period where their paid or unpaid leave covers every day of that relevant period</li>
		</ul>
<p>If, after a discussion with the customer it is determined they were eligible for COVID-19 Disaster Payment before or after the date of birth i.e. they were actually due to work during the relevant periods, but they were unable to due to the restricted movement&#58;</p>

they could still claim COVID-19 Disaster Payment, and </li>
		<li>
nominate a future PPL period that does not overlap any of their eligible COVID-19 Disaster Payment relevant periods</li>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a customer is eligible for COVID-19 Disaster Payment, receiving the payment will not count as a return to work unless the customer actually returned to work/duties.</p>

If the customer is receiving automatic payments, these will need to stop.

PPL will auto-reject in most cases, based on details keyed. If the claim is not auto-rejecting because information within the online claim needs to be updated or corrected, staff workflows can be added to update the information within an online claim. See <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-06045020-01.html">Social Applications</a>. If appropriate, <a href="../families/007-07030160-01.html">manually reject</a></li>

<p>Employers must <a href="../families/007-09010020-01.html">deliver the PPL period plus any connected Flexible PPL days to their eligible employees</a>. If the employer cannot do this, it will be delivered by Services Australia.</p>

<p>To view employer delivery details, </p>

<p><strong>In Process Direct</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Use <strong>Super Key</strong> to go to the PPL Employer Notified Details (<strong>P1ERD</strong>) screen </li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>In Customer First</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
select <strong>Workspace </strong>&gt;<strong> Claim Contacts </strong>&gt;<strong> Paid Parental Leave claim summary</strong> to access the PPL Claim Summary (<strong>P1CS</strong>) page </li>
		<li>
Go to the <strong>Paid Parental Leave Employer Notified Details</strong> (<strong>P1ERD</strong>) by placing an ‘<strong>N</strong>’ next to the claim to view the employer details.</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer meets the criteria to have their PPL period delivered by their current employer, and the employer has <a href="../business-and-employers/043-02040010-01.html">pre-registered for PPL</a>, an acceptance letter will auto-generate to the employer and the claim will have a status of <strong>PPL/ASS-EIA</strong> awaiting the employer acceptance.</p>

<p>Is the PPL and connected Flexible PPL days to be delivered by the employer?</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>, once acceptance has been received from the employer, the customer's benefit status will be updated to <strong>PPL/ASS-PCB</strong> (pending proof of birth/entry into care) or <strong>PPL/ASS-ASD</strong> if the confirmation of birth or entry to care has already been received. The customer's letter will confirm PPL is to be provided by the employer</li>
		<li>
<strong>No</strong>, if the PPL and Flexible PPL days cannot be delivered by the employer, the payments will be delivered by Services Australia. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> requests are received from PPL customers specifying their employer(s) as their requested payer when it has been determined Services Australia will be providing their PPL. Although the customer's employer may not be legally required to provide the customer's PPL, they may elect to do so. Encourage the customer to discuss this option with their employer. The employer must register with Services Australia and opt in to provide PPL <strong>before</strong> the customer submits their claim</li>
		</ul>
<p>For more information about how PPL is delivered to customers by their employer or Services Australia, see <a href="../families/007-09010020-01.html">Delivery of Parental Leave Pay (PPL)</a>.</p>
