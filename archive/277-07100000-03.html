<p>If a parent's adjusted taxable income (ATI) used in the child support assessment includes additional income earned after separation, the parent can apply to have this income excluded. Parents must show that the income to be excluded was earned in accordance with a pattern of earnings established after they separated and outside of the 'ordinary course of events'.</p>

<p>Applications may be made in writing (<a target="_blank" class="extwebsitelink" href="https&#58;//www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/forms/cs4120">Application for post separation income to be excluded</a> CS4120), over the phone, via the Services Australia website or in person.

<p>Check the case to determine the expiry date.</p>

<p><strong>Is the expiry date within 28 days of the PSI application being received?</strong></p>

<div class="showcont">


<p>Ask the applicant the following questions&#58;</p>

<p><strong>Question 1</strong></p>

<p><strong>Did the applicant and other parent live together for at least 6 months?</strong></p>

<p>The applicant must provide, or confirm, if this information is already recorded by child support&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the last date they separated from the other parent before the application for administrative assessment was made, and</li>
		<li>
the date they started living together on a genuine domestic basis before that separation</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Question 2</strong></p>

<p><strong>Have the applicant and other parent been separated for more than 3 years?</strong></p>

<p>The parent can only apply within 3 years of separation, and if their application is granted, post-separation income can only be excluded for a maximum of 3 years after separation. The 3 year period is not extended if there is a period of reconciliation of less than 6 months (during such a period of reconciliation, the assessment can be suspended). See also</p>

<p><a href="../separated-parents/277-03110000-01.html">Suspension of child support liability on reconciliation</a>. </p>

<p>If the parents reconcile for a period longer than 6 months, their child support assessment will end. If they separate again and make a new application for assessment, a new PSI application could be lodged in relation to the new separation date. However, all the relevant tests would apply in relation to the new separation date.</p>

<p><strong>Question 3</strong></p>

<p><strong>Are the applicant and other parent still separated?</strong></p>

<p>The applicant and the other parent must still be separated at the time of the application. Confirm this by checking the case Involvement List in Cuba. Ensure the case between the applicant and other customer is still active.</p>

<p>The <a>References </a>page has a link to more information about the 3 requirements in the Child Support Guide Chapter 2.5.2&#58; Additional income earned post separation.</p>

<p>Service Officers must be satisfied the applicant meets the 3 requirements listed above. Check the <strong>External Information</strong> window in Cuba to confirm the parents' relationship details&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Cuba - check the Relationship window as there may be marriage or living together dates recorded. The External Information window could also have information from Centrelink about the parents' relationship, and</li>
		<li>
Centrelink - a CSU request could be completed to confirm what date the parents began living together and then separated. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> information that is available on Cuba must not be requested from Centrelink. For help determining what information can be requested from Centrelink see also <a href="../separated-parents/277-04080000-01.html">Centrelink - Child Support information exchange</a>.</li>
		</ul>
<p>If these checks do not match the information given by the applicant, contact the other parent. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-01010000-01.html">Contact with Child Support customers</a>. If the other parent cannot be contacted by phone, send a <strong>CAL</strong> letter requesting contact.  See <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-30010400-01.html">Letters Cuba Process Help</a>.</p>

<p>If the other parent disputes the information the applicant has given or the other parent cannot be contacted, request evidence from the applicant. This evidence could include documentation confirming the dates the parents lived together and separated. For example, utility bills, rental tenancy documents. Give the applicant at least 7 days to provide their evidence. If the applicant does not provide evidence, make the decision using the information available.</p>

<p><strong>Is the Service Officer satisfied the applicant meets the 3 requirements?</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>, <a href="../separated-parents/277-07100000-03.html#bp03_tbl_PSI_application_Step05">go to Step 5</a></li>
		<li>
<strong>No</strong>, the application must be refused. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-07100000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Decision_determined_Step06">Step 6 in Table 3</a></li>		</ul>

<p>An application to exclude PSI can only be considered if the parent has been earning additional income after separation. If the parent has not been earning additional income or they began earning the additional income <strong>before</strong> separation, the application must be refused.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>The parents separated in December 2016. An application for a child support assessment is made and accepted in January 2017. The LRYI used in the assessment is 2015-16. The parent began earning additional income in January 2017. This additional income will be included in the 2016-17 ATI. The parent must wait until Child Support is using the 2016-17 income in the assessment to lodge their application to exclude the additional income.</p>

<p>Check the Client Income window to determine the income type used in the assessment. Ask the applicant the date they began earning the additional income. If the ATI used in the assessment does not include the additional income or the applicant began earning the additional income before separation, the application must be refused. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-07100000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Decision_determined_Step06">Step 6 in Table 3</a>.</p>

<p>If the applicant has earned additional income <strong>after</strong> separation and this additional income is included in the adjusted taxable income used in the current assessment, continue to next step.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the ATI which includes the additional income to be excluded does not have to be an ATO assessed income. However, Child Support must be satisfied of the accuracy of the income used in the assessment and be able to ascertain what part of that income is ‘additional income'. The ATI can be a parent supplied income or a derived income if Service Officers are satisfied that the income is accurate and the ‘additional income' component can be ascertained.</p>

<p>If a deemed or default income (2/3 Male Total Average Weekly Earnings (MTAWE), indexed default) is currently used in the assessment or the components of the ATI cannot be ascertained, PSI will not be able to be identified, therefore it cannot be excluded.</p>

<p>If a new income is received post application, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-07100000-03.html#bp03_L2GT_New_income_info01">Step 1 in Table 4</a>.</p>

<div class="showcont">


<p>Ask the applicant the amount of additional income they wish to exclude from the ATI used in the assessment. </p>

<p>If the income used in the assessment is an estimate, <a href="../separated-parents/277-07100000-03.html#bp03_tbl_PSI_application_Step07">go to Step 7</a>.</p>

<p>A customer may earn additional income by&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
working overtime</li>
		<li>
obtaining a second job</li>
		<li>
making a career change to a higher paying job</li>
		<li>
if self employed</li>
		<li>
extending opening hours of business</li>
		<li>
increasing production, or</li>
		<li>
developing new markets or new products</li>
		<li>
gaining or increasing investment income</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> while total net investment losses are included in a parent's ATI, an increase in the total loss is not considered additional income for the purposes of PSI. Only an increase to the amount of income received due to the parent's investment income may be considered when deciding whether the parent has additional income for the purposed of a PSI application. </p>

<p>Confirm the amount of additional income earned by comparing the parent's pre separation income to their PSI. Check ATO systems to determine the parent's taxable income prior to separation, see the <a href="../separated-parents/277-04370000-01.html">External searches guide (CS).</a> Use the last full financial year prior to separation for comparison.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>If the parents separated in December 2015 compare the 2014-15 (pre separation) income to the income used in the assessment. If the earnings were consistent throughout the 2014-15 financial year; or during the 2015-16 financial year between July and December 2015 (prior to separation), a direct comparison could be made. Where the parent's income had varied throughout the 2014-15 financial year; or during the 2015-16 financial year between July and December 2015 (prior to separation), the 2014-15 income will provide an indication of the pre separation earnings, however further investigation will be required to determine the parent's income immediately prior to separation.</p>

<p>If the parent's PSI is greater than their pre separation income due to the re-packaging of benefits such as a change to a previously reported superannuation amount, the parent ATI has not changed. See the example below for more details.</p>

<p>This is only applicable where the parent's child support assessment is based on their 2009-10 ATI or greater.</p>

<p>For WA ex-nuptial parents, reportable superannuation contributions and net financial investment losses with the exception of rental property losses will only be included in their ATI for child support periods that commence on or after 3 March 2011.</p>

<p>For example, an application is lodged by a parent advising their ATI has increased from $40,000 in the previous year to $50,000 currently. The parent advises they have changed their work situation to earn the additional $10,000 in order to support themselves post separation. The application is to exclude the additional $10,000 from their ATI for child support.</p>

<p>During the application process, the Service Officer finds that the parent previously had an arrangement with their employer to salary sacrifice $10,000 per annum into a superannuation fund in the parent's name. This reduced the parent's taxable income from $50,000 to $40,000. Since separation, the parent has ceased the salary-sacrifice arrangement with their employer opting to receive the money as part of their wages instead.</p>

<p>As the parent's ATI has not changed, the PSI application must be refused.</p>

<p>The additional income amount can also be calculated by looking at how much additional income the parent earned per pay period from the date the parent began earning the additional income to the end of the financial year in which the income was earned<strong>.</strong></p>

<p>For example, Mary's child support assessment is based on the 2012-13 ATI of $30,000. Mary started a 2nd job on 1 March 2013 and is earning an additional amount of $100 per week. From 1 March 2013 till 30 June 2013, Mary earned additional income of $1,600. The amount of $1,600 could be considered for exclusion from the 2012-13 income used in the assessment.</p>

<p>Service Officers must be satisfied of the accuracy of the additional income amount the applicant has claimed. </p>

<p>Where a parent has lodged an estimate of their income, they can make an application to exclude PSI if they are currently earning additional income. This is because the additional income is already being used in the assessment. </p>

<p>An applicant can lodge an estimate after Child Support has already accepted an application to exclude PSI. For their estimate to be accepted, it must be at least 15% less than the already-reduced ATI being used in their assessment. Once their estimate has been accepted, the parent may then apply again for post-separation income to be excluded, but their new ATI (provided in their estimate) must be more than they were earning prior to separation. This means it is unlikely that an application would be successful in these circumstances. For an estimate based scenario, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-07100000-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Examples">Examples in the Resources page</a>.</p>

<p>An accepted application will usually take effect from the date the PSI application was made. In special circumstances, the application to exclude additional income earned after separation can apply from the start of the child support period in which the application was lodged.</p>

<p>An accepted application to exclude PSI<strong> cannot</strong> be revoked. However, the parties can lodge a child support agreement which would override the PSI decision.</p>

<p>The post separation additional income amount excluded must not be more than 30% of the parent's ATI.</p>

<p>If the total amount of additional income earned is more than 30% of the ATI used in the assessment, only exclude 30% of the ATI.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>

<p>John’s additional income earned in 2013-14 has been calculated at $15,000. John's 2013-14 ATI was $40,000. 30% of $40,000 = $12,000. This is the maximum amount of additional income that could be excluded from the assessment. This means that while John earned additional income of $15,000, only $12,000 will be excluded from John's ATI.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>

<p>Mary's additional income earned in 2014-15 has been calculated at $1,600. Mary's 2014-15 ATI was $20,000. 30% of $20,000 = $6,000. This is the maximum amount of additional income that could be excluded. Therefore the full amount of Mary's additional income, that is $1,600, can be excluded from her ATI.</p>

<p>Seek Service Support Officer (SSO) support if assistance is required in determining the maximum amount of additional income to exclude. </p>

<p><strong>ATI can reduce to less than the pre separation income</strong></p>

<p>In some cases the applicant’s ATI can reduce to less than the pre separation income amount.  </p>

<p>If the requirements for excluding the additional income are met and the amount of the additional (post separation) income determined, the whole amount will be excluded (up to 30% of the ATI) even if this would reduce the ATI to an amount less than the pre-separation ATI. </p>

<p><strong>Example 3</strong></p>

<p>Abdul’s additional income earned in 2017-18 has been calculated at $16,000. Abdul’s 2017-18 ATI was $60,000. 30% of $60,000 = $18,000.  This is the maximum amount of income that can be excluded. Therefore the full amount of Abdul’s additional income, that is $16,000, can be excluded from the assessment.</p>

<p>Abdul’s ATI prior to separation was $50,000. The full amount of Abdul’s additional income can be excluded, reducing Abdul’s 2017-18 ATI to $44,000, which is less than Abdul’s pre separation ATI. </p>

<p>If the income decreases, but not less than the pre separation adjusted taxable income, the parent may still be eligible to have an amount of PSI excluded from their income. The amount may have decreased from the original approved amount.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>A PSI application was lodged and accepted. The parent’s PSI application was based on their pre separation income of $40,000 (2007-08 taxable) increasing to $50,000 post separation (ITD 2008-09). The approved PSI amount excluded was $14,000. The parent lodges their 2008-09 return, which produces an ATI of $45,000.

<p>If a parent lodges a tax return out of time, or a new ATI is determined after the parent could lodge their tax return on time, the PSI amount to be excluded may change. The application of the PSI amount to be excluded is split into 2 periods. See below&#58;</p>

<p><strong>Example - 30% rule applied to split periods</strong></p>

<p>If a parent lodges their tax return on time, a lower income will be applied to the entire period (as per <strong><a href="../separated-parents/277-07100000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Process_for_new_Step02">S</strong>tep 2</a> and <strong><a href="../separated-parents/277-07100000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Process_for_new_Step03">S</strong>tep 3</a>). If a parent lodges their tax return out of time, the lower income will only apply from the date of lodgement, except where special circumstances apply. See also <strong><a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-07010000-01.html">I</strong>ncome Processing - Lodgement Rules</a>.</p>

<p>A PSI application was lodged and accepted. The parent’s PSI application was based on their pre separation income of $20,000 (2014-15 taxable) increasing to $50,000 post separation (ITD 2015-16). The child support period commenced on 3 August 2009. The approved PSI amount excluded was $30,000, which was limited by the 30% rule to $15,000.</p>

<p>The parent lodges their 2015-16 taxable income out of time, on 9 March 2017, which comes in at $45,000. This has the following effect&#58;</p>

<p>3 August 2016 to 8 March 2017&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
income amount of $50,000 (2015-16 ITD) used in the assessment</li>
		<li>
PSI amount $15,000 excluded as the 30% rule applies ($50,000 x 30% = $15,000)</li>
		</ul>
<p>9 March 2017 to end of the child support period&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
taxable income of $45,000 used in the assessment, and</li>
		<li>
PSI amount of $13,500 excluded as the 30% rule applies ($45,000 x 30% = $13,500)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Conduct investigation and recalculate PSI</strong></p>

<p>In the above example, the parent’s ATO assessed income is less than their ITD. If this occurs, investigate the parent’s income to determine why the incomes differ. For example, the parent may have miscalculated relevant deductions.</p>

<p>Re-calculate the new PSI for split periods, to ensure the applicant's adjusted taxable income is not reduced by more than 30%.</p>

The parent had additional income of $14,000 but, due to the 30% cap, the approved PSI amount excluded was $12,000. The parent lodges their 2014-15 return, which produces an ATI of $50,000. As the ATI has increased, the full PSI amount of $14,000 can now be excluded without exceeding the cap.</p>

<p><strong>Conduct investigation and recalculate PSI</strong></p>

<p>Investigate the parent’s income to determine why the incomes differ. This may be due to miscalculation of relevant deductions.</p>
