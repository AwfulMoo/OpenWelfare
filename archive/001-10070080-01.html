<P>This document outlines the processes that apply when a job seeker fails to attend or satisfactorily participate in a compulsory activity.</P>
<P></P>

<H2 id=_Toc344898764>Requirement to attend and satisfactorily participate in compulsory activities</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Job seekers, including ParentsNext participants, receiving a participation payment are required to attend and participate in compulsory activities to help prepare them for the workforce. This excludes job seekers in <A href="../job-seekers/001-02140000-01.html">Community Development Program (CDP)</A> as activities are voluntary in CDP.</P>
<P>The job seeker's Job/Participation Plan sets out the compulsory activities they must attend and satisfactorily participate in.</P>
<P>Providers have responsibility for negotiating the compulsory activities included in the Job/Participation Plan with the job seeker. As part of this negotiation, job seekers are expected to take responsibility for discussing with their provider, circumstances that have the potential to impact on their ability to participate.</P>
<P>When negotiating a Job/Participation Plan, the provider must ensure:</P>
<UL>
<LI>compulsory activities are consistent with relevant legislation and policies</LI>
<LI>compulsory activities do not exceed the maximum hourly limits set in social security law</LI>
<LI>the job seeker's circumstances and assessed capacity have been appropriately considered</LI>
<LI>the job seeker is capable of meeting all the requirements in their Job/Participation Plan</LI></UL>
<P>If these conditions have not been considered when negotiating a job plan, job seekers cannot be compelled to attend or participate in the compulsory activities included in their Job/Participation Plan.</P>
<P>Once the Job/Participation Plan is agreed to, the job seeker is expected to:</P>
<UL>
<LI>participate in the activity on the scheduled days</LI>
<LI>be on time, and remain until the completion of the activity</LI>
<LI>satisfactorily participate in the activity</LI>
<LI>behave in an appropriate manner while participating in the activity, and</LI>
<LI>contact before the start time if they are unable to attend</LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<H2 id=_Toc344898764>Requirement to record own attendance - Targeted Compliance Framework</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Most job seekers are responsible for recording their own attendance at activities. The provider will determine if the job seeker is capable of doing so, and will record this in their Plan. Providers are responsible for assisting job seekers to access and use available system tools to record attendance at activities (or report attendance to their provider before close of business). Job seekers who are experiencing difficulties with recording their attendance should discuss this with their provider before close of business on the day of the activity.</P>
<P>When their provider has determined the job seeker is not capable of recording or reporting their own attendance, the provider is responsible for monitoring and recording the job seeker's attendance on a daily basis.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P></P>

<H2 id=_Toc344898764>Reporting absences and non-attendance</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Job seekers who are unable to attend an activity are required to notify their provider and explain why they are unable to attend/participate prior to the activity start time. This reflects the same expectations an employer would have of an employee.</P>
<P>Job seekers who need to arrive late or leave early from an activity on a specific day should discuss this with their provider or the activity coordinator.</P>
<P>When a job seeker fails to attend an activity, arrives late or leaves the activity early without reasonable excuse, will be managed using the <A href="../job-seekers/001-18030202-01.html">Targeted Compliance Framework</A>.</P>
<P>If the job seeker had a reasonable excuse but failed to make prior contact to explain why they were unable to attend an activity, or failed to discuss the need to arrive late/leave early beforehand, compliance action may still apply.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P></P>
<DIV class=twisty><A name=bp01_L2GT_Attendance_not_ class=anchor></A>
<H2 id=_Toc344898764>Attendance not required on a specific day</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>When the job seeker fails to comply with a compulsory activity in the Job/Participation Plan, that does not require attendance on a specific day, a mutual obligation failure is committed at the end of that fortnight. For example, when the job seeker does not undertake their compulsory activity to do 20 hours of private study per fortnight or 20 job searches per month, a mutual obligation failure is committed.</P>
<P>When an early school leaver fails to attend a course included in the Job Plan, compliance action may be applied. Compliance action is not appropriate if the job seeker is doing poorly in their course but they have a good attendance record.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<H2 id=_Toc344898764>Behave in an appropriate manner while participating in a compulsory activity</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Job seekers are required to behave in an appropriate manner while participating in an activity.</P>
<P>When inappropriate behaviour occurs while participating in a compulsory activity, the job seeker will be managed using <A href="../job-seekers/001-18030202-01.html">Targeted Compliance Framework</A>.</P>
<P>Misconduct or behaving inappropriately means failing to behave in accordance with the standards that would be expected in a workplace. This includes, but is not limited to:</P>
<UL>
<LI>not following reasonable instructions</LI>
<LI>being disruptive or uncooperative</LI>
<LI>behaving in a manner that is aggressive, violent or offensive</LI>
<LI>harassing other people</LI>
<LI>behaving in a manner that causes risk to the health and safety of themselves or other participants</LI>
<LI>being intoxicated or consuming intoxicants during the activity</LI>
<LI>behaving in a manner that may harm the reputation of the program</LI></UL>
<P>Generally this type of behaviour is only considered inappropriate when serious in nature, deliberate and within the job seeker's control.</P>
<P>If misconduct has occurred, a reasonable excuse assessment is not required because there is no reasonable excuse for behaviour that is within a job seeker's control. When misconduct is reported by a provider, if Services Australia establish the behaviour was not in the job seeker's control, free text is sent to the provider to ensure this can be considered for future servicing.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<H2 id=_Toc344898764>Managing non-compliance when a job seeker fails to attend or satisfactorily participate in a compulsory activity - Targeted Compliance Framework</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Under the Targeted Compliance Framework, when a job seeker fails to attend or satisfactorily participate in a compulsory activity, a mutual obligation failure has been committed. When a job seeker is required to record their own attendance but fails to do so, including when they attend but forget to record, a mutual obligation failure has also been committed and will be reported electronically to Services Australia by the Employment Services System (ESS).</P>
<P>Following a reported mutual obligation failure, participation payments are not payable until the job seeker contacts their provider and meets the reconnection requirement notified by the provider. Participation payments are cancelled if the reconnection requirement is not met within four weeks.</P>
<P>When a provider, or the ESS, reports the mutual obligation failure, the job seeker's participation payments are automatically suspended. The Services Australia system lifts the payment suspension when the provider electronically notifies the conditions for lifting the payment suspension have been met.</P>
<P>Job seekers in the green or warning zone will accrue one demerit if the provider is not satisfied the job seeker has a valid reason for failing to attend or satisfactorily participate in a compulsory activity. When the provider is able to establish that the job seeker attended but failed to record their attendance, a demerit will not be applied.</P>
<P>Job seekers in the financial penalty zone will incur a financial penalty, unless:</P>
<UL>
<LI>their provider closes the Non-Compliance Report (NCR) because they are satisfied the job seeker has a valid reason</LI>
<LI>Services Australia conducts a compliance investigation and establishes that the job seeker has reasonable excuse. Participation Solutions Team (PST) skilled Service Officers are responsible for conducting these compliance investigations</LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<DIV class=collapsible_container>

<P>The Job Seeker Compliance Model ensures Community Development Program (CDP) job seekers comply with their mutual obligation requirements. The model is a mix of incentives, deterrents and safety nets, intended to:</P>

<LI>protect vulnerable job seekers from incurring penalties for circumstances beyond their control</LI></UL>
