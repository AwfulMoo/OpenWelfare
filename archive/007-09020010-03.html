<P>To be eligible for PPL, a customer must be the primary carer of a PPL child.</P>
<P>The primary claimant can receive up to 18 weeks of PPL. This is 90 Payable days.</P>
<P>Primary claimants can claim the full amount for themselves or choose to:</P>
<UL>
<LI>transfer some or all of their PPL period to another person</LI>
<LI>give permission for another person to claim some or all of their Flexible PPL days, if their child is born or entrusted to their primary care on or after 1 July 2020</LI></UL>
<P>The other person must claim, have primary care of the child and be an eligible <A href="../families/007-09020020-01.html">secondary/tertiary claimant</A>.</P>
<P>Most often, the primary claimant will be the birth mother or the initial primary carer of an adopted child.

<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> primary claimants in exceptional circumstances can claim up to the full amount of PPL if they are eligible.

<P>Advise the customer they must provide <A href="../families/007-03010030-01.html">proof of the child's birth</A> or verification of the child entering the customer's care if this has not already been given to Services Australia. This includes proof of a stillborn child.</P>
<P><STRONG>Proof of entry to care for surrogacy</STRONG></P>
<P>For children who have entered the customer's care as a part of a surrogacy arrangement, the surrogacy agreement should be provided to confirm the surrogacy arrangement between the birth mother and the commissioning parents and include the care arrangements of the child.</P>
<P>The agreement should specify who will care for the child and the date the child will enter the care of the commissioning parent. The document should also establish whether the birth mother has relinquished care of the child.</P>
<P>If a determination cannot be made using the information provided, refer the case to the Service Support Officer (SSO) via the Direct Referral to SSO webform. The SSO may then determine a referral to the Level 2 Policy Helpdesk via the Online Form is required.</P>
<P>Before staff complete a referral they must ensure it contains all details of the surrogacy arrangement with any relevant documentation provided by the customer.</P>
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> surrogacy agreement referrals are only required as part of the post-birth claim process.</P>

<P>PPL can only be paid for one child in a multiple birth.</P>

<P>In these cases:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the customer must provide a letter from the doctor/midwife who attended the births confirming that the children were: </LI>

<LI>use the Direct Referral to SSO webform and the Level 2 Policy Helpdesk Online Query form with the letter from the doctor/midwife to refer the case. The <A href="../families/007-09020010-05.html">Resources</A> page contains links</LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P>The separate birthing events could be less than 5 days apart, but this would be confirmed by the doctor/midwife.</P>

<P><STRONG>Birth registration</STRONG></P>
<P>To be eligible for a newborn child, parent(s)/guardian(s) must notify the department that they have registered or applied to register the child's birth with the State/Territory Births registry. Customers may notify this verbally.</P>
