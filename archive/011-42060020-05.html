	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>There are 2 specific items that provide benefits for assistance at a caesarean section delivery. The general rules applying to assistant surgeon benefits apply to these items.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>51306 -</strong> Assistance at a delivery involving a Caesarean section. The item has a set fee and benefit</li>
		<li>
<strong>51309 -</strong> Assistance at a series or combination of operations which are identified by the word 'Assist' and assistance at a delivery involving Caesarean section</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where all the services that were performed in addition to the caesarean section are eligible for benefit for an assistant fee, the fees are calculated in the following manner&#58;</p>

<p><strong>Example A</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Caesarean - Schedule fee $800</li>
		<li>
Operation A (Assist) - Schedule fee $200</li>
		<li>
Operation B (Assist) - Schedule fee $100</li>
		<li>
Calculate the fee for the operations by applying the multiple operation rule as follows&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Caesarean - $8000 x 100% = $800</li>
			<li>
Operation A (Assist) - $200 x 100% - $200</li>
			<li>
Operation B (Assist) - $100 x 50% = $50</li>
			<li>
Total Schedule fee - $1050</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Calculate the derived fee for item 51309, that is, 20% of the total Schedule fee</li>
			<ul>			<li>
$1050 x 20% = $210</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> these are example figures only - access MBS for the current schedule fees.</p>

<p>Where not all the services that were performed in addition to the Caesarean section are eligible for an assistant fee, the claim should be assessed in the following manner&#58;</p>

<p><strong>Example B</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Caesarean - Schedule fee $800</li>
		<li>
Operation A (Assist) - Schedule fee $500</li>
		<li>
Operation B - Schedule fee $300.00</li>
		<li>
Operation C (Assist) - Schedule fee $100</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the surgeon's fee is obtained by basing the caesarean section at 100% of the Schedule fee and then applying the multiple operation rule to the remaining items as follows&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Caesarean - $800 x 100%</li>
		<li>
Operation A - $500 x 100%</li>
		<li>
Operation B - $300.00 x 50%</li>
		<li>
Operation C - $100 x 25%</li>
		<li>
To obtain the assistant's fee, reapply the multiple operation rule but only to those services for which an assistant fee is payable&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Caesarean - $800 x 100% = $800</li>
			<li>
Operation A (Assist) - $500 x 100% = $500</li>
			<li>
Operation C (Assist) - $100 x 50% = $50</li>
			<li>

<h3>Multiple operations</h3>


<p>Where multiple operations are performed and all the services are eligible for an assistant fee, the multiple operation rule applies. As outlined below, the aggregated total Schedule fee determines if an assistant fee is payable under item 51300 or 51303.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the total Schedule fee for assistance at operation in respect of multiple procedures must be calculated <strong>after</strong> the application of the multiple operations rule.</p>

<h3>Multiple operations where not all services are eligible for an assistance fee</h3>


<p>In some cases of multiple operations where assistance is given, some of the services are not eligible for an assistant fee because they do not have the word 'Assist' in their item description. In this situation, the multiple operation rule is applied to all the operations in the usual way, to determine the surgeon's fee. To determine the assistant's fee, the multiple operation formula is then re-applied but only to those services that are eligible for an assistant fee and at which assistance is rendered.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Multiple operation rule - Surgeon</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Item A - $300 x 100%</li>
			<li>
Item B - $250 x 50%</li>
			<li>
Item C - $200 x 25%</li>
			<li>
Item D - $150 x 25%</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Multiple operation rule - Assistant</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Item A (Assist) - $300 x 100%</li>
			<li>
Item B (No Assist)</li>
			<li>
Item C (Assist) - $200 x50%</li>
			<li>
Item D (Assist) - $150 x 25%</li>		</ul>
		<li>
The resultant aggregate fee determines if item 51300 or item 51303 applies to the assistant fee</li>

<h3>2 or more surgeons operating - surgeons operating independently</h3>


<p>Where 2 or more surgeons operate on the <strong>same</strong> patient on the <strong>same</strong> occasion and they <strong>do not</strong>&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
assist the other surgeons</li>
		<li>
administer, or assist in the administration of, the anaesthetic</li>
		</ul>
<p>they are deemed to be operating independently.</p>

<p>The procedures they perform are considered as separate operations, and if any of them employs an assistant, the assistant fees are calculated separately for the services of each surgeon.</p>

<p>See <a href="../your-health/011-42060050-01.html">Surgical operations assessing rules in Medicare</a> for more information.</p>

<p>The following provides examples of various scenarios of surgeons operating independently.</p>

<p><strong>Example A</strong></p>

<p>Dr Steve and Dr Michael operate independently on a patient on the same occasion. Dr Ted assists Dr Steve. All of the items at which assistance is given are eligible for an assistant fee.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Dr Steve</strong></li>
			<ul>			<li>
Operation A (Assist) - Schedule fee $500</li>

		<li>
<strong>Dr Michael</strong></li>
			<ul>			<li>
Operation 1 - Schedule fee $300</li>
			<li>
Operation 2 - Schedule fee $150</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>Apply the multiple operation rule to the services that are eligible for an assistant fee and at which assistance is rendered.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Dr Steve assisted by Dr Ted</strong></li>
			<ul>			<li>
Operation A (Assist) - Schedule fee $500 x 100% = $500</li>
			<li>
Operation B (Assist) - Schedule fee $450 x 50% = $225</li>
			<li>
Operation C (Assist) - Schedule fee $200 x 25% - $50</li>
			<li>
Total Schedule fee = $775</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>Compare the total Schedule fee to items 51300 and 51303 to determine which assistant item applies to Dr Ted's services.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Item 51303 applies because the total Schedule fee for the operations exceeds $558.30</li>
		</ul>
<p>Calculate the derived fee for item 51303, that is, 20% of the total schedule fee for operations A, B and C.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
$775 x 20% = $155</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> these are example figures only - access MBS for the current schedule fees.</p>

<p><strong>Example B</strong></p>

To calculate the fee for the operations, the multiple operation rule is applied as follows&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
<strong>Dr Steve assisted by Dr Ted</strong></li>
			<li>
Operation A (Assist) - Schedule fee $600 x 100% = $600</li>
			<li>
Operation B (No assist) - $0</li>
			<li>
Operation C (Assist) - Schedule fee $320 x 50% = $160.00</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Operation D (No assist) - $0</li>
		<li>
Total Schedule fee = $760</li>
		</ul>
<p>Compare the total Schedule fee to items 51300 and 51303 to determine which assistant item applies to Dr Brown's services.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Item 51303 applies because the total Schedule fee for the operations exceeds $537.15</li>
		</ul>
<p>Calculate the derived fee for item 51303, that is, 20% of the total Schedule fee for operations A and C.</p>

<h3>Multiple surgeons not operating independently</h3>


<p>Where 2 or more surgeons operate and each performs 1 or more operations but 1 assists the other, or they both assist each other, the surgeons are not considered to be operating independently. The multiple operation rule is applied to <strong>all the operations</strong> combined. The assessment of the assistant's fee is based on the fee for the combined operations.</p>

<p><strong>Example A</strong></p>

<p>Dr Steve and Dr Michael each perform a series of operations on a patient on the same occasion. Dr Michael also assists Dr Steve. Each of Dr Steve’s services is eligible for an assistant fee.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Dr Steve</strong></li>

		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Dr Steve and Dr Michael</strong></li>
			<ul>			<li>
Operation A - Schedule fee $500 x 100%</li>

			<li>
Operation C - Schedule fee $300 x 25%</li>
			<li>
Operation D - Schedule fee $200 x 25%</li>
			<li>
Operation 2 - Schedule fee $100 x 25%</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>To calculate the fee for the assistant, reapply the multiple operation rule only to those services that are eligible for an assistant fee, and at which assistance is rendered&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Dr Steve assisted by Dr Michael</strong></li>
			<ul>			<li>
Operation A (Assist) - Schedule fee $500 x 100% = $500</li>

			<li>
Operation C (Assist) - Schedule fee $300 x 25% = $75</li>
			<li>
Operation D (Assist) - Schedule fee $200 x 25% = $50</li>
			<li>

<strong>Dr Michael assisting Dr Steve</strong></li>
			<ul>			<li>
Item 51303 applies to the assistant services as the total Schedule fee for the operations exceeds $558.30</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Calculate the derived fee for item 51303, that is, 20% of the total Schedule fee - $825 x 20% = $165</li>

Operation A - Schedule fee $400 x 100%</li>
			<li>
Operation B - Schedule fee $240 x 50%</li>
			<li>
Operation 1 - Schedule fee $210 x 25%</li>
			<li>
Operation C - Schedule fee $200 x 25%</li>
			<li>
Operation 2 - Schedule fee $180 x 25%</li>
			</ul>
<p>To calculate the fee for the assistant, reapply the multiple operation rule only to the services that are eligible for an assistant fee, and at which assistance is rendered.</p>
			<ul>			<li>
Operation B (Assist) - Schedule fee $240 x 100% = $240</li>
			<li>
Operation 1 (Assist) - Schedule fee $210 x 50% = $105</li>
			<li>
Operation C (Assist) - Schedule fee $200 x 25% = $50</li>
			<li>
Total Schedule fee = $395</li>		</ul>
		<ul>		<li>
Compare the total Schedule fee to items 51300 and 51303 to determine which assistant item applies</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Item 51300 applies because the total Schedule fee for the operations does not exceed $558.30</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> where each surgeon assists the other, the division of the assistant's fee is a matter for the surgeons involved.</p>
