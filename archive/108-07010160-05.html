<P><STRONG>Customer's rate reduces to nil part way through an entitlement period</STRONG></P>
<P>Employment income nil rate periods start from the Entitlement Period Start Day (EPSD) of the first fortnight where a customer would get a zero payment for that entitlement period.</P>
<P>The system works on a daily rate and often determines that the customer's rate is nil (on a daily basis) part way through an entitlement period. This can be because the customer's Working Credits run out part way through the period.</P>
<P>For example, a customer may be paid a part payment in an entitlement period because their Working Credits do not deplete until day five of the period. The 6 full fortnights of the employment income nil rate period actually start from the EPSD of the fortnight after the customer's rate goes to zero on a daily basis.</P>
<P>That means:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the customer will be paid a part rate for the first 5 days</LI>
<LI>they will be on a nil rate of payment from day 6 of the first entitlement period and the employment income nil rate period starts from the EPSD of the next fortnight and continues for 6 full fortnights</LI></UL>

<P>If the customer's income is sufficient to give them a zero rate but the customer is working less than 30 hours per week, the customer and their partner will be entitled to deplete their Working Credits and then will remain current at zero rate for the employment income nil rate period.</P>
<P>Once the employment income nil rate period has finished, both pensions will be suspended for up to 2 years or until the income goes down and they are entitled to some payment again.</P>
<P>If the customer/partner has income coded as income in one period (IOP), and reports their last fortnight income late, the payment will not suspend due to system limitation.</P>
<P>Check the Payment Summary (<STRONG>PS</STRONG>) screen, to see if the customer has had 6 fortnights of nil payment. If so, code the income from the seventh fortnight and, if payment has not suspended correctly, follow current escalation procedures through my Support.</P>
