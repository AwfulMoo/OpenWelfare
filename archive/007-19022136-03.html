<p>CCS Disaster Affected Work items are created when reconciliation results in a new debt for customers impacted by a declared major disaster or emergency. These work items will not be allocated to staff for action, and will be paused for a defined period. After this time, the work item will be completed and reassessed automatically. If the reconciliation outcome falls into one of the other MIV categories, a new work item will be created and assessed, as per current process.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> a new debt is where a customer has had no previous reconciliation debt instances relating to the relevant CCS year.</p>

<p>CCS reconciliation can be paused the 3 'Manual Action' criteria mentioned in Step 4 above and also for disaster affected customers, where&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the outcome is a debt, and</li>
		<li>
the customer’s principal place of residence is within an Local Government Area (LGA), declared affected by a natural disaster or emergency (including pandemics) for at least one day within a prescribed period, or</li>
		<li>
the customer has been granted a disaster payment such as Australia Government Disaster Recovery Payment (AGDRP) or Disaster Recovery Allowance (DRA)</li>
		</ul>
<p>These activities will present with a work item entitled CCS disaster affected which will ensure the reconciliation debt is not immediately raised, but held for a certain period.</p>

<p>These items will not be allocated to staff for action - they will auto complete after the defined period.</p>

<p>In some cases, the customer may request the ‘CCS Disaster affected’ work item to be completed so that the debt can be raised immediately. Where this request is made, staff are to ensure the customer is fully aware of the consequences as a result of this request, including not being able to access Advance payments.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> If the Service Officer believes the debt outcome may not be correct and corrective action is required, any changes in circumstances updates should be actioned within the work item before it is completed. If the updates result in the debt being changed to a nil adjustment or arrears outcome, the work item will auto complete without any further manual intervention.</p>

<p>The following is to be read to the customer and documented on the record&#58;</p>

<p>'Customer has requested that the CCS reconciliation debt amount of $X be raised immediately instead of being held. Customer acknowledges that once the debt is raised, standard debt repayment provisions would apply, whether this is withholdings from ongoing payments, or a voluntary cash arrangement.'</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> during the debt pause period the below process applies.</p>

<p><strong>Process during the debt pause period</strong></p>

<p>If a customer asks a Service Officer to raise their debt immediately, remind them of the possible impacts including not being able to access Advance payments.</p>

<p>If the customer wishes to proceed to have the debt raised, staff <strong>must </strong>follow the processes below and tell customers&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
An Account Payable Notice will issue</li>
		<li>
Debt recovery will <strong>remain paused</strong> unless the customer specifically asks to enter into a withholdings or payment arrangement</li>
		<li>
Services Australia will not refer debt to an External Collection Agent or accrue interest during the debt pause period</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer agrees to these terms and the Service Officer is satisfied the debt outcome is correct, the work item can be actioned, by&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
conducting a  work item search using the work item ID via the inbox</li>
		<li>
selecting <strong>Assess</strong>, then Finish and Finalise the activity</li>
		</ul>

<p><strong>Timing of CCS reconciliation</strong></p>

<p>CCS reconciliation can only occur from the <a target="_blank" href="../families/007-19022123-01.html">29th day following the end of the CCS year</a> at the earliest. Depending on the staggered approach taken it may be several more weeks before an outcome is known. </p>

		<ul>		<li>
<strong>before the 29th day</strong> following the end of the CCS year, <a href="../families/007-19022136-03.html#bp03_tbl_Check_CCS_recon_Step14">go to  Step 14</a></li>
		<li>
<strong>after the 29th day</strong> following the end of the CCS year, advise we cannot balance everyone at the same time. Customers should continue to check their online accounts in the coming weeks and they will be notified of the result once it is known</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> in some cases a reconciliation activity will show an earlier date than the outcome letter or payment issue dates. This is a result of the staggering process and should not be reported as an issue</p>

<p><strong>Income Confirmation</strong></p>

<p>Staff should discuss income confirmation with the customer to ensure they have done everything they need to. All CCS customers must meet CCS reconciliation requirements by confirming the income they have estimated during the relevant CCS year. This includes confirming income for any partners or ex-partners they may have had during the relevant year.</p>

<p>Income can be confirmed by&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
lodging an Income Tax Return with the Australian Tax Office (ATO), or</li>
		<li>
advising Services Australia they are not required to lodge an Income Tax Return and providing their actual income, or</li>
		<li>
submitting a non-lodgement advice to the ATO, <strong>and</strong> advising actual income to Services Australia</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where the instance window status is <strong>Pending AMET</strong> or <strong>Pending PRVS</strong>, do not give customers specific information about the potential outcome as any amounts displayed are subject to change.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> where reconciliation is pending due to the inaction of an ex-partner, the customer can request an ex-partner most recent estimate (MRE) exception is recorded to meet income confirmation requirements for their ex-partner.

Select <img src="../resources/images/process_direct_small/Expand%20Subsidy%20types.png" alt="Expand Subsidy types" title="Expand Subsidy types" /> beside the <strong>Total</strong> to see a breakdown of the components</p>

<p>From the <strong>Provider Payments</strong> table the bottom border of the display field can be dragged down to reveal more periods of assessment. Use the scroll bar to navigate within the display field.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Paid to Provider</strong>&#58; displays amounts paid to all providers during the relevant CCS year.<br><br>See <a href="../families/007-19022136-05.html">Resources</a> for an example of viewing provider payments</li>
		<li>
<strong>Customer Entitlement</strong>&#58; displays total monetary customer CCS entitlement including amounts paid directly to the customer during the year and any amounts being paid due to changes in entitlement at reconciliation</li>
		<li>
<strong>Adjustment Amount</strong>&#58; difference between <strong>Paid to Provider</strong> and <strong>Customer Entitlement</strong> amounts. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> this total amount includes withholdings from the <strong>Paid to Provider</strong> column. This means the amount at the top of the <strong>Adjustment</strong> column is not the final reconciliation outcome. To see a breakdown of the adjustment amounts, <a href="../families/007-19022136-03.html#bp03_tbl_Review_CCS_reco_Step09">go to Step 9</a></li>
		<li>
<strong>Arrears/Debts</strong>&#58; this column is a simple calculation based on the values contained in the first two columns. Reconciliation arrears/debts are included in this column and will show amounts paid during the year as well as at reconciliation</li>
		<li>
<strong>Provisional Activity</strong>&#58; details will exist in this field if there is a pending update that is yet to be completed that may change the outcome of the reconciliation calculation. If figures are present in the <strong>Provisional Activity</strong> column but there is no wait instance or incomplete/pending work item, escalate to ICT through ROXY DA to force the outcome</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the provider payment figures will always show to 4 decimal places. In some instances the <strong>Total</strong> field may be displayed in the European format which places the decimal point after the thousand and the comma after the last dollar. For example, 10,000.00 displays as 10.000,0000. These settings can be adjusted in Customer First and should not be reported as a system error (select <strong>Personalise</strong> - top right of the screen &gt; <strong>Personalise setting</strong> &gt; then preferred option drop down for <strong>Decimal Notation</strong>).</p>

<p>After withholding amounts have been factored in, there still could be a difference identified between the 'Paid'<strong> </strong>amount in the <strong>Reconciliation History </strong>current instance tile and the <strong>Paid to Provider</strong> amount on the <strong>Provider Payments</strong> tab. This could be due to the customer receiving arrears directly to their bank account during the CCS year.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> session reports were not uploaded during the Business Continuity Period. For weeks between 6 April 2020 and 12 July 2020, either&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
'0' values will display, or</li>
		<li>
the week rows will be absent altogether</li>
		</ul>
<p>This is expected system behaviour.</p>

		<li>
<strong>Provider payment reason&#58;</strong> displays reason for impacted payments i.e. Annual Cap Exhausted or No Entitlement Exists</li>
		<li>
<strong>Entitlement (Provider)</strong>&#58; this is the amount the Child Care Provider was paid for the child on the relevant session during the CCS year</li>

		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> there may be variations when looking at CCS amounts on the provider payment tab compared with the final reconciliation result. This is due to the number rounding rules in the system which applies 2 decimal places to some calculations and 4 decimal places to other calculations. These rounding variations mean calculations may differ by as much as 1 cent per week, or up to 52 cents per year.</p>

<p>The total in the <strong>Adjustment Amount</strong> column includes the withholdings from the <strong>Paid to Provider </strong>column when it is calculated. However this amount does not form part of the final reconciliation outcome and does not represent an amount received by the customer.</p>
