<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>jobactive provides tailored services and programmes to help job seekers in their transition to employment based on their needs. This could include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>help with looking for work, writing a resume and preparing for interviews</LI>
<LI>referrals to jobs in their local area</LI>
<LI>training that is suited to the skills that local employers need</LI>
<LI>case management so they are ready to take up and keep a job</LI>
<LI>helping job seekers into work, education, apprenticeships and traineeships</LI>
<LI>support to complete Work for the Dole or other eligible activities to provide them with work-like experiences, to help them learn new skills and improve their chances of finding a job</LI></UL>
<P>All job seekers can access self service terminals in most Services Australia Service Centres and some Medicare Service Centres, Agents and Access Points. The terminals have been provided to enable customers to access self services.</P>
<P>jobactive provides a range of services to job seekers, according to their circumstances and needs. A job seeker registering for services will be referred to online jobactive services and may then be referred onto a jobactive provider.</P>
<P>Job seekers can be <A href="../job-seekers/001-02040000-01.html">registered as job seekers</A> by the agency. There are 3 types of job seeker registration available to customers, according to their circumstances and needs.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<DIV class=twisty><A name=bp01_L2GT_Fully_Eligible_ class=anchor></A>
<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_Fully_Eligible_>Fully Eligible Participants (FEPs)</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>FEP job seekers are able to access the full services as assessed by a <A href="../job-seekers/001-02050000-01.html" target=_blank>Job Seeker Classification Instrument (JSCI)</A> or, if required, an Employment Services Assessment (ESAt). Job seekers receiving payments with mutual obligation requirements <A href="../job-seekers/001-02020020-01.html">are normally registered by the agency as FEP</A>.</P>
<P>Non-protected SCV holders granted JobSeeker Payment (JSP) or YA under the New Zealand 10 year residence exemption are eligible to be registered as FEP job seekers while receiving JSP or YA. These customers will be eligible for full services from jobactive, but are not eligible for referral to Disability Employment Services (DES), <A href="../job-seekers/001-02100000-01.html">New Enterprise Incentive Scheme (NEIS)</A> or <A href="../job-seekers/001-02170000-01.html">Adult Migrant Education Programme (AMEP).</A></P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<P>All job seekers with mutual obligation requirements who are not eligible for registration as a No Stream Services Referral Required (NSSRR) job seeker must be registered as Fully Eligible Participants (FEP).</P>

<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Some customers are required to be registered as job seekers in order to access other assistance, but do not require a referral to jobactive. Customers eligible for NSSRR registration include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>customers who need a Department of Education, Skills and Employment record in order to be referred for a Job Capacity Assessment (JCA). For example, Disability Support Pension (DSP) new claim customers or DSP customers requiring a Medical Review JCA to be booked</LI>
<LI>full-time students applying for a supplementary allowance determination</LI>
<LI>principal carers with long term exemptions from their mutual obligation requirements (longer than 16 weeks) who do not choose to volunteer for employment services</LI>
<LI>customers requiring a Job Plan as a condition of their payment, including:</LI>
<LI>principal carers fully meeting their mutual obligation requirements who do not choose to volunteer for employment services</LI>
<LI>people with a Partial Capacity to Work who are fully meeting their mutual obligation requirements and do not choose to volunteer for employment services</LI>
<LI>full-time students transferring to a job seeker payment within 4 weeks of their student end date</LI>
<LI>customers receiving an income support payment with no mutual obligation requirements and who want to apply for <A href="../families/007-17103148-01.html" target=_blank>Additional Child Care Subsidy (ACCS) (Transition to Work)</A></LI>
<LI><A href="../job-seekers/001-02100000-01.html">New Enterprise Incentive Scheme</A> (NEIS) participants presenting to Services Australia after 39 weeks of participation in the scheme to claim income support</LI></UL>
<P>If job seekers do not meet the criteria for NSSRR registration at any time, such as no longer fully meeting their mutual obligation requirements, the NSSRR flag must be removed and the customer referred to a provider, if suitable.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<UL>
<LI>students aged 15 to 21 in <STRONG>full-time study</STRONG>, who present in crisis and have at least 1 serious non-vocational barrier, are eligible for immediate Stream C Services as a Vulnerable Youth (Student) if no appropriate youth services are available in their local area.

<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_Assessment_as_a>Assessment as a Vulnerable Youth (VY) job seeker</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>To be assessed as a VY job seeker, a young person must meet <STRONG>all</STRONG> of the following conditions:</P>
<UL>
<LI>be aged 15 to 21 years</LI>
<LI>not working 15 hours or more per week, not studying full-time and not currently receiving an income support payment</LI>

<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>In order to be assessed as a VY (student), a young person must meet <STRONG>all</STRONG> of the following conditions:</P>
<UL>
<LI>be aged 15 to 21 years</LI>
<LI>be a full-time student</LI>
<LI>present with at least 1 serious non-vocational barrier</LI>
<LI>be in crisis, which is defined as circumstances that require immediate intervention to stabilise their situation</LI>
<LI>have legal rights to work in Australia</LI></UL>
<P>VY (youth and VY (students) can be registered either by Centrelink or directly by a jobactive provider. If they are directly registered, they will be referred to the agency within 4 weeks to test their eligibility for an income support payment, and the agency must complete the Job Seeker Classification Instrument (JSCI) and refer them to an Employment Services Assessment (ESAt).</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_Newly_arrived_r>Newly arrived refugees</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Most newly arrived refugees remain Centrelink managed until 60 or 12 months after their arrival in Australia. There are a number of factors that determine when a newly arrived refugee needs to be referred to jobactive and the level of servicing they will receive. See <A href="../migrants-refugees-and-visitors/005-02040020-01.html" target=_blank>Refugee and humanitarian entrant service offer</A> for more information.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Job seekers may be voluntarily referred to jobactive if they <A href="../job-seekers/001-02020030-01.html">meet the eligibility criteria for registration as a volunteer</A>.</P>
<P>All volunteer job seekers can access jobactive servicing in Stream A for up to 12 months. Services Australia can register volunteer job seekers under the registration type of 'Volunteer'. All Stream A volunteer job seekers are referred to online jobactive services.</P>
<P>A volunteer who has already received services for a total of 6 months (if registered prior to 8 December 2019) or 12 months (if registered after 8 December 2019) or who was exited and returns more than 13 consecutive weeks after the date of exit, is not eligible for assistance and cannot be registered again. The only exception is where a job seeker subsequently experiences a significant change in their individual circumstances that result in their core eligibility for Employment Provider Services changing from a volunteer to a Fully Eligible Participant.</P>
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> prior to 8 December 2019, volunteer job seekers were referred to jobactive providers for a maximum of <STRONG>6 months</STRONG> and were not referred to online services. These job seekers will remain with their current provider until the end of their 6 month period.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<P>When a job seeker lives in a Department of Education, Skills and Employment designated remote area, they are referred to a <A href="../job-seekers/001-02140000-01.html">CDP</A> provider.
