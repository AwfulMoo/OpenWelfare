<p>This document explains eligibility for the activity supplement for FHA. It includes payment of vouchers, claiming and processing. The purpose of the activity supplement is to fund, to a maximum amount, costs of approved activities in a Financial Improvement Agreement (FIA).</p>

<p></p>
<div class="twisty">
	
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Eligibility"></a>
<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Eligibility">Eligibility</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>FHA customers may be eligible for the activity supplement for activities agreed in their FIA they have already undertaken, or they intend to undertake. This ensures the supplement is used to help them improve their capacity for financial self-reliance while fulfilling their requirements for FHA.</p>

<p>Customers are eligible for the supplement if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the activity is being undertaken for the purposes of the activity test</li>
		<li>
FHA is payable when the activity supplement is approved for the activity</li>
		<li>
the activity is in their FIA and is one of the activity types listed below</li>
		<li>
any professional advice or training is provided by an appropriately qualified person who is registered with an Australian Business Number (ABN)</li>
		<li>
a claim for payment (or re-imbursement) of the approved activity is made within a 2 month period of the date on the invoice or statement. This is provided they have not already used the maximum amount</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58; </strong>multiple TAFE's are requesting Farm Household Case Officers (FHCO) sign an Authority to Invoice form. This form is not applicable to Farm Household Allowance (FHA) customers who want to use the Activity Supplement for TAFE courses. If the TAFE will not invoice Services Australia without the authority form, then customers are required to pay for the course and lodge a voucher to request reimbursement for the paid invoice.</p>

<p>Farm Household Case Officers (FHCO) have the discretion to determine if it is appropriate to authorise payment of the activity supplement for activities, which will extend beyond a customer's 4 year period of eligibility for FHA.</p>

<p>Customers remain eligible to access the Activity Supplement even when an exemption from the activity test has been coded.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Payment_of_vouc">Payment of vouchers</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Activity supplement vouchers can be paid, if at the time the Farm Household Case Officers (FHCO) approved the use of the activity supplement&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
FHA was payable to the customer, and</li>
		<li>
all other conditions are met</li>
		</ul>
<p>When a subsequent determination results in a retrospective decision (that is, a cancellation), the intention of the policy should still be applied and the voucher paid. FHA was payable when the FHCO approved use of the activity supplement, regardless of the later decision to cancel the payment from an earlier date.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p><strong>From 11 June 2020</strong></p>

<p>The activity supplement increased to $10,000 with a life-time cap. There is no longer an 'additional activity supplement' and no need for the customer to undertake 'high value' activities to access any part of the activity supplement.</p>

<p>The activity supplement does not have to be used all at once. It can be used for multiple activities over the period the customer is in receipt of FHA but the total cannot exceed the maximum $10,000 payable. The activity supplement can be used for approved reasonable travel and accommodation costs associated with undertaking the activity as agreed in the customer's FIA.</p>

<p>Customers who were in receipt of FHA, as at 11 June 2020 will have their total activity supplement increased to $10,000 from 11 June 2020. The activity supplement available to these customers will be the difference between $10,000 and what the customer has already used. (For example, if the customer has used $2,800 of activity supplement when the threshold is increased to $10,000 the customer would have $7,200 available immediately). The increased activity supplement amount cannot be used to pay for activities that commenced before 11 June 2020. Customers who have activities agreed in their FIA before and started the activity on or after 11 June 2020 can access the increased amount of activity supplement.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the maximum amount of $10,000 is not reset if there is a break in FHA payments for any reason. For example, if the customer reapplies for FHA in the second 10 year period commencing 1 July 2024, they will have access to their remaining available balance only.</p>

<p><strong>Before 11 June 2020</strong></p>

<p>The activity supplement was up to $3,000 that could be used over the cumulative 4 years of FHA payment. Customers that commenced their third year of receiving FHA were entitled to claim a further $1,000 of additional activity supplement to help cover the cost of high value activities in their third and fourth year of receiving FHA. The maximum amount was not reset if there was a break in FHA payments.</p>

<p>Each member of a couple could access up to $4,000 but could not split or share it with their partner.</p>

<p>If the cost of the activity exceeded the available balance of the activity supplement, the customer could choose to pay for the unfunded portion.</p>

<p>Customers could choose to get the activity supplement directly or have it paid to the provider.</p>

<p>Customers must submit a completed Farm Household Allowance Voucher for Activity Supplement (A2555) to Services Australia. The voucher is issued to the customer once it is determined they have an approved eligible activity in their agreed FIA.</p>

<p>Part A of the voucher is completed by the customer. Part B is completed by the service provider.</p>

<p>If the customer chooses to be paid the supplement directly, they must also provide evidence they have paid the service provider for the activity.</p>

<p>For professional advice or training activities, the customer must give evidence it was provided by an appropriately qualified person. For example, someone with relevant financial qualifications provided the financial advice.</p>

<p>Where a provider has provided advice and submitted a form signed with a different surname listed on the relevant support qualification, staff are able to use discretion to accept the information provided.</p>

<p><strong>Time limit</strong></p>

<p>The customer must submit the voucher for the activity supplement <strong>within 2 months of the date on the invoice</strong> for the activity from the service provider.</p>

<p>If the customer provides additional documentation for a previously rejected voucher, the voucher and invoice can be reassessed.</p>

<p>If a customer provides a new receipt or invoice&#58;</p>

<p>The activity supplement cannot be used to cover the cost of activities considered a part of normal farm operations (business as usual (BAU). Expenses will not be eligible for costs incurred implementing any advice or training or purchase of equipment (capital) to implement practices learned in farm enterprise training or recommended by an agricultural adviser. </p>

<p>When reviewing a request for access to the activity supplement the FHCO must take into account the goals and objectives of the customer as well as the current farm business. Where an activity may be considered BAU for one customer, it may not be considered BAU for another, based on their circumstances and industry.</p>

<p>FHCOs are required to record details supporting their determination to approve payment of the activity supplement within the <strong>FHCO approval Fast Note</strong> on the customer record. Where there is insufficient detail within the <strong>Fast Note</strong> to support payment of the activity supplement, the voucher may be rejected.</p>

<p><strong>Examples - Activity Supplement not payable&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Capital Equipment.</strong> Purchase of equipment such as computer equipment, piping for irrigation or other farm based assets</li>
		<li>
<strong>Legal Advice&#58;</strong> the preparation of Wills, Power of Attorney, farm contracts (including sale contracts) and loan advice. However funds to cover advice about succession planning identified as part of the FIA <strong>is</strong> payable</li>
		<li>
<strong>Financial Advice.</strong> The use of Activity Supplement funds for financial advice must be assessed on a case by case basis, but does <strong>not </strong>cover completion of tax returns, Business Activity statements (BAS) and other BAU activities a business would normally be required to complete </li>

<p>The FHCO may approve payment of the activity supplement for a customer who will undertake an activity in the future, if FHA is payable when the activity supplement is approved, and it is reasonable to assume&#58;</p>

the activity will be undertaken in accordance with the financial improvement agreement, and</li>

the activity will comply with all prescribed conditions relating to the activity and the activity supplement, and</li>

<p>The activity supplement remains payable after payments of FHA stop if, the use of the activity supplement has been approved before the customer cancels even if the activity has not actually commenced.</p>

<p>From 11 June 2020, the activity supplement can be used for reasonable travel and accommodation costs associated with undertaking an approved activity as agreed in the customer's FIA. Travel and accommodation costs can be paid for approved activities with no cost, provided they are listed in the customer's FIA. Where the amount paid to the provider for travel costs can be identified as a component of the total amount to be paid, it should be recorded when processing the Activity Supplement Voucher.</p>

<p>If a customer is receiving free advice, before travel and accommodation is paid, complete Part B of the activity supplement voucher with evidence of qualifications. If customers are claiming the activity supplement for travel and accommodation, clearly tell them they cannot also claim a business deduction (tax deduction) for it.</p>

<p>If an activity for advice or training is determined not to be payable, after the customer has completed the activity, any associated travel and accommodation costs for that activity cannot be paid from the activity supplement. For example, if the provider was not appropriately qualified, payment of the activity would not be made. Travel and accommodation costs would need to be personally funded by the customer.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_NonRegistered_">Non-Registered Training Organisations (RTO)</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The consideration of non-RTO requests accounts for training that is not delivered through RTOs but is suitable for improving the situation of FHA customers according to their FIA. It also accounts for the isolation of some customers, which inhibits them from being able to reasonably access RTOs.</p>

<p>Non-RTOs are to be used as a last resort to avoid inappropriate training providers who may negatively influence the FHA customer or their business.</p>

<p>If a non-RTO must be used, complete the <a href="../rural-and-remote-australians/002-02070050-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Template">non-RTO consideration template</a>. Each request is assessed on a case by case basis even if the provider has been previously approved. A lead time of 6-8 weeks is required from the submission to allow enough time to obtain an approval from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry.</p>

<p>If a customer is completing a free course, the course must meet the activity supplement criteria. This means if the course is through a non-RTO, an approved non-RTO request is required as the course needs to meet eligibility requirements for travel and accommodation.</p>

<p><strong>Supporting documents for non-RTO requests</strong></p>

<p><strong>Mandatory documents</strong> required for all non-RTO requests are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
non-RTO request form</li>
		<li>
copy of <strong>Professional Indemnity Insurance</strong></li>
		<li>
copy of <strong>trainer's qualifications</strong></li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Additional documents required</strong></p>

<p>The provider must supply a copy of their Public Liability Insurance certificate if the course is being delivered in person (face to face). Attach the certificate to the non-RTO request.</p>

<p>The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry have advised if any of the required insurance documentation is missing from the application for the non-RTO, the customer may have the claim rejected.</p>

<p><strong>Professional indemnity insurance</strong></p>

<p>Professional indemnity insurance covers the content of what the provider teaches. If they teach something that is incorrect and causes the recipient significant damages or loss of money, the provider needs to be covered for this with professional indemnity insurance.</p>

<p>Every non-RTO must have professional indemnity insurance, even if the course is held online.</p>

<p><strong>Public Liability insurance</strong></p>

<p>Public liability insurance is designed for professionals who interact with customers or members of the public. It protects against claims of personal injury or property damage a third party suffers (or claims to have suffered) because of the business activities.</p>

<p><strong>GovTeams</strong> (FHCO resource only)</p>

<p>FHCO's must check <strong>GovTeams</strong> for the supporting documents. Where current documents are listed for the provider on GovTeams only the non-RTO consideration template is required to be escalated for a delegate decision. Where a document has expired or new supporting document is required FHCO's will follow their normal escalation process to obtain the required documents.</p>

<p><strong>Acceptable evidence of qualifications&#58;</strong></p>

<p>It is the responsibility of the customer to supply the required documents to support their claim for the Activity Supplement. Customers should be encouraged to supply evidence of qualifications with every claim. If this information is not available, it may be appropriate for Smart Centre processing staff to use the <a href="../rural-and-remote-australians/002-02070050-05.html#bp05_L2GT_External_websit">Moneysmart</a> website to confirm Service Providers qualifications.</p>

		<li>
the organisation requires the degree/qualification held to be relevant to the organisations skill sets and the organisation does not accept any tertiary education to become a member, or</li>
