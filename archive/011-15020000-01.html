<p>The compensation payer (usually the insurer) must notify Services Australia (the agency) if in respect of an injury or illness&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
a settlement is made, where the amount of compensation fixed is more than $5,000 (including all costs) </li>
		<li>
a judgment is made where the amount of compensation fixed is more than $5,000 (not including costs) </li>
		</ul>
<p>A claim is not notifiable if in respect of an injury or illness, it</p>
		<ul>		<li>
settled for $5,000 or less (including all costs) or</li>
		<li>
reached judgment for $5,000 or less (excluding costs). Judgment documents may be required to determine the amount of damages excluding costs</li>
		</ul>
<p>If it is not clear, refer the case to Programme Management to determine if the case is notifiable. </p>

<p>Where Service Delivery or Programme Management determine the case is not notifiable&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
get approval from a Team Leader or Programme Support Officer to issue a z2654 Compensation claim not notifiable manual letter, and</li>

<p></p>

<p>Compensation is defined as&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a payment of damages</li>
		<li>
a payment under a scheme of insurance or compensation under law</li>
		<li>
a payment (with or without admission of liability) in judgment or settlement of a claim for damages or a claim under an insurance scheme</li>
		<li>
any other compensation or damages payment, other than a payment under a scheme to which the recipient has contributed, that is made in respect of an injury to a person (whether or not the payment is made to that person)</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p>If Service Delivery determines a compensation payment made under a scheme that the injured person has contributed (for example, superannuation)&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
get approval from a Team Leader or Programme Support Officer to issue a z2654 Compensation claim not notifiable manual letter, and</li>
		<li>
return any documents received by the agency</li>
		</ul>
<p>The <a href="../your-health/011-15020000-05.html">Resources</a> page contains links to letter template - z2654 Compensation claim not notifiable.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Compensation does not include&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
a payment by an individual who is not insured or indemnified for liability in respect of the injury in question, and <strong>who is not required by law</strong> to be insured or indemnified</li>
		<li>
a payment in the nature of criminal injuries compensation</li>
		<li>
an amount paid that is not required to be paid by or under an Australian law</li>
		<li>
a payment of a kind, or in circumstances prescribed by the regulations</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p>Refer these cases to Programme Management to determine if the case is notifiable. If Programme Management confirm the case is not notifiable&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
get approval from a Team Leader or Programme Support Officer to issue a z2654 Compensation claim not notifiable manual letter, and</li>
		<li>
return any documents received by the agency</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p><strong>Case with settlement amount for legal costs only</strong></p>

<p>In some compensation cases, the settlement amount may <strong>not include payment</strong> for the compensable person's injury or illness but only the legal costs associated with pursuing the compensation claim.</p>

<p>In compensation cases such as these, the agency does not need to be notified. When <strong>notification</strong> has been received the agency must seek evidence to support that the compensation case settled for legal costs only.</p>

<p>Evidence such as the Terms of settlement, Deed of release or the legal costs invoice can be submitted to the department in order for a decision to be made.</p>

<p>These cases are to be referred to Programme Management to determine if the case is notifiable. If Programme Management confirm the case is not notifiable&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
get approval from a Team Leader or Programme Support Officer to issue a z2654 Compensation claim not notifiable manual letter, and</li>

		<ul>		<li>
on any school premises</li>
		<li>
during school excursions, or</li>
		<li>

<p>Schools are not legally required to carry insurance for accidents. Therefore, any compensation payment arising from a school accident must be considered on its individual merits.</p>

<p>Injuries sustained by a teacher during the course of their employment would be considered to be workers compensation and not a school accident.</p>

<p><strong>Notifiable claims</strong></p>

<p>A school accident is notifiable if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the school is insured against the accident which gave rise to the claim</li>
		<li>
the school has an insurance policy that covers payment for medical expenses incurred by the injured person</li>
		<li>
the matter is a common law or public liability claim, or</li>
		<li>
an amount of compensation has been fixed for greater than $5,000 by a judgment (excluding costs) or settlement (including costs)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Claims that are not notifiable</strong></p>

<p>A school accident is not notifiable if the school&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
holds an insurance policy that does not provide for any payment of medical expenses, or only covers payment of medical expenses which are not eligible Medicare or nursing home benefits or residential and home care subsidies</li>
		<li>
is not insured or indemnified in respect of the injury or illness, and is not required by law to be so insured or indemnified</li>

<p>If the judgment or settlement payment is only for loss of dependency or loss of consortium, the claim is <strong>not</strong> considered to be a payment of compensation as the payment is not being made for personal injury.

<p>A loss of dependency or loss of consortium claim <strong>is</strong> notifiable&#58;</p>

any part of the settlement or judgment (separate or in conjunction with the claim for dependency or consortium) includes an amount paid that relates to compensation for injury or illness sustained by the dependants or spouse, for example, depression</li>

the dependants or spouse pursue a claim or a continuation of a claim for the deceased person's injury or illness under the estate of the deceased</li>

<p>An injured person, whether within Australia or overseas, who becomes eligible for compensation for an injury or illness sustained overseas may be liable to repay the Commonwealth amounts owed for Medicare benefits, nursing home benefits, residential care subsidies and home care subsidies (care costs) that have been paid by the Australian Government.</p>

<p>Sections 7 and 8 of the Act require any <strong>compensable person to repay to the Commonwealth</strong> amounts paid as Medicare benefits where that person becomes eligible for compensation in the form of a judgment, settlement or reimbursement arrangement, regardless of whether the&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
compensation is payable by a compensation payer within Australia or overseas</li>
		<li>
the judgment or settlement or reimbursement arrangement is made within Australia or overseas</li>
		<li>
the injury or illness in respect of which the compensation is payable occurred within Australia or overseas</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where the injury or illness occurs outside Australian jurisdiction, the agency will determine whether the claim for compensation is notifiable under Australian law and the Act when the settlement or judgment, deed of release, court order or reimbursement arrangement is received. For example, compensation payments awarded by a foreign equivalent of bodies or persons established under Australian Law (such as Comcare) are not a ‘compensation authority’ for the purposes of the Act unless those bodies can be described as courts. The Australian Government is limited in its legal ability to exercise authority beyond its normal borders in other countries.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Australian jurisdiction covers all States and Territories including the Australian Antarctic Territory, the Jervis Bay Territory, Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Heard and McDonald Islands, Norfolk Island, Coral Sea Islands and Ashmore and Cartier Islands.</p>

<p>The agency cannot enforce the recovery of any amounts owed upon a compensation payer located outside of Australian jurisdiction where the accident and injury or illness has occurred overseas. If the compensation payer voluntarily pays an amount owed to the Commonwealth in part or full, any shortfall in the amount owed may be pursued by the agency from the compensable person.</p>

<p>If the Notice of charge is not paid by the compensation payer, the whole charge is recoverable from the claimant. If an advance payment is made by the compensation payer, the claimant will be responsible for any shortfall.</p>

<p>Each compensation case must be assessed on its individual merits. If a Service Officer is unsure whether a compensation case should be registered, advice should be obtained from a Programme Support Officer and the case can be escalated to Programme Management.</p>

<p>Wrongful deaths are usually the result of an accident caused by the misconduct of another person or company. For example, wrongful death claims are lodged for&#58;</p>

		<li>
unsafe premises</li>
		<li>
unsafe working practices</li>

<p>Australian State and Territory legislation make provisions for wrongful deaths, for example, worker's compensation. Claims lodged under State or Territory legislation may also be pursued by the estate of the deceased or family members under other legislation, for example common law.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> claims lodged for wrongful deaths should not be confused with fatal injuries or claims lodged under the legislation specific to criminal injuries.</p>

<p><strong>Notifiable claims</strong></p>

<p>Claims are notifiable if they include claims for medical services for the&#58;</p>

deceased injured person</li>
		<li>
family member making the claim</li>
		</ul>
<p>A claim may be lodged under both workers' compensation and common law for personal injuries sustained by either the deceased or family members and these claims are notifiable.</p>

<p><strong>Claims that are not notifiable</strong></p>

<p>Wrongful death claims are not notifiable when the claim is not for personal injury. For example, the family or estate of a deceased&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
worker, who dies as a result of a car accident while driving a company vehicle, the estate may lodge a claim for wrongful death against the employer because the employer failed to maintain the vehicle in proper mechanical repair</li>

<p>The Transport Accident Commission (TAC) is a Victorian Government owned organisation that will pay all reasonable medical treatment costs, above a certain threshold, for personal injuries sustained in a transport accident in Victoria. It is a no-fault scheme and medical benefits will be paid to an injured person regardless of who caused the accident. A claim against the TAC can also be made if a Victorian resident or person is injured in an interstate accident that involves a Victorian registered vehicle.</p>

<p>If the injured person lives in Victoria and the accident happened in Victoria, the claim is likely to be <strong>Medical Excess only</strong> and Services Australia does not process or register these claims.

Common law claims must be registered as they are governed under different legislation to Victoria for motor vehicle accident claims.</p>
