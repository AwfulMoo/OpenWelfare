a child is at risk of serious abuse or neglect, and </li>

		<li>

		</ul>
<p>For parents/carers to be eligible for ACCS (child wellbeing), they must first apply and be found eligible for CCS. Where there is an eligible individual, the child must be enrolled under a Complying Written Arrangement (CWA) enrolment type. There are limited circumstances when a provider may enrol a child under a Provider Eligible Arrangement (PEA) for up to 13 weeks. PEA enrolments are permitted where&#58;</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Child care services are responsible for applying for ACCS (child wellbeing) on behalf of the family.</p>

<p>The child care service can do this by&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
issuing a <a href="../families/007-17103159-01.html">certificate</a>, or</li>
		<li>
applying for a determination. <br>In most cases, the child care service must give a certificate(s) totalling 6 weeks before they can apply for a determination. The Provider Entry Portal (PEP) or third party software will regulate whether a certificate or a determination is required based on previous applications</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p><strong>Certificate Applications</strong></p>

<p>A provider can give a certificate up to 6 weeks, allowing for immediate access to ACCS (child wellbeing) if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they consider the child is, or was 'at risk'</li>
		<li>
certificates for the same child has not been given for the same service provider for a total of 6 weeks in a 12 month period, and</li>
		<li>
the service is below its percentage limit, if one has been applied</li>
		</ul>
<p>A service can request a certificate to be backdated up to 13 weeks if there was an exceptional circumstance that prevented the provider from issuing a certificate.</p>

<p>While a certificate is in effect, the higher ACCS (child wellbeing) subsidy rate is paid. This rate applies to the child at the service who gave the certificate, and does not apply to enrolments at other services or providers. For more details, see <a href="../families/007-17103159-01.html">Additional Child Care Subsidy (ACCS) (child wellbeing) certificates</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Determination Applications</strong></p>

<p>A provider can apply for a determination where&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they consider the child is or was 'at risk', and </li>
		<li>
the child has been given a certificate previously for the same service for a total of 6 weeks in a 12 month period, and</li>
		<li>
the service is below its percentage limit, if one has been applied</li>
		</ul>
<p>Services can apply for a new determination while a certificate or determination is in place. There is no need to wait until the certificate or determination ends. Determination applications are for periods between 1 to 13 weeks at a time, with the exception of the following circumstance's, which can have extended determinations period of up to 52 weeks if the child&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
is on a long term protection order </li>
		<li>
is in formal foster / kinship care, or</li>
		<li>
is enrolled at one of the services participating in the Early Years Education Program</li>
		</ul>
<p>When Services Australia has approved a determination, the ACCS (child wellbeing) rate will apply to <strong>all</strong> child care services the child attends for the approved determination period, even if they are in someone else's care, noting each service must also apply for a certificate.</p>

<p>Before a determination expiring, the child care service will be prompted through their Practice Management Software (PMS) or the Provider Entry Portal (PEP), for them to take action and lodge a new determination application, if they deem the child to still be at risk.</p>

		<li>
more than 28 days are assessed for exception circumstances by the Department of Education</li>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Children identified as in need of care and protection and subject to a court order placing them in the care of the state/territory or the Minister/Secretary, will be taken to be 'at risk' for the purpose of ACCS (child wellbeing). Children in <strong>formal</strong> foster care placement (or formal kinship placement) meet the definition of 'at risk'. Meaning, the provider will not need to provide information about the type of harm the child is experiencing.</p>

<p>If the court order is <strong>less than 6 months old from the date the application is lodged</strong>, no additional evidence is required if the child&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
is under an order as detailed on the <a href="../families/007-17103142-04.html">References</a> page, or</li>
		<li>
in a formal foster/kinship care placement</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the court order is more <strong>than 6 months old from the date the application is lodged</strong>, an additional letter is required from the State Protection Agency or a supporting agency that has a working knowledge of the foster care case confirming there is a&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
current care order, or</li>
		<li>
formal foster/kinship care arrangement</li>
		</ul>
<p>Children in <strong>informal</strong> care placements, such as voluntary care placements with extended family, may be eligible for ACCS (child wellbeing). Check if the care arrangements are formal or voluntary to determine the evidence required to support the determination application. Children in <strong>informal</strong> care arrangements do not automatically meet the definition of 'at risk'. Any evidence needs to meet the evidence requirements and describe the circumstances of the child.</p>

<p>The state protection agency may indicate that&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
another type of order (such as an early intervention order, or family protection order) is in place, or </li>
		<li>
they are currently undergoing an investigation into child protection concerns</li>
		</ul>
<p>Whilst these orders do not remove the child/ren from the care of the customer, they indicate the protection agency has ongoing concerns for the child's safety and wellbeing. Statements of this nature are to be taken as an indicator of child at risk. The 6 month age of evidence rule applies to these letters. (Information regarding Temporary Protection Orders / Apprehensive Violence Orders and Domestic Violence Orders is contained in the Third Party Evidence section).</p>

<p>The CCS reconciliation process (including re-reconciliation) will quarantine all periods where a child was assessed as eligible for ACCS (child wellbeing). Customers will not be reconciled for an ACCS (child wellbeing) period at the child level and the estimate held in the system for those periods will remain in place. As such, actual taxable income (ATI) will not readjust the customer's calculated entitlement for those periods.</p>

<p>The quarantining rule is effective under either a certificate or determination.</p>

<p>Individuals in receipt of ACCS (child wellbeing) are still required to meet income and notification provisions for CCS reconciliation.</p>
