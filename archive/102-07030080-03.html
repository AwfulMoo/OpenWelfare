<p>For <strong>JSP</strong> or <strong>YA job seekers</strong>, determine if the customer has ongoing entitlement to payment. They must still satisfy the sufficient work test, mutual obligation requirements and continue to report on their normal reporting due date.</p>

<p>Most JSP and YA (job seeker) customers who have returned to full-time ongoing work will no longer be qualified for payment as they are not considered unemployed. They will be able to deplete their Working Credit balance before payment is cancelled.</p>

<p><strong>However, certain job seekers in receipt of JSP or YA (job seeker) who commence full-time ongoing work may still be eligible for payment.</strong></p>

<p>The most common examples of full-time workers who may qualify for JSP  without further activity requirements are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
job seekers with a pensioner partner (the income test cut-off point for the JSP partner is higher than applies to individuals or allowance couples</li>
		<li>
long term single JSP customers aged 60 or over who receive Rent Assistance (RA) </li>
		<li>
JSP single principal carers </li>
		<li>
job seekers with a working credit balance in the entitlement period they are paid employment income, see <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-07030080-03.html#bp03_tbl_Unfavourable_decisio_Step01">Step 1 in Table 2</a></li>

<p>When a provider advises a job seeker has been placed in full-time ongoing employment, an electronic transaction will be sent via the Department of Employment system and Workplace Relations to Centrelink, which updates the job seeker's record.</p>

<p>The transaction will automatically update the Employment Status with code '<strong>FTO</strong>' code on the Customer Employment Status (<strong>EAES</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>When this occurs, <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010010-01.html">employment income</a> must be recorded as full-time ongoing so the customer can access their Working Credit balance. After the depletion of any working credits, payment will be auto cancelled under reason '<strong>FWC</strong>' Full-time Employment - Working Credit balance is zero.</p>

<p>If there is no ongoing income recorded, the job seeker's payment will be auto cancelled under reason '<strong>FTE</strong>' from the Entitlement Period Start Date (EPSD) of the fortnight in which they commenced full time employment. The job seeker is not able to utilise their Working Credit balance unless employment income is reported and payment is restored.</p>
