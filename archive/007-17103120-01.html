the customer experienced an <a href="../families/007-17103158-01.html">ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship)</a> event (or multiple events)</li>

this was within 6 months of lodging the application, and</li>
		<li>
this has caused them temporary financial hardship resulting in a reduction in their ability to pay child care fees</li>
		</ul>
<p>In some circumstances, the Australian government may approve periods of reduced evidence requirements for ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship) applications. During these periods staff do not need to request further evidence of how these events have reduced a customer's ability to pay child care fees.</p>

<p>Where a natural disaster is declared, reduced evidence requirements may also be approved in some circumstances. Where the customer or their partner receive an applicable payment for an approved event, further evidence to demonstrate financial hardship is not required.</p>

<p>If evidence is not provided, the application&#58;</p>

<p>As part of the application process, customers are asked to indicate the date they would like the ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship) payment to start. The start date must be a Monday and can be any future date. It cannot&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
be more than 28 days before the application was submitted, and</li>
		<li>
start prior to the circumstance or event that resulted in temporary financial hardship</li>
		</ul>
<p>A customer does not need to be using child care prior to lodging a claim.</p>

<p>In exceptional circumstances, an application can be backdated more than 28 days if the delay in lodging the application is not the fault of the individual. Evidence may be requested to support this.</p>

<p>If more information is needed to process an ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship) application, customers will be asked to provide the information within 14 days.

<p>Customers are asked to select the number of weeks they would like to receive ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship), as part of their application. The maximum period payable for an event (or multiple events) that caused financial hardship is 13 weeks.</p>

<p>If a customer continues to experience financial hardship due to an event they received less than 13 weeks of ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship), they can apply again using the same event, as long as the event is still within 6 months of the date of the subsequent application. In this case, the customer can only be granted the balance of the maximum 13 weeks.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A determination of ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship) is linked to a particular child and a particular customer. If the customer has multiple children, they can select which children the application relates to. The application can be used to make multiple determinations (1 for each child). It is important to note the application for each child must be made within 6 months of the Temporary Financial Hardship event.</p>

<p>Example&#58; A customer has 3 children and lost their job in May. The customer applies for ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship) in June, requesting the determination be backdated to May (can only be backdated up to 28 days). The customer decides to apply for each child separately to receive the subsidy sequentially for each of the children. This would see the customer applying for ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship) over 39 weeks (13 weeks multiplied by 3 children). This is not allowable for the last child as the claim made for the last child would more than likely fall outside the 6 month period.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> receiving the subsidy sequentially, rather than concurrently, does not result in the customer receiving more subsidy. If a customer chooses this option, it is important to take into account the date the event took place. Staggering claims may result in a final claim not falling within 6 months of the event. Customers are also required to demonstrate they are still in financial hardship with a reduced ability to pay child care fees.</p>

<p>In <a href="../families/007-17103144-01.html">exceptional circumstances</a>, customers can apply to receive an assessment that is higher than 120% of the relevant hourly rate cap and/or access more than 100 hours of subsidised child care.</p>

<p>It is important to note exceptional circumstances will only be granted in extreme and unusual cases. Customers are required to supply evidence to support their application, such as a medical certificate, or policy report.</p>

<p>Exceptional circumstance for increased hours will not be granted if the main reason for the request is the customer's entitled hours do not cover hours the service is charging. (For example, the customer is entitled to 100 hours per fortnight and the child attends 10 days per fortnight. The child care service charges for 11.5 hour sessions, meaning the customer is billed for 115 hours per fortnight.).</p>

<p><strong>More than 120%</strong> - customers can request to be considered for more than 120% of the hourly rate cap. These requests must be made through their child care service, who will lodge a submission for consideration directly to the Department of Education, Skills and Employment.</p>

<p><strong>More than 100 hours</strong> - customers can contact Services Australia to ask to be considered for more than 100 hours of subsidised care per fortnight. The maximum number of hours that can be considered is 24 hours per day (24 x 14 = 336 per fortnight) in extreme cases. All requests for additional hours are referred to the CCS Level 2 Helpdesk once all information and evidence has been provided.</p>

<p>Customers must advise as soon as possible if their circumstances change as this may affect their eligibility to CCS or ACCS. Notifiable events may include an increase in family income estimate, or no longer being in financial hardship.</p>

<p>A determination of ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship) can be changed if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a customer advises they are no longer in financial hardship</li>
		<li>
a customer requests a change to start date and no sessions of care have occurred in that CCS fortnight, change the start date to the CCS fortnight in which the first session of care will occur</li>
		<li>
Services Australia determines the customer is no longer/or never was in temporary financial hardship</li>

<p>If a determination is changed, it can only reduce the number of whole weeks for which it takes effect, not to increase the number of weeks of ACCS (temporary financial hardship). Changes can include changing the start date of the determination to a later Monday or bringing forward the end date to an earlier Monday.
