<p>Advise the customer about School Meals Program and the benefits&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the food is good value and costs very little compared to buying similar meals from the local store</li>
		<li>
it’s a consistent, predictable expense to have paid without needing to think about it</li>
		<li>
peace of mind knowing children will receive meals every day at school</li>
		<li>
can help to improve student's school attendance</li>
		<li>
everyone receives the same meals</li>
		<li>
receiving regular meals may improve concentration</li>
		<li>
school teachers can concentrate on preparing classes and not be involved in organising meals for students</li>
		<li>
when paying via Income Management, allocations are not paid during the end of year school holidays (that is from the end of Term 4 the previous year to the start of Term 1 the following year)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Contributions to a School Meals Program are voluntary</strong></p>

<p>School Meals Program expense allocations would generally be made by the person who receives Family Tax Benefit (FTB) for that child.</p>

<p>If a parent does not direct any of their income managed funds towards a School Meals Program, it is important the Service Officer ensures the child's needs are being met. This can be done by&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
asking the customer to explain how the child’s daily needs are being met</li>
		<li>
checking Income Management and voluntary deductions for food provisions</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> customer's explanations should be taken on face value. Under no circumstances should customers be asked to provide documentary evidence of how they are meeting the child's daily food needs.</p>

<p>Under legislation, if a Service Officer is not satisfied a priority need is being met, action must be taken to allocate the customer's income managed funds as required. This may include referral to a social worker, an Income Management Contact Officer or the Income Management Policy helpdesk for an independent evaluation of the situation. Any decision should be documented on the customer’s record.</p>

Payments will be automatically stopped at the end of the school year</li>

They only need to contact the agency if their circumstances change, including care of the child, or enrolment at a different school</li>

When providers calculate the cost of School Meals Programs, allowances are made for a level of absences and public holidays throughout the school year</li>

<p>Customers are not entitled to a refund of any contributions made to a School Meals Program arising from a child's temporary absence from school. When providers calculate the cost of delivering School Meals Programs, allowances are made for a level of absences and public holidays throughout the school year. Customers can also arrange for meals to be collected from the school during short periods of absence.</p>

<p>To avoid any overpayment to a TPO, customers should advise Services Australia of any change in their child’s circumstances as soon as possible. However, extraordinary and unanticipated circumstances may arise where a customer may have a reasonable claim to request recovery of payments made to a School Meals Program. For example, customers may have been unable to notify the agency of an extended absence, or a transfer to another school due to circumstances beyond their control.</p>

<p>If a customer believes they have such a claim, the same Income Management recovery process will be applied. See <a href="../payment-delivery/103-01050070-01.html">Recall of Income Management funds</a>.</p>
