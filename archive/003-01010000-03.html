have participated in the Australian tax system for at least one year in the past 3 financial years, <strong>or</strong></li>
		<li>
will participate in the Australian tax system in the next 12 months</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Participation in the Australian tax system means the customer's income is <strong>above</strong> the <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-01010000-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Income_Tax_Rate">tax free threshold</a> for at least 1 year in the past 3 financial years, <strong>or</strong> will be in the next 12 months. </p>

<p>To check what is <strong>above</strong> the tax free threshold, when accessing the link from the Resource page to the ‘Australian Taxation Office’s individual income tax rates’, see the <strong>Resident tax rates</strong>. The customer’s income under the column ‘Taxable income’ <strong>must</strong> show an amount of <strong>tax payable</strong> under the column ‘Tax on this income.’ For example, 19 cents for each $1 over $18,200</p>

<p>Participated in the Australian tax system means a customer’s income is over the <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-01010000-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Income_Tax_Rate">tax free threshold</a>, or will be in the next 12 months.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a customer has allowable deductions that takes their income below the <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-01010000-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Income_Tax_Rate">tax free threshold<strong></a>,</strong> contact Technical Peer Support who will escalate a <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-01010000-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Payment_Query_t">payment query template</a> to the Level 2 Helpdesk. These queries will be escalated to the Level 3 Helpdesk.</p>

<p>For the relevant financial years and ‘next 12 months’ date, see <strong>NZ DRP tax participation</strong> in the Background page of the Operational Blueprint for the event.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> to find the Operational Blueprint for the event, see <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-14010000-01.html">Current emergency management events</a> and select <strong>Natural Disasters</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Evidence is required before granting NZ DRP</strong></p>

<p>Evidence may include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a previous tax return or Notice of Assessment as proof of participation in the Australian tax system in the past 3 financial years</li>
		<li>
a payslip or letter from their current employer that they will meet this requirement in the next 12 months</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer cannot provide the evidence as they have lost their records in the disaster, they can get a copy of their Notice of Assessment from the Australian Tax Office (ATO). Customers with a myGov account may be able to access this information if their ATO account is a linked service.</p>

<p>Also request evidence if the customer cannot show participation in the tax system for any of the following reasons&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
their income did not meet <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-01010000-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Income_Tax_Rate">income tax thresholds</a></li>
		<li>
they have lodged non-taxable returns or nil activity statements</li>
		<li>
they have not yet lodged a tax return</li>
		<li>
they did not need to lodge tax returns or activity statements</li>
		</ul>
<p>Evidence may include a payslip or letter from the customer’s current employer that there is a likelihood they will pay tax within Australia in the next 12 months.</p>

<p>When submitting a claim, customers are asked to provide this information and advised their claim cannot be assessed until they provide it. NZ DRP <strong>cannot </strong>be granted until this evidence has been provided.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a customer is claiming for a biological child of a current relationship, a principal carer assessment is not needed.

<p>If an event occurs over a period, the principal care of a child may change from one person to another. If both principal carers are adversely affected by the major disaster at different times and meet all other eligibility criteria, they can both receive AGDRP or NZ DRP for the same dependent child.</p>

<p>Consider if the person&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
was near the disaster at the time of the disaster, and</li>
		<li>
has not communicated with family members, friends, colleagues or significant others in the 14 days following the disaster, and</li>
		<li>
not returned to their principal place of residence or work in the 14 days following the disaster, and</li>
		<li>
not found by police and emergency services</li>
		</ul>
<p>For AGDRP and NZ DRP, a ‘missing person’ will be presumed killed as a direct result of the major disaster.</p>

<p>For more information, see <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-01030010-01.html">AGDRP and NZ DRP claims for an immediate family member who has died or is missing</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Evidence</strong></p>

<p>The customer should provide a copy of a missing person report. If this is not available, a declaration by the customer may be accepted. A declaration should not be accepted until the social worker has assessed the customer’s circumstances.</p>

<p>Social workers, as well as providing specialist support, can help in obtaining evidence.</p>

<p>A principal place of residence is where a person&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
regularly lives with a degree of settled purpose, and</li>
		<li>
has a lawful right to live</li>
		</ul>
<p>Degree of settled purpose in that place means&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a regular or usual pattern of living there, and</li>
		<li>
settlement with a degree of permanence</li>
		</ul>
<p>Settlement could include, but is not limited to, living in a place for&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
caring, </li>
		<li>
education, </li>
		<li>
work or </li>
		<li>
medical treatment or condition. </li>
		</ul>
<p>This is not a complete list.</p>

<p>A principal place of residence can include any of the following, if the customer regularly lives there with a degree of settled purpose <strong>and</strong> has a lawful right to live there&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
home that a customer owns</li>
		<li>
home that a customer rents</li>
		</ul>
<p>A caravan or tent can be a principal place of residence if a customer has a right or licence to be on the land where the caravan is parked or the tent is pitched. If the customer has no right or licence to park their caravan or pitch their tent on the land, this <strong>does not</strong> meet the definition of ‘principal place of residence’.</p>

<p>A person can have more than one principal place of residence but can only make one claim for the same major disaster. For example, a customer may have a second principal place of residence that they live in during the week as it is close to a hospital where they receive on-going medical treatment.</p>

<p>A person may not have a principal place of residence if they do not have a residence they normally live in and have a legal right or license to live in.</p>

<p>Holiday homes, second residences and investment properties generally do not meet the definition of a person's principal place of residence.</p>

<p>The principal place of residence&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
includes all rooms that are fully enclosed and under a common roof space</li>
		<li>
in most free-standing homes includes a garage or a similar structure (such as a laundry) if it was</li>
			<ul>			<li>
under the common roof space, or</li>
			<li>
attached to the main residence</li>		</ul>
		<li>
can include structures apart from the main residence but on the same property if the person</li>
			<ul>			<li>
regularly lives in the place with a degree of settled purpose, and</li>
			<li>
has a lawful right to live in the place</li>		</ul>
		<li>
for high density housing (multi-storey unit, apartment block or townhouse) is the self-contained residence only. It excludes all common areas the person may access (for example, staircases, hallways and common car parks or basements). However, it can include common areas that form part of the internal make-up of the self-contained residence (for example, common walls and ceilings)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Evidence of a customer’s principal place of residence is not required, unless there are concerns about the validity of an address a customer has provided (for example advising they have moved into a declared LGA). </p>

<p><strong>If there are concerns&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Ask for evidence such as&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
utility bills</li>
			<li>
current rental agreement</li>
			<li>
bank statements</li>
			<li>
driver’s licence</li>		</ul>
		<li>

		</ul>
<p><strong>A prison or place of detention (AGDRP only)</strong></p>

<p>A prison or place of detention is not a person's principal place of residence. Although they normally live there, they do not have a license or right to live there. This may mean that some prisoners have no principal place of residence.</p>

<p>However, they may be eligible for AGDRP under other adversely affected criteria. For example, the prisoner&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
is the immediate family member of an Australian resident or citizen killed, or</li>
		<li>
has been seriously injured</li>
		</ul>
<p>This is not relevant for NZ DRP due to the nature of the visa</p>

<p><strong>Floodwater</strong></p>

<p>Floodwater is water flowing along the ground at floor level. </p>

<p><strong>Rainwater</strong></p>

<p>Rainwater is water that falls as rain from the sky.</p>

<p>For heavy rainfall to meet the major damage criteria, rainwater needs to have entered a person’s principal place of residence through a breach, as a direct result of the major disaster. For example, there must have been damage to the residence that exposes the interior of the residence to the elements.</p>

<p>Rainwater that comes through a breach&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
that is supposed to be there, for example doorway or window (open or closed) - this <strong>does not</strong> meet the major damage criteria</li>
		<li>
that is <strong>not</strong> supposed<strong> </strong>to be there, for example, broken tiles, lifted tin, overflowing gutters, hole in the wall – this <strong>does</strong> meet the major damage criteria</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> a <strong>breach</strong> is a gap in, for example, a wall, window or roof</p>

<p><strong>Mould</strong></p>

<p>If a customer advises they have mould in their principal place of residence, this does not mean they meet the major damage criteria. Flood or rainwater must have entered the customer’s principal place of residence, as a direct result of the major disaster as per <strong>Floodwater</strong> and <strong>Rainwater</strong> above, for them to meet this criteria. </p>

<p>Mould growth because of atmospheric moisture (high humidity) for the period of a disaster event does not meet the major damage criteria.</p>
