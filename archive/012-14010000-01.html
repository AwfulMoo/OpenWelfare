	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Before 1 July 1997, Medical Defence Organisations (MDO) provided MI cover, on a ‘discretionary’ basis. MDOs retained the discretion to decide whether to provide indemnity and assistance to the medical practitioner, and the medical practitioner would have no recourse against the decision. In practice, MDOs generally exercised this discretion in favour of the medical practitioner and refusals would generally only occur in cases involving fraud, criminal activity, sexual misconduct or drug abuse.</p>

<p>The amount of indemnity provided to medical practitioners was considered to be unlimited. However, in practice, cover was limited by the capital available to the MDO. </p>

<p>Since 1997, several Medical Indemnity Insurers (MIIs) have offered (some exclusively for example, MDA National) claims-made cover. Claims-made cover allows a medical practitioner to notify the insurer of a claim within the terms of the current cover, for an incident that occurred within a recognised period. Before 1 July 1997, this ‘recognised’ period related to the medical practitioner’s annual membership with the MDO. After 1 July 1997, this recognised period relates to the policy period specified in the insurance contract issued to the medical practitioner by the MII.</p>

<p>In 2002, Australia’s largest MDO, United Medical Protection, was placed in provisional liquidation. </p>

<p>Since 1 July 2003, MI insurance has been compulsory for Australian practitioners, by insurers licensed under the Insurance Act 1973. The Resources page contains a table outlining the major features of MI insurance pre and post 1 July 2003.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_High_Cost_Claim">Schemes</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p><strong>High Cost Claim Indemnity Scheme (HCCS)</strong></p>

<p>HCCS is set out in legislation that commenced on 1 January 2003 to remedy the upward pressure on MI premiums by reducing the large cost of claims on Medical Indemnity Insurers (MIIs) and Medical Defence Organisations (MDOs). The government funds the HCCS, which pays 50% of out of pocket costs by MIIs and MDOs that are greater than the applicable HCCS threshold amount, up to the limit of a medical practitioner’s or allied health professional’s indemnity cover. The Department of Health and Aged Care provides funding via a sweeping account arrangement.</p>

<p>In order for a claim to be eligible under the HCCS, it must reach a threshold that depends on the date the MII or MDO was first notified of the claim. The 4 thresholds are&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
$2 million for claims notified between 1 January 2003 and 21 October 2003</li>
		<li>
$500,000 for claims notified between 22 October 2003 and 31 December 2003</li>
		<li>
$300,000 for claims notified between 1 January 2004 and 30 June 2018</li>
		<li>
$500,000 for claims notified on or after 1 July 2018</li>
		</ul>
<p>From 1 July 2020 this scheme is limited to medical practitioners.</p>

<p></p>
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Allied_Health_H"></a>
<p><strong>Allied Health High Cost Claim Indemnity Scheme (AHHCCS)</strong></p>

<p>AHHCCS is set out in legislation that commenced on 1 July 2020 to contribute towards the availability of certain allied health services in Australia by reducing the large cost of MII claims. The government funds the AHHCCS, which pays 50% of out of pocket MII costs that are greater than the applicable AHHCCS threshold amount, up to the limit of the allied health professional’s indemnity cover. The Department of Health and Aged Care provides funding via a sweeping account arrangement.</p>

<p>For a claim to be eligible under the AHHCCS, it must reach a threshold dependent on the date the incident occurred. The current threshold is&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
$500,000 for incidents that occurred on or after 1 July 2020</li>
		</ul>
<p>This scheme will only be initially open to certain insurers providing professional indemnity insurance to registered medical practitioners (or their employers).</p>

<p></p>
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_RunOff_Cover_I"></a>
<p><strong>Run off Cover Indemnity Scheme (ROCS)</strong></p>

<p>ROCS is set out in legislation that commenced on 1 July 2004 to remove the need for medical practitioners to fund their own run-off cover when they have left the private medical workforce. It also provides a guarantee that the cost of MI claims covered by the scheme will be funded. Under ROCS, the government covers the full cost of eligible claims (100%) for incidents that were first notified on or after 1 July 2004. In addition, the MIIs and MDOs can claim a handling fee (5%) of the amount being claimed. ROCS is directly funded through contributions collected under ROCS Support Payments, which is a payment by MIIs based on a proportion of each medical practitioner’s insurance premium collected annually through a contribution year. Prior to ROCS, medical practitioners needed to purchase death, disablement, and retirement run-off cover from MDOs when the medical practitioner stopped practising.</p>

<p></p>
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_IBNR"></a>
<p><strong>Incurred But Not Reported Indemnity Scheme (IBNR)</strong></p>

<p>IBNR assists an eligible MDO by funding medical insurance payouts in specified circumstances and covers claims for incidents that took place before 30 June 2002 and were notified to the MDO on or after 1 July 2002. Under IBNR, the government covers the full costs of eligible claims (100%) from MDOs that do not have adequate reserves to cover their liabilities. In addition, MDOs can claim a handling fee (5%) of the amount being claimed. The Department of Health and Aged Care provides funding via a sweeping account arrangement.</p>

<p>Under IBNR, an MDO is a participating MDO as defined under section 5 of the Act. Only 1 MDO (United Medical Protection, now known as Avant Insurance Limited) is currently determined as being able to participate in IBNR.</p>

<p></p>
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Exceptional_Cla"></a>
<p><strong>Exceptional Claims Indemnity Scheme (ECS)</strong></p>

<p>ECS is designed to protect medical practitioners against personal liability for eligible claims that exceed the level of their insurance cover. The government funds 100% of the cost of eligible claims above their insurance limit, and equals or exceeds the relevant threshold. The Department of Health and Aged Care provides funding via a sweeping account arrangement.</p>

<p>The ECS covers incidents that are notified on or after 1 January 2003. A claim can be for a single incident or for a series of related incidents.</p>

<p>To determine whether the medical practitioner’s contract limit equals or exceeds the relevant threshold, the relevant threshold is the date the MII was first notified of the claim, or of facts that might give rise to the claim. The thresholds are&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
$15 million for claims notified on or after 1 January 2003 and before 1 July 2003 </li>
		<li>
$20 million for claims notified on or after 1 July 2003</li>
		</ul>
<p>From 1 July 2020 this scheme is limited to medical practitioners.</p>

<p></p>
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Allied_Health_E"></a>
<p><strong>Allied Health Exceptional Claims Indemnity Scheme (AHECS)</strong></p>

<p>AHECS is set out in legislation that commenced on 1 July 2020 and is designed to protect allied health professionals, registered by the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra), against personal liability for eligible claims that exceed the level of their insurance cover. The government funds 100% of the cost of eligible claims above their insurance limit, and equals or exceeds the relevant threshold. The AHECS covers incidents that occurred on or after 1 July 2020. A claim can be for a single incident or for a series of related incidents. The Department of Health and Aged Care provides funding via a sweeping account arrangement.</p>

<p>To be eligible for the AHECS, the allied health professional’s contract limit must equal or exceed the relevant threshold, determined by the date of the incident. The current threshold is&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
$20 million for incidents that occurred on or after 1 July 2020</li>
		</ul>
<p>This scheme is limited to certain MIIs as set out in the Rules.</p>

<p><strong>Medical Indemnity Insurance</strong></p>

<p>In Australia, it is a mandatory requirement for registered healthcare practitioners to hold the appropriate medical indemnity insurance for healthcare practice in Australia.</p>

<p>Medical indemnity insurance plays a vital role within the Australian health system by working to protect both healthcare practitioners and patients in the event of an adverse incident arising from medical care. While Australia’s health system is generally very safe, things occasionally go wrong and patients may sometimes be harmed in the process of receiving medical care.</p>

<p></p>
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Medical_Defence"></a>
<p><strong>Medical Defence Organisation (MDO)</strong></p>

<p>MDOs were set up by doctors over 100 years ago to deal with legal and ethical aspects of medical practice, such as negligence. They were established as friendly societies and mutual funds, which were owned by their members, and provided indemnity to doctors on a discretionary basis. </p>

<p>The role of MDOs has grown and changed over the past century. They are now large organisations, with a high degree of experience in medical and legal issues.</p>

<p></p>
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Medical_Indemni01"></a>
<p><strong>Medical Indemnity Insurer (MII)</strong></p>

<p>Since July 2003, medical indemnity must be provided via an insurance contract. Medical Indemnity Insurers (MIIs) are required to meet the same prudential standards as general insurance companies and are regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (APRA). This provides a high level of security for consumers and doctors.</p>

<p>MIIs are subsidiaries of MDOs.</p>

<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Medical_Indemni02"></a>
<p><strong>Medical Indemnity Online Claiming (MIOC) system</strong></p>

<p>In July 2020, Services Australia introduced the Medical Indemnity Online Claiming (MIOC) system. </p>

<p>An eligible MII or MDO can submit an online HCCS, AHHCCS, ROCS or IBNR payment application along with the relevant supporting documentation via the MIOC system. </p>

<p>Applications for the ECS and AHECS can be made by MIIs or the person against whom the claim was made (or someone acting on their behalf), and must be submitted using the Services Australia approved payment application form. Staff will need to enter this into MIOC on the customer’s behalf, as an external interface is not available for these claim types. </p>

<p>The MIOC system reduces the manual administration tasks required to process applications. Eligible insurers are required to access the MIOC system via their PRODA log in and submit an application including supporting documents. The MIOC system checks eligibility requirements for HCCS, ROCS and IBNR. Answers provided by the applicant will determine whether the system allows them to submit their application and the supporting information required. Once submitted, an application reference number (ARN) is automatically generated. </p>

<p>The MIOC system has the capacity to automatically assess applications for approval by the delegate with limited intervention. When certain criteria are met (based on system specifications), the application will be marked as requiring quality assurance checks. This means that assessment of the application is required by a Program Officer to ensure the claim meets legislative requirements and can be approved by the delegate. </p>

<p>Subsequent applications are prepopulated with details from the initial or previous application for that claim ARN. The applicant can change certain fields in the subsequent application they are submitting, however they cannot change the insured person details. Subsequent applications submitted against historical (migrated) applications will only have limited data prepopulated into the application. These subsequent applications will show the insured person as ‘null null’ in the MIOC Approval screen as the information is not available to be prepopulated. Payment amounts for migrated applications are considered in the MIOC claim calculations.</p>

<p>The process for assessing a claim is very similar from scheme to scheme. The scheme specific Assessment Worksheets will walk the Assessing Officer (AO) through the relevant information required for each scheme.</p>

<p>All applications awaiting finalisation in MIOC will be listed in the Approvals screen, and can be viewed for assessment. Staff can view various details about the applications in this screen including their status. Statuses include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Quality Assurance</strong> – the application needs to be assessed, no recommendation has been made</li>
		<li>
<strong>Approve</strong> – the system (in automated mode) or an AO has recommended that the application be paid</li>
		<li>
<strong>Request further information</strong> - an AO has recommended that further information is required to finalise assessment of the application</li>
		<li>
<strong>Further Information Submitted</strong> – further information has been submitted by the applicant, in response to a Section 38 letter, and the application needs to be re-assessed and a recommendation made</li>
		<li>
<strong>Deemed not payable</strong> - an AO has recommended that the application is not payable</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p><strong>Manual Claiming</strong></p>

<p>In the event the MIOC system is unavailable for a period of time (determined by the Director), a HCCS, ROCS or IBNR application can be submitted with the relevant supporting documentation, via post or email. If needed, manually submitted applications must be monitored via a Work on Hand spreadsheet and processed manually.</p>

<p>An initial application received via post or email will not be issued with a claim ARN number, as the ARN is auto generated by the MIOC system. Manual registration and assessment will need to be completed without an ARN number. When the system is operational, the application will then be manually entered into the system and an ARN generated. </p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Combining of Medical Indemnity claims to a single claim</strong></p>

<p>Combining of claims refers to the situation where a court has formally joined or agreed to join claims into a single proceeding or action.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Supporting evidence</strong></p>

<p>If an insurer decides to submit a combined claim under the Run-off Cover Scheme or High Costs Claim Scheme, the insurer must provide appropriate evidence in support of their claim.</p>

<p>Evidence should include either&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a Court Order that shows that 2 or more claims had been joined by the Court, or</li>
		<li>
a document produced or accepted by the relevant court evidencing that 2 or more matters have been heard together, for example, a judgment or settlement document or approved application for joinder</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p><strong>Deemed not payable</strong></p>

<p>The Medical Indemnity Act 2002 (the Act) does not use the term 'reject' when referring to an application that does not meet the requirements of a Medical Indemnity Scheme. The Act instead refers to determining whether an 'indemnity scheme payment is payable'.</p>

<p>A claim for payment may be deemed not payable if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The eligibility requirements set out in the Act are not met</li>
		<li>
Insufficient information is provided to assess the claim against the requirements of the Act</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p><strong>Aggregating payments for the same claim </strong></p>

<p>MDOs and MIIs can elect to aggregate amounts paid or payable in respect of the same claim in accordance with Section 31 of the High Cost Claim Indemnity Scheme (HCCS) and Section 34ZE of the Run-off Cover Indemnity Scheme (ROCS) of the Medical Indemnity Act 2002. </p>

<p>For the purposes of ROCS or HCCS, where both an MDO and an MII have paid, or are liable to pay amounts in relation to the same member or policy holder in respect of the same claim, they may aggregate those costs and make a single application for payment.</p>

<p>The MO008 - Medical Indemnity Request to aggregate payments for the same claim form must be completed and submitted with the MI payment application. See the <a href="../health-professionals/012-14010000-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Forms">Resources</a> page for a link to the MO008 form.</p>

<p>The advice relating to aggregation of MI claims to a single application does not change the requirement for aggregate payments for the same claim form.</p>

<p></p>
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Payment_schedul"></a>
<p><strong>Payment schedule</strong></p>

<p>The payment schedule for MI is legislated in the Act.</p>

<p>Under section 37 of the Act, payment for eligible MI applications submitted under HCCS, AHHCCS, ROCS and IBNR must be made to the applicant before the end of the month immediately following the month in which the application, or response to our request for further information under Section 38, was received.</p>

<p>For applications submitted under the ECS or AHECS, payment requirements are legislated under Section 37B of the Act. See the <a href="../health-professionals/012-14000000-04.html">References</a> page for a link to the Act.</p>

<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Review_of_Decis"></a>
<p><strong>Review of Decision</strong></p>

<p>If an applicant would like to dispute the delegate’s decision in relation to an application for payment under the HCCS, AHHCCS, ROCS or IBNR schemes, Services Australia will take all necessary steps to resolve the dispute informally with the relevant MDO or MII.</p>

<p>If a satisfactory resolution cannot be reached through an informal process, the applicant may elect to request a review of decision. The request must be in writing and should set out the details of the dispute including any additional supporting documentation.</p>

<p>The internal review is an administrative service that Services Australia provides to MDOs and MIIs. It is not set out in the Medical Indemnity Act 2002 or in other legislation. Services Australia will acknowledge receipt of the request for review within 28 days of the request being received.</p>

<p>Applicants who would like to dispute the delegate’s decision in relation to an application for a payment under the ECS or AHECS can request a review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</p>

<h2 id="Types of cover">Types of cover</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p><strong>Discretionary cover</strong></p>

<p>Discretionary cover generally refers to cover that was available before 1 July 2003. This cover still exists as overarching cover and is sometimes referred to as umbrella cover. </p>

<p>Prior to 1 July 2003, medical practitioners paid an annual membership to an MDO which would give them discretionary indemnity cover. The cover was of differing levels and was generally based on the chosen field of the medical practitioner and the services they provided. </p>

<p>As protection was discretionary, MDOs had the ability to give or deny assistance to their members. </p>

<p>See also&#58; Part 3 Division 2 of the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Act 2003.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Contract of insurance</strong></p>

<p>All medical practitioners are required to have a contract of insurance in order to be registered to practise medicine in Australia.</p>

<p>See also&#58; Contracts of insurance policy.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Claims-made based cover</strong></p>

<p>Claims-made based cover is provided through a contract of insurance and gives a medical practitioner MI insurance for a specified period in time. A contract of insurance usually lasts for twelve months, and then it must be renewed and new premiums are paid. Each new contract voids any previous contracts.</p>

<p>Claims-made based cover can include retroactive cover for past periods. The retroactive date is specified on a medical practitioner’s policy schedule and determines how much of their prior practice is covered under their policy. To meet the requirements of claims-made based cover a claim must have occurred and be notified to the insurer during the period specified in the contract of insurance. Claims-made based cover is for the period stated in the contract of insurance. </p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Retroactive cover</strong></p>

<p>Retroactive cover is insurance cover for claims arising from incidents that took place before the commencement of the current insurance policy. Retroactive cover must be offered at the time that the MII offers claims-made based cover. </p>

<p>Where retroactive cover is provided in conjunction with claims-made based cover, it insures against claims arising out of incidents that occurred before the commencement of the current claims-made based policy but which are notified during the term of the current claims-made based policy. If a medical practitioner does not acquire adequate retroactive cover and a claim arises from their work prior to the retroactive date, the medical practitioner will not have cover for that claim. Adequate cover needs to be evidenced by the most current policy which specifies the dates of all cover periods. </p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Incident-occurring based cover</strong></p>

<p>Incident-occurring based cover can also be referred to as discretionary and retroactive cover. The industry standard is that incident-occurring based cover is the term used for discretionary cover. </p>

<p>Incident-occurring based cover gives medical practitioners MI insurance for the incident date. Any claim arising out of an incident that took place during the term of discretionary cover or insurance policy, regardless of when the claim was notified, falls under incident-occurring based cover.</p>

<p>See also&#58; Section 6 of the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Act 2003 and Section 7 of the Medical Indemnity Act 2002 and section 18 of the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Act 2003.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Tail cover</strong></p>

<p>Tail cover is insurance that covers a medical practitioner for any period that follows an insurance policy, once they are no longer practising as a private medical practitioner. In most circumstances tail cover applies to periods before a medical practitioner becomes eligible for the Run-off Cover Scheme.</p>
