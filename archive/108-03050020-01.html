<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Clearance_proce">Clearance process</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The clearance process refers to information and data exchanged between Services Australia (Centrelink) and DVA. This ensures the customer and other linked persons, such as their partner, dependant, or carer, receive the correct benefit type and payment rate.</p>

<p>Clearance processes can occur via a data exchange or manually via email. Manual intervention of automatic clearances may be required where data cannot be loaded on a record and needs further verification and assessment. Manual clearances are actioned by the DVA Clearance Team.</p>

<p>The Clearance process will ensure that&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
DVA customer records are identified, linked or unlinked to corresponding Centrelink records</li>
		<li>
<a href="../initial-contact-general/106-05010070-05.html">Mutually exclusive benefits</a> are not paid by both Services Australia and DVA concurrently</li>
		<li>
Benefits are coded with correct start and end dates, and paid at the correct rate</li>
		<li>
Both Services Australia and DVA can recover overpayments for the other as part of the clearance process</li>
		</ul>
<p>A DVA Clearance refers to a DVA initiated data exchange, where DVA sends information to Services Australia about a change to a DVA benefit.</p>

<p>A DVA Reverse Clearance refers to a Centrelink initiated data exchange, where Services Australia send information to DVA about a change to a Centrelink payment or benefit.</p>

<p>The clearance process is required when&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
DVA customer receiving an income support payment is transferring to a Centrelink income support payment. <strong>Do not reject these claims without consulting with the DVA Clearance Team</strong></li>
		<li>
Services Australia customer or their partner is granted a DVA income support payment, War Widow(er) Pension, DVA grant Compensation for Permanent Impairment, or to a Wholly Dependent Partner (WDP) or Eligible Young Person (EYP) under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 (MRCA)</li>
		<li>
Services Australia customer or their partner is granted or has a change in rate of DVA Disability Compensation Payment</li>
		<li>
Services Australia customer is caring for a person who is receiving a DVA income support payment</li>
		<li>
Supplements become payable by either Services Australia or DVA</li>
		<li>
DVA grant a Prescribed Education Scheme payment to a child or young dependant of a Veteran</li>
		<li>
Customer submits a new claim to Services Australia and advises about a payment received from DVA</li>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Services Australia and DVA exchange information daily about changes that affect customer's payments. Data may be placed on a customer's record automatically.</p>

<p>Automatic exchange of data can flow only if identity matching has occurred and a Centrelink Customer Reference Number (CRN) is linked to a DVA Unique Identification Number (UIN). When matching fails, the DVA Clearance Team conducts manual matching of Centrelink and DVA customer records.</p>

<p>If the data on a customer record is incomplete and unable to assess the benefit status of the customer, or the payment information from DVA is not transmitted via the automated exchange, a manual clearance will be completed.</p>

<p>Services Australia (Centrelink) and DVA have a bilateral agreement, which outlines the relationship between the two agencies and the expected standards of performance. Set guidelines and agreements between Services Australia and DVA determine rules about clearances. Guidelines determine&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
delegation and authority to disclose information</li>

obligations about what information can be requested and exchanged between the two agencies</li>

<p>The Centrelink payment will be reassessed upon receipt of this advice. A DVA benefit under the <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-05010070-01.html">multiple entitlement exclusion</a> rules, will cancel a current Centrelink payment or benefit.</p>

<p>In the event that cancellation results in a debt, Centrelink transmits debt amounts to DVA as part of an automated recovery process for payments under the Veterans’ Entitlement Act (VEA) 1986. Once DVA has recovered a Centrelink debt from a customer's DVA arrears, a notification is sent to Centrelink with details of the amount recovered. These repayment details are placed on the customer's debt record, and finalised automatically. If DVA do not hold enough arrears to recover the Centrelink debt, a residual debt amount will remain on the customer's Centrelink record.</p>

<p>The Centrelink system may be unable to automatically calculate a debt amount. This may be due to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a limiting date</li>
		<li>
a cancelled payment record</li>
		<li>
manual rate case, or</li>
		<li>
where conflicting data exists</li>
		</ul>
<p>In these cases, a manual clearance will be required.</p>

<p>Residual debts from the grant of War Widow(er)'s Pension may be recovered by negotiation with DVA by manual clearance, if the customer is later granted Income Support Supplement (ISS).</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>When DVA grant WDP payments under MRCA, a manual clearance process occurs. DVA sends this information via email to the DVA Clearance Team on an endorsed MRCA Clearance form.</p>

<p>These payments are assessed under multiple entitlement exclusion rules and result in the cancellation of all Services Australia income support payments for the lifetime of the recipient.</p>

<p>WDP payments are granted as an ongoing weekly entitlement (paid fortnightly) but may be commuted by the customer to a lump sum entitlement (either partially or fully) at any time within 2 years of the payment being granted.</p>

<p>Family assistance recipients must include WDP ongoing payments and/or any lump sum as income for calculating adjusted taxable income (ATI) for family assistance payments when the ongoing entitlement is granted, and again if this is commuted to a lump sum entitlement.

<p>From 1 January 2022, all DVA Disability Compensation Payment types are exempt income for social security income support payments. A Disability Compensation Payment may be reduced by a 'limiting amount', for lump sum compensation previously received. In this case only, the actual (net) amount of the Disability Compensation Payment received is treated as income.</p>

<p>A Services Australia veteran of age pension age who is paid a DVA Disability Compensation Payment under the VEA, but is not eligible for a DVA Service Pension, can elect to receive the Social Security Age Pension under the SSA paid by DVA. </p>

<p>DVA will automatically transmit details of grants and variations of Disability Compensation Payments, plus indexed rates twice a year in March and September. MRCA Permanent Impairment and SRDP payments are advised via manual clearances as explained below.</p>

<p>Manual clearance processes are in place for DVA grants of Veterans' Children Education Scheme (VCES) and Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act Education and Training Scheme (MRCAETS) payments. These are considered prescribed education scheme payments.</p>

<p>When a student receives VCES or MRCAETS, payment of any other Australian Government income support or educational assistance is precluded under DVA legislation. Legislation administered by DSS differs, as it only precludes VCES and MRCAETS recipients from receiving Youth Allowance (YA), Austudy and ABSTUDY. This allows VCES and MRCAETS to be <a href="https&#58;//guides.dss.gov.au/guide-social-security-law/4/3/5/10">treated as income</a> for the following social security income support payments&#58;</p>

<p>VCES payment will also prevent a customer from receiving Family Tax Benefit (FTB) for a child 16 years and over. The parent will need to consider the benefit of transferring an FTB child to DVA VCES. Rent Assistance paid with FTB will be lost, if the child is transferred to DVA VCES and parent is not in receipt of FTB for another child.</p>

<p>DVA will be contacted to arrange a cut-off date for the DVA payment to reduce unnecessary debts, calculate any DVA overpayment amount if necessary, and cease any DVA mutually exclusive payments coded on the record. If DVA have overpaid the customer, a debt will be raised on behalf of DVA. The debt will be linked to the claim and recovered from the customer's Centrelink arrears if applicable.</p>

<p>The Service Officer processing the claim must follow this procedure and any other instructions given by the DVA Clearance Team, to avoid incorrect claim rejection and ensure the correct outcome of the claim.</p>
