<p>When a loan is granted, the system automatically sets up a review to reassess the customer’s loan each fortnight. When the review runs&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the loan balance is updated with any loan payments issued during that fortnight, including&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
regular loan payments</li>
			<li>
arrears, and</li>
			<li>
one off payments manually paid via the Payment Adjustment (<strong>PYAJ</strong>) screen</li>		</ul>
		<li>
interest is calculated on the updated loan balance and added to the balance</li>
		</ul>
<p>Any loan repayments made during the fortnight will have already been taken into account by the time the fortnightly review runs, as the loan balance adjusts immediately when repayments are coded.</p>

<p>The updated loan balance, including accrued interest, is recorded on the HEAS Details (<strong>PLS</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>The review runs one day after the Entitlement Period End Date (EPED) each fortnight. The Event Date for the update is the EPED of the fortnight that has just ended.</p>

<p>For example, if the entitlement period is 1 January 2020 - 14 January 2020, then&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the review for that fortnight runs on 15 January 2020 (the EPED+1 day), and</li>
		<li>
the new loan balance and interest calculation is updated on the <strong>PLS</strong> screen using 14 January 2020 (the EPED) as the Event Date</li>
		</ul>
<p>The review continues to run each fortnight until the loan balance is repaid in full.</p>

<div class="showcont">


<p>The MLA is calculated based on the value of a customer’s real assets and their age component. The age component for the Scheme is determined as follows&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
if the customer is single, the age component is the customer’s age</li>
		<li>
if the customer is partnered, the age component is the age of the younger member of the couple</li>
		</ul>
<p>The system automatically recalculates the customer’s MLA each year when their age component increases. The age component increases on the customer’s birthday, or if they have a younger partner, on their partner’s birthday.</p>

<p>The MLA recalculation occurs at the end of the entitlement period in which the applicable birthday falls. The updated MLA is displayed on the HEAS Details (<strong>PLS</strong>) screen in the <strong>Maximum Loan Amount</strong> field. The Event Date for the updated MLA is the Entitlement Period End Date (EPED) for that fortnight.</p>

<p>Upon completion of the review, a Home Equity Access Scheme itemised loan statement with the updated MLA is automatically sent to the customer, unless the customer is deceased. If the customer is deceased, the letter is held on the <strong>BLST</strong> screen and an email is automatically sent to the Home Equity Access Scheme National team to review whether the statement should be released.</p>

<p>For further details on the manual review and release of the Scheme letters see <a href="../older-australians/065-08020060-03.html#bp03_tbl_Manual_reviews_Step10">Step 10 in Table 2</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the system also automatically recalculates the MLA where the <strong>Loan Security value</strong>, <strong>Nominated Amount</strong> or <strong>Deductions</strong> are manually changed on the <strong>PLS</strong> screen. Staff can also manually trigger a re-calculation of the MLA by entering '<strong>Y</strong>' to the <strong>Recalc</strong> field on the <strong>PLS</strong> screen.</p>

<div class="showcont">


<p>If a customer’s loan balance falls within $5,000 of their MLA, the system automatically generates a letter to advise the customer that they are approaching the MLA. The letter can be viewed on the History Summary (<strong>HS</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>The letter provides the customer with the opportunity to consider their financial circumstances and make necessary arrangements for when the payments cease. Some customers may decide to change their current loan arrangement to extend the period of time they can continue to receive loan payments.</p>

<p>For example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
customers may request to decrease their fortnightly loan amount, or</li>
		<li>
if a customer has more equity in Australian real estate, they may choose to&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
offer this as more security for the loan, and</li>
			<li>
ask for the MLA be recalculated</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>Requests to change a loan arrangement must be made in writing and signed by the customer and their partner (if they have one). It is recommended that customers seek independent financial or legal advice before requesting an increase to their MLA.</p>

<p>When a customer’s loan balance reaches their MLA, their loan payments automatically stop being paid. The following automatically occurs on their record&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The <strong>Cease Loan Indicator</strong> on the HEAS Details (<strong>PLS</strong>) screen is set to ‘Y’ to prevent further loan payments from being issued</li>
		<li>
The <strong>Reject/Cease Reason</strong> field on the <strong>PLS</strong> screen is updated to display cessation reason <strong>MBL</strong> (MLA reached)</li>
		<li>
A letter is generated to advise the customer that payments have stopped. The letter can be viewed on the History Summary (<strong>HS</strong>) screen</li>
		</ul>
<p>The system continues to calculate interest on the balance of the loan each fortnight until the loan has been repaid in full.</p>

<p>The customer may contact to offer additional security for the loan and request the MLA be recalculated.</p>

<p>The preferred option is for customers to use their Centrelink online account. If they are unable to use the online self service, they can complete the Home Equity Access Scheme Variation (SA497) form.</p>

<p>See <a href="../older-australians/065-08000000-01.html">Escalating enquiries to CAO's</a> for more details.</p>

<p>CPI reviews are automatically actioned by the system in March, July and September of each year.</p>

<p>An exception to the automated process occurs if the Scheme customer is paid via manual rate. In this case, a Manual Follow Up (MFU) review is created for staff to manually apply the CPI update.

<p>An MFU generates when a partnered customer is unlinked from their partner, and the customer currently receives Scheme loan payments or has an outstanding loan balance.

		<li>

<p>If the customer was receiving the Scheme loan payments at the time of being unlinked from their partner, their loan payments may automatically stop if the customer is no longer qualified.

<p>An MFU generates when a customer’s qualifying payment is cancelled and<strong> all</strong> the following criteria are met&#58;</p>

		<li>
Their qualifying payment is not Age Pension</li>
		<li>
The Scheme payments cancelled when the qualifying payment cancelled</li>

		</ul>
<p>For example, the customer is Age Pension age and they receive the loans payments as well as Carer Payment (CAR) or Disability Support Pension (DSP). If the Scheme stops when the CAR or DSP stop, the MFU is created to determine if the customer may have ongoing eligibility for the Scheme via the Age Pension qualification rules.</p>

		</ul>
<p>The Complex Assessment Officer (CAO) is to determine whether the customer may be payable as a ‘loan only’ arrangement using Age Pension qualification.</p>

<p>If restoration of the Scheme payments is possible, contact with the customer is required to determine their desired outcome, noting it may be their preference to no longer receive loan payments. The customer may wish to test their eligibility for the Age Pension first, in which case they should lodge an Age Pension claim. The outcome of the pension claim should be determined before recommencing loan payments through the Scheme.</p>

<p>An MFU generates if a customer’s qualifying payment is cancelled for a payability based reason. When the qualifying payment cancels for one of these reasons, the loan payments continue to be paid as a loan only arrangement. The qualifying payment, although cancelled, remains notionally ‘current’ in the system at a zero rate to facilitate the loans payments. </p>

<p>This does not override the legislative decision that the customer is no longer eligible for a payable rate of the qualifying payment. Therefore manual action is required to prevent any pension components from becoming payable.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The MFU has the following attributes&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Activity notes&#58; <strong>I013PH – HEAS Qualifying Payment stopped (HEAS ongoing)</strong></li>
		<li>
Keywords&#58; <strong>PLSMFU, PLSQPC</strong></li>
		</ul>
<p>The Complex Assessment Officer (CAO) is to set the <strong>HEAS Only Claim indicator</strong> on the HEAS Details (<strong>PLS</strong>) screen to Y. This will prevent the system from incorrectly auto-restoring the qualifying payment in response to coding updates on the customer’s records. For example, where the customer makes an update via their online account, or staff code an income or asset update.</p>

<p>Where the system has notionally ‘overridden’ a pension cancellation reason for the purposes of paying the loan only, staff can see the cancellation reason for the qualifying payment as follows&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Go to the <strong>XPDETR</strong> screen</li>
		<li>
Type <strong>PHPS</strong> in the <strong>Group</strong> field and press [<strong>Enter]</strong></li>
		<li>
The pension cancellation details will be indicated by the following&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
The PHPS.PEN.STS.CODE will be CAN</li>
			<li>
The PHPS.PEN.RSN.CODE will display the cancellation reason code (i.e. one of the payability based reasons)</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>If the qualifying payment has already been restored by the time the MFU is actioned, check whether the restoration action was correct. The qualifying pension must only be restored if qualification for payment has been re-established. Customers generally have to lodge a new application unless a decision has been made to reinstate the payment. For guidance see <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-10040000-01.html">Restoration of payments (CLK)</a>. If payment has been correctly restored there is no need to change the <strong>HEAS Only Claim indicator</strong>. Incorrect auto-restoration of the qualifying payment may require corrective action (for example, manual cancellation) and a debt raised for the pension components.</p>

<p>The Complex Assessment Officer (CAO) is to review whether the customer can continue receiving loan payments as a loan only arrangement. </p>

<p>Based on the cancellation reason being payability-related or a voluntary cessation, the customer may still be eligible to continue getting loan payments. Staff must establish ongoing eligibility for the Scheme, before making a decision to re-start loan payments.</p>

<p>Customers who have a loan under the provisions of the 1985 ‘old scheme’ are saved cases and require annual review. There are no system-generated reviews created on saved cases, therefore review actions must be set up and conducted manually.</p>

<p>These manual reviews are created and actioned by a Home Equity Access Scheme National Complex Assessment Officer (CAO). The manual actions required are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
create an MFU review on the customer’s record to mature annually</li>
		<li>
on maturity of the review&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Manually calculate the interest that has accrued in the previous 12 months. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> the interest calculation applicable to the old scheme is different to the current scheme. See the <a href="https&#58;//guides.dss.gov.au/social-security-guide/3/4/5/100">Social Security Guide, 3.4.5.100 Saved Cases - PLS before 10 July 1996</a> for details</li>
			<li>
Update the <strong>DOC</strong> on the Document List (<strong>DL</strong>) screen with the updated interest amount and loan balance</li>
			<li>
Create and issue a loan statement to the customer (or where applicable, their surviving partner or executor) setting out the amount of the outstanding loan balance to date</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Upon completion of the review, create a new MFU to mature in 12 months' time</li>
		</ul>
<p>As the Scheme loan amount (including interest) is an allowable deduction from the assessable asset value of the real estate used as security for the loan, update the <strong>Mortgage/Loans</strong> field on the Real Estate Detail (<strong>RE</strong>) screen with the loan amount. For instructions on how to assess and apply the deduction, see <a href="../older-australians/065-08020020-01.html">Security for the Home Equity Access Scheme</a>.</p>

<p>When an advance payment of a loan is issued through the Scheme, trigger processing is used to automatically make the following updates&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
add the advance payment to the customer’s loan balance</li>
		<li>
code the advance payment as investment type HEA on the Direct Investments (<strong>SVDI</strong>) screen. The investment is exempt from the asset test for a period of 90 days</li>
		<li>
removal of the asset test exemption from the Scheme investment on the SVDI screen after 90 days</li>

<p>Manual Follow Up (MFU) activities are created when trigger activities cannot be completed automatically.
