<P>When a loan is granted, the system automatically sets up a review to reassess the customer’s loan each fortnight. When the review runs:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the loan balance is updated with any loan payments issued during that fortnight, including regular loan payments, arrears, and one off payments manually paid via the Payment Adjustment (<STRONG>PYAJ</STRONG>) screen</LI>
<LI>interest is calculated on the updated loan balance and added to the balance</LI></UL>
<P>Any loan repayments made during the fortnight will have already been taken into account by the time the fortnightly review runs, as the loan balance adjusts immediately when repayments are coded.</P>
<P>The updated loan balance, including accrued interest, is recorded on the HEAS Details (<STRONG>PLS</STRONG>) screen.</P>
<P>The review runs one day after the Entitlement Period End Date (EPED) each fortnight. The Event Date for the update is the EPED of the fortnight that has just ended.</P>
<P>For example, if the entitlement period is 1 January 2020 – 14 January 2020, then:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the review for that fortnight runs on 15 January 2020 (the EPED+1 day), and</LI>
<LI>the new loan balance and interest calculation is updated on the <STRONG>PLS</STRONG> screen using 14 January 2020 (the EPED) as the Event Date</LI></UL>
<P>The review continues to run each fortnight until the loan balance is repaid in full.</P></DIV>

<DIV class=showcont>
<P>The MLA is calculated based on the value of a customer’s real assets and their age component. The age component for the Scheme is determined as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>if the customer is single, the age component is the customer’s age</LI>
<LI>if the customer is partnered, the age component is the age of the younger member of the couple</LI></UL>
<P>The system automatically recalculates the customer’s MLA each year when their age component increases. The age component increases on the customer’s birthday, or if they have a younger partner, on their partner’s birthday. The MLA recalculation occurs at the end of the entitlement period in which the applicable birthday falls and the updated MLA is displayed on the HEAS Details (<STRONG>PLS</STRONG>) screen in the <STRONG>Maximum Loan Amount</STRONG> field. The Event Date for the updated MLA is the Entitlement Period End Date (EPED) for that fortnight.</P>
<P>Upon completion of the review, a Home Equity Access Scheme itemised loan statement with the updated MLA is automatically sent to the customer, unless the customer is deceased. If the customer is deceased, the letter is held on the <STRONG>BLST</STRONG> screen and an email is automatically sent to the Home Equity Access Scheme National team to review whether the statement should be released.</P><A name=_Hlt116627432 class=anchor></A><A name=_Hlt116627431 class=anchor></A>
<P>For further details on the manual review and release of the Scheme letters see <A href="../older-australians/065-08020060-03.html#bp03_tbl_Manual_reviews_Step10">Step 10 in Table 2</A>.</P>
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> the system also automatically recalculates the MLA where the <STRONG>Loan Security value</STRONG>, <STRONG>Nominated Amount</STRONG> or <STRONG>Deductions</STRONG> are manually changed on the <STRONG>PLS</STRONG> screen. Staff can also manually trigger a re-calculation of the MLA by entering '<STRONG>Y</STRONG>' to the <STRONG>Recalc</STRONG> field on the <STRONG>PLS</STRONG> screen.</P></DIV>

<DIV class=showcont>
<P>If a customer’s loan balance falls within $5,000 of their MLA, the system automatically generates a letter to advise the customer that they are approaching the MLA. The letter can be viewed on the History Summary (<STRONG>HS</STRONG>) screen.</P>
<P>The letter provides the customer with the opportunity to consider their financial circumstances and make necessary arrangements for when the payments cease. Some customers may decide to change their current loan arrangement to extend the period of time they can continue to receive loan payments. For example, they may request to decrease their fortnightly loan amount, or if they have more equity in Australian real estate, they may choose to offer this as additional security for the loan and request the MLA be recalculated.</P>
<P>Requests to change a loan arrangement must be made in writing and signed by the customer and their partner (if they have one). It is recommended that customers seek independent financial or legal advice before requesting an increase to their MLA.</P></DIV>

<UL>
<LI>The <STRONG>Cease Loan Indicator</STRONG> on the HEAS Details (<STRONG>PLS</STRONG>) screen is set to ‘Y’ to prevent further loan payments from being issued</LI>
<LI>The <STRONG>Reject/Cease Reason</STRONG> field on the <STRONG>PLS</STRONG> screen is updated to display cessation reason <STRONG>MBL</STRONG> (MLA reached)</LI>
<LI>A letter is generated to advise the customer that payments have stopped. The letter can be viewed on the History Summary (<STRONG>HS</STRONG>) screen</LI></UL>
<P>The system continues to calculate interest on the balance of the loan each fortnight until the loan has been repaid in full.</P>
<P>The customer may contact to offer additional security for the loan and request the MLA be recalculated. </P>
<P>The preferred option is for customers to use their Centrelink online account. If they are unable to use the online self service, they can complete the Home Equity Access Scheme Variation (SA497 form. </P>
<P>See <A href="../older-australians/065-08000000-01.html">Escalating enquiries to CAO's</A> for more details.</P>

<LI>The Scheme payments cancelled when the qualifying payment cancelled</LI>
<LI>The customer has an outstanding loan balance</LI></UL>
<P>For example, the customer is Age Pension age and they receive the loans payments as well as Carer Payment (CAR) or Disability Support Pension (DSP). If the Scheme stops when the CAR or DSP stop, the MFU is created to determine if the customer may have ongoing eligibility for the Scheme via the Age Pension qualification rules.</P>

<P>The Complex Assessment Officer (CAO) is to determine whether the customer may be payable as a ‘loan only’ arrangement using Age Pension qualification.</P>
<P>If restoration of the Scheme payments is possible, contact with the customer is required to determine their desired outcome, noting it may be their preference to no longer receive loan payments. The customer may wish to test their eligibility for the Age Pension first, in which case they should lodge an Age Pension claim.

<P>An MFU generates if a customer’s qualifying payment is cancelled for a payability based reason. When the qualifying payment cancels for one of these reasons, the loan payments continue to be paid as a loan only arrangement. The qualifying payment, although cancelled, remains notionally ‘current’ in the system at a zero rate to facilitate the loans payments. This does not override the legislative decision that the customer is no longer eligible for a payable rate of the qualifying payment, therefore manual action is required to prevent any pension components from becoming payable.</P>
<P>The MFU has the following attributes:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Activity notes: <STRONG>I013PH – HEAS Qualifying Payment stopped (HEAS ongoing)</STRONG></LI>
<LI>Keywords: <STRONG>PLSMFU, PLSQPC</STRONG></LI></UL>
<P>The Complex Assessment Officer (CAO) is to set the <STRONG>HEAS Only Claim indicator</STRONG> on the HEAS Details (<STRONG>PLS</STRONG>) screen to Y. This will prevent the system from incorrectly auto-restoring the qualifying payment in response to coding updates on the customer’s records. For example, where the customer makes an update via their online account, or staff code an income or asset update.</P>
<P>Where the system has notionally ‘overridden’ a pension cancellation reason for the purposes of paying the loan only, the cancellation reason applicable to the qualifying payment can be viewed as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Go to the <STRONG>XPDETR</STRONG> screen</LI>
<LI>Type <STRONG>PHPS</STRONG> in the <STRONG>Group</STRONG> field and press [<STRONG>Enter]</STRONG></LI>
<LI>The pension cancellation details will be indicated by the following:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>The PHPS.PEN.STS.CODE will be CAN</LI>
<LI>The PHPS.PEN.RSN.CODE will display the cancellation reason code (i.e. one of the payability based reasons)</LI></UL></UL>
<P>If the qualifying payment has already been restored by the time the MFU is actioned, check whether the restoration action was correct. The qualifying pension must only be restored if qualification for payment has been re-established. Customers generally have to lodge a new application unless a decision has been made to reinstate the payment. For guidance see <A href="../ongoing-contact/102-10040000-01.html">Restoration of payments (CLK)</A>. If payment has been correctly restored there is no need to change the <STRONG>HEAS Only Claim indicator</STRONG>. Incorrect auto-restoration of the qualifying payment may require corrective action (for example, manual cancellation) and a debt raised for the pension components.</P></DIV>

<P>A HEASAV trigger is created when an advance payment is granted and the customer’s loan is secured against their principal home.</P>
<P>The trigger runs overnight and attempts to code the advance payment as investment type HEA (HEAS-ADVANCE) on the Direct Investments (<STRONG>SVDI</STRONG>) screen.</P>
<P>The update includes coding an asset text deduction amount, as advance payments of loans paid through the Scheme are exempt from the assets test for 90 days.</P>
