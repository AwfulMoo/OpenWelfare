<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Compensation_as">Compensation assessment</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Compensation is assessed as income for LIC purposes. It is treated differently for LIC than it is for all other Centrelink payments and products. The ordinary income test is used to assess all compensation payments using the gross compensation amount (settlement amount without reduction).</p>

<p><strong>Periodic compensation</strong> payments that are paid in the 8 week LIC income assessment period are included in the income test.</p>

<p><strong>Lump sum compensation</strong> payments are apportioned over a period of 12 months and affect a customer's LIC eligibility for 12 months starting on the date of settlement. Any part of the apportioned income that coincides with the LIC income assessment period is included in the income test. If a customer lodges a LIC claim within 56 days of the end date of the lump sum apportionment period, that part of the assessable lump sum payment/s that applies to relevant days within the LIC 8 week income assessment period will be included in the income test.</p>

<p>Smart Centre staff may complete simple updates. For example, a customer has weekly compensation payments already recorded and is advising a new amount together with a letter that verifies the amount and date of change. For more details, see <a href="../compensation/117-01020010-01.html">Role of staff outside Compensation Teams</a>.</p>

<p>LIC renewals and reassessments, new instances, unsubstantiated or complex changes to these types of income should be referred to the <a href="../compensation/117-01000000-01.html">Compensation Recovery Team (CRT)</a>.</p>

<p>Normal procedures apply where compensation amounts need to be assessed for LIC purposes.</p>

If the customer and/or partner are receiving an income support payment and have income from self-employment or a business</li>
		<li>
If business/self-employment income has recently been assessed, do not request documents again but accept the assessment already done</li>
		<li>
If the customer has provided an estimate of income for income support payments, this estimate should also be accepted for the LIC claim and previous year financial documents should not be requested</li>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> this does not include private trusts and private companies that are recorded by the Complex Assessment Officers (CAO). Do not ask for relevant documents from customers with trust and company income, as these entities are reviewed annually, if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
it is an ongoing entity that has already been assessed, and</li>

the customer advises that no changes have occurred</li>

<p>When a customer repays a debt to Services Australia and pays too much, the agency reissues the over recovered payment for the period of the debt.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>If there is a change of circumstances for a <strong>current LIC cardholder</strong> who is not yet due for renewal, the customer's gross income must not equal or exceed 125% of the qualifying limit on an 8 week basis to retain the card.</p>

<p>Customers need to notify the agency when their total gross income reaches or exceeds 125% of the relevant income threshold in any 8 week period. If the customer's total gross income over any 8 week period is equal to, or greater than the 125% income limit, then&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
eligibility is reassessed, and</li>
		<li>
entitlement to the LIC is cancelled</li>
		</ul>
<p>This higher income limit is to help customers employed on a contractual, seasonal or casual basis.</p>

<p>From 1 July 2021, the Single Touch Payroll process will apply to all current LIC records. If the customer or partner are identified in the STP process, they will need to confirm the employer. The STP process will then monitor the Paid Employment income and automatically cancel their card entitlement if the income exceeds the relevant LIC income threshold.</p>

<p>If not included in the STP process, the customer will need to advise when starting work that their income will go over the limit, and they wish to surrender the LIC immediately.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the customer may wish to wait until their income reaches 125% of the qualifying limit.</p>

<p>In these cases, if an income support payment is not being paid, the customer's new income should be recorded as ongoing income from the start date of their employment. If they have a partner, an estimate of the partner's average income should be recorded as income from the beginning of the 8 week period.</p>

<p>In these circumstances, income does not need to be verified. The outcome will then be that once 125% of the qualifying limit has been reached&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the LIC will cancel, and</li>
		<li>
an appropriate letter will be sent</li>
		</ul>
<p>While there is some flexibility in using an estimate for part of the assessed income, staff should request that employment earnings details be supplied by the customer.</p>
