<p>This document outlines the process of reconciling estimated business income with actual business income after the end of a financial year. Customers must provide copies of their income tax return(s) and financial statements so actual business income can be assessed to calculate their correct FHA entitlement. </p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Business_income">Business income reconciliation</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Unlike income from employment, business income for farm and non-farm businesses can be hard to predict due to factors such as commodity prices, business expenses and seasonal conditions. To account for these factors, estimate(s) of business income are used to determine the rate of FHA paid during the financial year. At the end of the financial year, customers provide their tax returns and other financial statements.</p>

<p>Business income reconciliation is a process that enables a comparison of the estimated and actual income to accurately determine the customer’s entitlement for the year being reconciled.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Each financial year, customers are required to give a reasonable estimate of their business income. This is initially set up when claiming FHA and is revised every year.</p>

<p>The business income estimates should only include income and expenses derived through the activities of the business. Income from non-farm businesses is recorded separately on the customer's record.</p>

<p>Customers are obliged to advise any changes in their circumstances during the financial year. They can provide a revised estimate for a farm or non-farm business at any time to reduce the risk of overpayment.</p>

<p>When a customer contacts the agency, prompt them to check that their current business income estimate for all farm and non-farm businesses is still accurate.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Actual_farm_ent">Actual business income</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Actual business income is verified income provided by the customer after they have lodged their tax return. Items listed on the tax return are separated into farm and non-farm items to apportion the correct amount of income and expenses to each source of income to determine the amount of the business income.</p>

<p>Consistent with social security law, expenses incurred by a business are deducted to calculate a person's ordinary income. For FHA, if a person operates a non-farm business as well as the farm enterprise, the net income from both businesses is used to calculate actual business income.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> non-controllers of a trust and/or company cannot estimate the entities business income. They will be assessed on distribution income, see <a target="_blank" href="../business-and-employers/043-04050030-01.html">Assessing and recording distribution income</a>. Distribution income is assessed as ordinary income and must be updated before BIR being completed. If a non-controller does not have a separate farm business outside the trust or company, they will have no actual income to be assessed. BIR will be completed using nil farm and off farm business income. </p>

<p><strong>Small Business Entity (SBE) depreciation</strong></p>

<p>For consistency between estimated business income and actual business income, policy advice has been received to ensure in circumstances where SBE depreciation was allowed when the customer lodged their business income estimate that the BIR assessment also treat SBE the same way. The majority of customers would have estimated their business income with SBE as an allowable deduction before the change.</p>

<p><strong>Sole traders and partnerships&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
SBE depreciation will be an allowable deduction for all BIR years (2014-15 through 2019-20) for sole traders and partnership as these rules were clarified in July 2019</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Trust and Companies&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
for 2014-15 through 2016-17 financial years&#58; SBE depreciation will be an allowable deduction for Trust and Companies as these rules were clarified in March 2017</li>
		<li>
for 2017-18 through 2019-20 financial years&#58; where the estimate was received before 16 March 2017 or later, but not assessed by a Complex Assessor Officer (CAO), SBE will be an allowable deduction for Trust and Companies for the entire BIR year being assessed</li>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Offfarm_income">Off-farm income offset</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The <a href="../rural-and-remote-australians/002-20102102-01.html">off-farm income offset</a> recognises farmers experiencing financial hardship. Farmers are often forced to rely on off-farm income to support the farm enterprise rather than using that income for their own support. The offset can be applied if specific conditions are met.</p>

<p>The amount of the allowable deduction for the off-farm income offset is determined by the value of the farm business loss. This is initially determined by the estimated amount of the farm business income loss and is revised when the actual farm business income is known following the income tax assessment. This ensures the correct entitlement is paid. If the actual income shows the farm business made a profit, the customer's eligibility for the off-farm income offset and FHA must be reassessed.</p>

<p>When the actual farm business income is known, the amount of the deduction allowed for the financial year may change.</p>

<p>If the actual loss is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
greater than the estimated allowable deduction, an arrears payment may be generated</li>
		<li>
less than the estimated allowable deduction, the customer may have been overpaid and a debt shell may be created</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the actual farm income is a profit&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
eligibility for the off-farm income offset is reassessed and the customer will not qualify for the off-farm income offset</li>
		<li>
the new determination will be applied retrospectively, meaning the customer may have been overpaid and a debt shell may be created</li>
		</ul>
<p>For the<strong> 2014 -15 financial year</strong>, debts resulting from this process may be waived under the Farm Household Support (Waiver of Debts) Minister's Rule 2016. </p>

<p>For the <strong>2015-16 to 2019-20 financial years</strong>, any debts created from this process&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
before 24 July 2021</li>
			<ul>			<li>
zero rate Business Income Reconciliation (BIR) debts can be offset by customers using available clock days. Customers with full rate BIR debts had these days added back to their available clock days when the debt was raised </li>
			<li>
partial rate BIR debts may be waived. No trade of clock days is required as no days were re-credited when the debt was raised</li>		</ul>
		<li>
from 24 July 2021 BIR debts may be waived under the Farm Household Support Amendment (Debt waiver) Act 2021. <strong>Note</strong>&#58; this process commenced in 2022</li>

<p>In June each year, customers were requested to provide their income tax returns and other financial statements for the previous financial year. This enables Services Australia to commence business income reconciliation. If the customer is unable to supply their documents by the due date, an extension may be granted if evidence from the ATO shows an extension to lodge has been provided.</p>

<p>If granted an extension by the ATO, the customer should contact before the due date and provide a copy of the ATO extension letter.</p>

<p>If operating a business as a sole trader, customers must lodge a tax return even if their income is below the tax-free threshold. This includes&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a tax return for individuals including the supplementary section</li>
		<li>
business and professional items schedule for individuals</li>
		</ul>
<p>All FHA customers paid as farmers are required to lodge a tax return. This is because businesses are not exempt from lodging an income tax return. Sole trader and partnership businesses must lodge a tax return even if the income is below the tax-free threshold.</p>

<p>Only FHA customers, who are paid as the partner of a farmer <strong>and</strong> not involved in a business, may not be required to lodge a tax return.</p>

<p>For example, if the Entitlement Period End Day (EPED) finishes on 26 June and the final payment was on 27 June, reconciliation will cover up until 30 June, based on the calculated entitlement.</p>

<p>Reconciliation covers the 2014/2015, 2015/2016, 2016/2017, 2017/2018, 2018/2019 and 2019/2020 financial years. </p>

This is because they had the benefit of clock days being re-credited when the original BIR debt was raised. FHA recipients with days to trade, will have the choice of whether to accept the waiver. Some recipients may wish to continue to receive FHA, rather than reduce their debt by trading days.</li>

Customers with a post-commencement RCN debt will have their debt automatically waived in full without the need to trade any clock days regardless of whether they received a partial rate or NIL rate during the financial year/s being assessed for BIR. This process will be automatic, the new BIR system functionality will apply the debt waiver and will not re-credit clock days where the customer had zero or partial entitlement for the year being reconciled</li>

		<div class="block">

<p>The designated and controlled private trusts and private companies in which customers have a financial interest each have their own separate organisation record. </p>

<p>Reviews prompt the CAO to ensure that the organisation's details are correct. For example, income, assets, and the customers who are linked to the organisation.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Before 1 July 2020. </strong>CAOs should <strong>not</strong> update the entity income for FHA customers on the Trust and Companies record for the 2014 to 2020 financial years when undertaking an update in the BIR process. The CAO must <strong>Note</strong>/<strong>DOC</strong> the income details on the customers file for when BIR is undertaken. Lodgement of tax returns or the annual review is not an automatic request for BIR to be completed. In some instances, the Trust and Companies record may have been updated due to the partner being on an Income Support Payment at the time, or as result of a request reassessment </li>
		<li>
<strong>From 1 July 2020</strong>. FHA customers will have current estimated income recorded for both farm and off-farm income. CAOs should not update the income from the latest tax return where an estimate is in place. If the entities controllers are on a combination of FHA and also other ISP, CAOs should seek policy advice on income coding </li>
		</ul>
<p>Once the CAO completes the review, the entity record is updated and a <strong>Note</strong>/<strong>DOC</strong> will be placed on the customer record. As the review is likely to take place outside of the reconciliation process, staff should not update business income until after the customer's reconciliation comes due.</p>

<p>If the business income advised by the CAO report is significantly different to the customer's current estimate, it may be appropriate to contact the customer and request a revised estimate.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> under no circumstances should business income related debts be raised outside the reconciliation process.</p>
