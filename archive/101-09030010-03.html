<p>Obtain relevant information such as current Australian Business Number (ABN/ACN) details.</p>

<p>Make sure that&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The entity name matches what is on the ABN Lookup and what is recorded in Customer First. Check ASIC as well, for entity details including an ACN, if relevant</li>
		<li>
The ABN/ACN is current/registered and has not been cancelled</li>
		<li>
The entity is not unincorporated. If the entity is unincorporated or an unincorporated association, the legal entity needs to be established. See <a href="../payment-delivery/103-19031344-01.html">Legal Entities information</a></li>
		<li>
If the entity is a trust, get the trustee details. Record the ABN of the trust and the Australian Company Number (ACN) if applicable of the trustee in Customer First</li>
		<li>
If the entity is a partnership, establish who the partners are, and ensure all partners are recorded on a DOA <strong>DOC</strong></li>
		<li>
Check previous compliance history. Check <strong>DOC</strong>s and the <strong>M3RV </strong>screen for previous reviews</li>
		<li>
Check the record for a General Activity (GND) and note any issues found. <strong>DOC</strong> this has been checked</li>
		<li>
Check licences if the TPO is required to have one. <strong>DOC</strong> this has been checked</li>
		<li>
Check if the business has additional conditions. This will need to be discussed/checked during the review</li>
		<li>
Check that the business is registered for Business Online Services (not relevant for BasicsCard). DaC usage report will show the Log-On Id of users and usage. Check passwords/log-on ID are not shared</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>If the entity is not correct or the ABN has been cancelled&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Issue a correction of registration letter or an intent to withdraw approval letter. Give 10 business days for the business to provide a new Business Application if required. TPP can use their discretion for which letter is better suited based on the scenario. For scenarios, see <a target="_blank" href="../payment-delivery/103-09010020-05.html">Withdrawing a business's approval to use a deduction and confirmation service</a></li>
		<li>
Place the review on hold until a response, or until it is confirmed by the business or Program Assurance team that a termination/withdrawal of approval letter should be issued</li>
		<li>
If the ABN has been cancelled, first find out why. This could be an error on the website, or the ABN might be cancelled on ABN Lookup but ‘registered’ on the ASIC website. Check both sites. If the business has ceased trading, issue a termination/withdrawal of approval letter</li>
		<li>
For BasicsCard, remember to email the national business gateway team to deactivate the terminals and have the business removed from the organisation finder. Refer to the question sets spreadsheet for the email address</li>
		<li>
For withdrawal of approval, see <a target="_blank" href="../payment-delivery/103-09010020-03.html">Withdrawing a business's approval to use a deduction and confirmation service</a></li>
		<li>
If the entity has changed but retaining the same CRN, see <a target="_blank" href="../additional-products-and-services/101-09010040-03.html">Registration for Income Management deductions, EVoR or CCeS</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>If the TPO has multiple programs, send a new Business Application for <strong>all</strong> programs.</p>

<p>Conduct a check using the business ABN to see if the entity has other businesses. If they do, review all businesses at the same time to reduce multiple contacts with the TPO.</p>

<p>If the business has been sold and the new entity does not want to lodge a new Business Application&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
complete the review at the baseline questions, and</li>
		<li>
issue a termination/withdrawal of approval letter to the previous owner (as legally required)</li>
		<li>
for<strong> Centrepay</strong>, proceed with the review, do not complete at baseline. See <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-09030010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Completing_a_re_Step05">Step 5 in Table 2</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>Check the Authorised Officer is coded on the Org Service Contact Details (<strong>OSCS</strong>) screen. Their name, then ‘Authorised Officer’ in brackets should follow. Every other contact should have their name and position title. For example, Name (Finance Officer).</p>

<p>For businesses with a board of trustees (Salvation Army), the Trustee is the Authorised Officer. The trustee may not be the appropriate person to conduct the review with. The Authorised Officer can nominate other Authorised Officers. Code the <strong>Authorised Officer</strong> as the person with written authority to act on behalf of the business for assurance review purposes. <strong>DOC</strong> who the review was conducted with and that they are the appropriate person to conduct the review with. The Authorised Officer can nominate a relevant staff member to conduct the review.</p>

<p>For more, see <a href="../payment-delivery/103-19031344-01.html">Legal Entities Information</a>.</p>

<p>For more information on Authorised Officers and Contact Officer roles, refer to the SharePoint page for the DaC Branch under Learning Resources.</p>

<p>Do a Google search to make sure the business has not been investigated by a regulatory body or has had any adverse media. Search by the business name and the trading name. If any adverse information is found, this will require referral to the Program Assurance team.</p>

<p>Check details of any previous complaints on the Document List (<strong>DL</strong>) screen and information relevant to the TPO's contracted programs listed below&#58;</p>

<p>The DaC Usage report is required to show the log-on Id details of users. A spreadsheet with the CRN of the business should be sent to the Program Integrity and Reporting team (PIR) by close of business every Wednesday by one staff member from the Third Party Programmes Team.</p>

<p>This means planning ahead and obtaining all the necessary information before booking a review with a business.</p>

<p>Refer to the task card on the shared drive for how to obtain a DaC usage report.</p>

<p>PDF the DaC Usage Report and upload it to the business record. This is a QA requirement </p>

<p>Ensure that only the details of the business under review appear in the usage report to be uploaded. <strong>Tip</strong>&#58; filter the data, highlight the table &gt; Home tab &gt; Format &gt; Auto Fit column width. Then PDF the whole excel spreadsheet.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The usage report can be used to check consent for EVoR (if there is CCeS access)</li>
		<li>
Request a recent consent record from the business, even if there is no usage by the business in the past 12 months. The focus of these checks for assurance reviews is to confirm that the business&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
has an effective method for collecting and storing consent, and</li>
			<li>
is using the appropriate consent wording</li>		</ul>
		<li>
If there is a complaint or tip off, or data identifies a potential issue of non-compliance, check 25 consent forms as standard or what the usage report returns. If the usage report returns usage fewer than 25, <strong>DOC</strong> this for quality assurance. For low usage, see <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-09030010-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Actioning_the_r">Table 2</a></li>
		<li>
If the consent forms have been provided due to a complaint or tip-off,  and were all signed before the March 2015 transition, make sure the current version of the consent meets requirements</li>
		</ul>
<p>The usage report can also be used for Centrepay to identify User Logon IDs.</p>

<p>The <strong>time stamp</strong> in the usage report is Australian Eastern Standard Time <strong>(</strong>AEST). For states not in this time zone, subtract the time relevant to the state/time zone.</p>

<p><strong>Delete</strong> the <strong>transaction</strong> tab of the spreadsheet before forwarding the usage report to the business.</p>

<p><strong>Old consent</strong></p>

<p>This will only apply when 25 consent forms have been requested due to a complaint or tip-off.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The transition from a contract to an administrative scheme for CCeS occurred in March 2015. The business did not need to obtain new consent for existing customers. However, for their new customers they had to use the new wording by 30 June 2015 if their consent words were not substantially the same as per the Procedural Guide</li>
		<li>
For any old consents obtained with previously approved wording by the agency, but not substantially the same as per the current Procedural Guide, do not apply a breach. This is because the business was using the approved version at the time. Check the current consent is substantially the same as per the Procedural Guide</li>
		</ul>
<p>Check how the business collects consent. This could be verbal, written or electronic/online. If the business gets consent using all 3 channels, check all 3 to make sure wording is in an approved format.</p>

<p><strong>Multiple Consent&#58;</strong> if the business has cross programs, make sure the multiple consent form is current and meets requirements for CCeS and EVoR. For Centrepay, check 10 customers as standard.</p>

<p>Upload a copy of the recent consent to the business record.</p>

<p>For the minimum requirements for verbal and online consent, see the <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-09030010-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Attachments_and">Resources</a> page for the CCeS script attachment.</p>

<p>The requirements for written consent are as per the CCeS and EVoR Procedural Guides.</p>

<p>The Legal Services Division has confirmed the usage report constitutes a lawful disclosure of personal information. Providing the usage report details to a TPO is a necessary part of the Service Australia business process. This is to check that TPO access to a customer record has been authorised under social security law, e.g. the customer has signed a valid consent.</p>

<p>This means the CRN, address or date of birth of the customer can be disclosed if it helps the TPO in locating the consent.</p>

<p>This information should only be released on a case-by-case basis. It depends on what the TPO needs to locate information and assure the agency they have obtained consent.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the TPO is a financial business&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Check the Australian Financial Services (AFS) licence through the ASIC website using the 'professional registers' online search tool. See the <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-09030010-05.html#bp05_L2GT_External_websit">Resources</a> page for a link</li>
			<li>
Enter the name of the business or licence number and select <strong>Financial Services Licensee</strong> as the register</li>
			<li>
Make sure the licence is still current and <strong>DOC</strong> this has been checked</li>
			<li>
If the business is an AFS authorised representative of a licensee, select the <strong>Australian Financial Services Authorised Representative</strong> option, which will also verify if the licensee is current</li>		</ul>
		<li>
If there has been a change in ABN and the TPO is keeping the same CRN, follow up with the TPO that they have changed their content forms to reflect the new entity</li>
		<li>
Only record one ABN (the current one) on the <strong>NU</strong> screen. Delete all previous ABNs. <strong>DOC</strong> the previous ABN/s and the date changed</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> CCeS businesses with System Integration and/or Batch Lodgement no longer have a separate process. Use the CCeS assurance workflow to conduct the review.</p>

<p>If there has been a change to the entity and the business is keeping the same CRN or the business no longer wants a service reason, remove the service reason from the Org Service Agreement Summary (<strong>OSAS</strong>) screen and from the contract workflow. Issue a Q848 to the business, if the TPO also has IM use the Q771.</p>

<p>For more information on keeping a CRN, see <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-09010040-01.html">Registration for Income Management deductions, EVoR or CCeS</a>. </p>

<p>Also use this procedure to assess what is needed or should be deselected in RAMB. Make sure that the <strong>Organisation Summary</strong> screen matches the details in RAMB. Selecting the <strong>View Summary</strong> link from the contract/agreement summary will display the <strong>Service Reason</strong>, <strong>Type of Service</strong> and <strong>Delivery Method</strong>.

<p>The only IM reviews which should be conducted are for those TPOs in the Northern Territory (NT).</p>

<p>If the TPO has the School Meals Programme (SMP), refer to the Special Condition that should be uploaded to the TPO record upon approval.</p>

<p>SMP providers do not need to maintain a Declared Customer Account (if SMP is their only service reason). The TPO has to show that the IM funds have been spent on food/food preparation, and notify the agency at the end of the school year of any unspent funds.</p>

<p>There are no 'overpayments' for SMP, but there will be unspent funds. At the end of the school year if the school advises it will be using the funds to buy a fridge or equipment for food preparation, the agency may allow the use of the funds this way.</p>

<p>Read the Workflow Question Sets spreadsheet for questions not to ask when undertaking a review for providers with SMP only.</p>

<p>If an IM contract results in withdrawal of approval (termination), remind the businesses to use the notice period (30 days) to get their accounts in order as Business Online Services access will be removed upon the termination date. </p>

<p><strong>Outsourcing Arrangements</strong></p>

<p>If the approval letter does not specify the outsourcing arrangement, and if there is doubt previous approval letters mention them as they cannot be obtained, re-issue the Q821 and include the following text&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
‘It should be noted as part of your approval, that Third party outsourcing arrangements in place, do not relieve your business of its liabilities or obligations under the Business Terms and Conditions and Schedule 4/5. Your Business is responsible for any third party, and any default in its performance.’</li>

<p>Request the BasicsCard Report (BCDR) using the DAC usage report process. Take into account timeframes for the return of data when planning review activities.</p>

<p>BCD transactions will be provided for the last 3 months.</p>

<p>Check itemised receipts for merchants who sell excluded goods. Go to the <strong>OSAS</strong> screen, select the BC2 agreement and confirm the details on the <strong>Excluded Goods and Services</strong> tab.</p>

<p>Check 25 receipts as standard. For Merchants that do not sell excluded goods, check the BCDR for any discrepancies or patterns in the data.</p>

<p>There is a spreadsheet to help analyse BCD data. This is on the shared drive. Data for a single business only can be entered into the spreadsheet one at a time. For low usage, see <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-09030010-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Actioning_the_r">Table 2</a>.</p>

<p>The spreadsheet explains how to use the BCD data tool. To analyse the data, copy and paste it from the BCDR into the BCD data tool on the second tab. On the first tab, refresh the data to display a summary of the transactions. PDF a screen shot of this summary and upload it to the TPO record.</p>

<p><strong>For merchants selling excluded goods</strong>, the data check will inform which transactions to request receipts for, and highlight potential non-compliance under the review themes.</p>

<p><strong>For merchants not selling excluded goods,</strong> the data check will highlight any potential issues that may need extra review themes conducted.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Look for transaction patterns that indicate any of the following&#58;</li>
		<li>
purchase of excluded goods; alcohol, cigarettes, pornography or gambling products</li>
		<li>
access to cash</li>
		<li>
purchase of gift cards that allow access to excluded goods</li>
		<li>
repeated purchase of large items for cash resale</li>
		<li>
purchase of items, namely fuel, on behalf of third parties in exchange for cash</li>
		<li>
book up, or the merchant retaining the BasicsCard</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Broad indicators</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
an average transaction value much higher than the average for the main business activity</li>

<p><strong>More defined indicators</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
repeated transaction amounts, especially round dollar amounts</li>
		<li>
excessive customer expenditure</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Check&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
the main business activity and that the value of transactions are appropriate in association with the main business activity </li>
		<li>
the average transaction value broadly aligns with the average transaction value of the main business activity</li>
		<li>
any repeated transaction amounts that have round dollar amounts or are similar to the cost of excluded good</li>
		<li>
customers who spend substantially more than other customers at one store </li>
		</ul>
<p>Customer over-usage or repeated transactions are not firm evidence of non-compliance.</p>

<p>Questions could include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
What are the transaction amounts and times of the overusing customer?</li>
		<li>
Are the repeated transaction amounts broadly spread over different customers, or is a small group of customers responsible for them?</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the TPO is a Taxi Merchant or mini bus, check the taxi licence is still current. Request the TPO provide evidence the taxi licence is still current. Upload the evidence to the TPO record. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> this is not the individual's drivers licence.</p>

<p><strong>Do not</strong> <strong>continue</strong> with the review (a new Business Application is required) if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
there has been a change in ABN, or</li>
		<li>
the agency has not contracted with the correct legal entity, e.g. a Trust/Unincorporated association without an individual undertaking</li>

<p>To check large volumes of registered users for CBOS, request a DAC usage report.</p>

<p>The usage report for Centrepay will show the log-on user ID of staff with access to business online services. Check with the business that details are still current. The report will also show a list of Centrepay Deductions</p>

<p>Check the customers the business maintains. Key '<strong>LS</strong>' in <strong>NEXT</strong> and press [<strong>Enter</strong>]. Not all customers will be current.</p>

<p>Some businesses may have multiple approved Service Reasons and Business Products, on the <strong>CONTRACT AGREEMENT SUMMARY</strong> page. Select the correct current customers for the correct service reason for the Centrepay review.</p>

<p>Select 10 customers as standard; all cases, where the business has started the deduction. If there are not 10 cases the business has started, the rest can be cases the customer has started. Select deductions within the last 12 months.</p>

<p>Navigate to each customer record one at a time in Customer First. Go to the <strong>PIHS </strong>screen to check deduction amounts and the dates coded.</p>

<p>Check the <strong>PIHS</strong> screen against the business record to determine the changes made for each deduction&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
From the <strong>LS</strong> screen on the business record, copy the customer’s CRN and paste in the <strong>CRN</strong> field in Customer First</li>
		<li>
In the customer’s record, go to the <strong>PIHS</strong> screen. Find the correct service reason and the correct <strong>TPO CRN</strong></li>
		<li>
Always select the earliest deduction listed on the <strong>PIHS </strong>screen. '<strong>S</strong>'elect the entry</li>
		<li>
Scroll through the previous pages, taking note of the change reasons</li>
		<li>
Check the <strong>ES</strong> screen to see if the business or customer made the change to the deduction. To find the user that completed the update&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
copy the AMR number from the <strong>PIHS</strong> screen</li>
			<li>
go to the <strong>ES</strong> screen, paste the AMR number in the <strong>ACT ID</strong> field and hit [<strong>Enter</strong>]</li>
			<li>
under the <strong>Activity User ID</strong> section of the <strong>ES </strong>screen, check if a <strong>User ID</strong> appears. This means the change was made by the business</li>
			<li>
anything with an <strong>E</strong> means the business started the deduction<br><strong>ENI </strong>(External New Instruction)<br><strong>EXV</strong> (Replaced by External Request)<br><strong>INI</strong> (Internal New Instruction)</li>
			<li>
check against RAMB if unsure</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Once confirmed that the business has coded the deduction, include this customer as 1 of 10 to check</li>
		<li>
Repeat the process until there are 10 customers for review</li>
		</ul>
<p>If unable to find the AMR activity on the <strong>ES</strong> screen, <a target="_blank" href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-02010040-03.html">use the Archiving Culling Engine (ACE) to search for the activity</a>.</p>

<p>Each deduction found to be coded by the business will need a matching customer's deduction authority. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> the business may also have multiple consent forms to be considered.</p>

<p>When conducting an assurance review, focus on those with a change reason code of <strong>ENI/EXV</strong> and <strong>INI</strong>. There are other change reason codes that may show a deduction started by the business. See the <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-09030010-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Attachments_and">Resources</a> page for a spreadsheet.</p>

<p>The <strong>Data Asset</strong> can help to identify customers for review. This is a useful tool, especially when there has been a complaint about a business, or if the business has been picked up in a trigger report.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The data team in Program Integrity and Reporting team (PIR) updates the Data Asset on a regular basis. They will provide the new link via email</li>
		<li>
To access the Data Asset, staff need to install the Harman Browser and email the data team in PIR with their Log-on ID. There is nothing to upload from the Data Asset to the business record. Note which customers were selected and why. Selecting customers from the Data Asset is the same as looking them up via the <strong>PIHS </strong>screen</li>
		</ul>
<p>Check the change reasons that fall under the <strong>Termination</strong> category, and those showing a pattern of the customer stopping the deduction and the business restarting it. This can be a sign the business has restarted deductions without the customer's consent. See the <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-09030010-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Attachments_and">Resources</a> page for a change reasons spreadsheet.</p>

<p>Request the Deduction Authority Forms for customers whose deductions have been set up by the business, and the deduction statements showing the amount of Centrepay Deductions received by the business.</p>

<p><strong>Deduction Authority</strong></p>

<p>Always check how the business collects Deduction Authorities. </p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Verbal consent</strong> - refer to the minimum standards for verbal consent in the Procedural Guide&#58; can the business provide evidence a Deduction Authority was obtained and retain the audio or online/system generated record? </li>
		<li>
<strong>Written consent</strong> - refer to the minimum standards for written consent in the Procedural Guide&#58; see the 'Sample Centrepay Deduction Authority'</li>
		<li>
<strong>Electronic/Online consent</strong> - ask the business for screen shots of the process/ wording. Does it meet the minimum content as per Procedural Guide?</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the business uses more than 1 channel to collect consent, check all channels to make sure wording meets the minimum requirements.</p>

<p>Check if the business is eligible to use multiple consent. If the business is using a Multiple Consent Form, check they are using it correctly.</p>

<p>Give the business the current version of this form if required.</p>

<p>Check each customer's deduction using the <strong>DDS</strong> screen against the itemised statement of Centrepay purchases and payments. This is to determine if the business&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
is passing on the fee</li>
		<li>
accruing any overpayments, and</li>
		<li>
deductions are credited correctly to the customer's account for the correct service reason</li>
		</ul>
<p>To check&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
go to the <strong>DDS</strong> screen on the business record</li>
		<li>
select deduction type <strong>C</strong> (customer) and delivery method <strong>DC</strong> (direct credit)</li>
		<li>
add the relevant delivery dates in the date range and the customer CRN to conduct the search</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Deduction Authorities must be updated to reflect the new name change (Services Australia). Timeframe for when this is required is to be arranged. Procedural Guide will be updated to reflect these changes.</p>

<p><strong>Australian Credit Licence (ACL)</strong></p>

<p>All businesses engaging in ‘credit activities’ must hold a credit licence. This would affect rental companies that provide credit under a credit contract or consumer lease. For example, they offer to rent items such as whitegoods, furniture and household items.</p>

<p>If the business is required to have an ACL, check these details using the ASIC website. See the <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-09030010-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Attachments_and">Resources</a> page for how to check ACL and CR Numbers.</p>

<p>Obtain a copy of the rental agreement for white-good providers.</p>

<p>Refer to the instructions tab of the Workflow Questions Sets spreadsheet for the extra questions when reviewing a consumer lease provider.</p>

<p><strong>Australian Financial Services (AFS)</strong></p>

<p>If the business is a Financial business they will need an AFS licence, unless they are an AFS representative. This means they are authorised to provide those services as a representative of another person who holds an AFS licence. Check ASIC’s professional register for AFS Licence or AFS representative details. </p>

<p>For other Service Reasons, check the Centrepay Service Reasons Spreadsheet which contains state specific requirements. See the <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-09030010-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Attachments_and">Resources</a> page for a link.</p>

<p>A full review is required for Centrepay even if there are fewer than 10 deductions.</p>

<p><strong>Escalate </strong>any adverse information found relating to ASIC and other regulatory bodies to the Centrepay Services team.</p>

<p>Change in ownership/ABN may also result in withdrawal of approval if a new Business Application is not lodged.</p>

<p>For more on questions for Centrepay, see the Instructions tab of the Question Sets spreadsheet.</p>

<p>For any breaches that are not in the Centrepay workflow, refer to the Program Assurance team using the referral template on the shared drive. Advise the breaches that are/are not in the workflow. The team will advise how to record breaches that are not in the workflow.</p>

<p>If there is no response to the request to contact letter, issue a remedy notice for not responding to the request for a review. Place the Baseline review on hold until they respond.</p>

<p>If there is no response to the remedy notice requesting contact, for all programs issue a potential of revocation letter. Refer to the Program Assurance Team for a letter using the referral template on the shared drive. </p>

<p>For Centrepay there is the option to issue an intent to suspend letter. If there has been no response to the potential of revocation letter or the intent to suspend letter, the business may have a full or partial suspension imposed or need their approval withdrawn. Refer to the Program Assurance team using the referral template on the shared drive. Include documentation outlining attempts at contact and all other relevant information to support withdrawal of approval.</p>

<p>An intent to suspend letter or suspension letter can be issued before a potential of revocation letter. This depends on the seriousness of the breach.</p>

<p>If withdrawal of approval is to occur, be sure to select the relevant theme for each program. They need to reflect the outcome that the business has failed to participate in a review.</p>

Is the issue only applicable to 1 customer and not many?</li>

<p>Wording for Remedy Notices for all programs are on the shared drive.</p>

<p>Different programs need individual Remedy Notices. Do not include multiple programs in the one Remedy Notice. This is based on legal advice due to different clauses in the relevant policy or terms.</p>

<p>If wording for the Remedy Notice is not available, send a request to the Program Assurance team mailbox. Use the referral template on the shared drive.</p>

<p>The remedy period should be in business days (excluding Saturday and Sunday) unless advised otherwise. For help counting business days, see the <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-09030010-05.html#bp05_L2GT_External_websit">Resources</a> page.</p>

<p>Re-review the TPO at the end of the remedy period. For Centrepay, the re-review will be the General activity (GNC).</p>

<p>If considering termination/withdrawal of approval due to non-compliance, send all relevant information to the relevant teams. These include DaC Branch, Centrepay Services, Welfare Quarantining Programme Management and the Program Assurance team.</p>

<p>Complete the Re-review (GNC for Centrepay) in the workflow and <strong>DOC</strong> the outcome.</p>

<p>For <strong>Centrepay</strong>, the baseline question must always have an outcome of <strong>proceed with review</strong> for data purposes. A full review is always required, even if there is low usage.</p>

<p>If a business wants to withdraw voluntarily, there is an option to select this outcome at the baseline questions.</p>

<p>The Organisation Assurance/Compliance reviews workflow allows the reviewer to exclude a breach from the review result. The workflow question sets/breach application table describes where to apply tolerances to breaches.</p>

<p>An example for BasicsCard would be that the business failed to display posters in accordance with the agency's instruction.</p>

<p>Instead of sending a remedy notice for this breach, discuss with the business their obligations under the BasicsCard Merchant Terms and remind them to display posters/stickers accordingly.</p>

<p>Consult the Program Assurance team to exclude a breach not outlined in the workflow questions sets or other documentation provided. Use the referral template on the shared drive.</p>

<p><strong>I</strong>f a TPO has&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
only 1 breach and that breach is excluded, that means the outcome of the review is <strong>COMPLIANT</strong></li>
		<li>
multiple breaches and only 1 is being excluded but the rest still apply, this outcome is <strong>NON-COMPLIANT</strong> (exclude breach on the completion tab of the workflow)</li>
		</ul>
<p>For Centrepay, Compliant = <strong>Assurance Met</strong>. If the business is non-compliant, select <strong>Assurance not Met - referral to AMT</strong>.</p>

<p>This outcome will trigger a GNC which will be the re-review. Place the GNC on hold. Set a reminder to follow up when this is due.</p>

<p>The TPO Program Assurance workflow also allows for systemic/ non-systemic breaches to be recorded against certain common breaches for all programs except Centrepay.</p>

<p>Systemic breaches&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
are ongoing issues</li>
		<li>
are repeated breach/breaches from past reviews, and/or</li>
		<li>
have previously occurred more than twice</li>
		</ul>
<p>Non-systemic breaches&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
are not ongoing, and</li>
		<li>
have not occurred in the past, or</li>
		<li>
are where there are less than 2 instances of the same breach</li>
		</ul>
<p>Locate this information from previous reviews.</p>

<p>If the TPO is non-compliant and has a breach or multiple breaches, send a remedy notice to the TPO and a response in writing from the TPO will be required. The remedy notice must include the correct clause references and appropriate remedy actions.</p>

<p>Decide the review result within 14 days of the review and advise the TPO.</p>

<p>If there is a significant delay in making a decision (e.g. waiting on legal advice), contact the TPO and advise the delay. <strong>DOC</strong> the TPO's record.</p>

<p><strong>Determine action required</strong></p>

<p>Determine if the TPO can remedy the breach or if the breach is cause for termination&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
For <strong>Terminations</strong>, do not terminate the contract workflow agreement. This will prevent the TPO Program Assurance workflow from working. Organise to reinstate the approval of the contract. For now, run the workflow and then terminate or withdraw approval in the contract workflow</li>
		<li>
If the review finds that the TPO has ceased trading, use the Baseline check questions only and answer 'Yes' to the TPO has ceased trading question. The outcome should be Terminated (except to Centrepay). For<strong> Centrepay</strong>&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
proceed with review at the baseline questions, and</li>
			<li>
complete subsequent linked reviews with the outcome <strong>Withdrawal Action Complete</strong></li>		</ul>
		<li>
If the review finds that a TPO  has not used a program and wants to withdraw, use the Baseline check questions and answer 'Yes' to the relevant question with a <strong>Voluntary Withdrawal</strong> outcome. <strong>Do not</strong> make the TPO non-compliant. This will generate an unwanted re-review. For <strong>Centrepay</strong>, complete at the baseline check using the outcome <strong>exclude withdrawal trigger</strong></li>
		<li>
If termination/withdrawal of approval occurs, RAMB roles need to be removed (if relevant) and the contract workflow ended. Ensure all user access is removed and end date bank account details (if relevant)</li>
		<li>
If a remedy notice is required, check if there is an appropriate remedy notice available on the shared drive/SharePoint. If not, send a request for either a remedy letter or a letter of termination to Program Assurance team. Use the referral template on the shared drive and include all relevant details</li>
		<li>
If a TPO is non-compliant, check the system for other businesses under the same entity with the same ABN/ACN. If the non-compliant issue is systemic, a review may need to be conducted on the other TPOs as well. Send a referral to the assurance team explaining the issue and number of businesses with the same ABN/ACN</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Uploading documents</strong></p>

<p>Upload any documents relevant to the breach via the <strong>Upload attachments</strong> button in the <strong>Completion</strong> tab.</p>

<p>For how to upload document outside the workflow, see <a target="_blank" href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-10010030-03.html">Scanning Centrelink documents using an MFD</a>.</p>

<p>Documents may be uploaded outside the workflow, but best practice is to collate all required documents and upload them to the TPO record at the same time. This ensures no documents are missed. This is a requirement and forms part of the QA standards that all documents related to the review are uploaded. These documents include a copy of the ABN Lookup/ASIC register, consent forms/receipts/statements and any written correspondence from the TPO.</p>

<p>Do not attach emails to the record without converting them to PDF. The Program Assurance workflow does not support email format.</p>

<p><strong>DOC</strong> anything outside the standard for QA purposes.</p>

<p>Take care when recording non-compliant outcomes to thoroughly <strong>DOC</strong> the breach. Stating that a breach has occurred is not sufficient. This is because in the future the circumstances of a breach could be disputed and involve legal representation.</p>

<p>When recording the breach, state the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
What is the breach and the relevant clause of the contract/agreement? This should include information about the nature of the breach, e.g.</li>
			<ul>			<li>
If they are selling excluded goods and services, what goods and how frequently?</li>
			<li>
If staff are accessing customer records without authorisation, how many staff and how many times?</li>		</ul>
		<li>
How the breach was identified, e.g.</li>
		<li>
Was it the result of a complaint or accusation (if so, include TPO's response when the complaint is put to them)</li>
		<li>
TPO admitted breach when questioned</li>
		<li>
Observed/identified during course of review (documents not securely stored, etc.)</li>
		<li>
Did the TPO agree that a breach has occurred?</li>
		<li>
If the TPO disputes the breach, record the conversation between the TPO and the agency</li>
		<li>
Record any other statements the TPO makes, such as mitigating circumstances they may be claiming</li>
		<li>
If discussion occurred of possible remedies&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
What was discussed? </li>
			<li>
Did the TPO commit to a course of action?</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>If the breach is not serious, less detail is required. Refer to the Workflow question sets/Breach application table for when it is appropriate to apply tolerances to a breach. Only apply tolerances if there is no risk to the agency and no disadvantage to the customer. Applying tolerances means excluding the breach, the review outcome is then <strong>Compliant.</strong></p>

<p>Consult the Program Assurance team to exclude a breach for any other reasons not outlined in the breach application table. Use the referral template on the shared drive.</p>

<p>Non-serious breaches are limited to failure to notify that the business agreement is now incorrect (if incorrect information would not lead to termination). For example, change of address, contact details, ABN (if no ownership change or cease trading).</p>

<p><strong>DOC</strong> the TPO's record or document within the workflow stating the breach/breaches reasons.</p>

<p>See the <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-09030010-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Attachments_and">Resources</a> page for a link to the Quality Standards for TPO Program Assurance and the standard text to include on the <strong>DOC</strong>. For <strong>DOC</strong> standards, refer also to the QA check list on the shared drive.</p>

<p>Send remedy notice (Q827) to TPO advising of breach details and remedy action required.</p>

<p>Advise TPO of the timeframe that they have to complete the remedy action and to respond to the agency to advise of the action taken and provide evidence if necessary.</p>

<p>The TPO will need to be re-reviewed once they respond to the notice to determine further action required. For more information, see <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-09030020-01.html">Re-reviews for non-compliant TPO</a>, (For Centrepay, as an interim process, GNCs will be considered the re-review.)</p>

<p>All remedial responses need to be in writing and uploaded to the TPO record.</p>

<p>If the TPO advises during the review that they have already remedied the breach, a remedy notice should still be issued. A written response is still required by the TPO to assure the agency that remedial action has been completed.</p>

<p>Check that the correct documents are uploaded in Customer First to the correct record.</p>

<p>For Centrepay&#58; an intent to suspend letter can be issued either as a result of non-compliance if the breach is serious, or if the business cannot be contacted.</p>

<p>If the business does not respond to an Intent to Suspend letter, a full or partial suspension can be imposed. Refer to the Program Assurance team using the referral template on the shared drive.</p>

<p>A show cause letter can be issued instead of an intent to suspend letter. It advises the business they need to show why the agency should not withdraw their approval based on the information currently available. If a business does not reply to this letter, their approval may be withdrawn.</p>

<p>If the business's approval is to be withdrawn due to non-compliance, refer to the Program Assurance team using the referral template on the shared drive.</p>

<p>Include information about the number of linked customers, any previous non-compliance and any impacts to the customer if the business is withdrawn.</p>

<p><strong>If an error is made</strong> in the workflow (e.g. incorrect outcome selected), send a request to delete the review by email to the Program Assurance team. Use the referral template on the shared drive.</p>

<p>Make sure&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
any notes from the review are copied before requesting deletion, as any linked reviews will also be deleted </li>
		<li>
notes are copied from all linked reviews (including Baseline questions)</li>		</ul>
