<p>FTB is the primary payment option for students aged 16-19 years in full-time secondary study. However in some circumstances it may be more beneficial for the student to claim ABSTUDY (for example, if the student is 18 years of age or older, living away from home or independent).</p>

<p>Where applicable, discuss the option of claiming or remaining on FTB with the student and parent(s)/guardian(s). Parent(s)/guardian(s) can compare payment options via the Payment and Services Finder. See <img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> <a href="../self-service/133-04120000-01.html">Online estimator options</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>From 1 January 2020</strong>, children aged 16-19 years receiving a means tested ABSTUDY payment (such as Living Allowance and School Fees Allowance (Group 2)) can still be considered an FTB child if they are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a full time secondary student</li>
		<li>
approved to live away from home to study, and</li>
		<li>
boarding to attend school</li>
		</ul>
<p>The system will continue to pay FTB for this child, if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a customer is in receipt of FTB for a child who is 16 to 19 years, and</li>
		<li>
the child is granted a means tested ABSTUDY payment and is boarding away from home to study</li>
		</ul>
<p>No action is required by Service Officers.</p>

<p>To restore FTB for children aged 16-19 years receiving means tested ABSTUDY allowances as a full time secondary student and who are living away from home and boarding to study where FTB is not being paid for the child, see <a href="../families/007-07110030-03.html#bp03_tbl_Restoring_or_re01_Step03">Step 3 in Table 2</a>.</p>

<p>When an ABSTUDY claim is granted for a child <strong>living at home</strong>, the parent/carer's record displays on the Assessment Explanation (<strong>AX</strong>) screen for the child as '<strong>DPP</strong>' (Dependent Receiving Precluding Payment). This action automatically occurs when ABSTUDY is granted and FTB is no longer payable for that child.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a CCS child claims one of the above payments, they may continue to attract CCS until they are granted a precluding payment. <strong>Do not</strong> cancel CCS while the claim for any of the above payments is still being assessed. Once the precluding payment has been granted CCS eligibility ceases from the date that the payment has been granted from (which would include any backdated periods). The child age exception should be ended from the date that the precluding payment has been granted, and customer overpayments may apply.
