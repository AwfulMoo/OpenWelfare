other mitigating or extenuating factors such as phone problems or illness</li>

<p>If the customer has continued to be qualified and retained payability for their payment during the period of suspension/cancellation, their payment <strong>may</strong> be restored with full arrears, even if the customer has contacted more than 13 weeks after the decision to suspend or cancel.</p>

<p><strong>Each customer’s circumstances must be looked at individually</strong> to determine whether they could be taken not to have received advice of the decision to suspend/cancel, and whether they retained qualification and payability during the period, and therefore receive arrears upon restoration.</p>

<p>If they were not at their known address or advice of the decision was returned to the agency, the customer is <strong>taken not to have received advice of the decision to suspend/cancel.</strong></p>

<p>Ensure the following factors are taken into consideration when deciding whether restoration with full arrears is appropriate&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the <strong>customer's address details have not changed</strong>, before payment can be restored the customer must provide evidence that they still live at the recorded address. This must be done before the payment can be restored</li>
		<li>
If an <strong>address has been incorrectly ended</strong>, go to the Address History (<strong>ADH</strong>) screen and '<strong>D</strong>'elete the <strong>Address Type Ended</strong> line. This will remove the end date from the current address</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the review of the decision to suspend/cancel <strong>WUK</strong> results in a favourable determination, the date of effect of the restoration <strong>is the date of the original decision</strong> (date of suspension/cancellation), as per legislation. See <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-10030010-01.html">Correspondence returned to service centre or Processing Centre ‘Whereabouts unknown’</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the customer is under income management (they have <strong>INM</strong> on the benefit status line) and they have an arrears or lump sum payment entitlement, the Service Officer is <strong>not</strong> to make any changes to the customer's record to allow this payment to be made. The Service Officer is to contact the Income Management Team to allow income management to be turned on for the arrears payment <strong>before</strong> it is made.</p>
