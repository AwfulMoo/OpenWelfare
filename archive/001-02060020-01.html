<p>This document outlines how to use the online diary to refer and manage appointments for job seekers with Employment Services Providers including jobactive, Disability Employment Services (DES) Community Development Program (CDP) and Intensive Support - Transition to Work (TtW) providers.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Access_to_the_O">Access to the Online Diary</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The Online Diary is used to initiate referrals, check current appointments, the job seeker's full appointment history and appointment outcomes. The Online Diary is available as a standalone function as well as forming part of the <a href="../job-seekers/001-03020100-01.html">Participation Interview</a> and the Looking for Work (LFW) workflow. The Online Diary will be presented in the workflow for those job seekers who have a requirement to be connected with a provider and have their initial appointment booked where appropriate. This includes job seekers who are exempt under certain RapidConnect exemption reasons.</p>

<p>When an appointment is made in the Online Diary, it will update the job seeker's record with details of the referral. Services Australia will also receive notification of the Diary appointment including RapidConnect results, electronically via the Department of Education, Skills and Employment's Employment Services System (ESS).</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The interface with the ESS will automatically check a job seeker's eligibility for referral. This includes checking that the job seeker&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
has an active Job Seeker Identification Number</li>
		<li>
does not have an existing <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-03010000-01.html">First Contact Concessions, Carers and Seniors (FCCCS) workflow</a> interview started</li>

		<div class="block">

<p>Most job seekers are automatically referred to the <a href="../job-seekers/001-02000000-01.html">Online Employment Services</a> (OES), with selection and referral being undertaken by the Department of Education, Skills and Employment during the job seeker's Participation Interview. Service Officers are blocked from using the Online Diary to refer these job seekers to a jobactive provider as they manage their obligations through jobactive (the online employment service website).</p>

<p>From 1 July 2019, all Stream A job seekers in 2 designated pilot areas are selected by the Department of Education, Skills and Employment to participate in the New Employment Services Model (ESM) Pilot. The ESM pilot builds on the existing OES but has been expanded to include Parenting Payment Single (with mutual obligations) and RapidConnect exempt job seekers.</p>

<p>The Online Diary will not feature in registration and referral workflows for job seekers selected for online employment services. These job seekers will be automatically connected to the online service and given instructions on how to participate and meet their mutual obligation requirements by the Department of Education, Skills and Employment.</p>

<p>Both the OES and ESM pilot will continue until the New Employment Services Model is implemented in July 2022.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Providers are listed in the Online Diary according to their earliest available sessions. The list can be searched by postcode, provider name and, for some providers, service centre or area of expertise.</p>

<p>When making the referral to jobactive, Service Officers are to advise the job seeker of available providers in their local area and their respective performance ratings. Service Officers must not provide advice to job seekers about which provider to choose.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the star rating system for jobactive providers ceased 1 June 2021.</p>

<p>For some providers, preferences and exclusions can be keyed to sort the list of providers. If providers are 'full', 'closed' or 'not available' they cannot be selected.</p>

<p>Services Australia does not have the functionality to change a provider for a job seeker once the initial appointment has been booked. Service Officers can contact the Department of Education, Skills and Employment&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Employment Services Helpdesk, to <strong>correct </strong>a referral made to the <strong>wrong </strong>provider, or</li>

<p>Job seekers will be referred to a jobactive provider to access the assistance available through jobactive for which they are eligible. The job seeker will remain with that provider&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
for the duration of their unemployment, or</li>
		<li>
until they reach the Maximum Time they are allowed with 1 jobactive provider, or</li>
		<li>
until the jobactive organisation no longer has a contract</li>
		</ul>
<p>Job seekers referred to the <a href="../job-seekers/001-02000000-01.html">jobactive online employment service</a> will remain with the online service until the Department of Education, Skills and Employment deem it appropriate to refer them to a jobactive provider.</p>

<p>Maximum time transfers ensure job seekers who have been with the same provider for an extended period without achieving an employment outcome are transferred to a new provider. This will give job seekers different servicing which may improve their prospects of getting a job.</p>

<p>Job seekers are generally transferred to a different provider, at the following points&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
2 years for Stream A job seekers, and</li>
		<li>
3 years for Stream B or C job seekers</li>
		</ul>
<p>The timeframe depends on their Time in Program with Provider (TIPP) clock.</p>

<p>Services Australia has no role in the maximum time transfer process as this is calculated by the Department of Education, Skills and Employment system. Job seekers with questions about the transfer process should contact the Department of Education, Skills and Employment.</p>

<p>In the Online Diary, the <strong>List Providers</strong> screen displays information about DES performance star ratings.

<p>Job seekers who are subject to <a href="../job-seekers/001-02030000-01.html">RapidConnect</a> provisions and are not referred to Online Employment Services are required to have an appointment with a provider within 2 working days of the Participation Interview being conducted and being advised of their obligation to attend a RapidConnect appointment. If an appointment is not available within 2 days, an appointment within the next 14 calendar days may be selected. Contact with the provider should be made in order to seek an appropriate appointment. However, if additional provider sessions are not able to be arranged with any providers in the job seeker's local area within 14 calendar days, the job seeker will be exempt from RapidConnect requirements.

There is no requirement for the Service Officer to book the initial appointment for the job seeker in this instance and they would be exempt from RapidConnect.</p>

<p>Job seekers in CDP regions will be re-registered with the CDP provider for that region. If the job seeker has moved to a non CDP region, they will be able to select a jobactive provider of their choice.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Services Australia, jobactive, TtW and CDP providers can reschedule the RapidConnect or initial appointment with the job seeker as long as the appointment is still in the future and no result has previously been recorded for that appointment. 'Created in Error' can be input for DES Referrals, which will cancel the whole referral.</p>

<p>When the appointment is rescheduled, Service Officers need to ensure that the job seeker is advised about their appointment details verbally or in writing.</p>

<p><strong>Special considerations for RapidConnect appointments</strong></p>

<p>If a job seeker is subject to the RapidConnect provisions, rescheduling their RapidConnect appointment may affect their income support payment. Service Officers are required to determine whether a request to reschedule a RapidConnect appointment is for an acceptable reason and the new appointment must be booked within 14 days from the date the <strong>Online Participation Workflow</strong> was run.</p>

<p>Where the RapidConnect appointment date has passed or an appointment result has already been keyed, the RapidConnect appointment can no longer be rescheduled, and the appointment will need to be rebooked.</p>

<p>See <a target="_blank" href="../job-seekers/001-02030010-01.html">Processes for RapidConnect appointments</a> to <strong>reschedule</strong> and <strong>rebook</strong> RapidConnect appointments.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>If the provider has not re-booked the initial RapidConnect appointment and the job seeker either attends or contacts Services Australia, the Service Officer can rebook the appointment using the Online Participation Workflow if the original claim was completed online. If there are no appointments available, the Service Officer will need to contact the provider and request an initial appointment for the job seeker. This appointment should be within 14 days of Participation Interview being conducted, to ensure the job seeker is paid from the correct start date under RapidConnect rules.</p>
