<p>Customers may lodge a claim for an income support payment up to 21 days before their expected release date. The payment will be issued on the customer’s next Entitlement Period End Date (EPED) following release.</p>

<p>Service centres near correctional centres have nominated staff (Prison Liaison Officers) to liaise with the prison authorities. Local service arrangements for delivery of CrP should include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The agreed method is for the correctional centre to advise Services Australia of the names of customers in prison due for release within the next 21 days. The Release Notification Ledger (SU517) may be used for this purpose, if the prison doesn't already have a preferred format</li>
		<li>
A method of obtaining applications and other forms from customers, such as whether a Service Officer personally interviews customers (this can be done via phone), or forms are delivered/received via prison welfare officers</li>

Staff may complete this step if they are trained." /></strong></p>

<p><strong>Alternative Identity Confirmation process</strong></p>

<p>If the customer has insufficient identity documentation, use the alternative Identity Confirmation process using the Personal Crisis (PC) code. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07040050-01.html">Alternative Identity</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> do <strong>not</strong> use the Identity Review Period (IRP) code unless they can definitely provide identity documentation within 28 days.</p>

<p><strong>Types of Proof of Identity (POI) prison release customers may have</strong></p>

<p>Prison release customers may not be aware of what documents are approved identity documents. In addition to common identity documents, ask if they have any of the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Justice or other lease agreement (LA). Prisoners living in supported accommodation with a local prison or a justice health agency that has a housing strategy for prisoners, can use their 'lease agreement' (LA)</li>
		<li>
Discharge or Release Certificates with their photo and/or signature (PA)</li>
		<li>
Qualifications completed while in custody educational or trade certificates, educational reports or references or student cards</li>
		</ul>
<p>Prison release certificates with photo or signature are approved identity documents that count towards establishing the customer's identity. Certificates that do not meet these criteria can only be used towards Alternative Identity.</p>

<p>When the customer provides identity documents, take care to check it is acceptable Identity Confirmation to help prevent fraud. The customer's identity must be satisfied before the claim can proceed.</p>

<p>If the customer has any names/aliases or alternative identity information not recorded on their Centrelink record, update the Customer Person Details Summary (<strong>CPDS</strong>) screen. Correctional Services departments are a trusted third party data source.</p>

<p>For how to code the details, see <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-04010030-03.html">Aliases and other names (legal, preferred, sex and gender diverse customers, cultural considerations etc.</a>).</p>

<p>To be eligible for Crisis Payment (CrP) a person must be qualified for a social security pension, social security benefit or ABSTUDY Living Allowance and the payment is payable.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Upon receipt of the completed claim forms, assess the customer's qualification for a new claim for a primary payment or a restoration of primary payment</li>
		<li>
If the customer qualifies, grant the payment with the date of commencement being the expected date of release</li>
		<li>
Record grant or reject decision and any action taken on a <strong>DOC</strong>. Ensure the advice letter is correctly addressed or delivered to the customer</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Disability Support Pension (DSP)</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Customers may have their record suspended due to imprisonment (SUS-IMP) for up to 2 years. In these cases a new claim is not required. Instead, restore the record from the date of release<br>If the payment is to be restored and the customer is partnered, check the payment rate and Marital Status (<strong>MS</strong>) screen to ensure a relationship qualifier code&#58; '<strong>GAC</strong>' (In Gaol) is not present. If present, see <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07120050-03.html">Assessment of circumstances for customers with partner in prison</a> for further instruction</li>
		<li>
The <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-07030040-05.html">Resources</a> page contains links to contact details for release of medical information, the form to request information for Queensland and an Authority for release of information generic fax template if required by the prison/corrective services</li>
		<li>
Medical records can assist with DSP claims, and help the customer's doctor to assess them for ongoing medication. Usually prisoners are released with up to 3 days medication. It may be difficult for a new doctor to assess some illnesses or medical conditions, for example schizophrenia, in such a short period</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Parenting Payment (PP)</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
PP should generally <strong>not</strong> be granted with a future start date for parents about to be released from prison. This is because the customer will not ordinarily have a dependent child in their care whilst they are in custody</li>
		<li>
However, if the customer has the child with them in custody, and the child remains with them when released, PP can be restored or granted upon the customers release from prison</li>
		<li>
In the majority of cases JobSeeker Payment (JSP) or Youth Allowance (YA) should be assessed for these customers before their release from prison</li>
		<li>
PP backdating rules allow a claim to be backdated to the date the child came into the customer's care, if the claim for PP is made within 28 days of the child entering care</li>
		<li>
If the child does come into the customer's care and the customer qualifies for PP on the day of release, the customer should receive a 'top up' of the difference between PP and the payment they were granted (JSP or YA) prior to their release. The difference in rates of CrP should also be topped up</li>
		</ul>

Customers who have entered into a new relationship after they were imprisoned are required to verify their relationship status via a Partner Details (Mod P) form.</p>

No manual review is required to be coded for evidence and no follow up is required if the customer isn’t able to, or doesn’t supply evidence within 14 days of being released.

<p>If a customer has been released from prison or psychiatric confinement and is in severe financial hardship, it may be appropriate to offer the customer a hardship advance of the first instalment of their regular payment.

<p>Customers who are in prison should have the recovery of their debts deferred until release. Upon release, customers typically need further deferment until they can negotiate a debt repayment arrangement.</p>

<p>If a customer who has been released from prison has an outstanding debt; Prison Liaison Officers (PLO) with access to the Debt Recovery script can <a href="../debts/107-05130010-01.html">temporarily write-off the debt</a> for 28 days. This allows the customer to receive full entitlement for 2 pay periods and minimises hardship. See Prison Release under <a href="../debts/107-05010020-03.html">Debt Recovery general information</a>.</p>

<p>PLOs can tell the customer that there are a number of repayment options to repay their debt. The PLO can negotiate for a preferred payment option on the customer's behalf. If a PLO is not available prior to release, the customer can use their Centrelink online account or contact the Debt Management Branch to organise repayment.</p>
