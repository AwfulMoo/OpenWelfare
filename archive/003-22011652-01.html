<p>Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment can be paid if a customer has not completed <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-09010000-01.html">identity confirmation</a>.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
who they say they are, <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>

<p>Staff <strong>do not</strong> need to review or follow-up any identity requirements for online claims.</p>

<p>These customers meet&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>identity requirements</strong> by being previously known to Centrelink and using their existing <a href="../self-service/133-19061415-01.html">Centrelink online</a> account to lodge their claim, they do not need to provide any further identity documents to be verified, or</li>
		<li>
<strong>abridged identity requirements (Connected ID)</strong> by creating a new myGov account and linking it to a Centrelink online account. This way they meet identity requirements to receive a payment</li>
		</ul>
<p>When allocated a claim, staff must check the ‘Channel.’ If it shows as <strong>WEB CHANNEL</strong>, this is an online claim lodged by a customer and the customer will meet the identity requirements. ‘Submitted by’ will show the customer’s CRN.</p>

<p>If the ‘Channel’ shows as <strong>INTERNAL,</strong> this is a phone claim lodged using <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-22011601-01.html">Assisted Customer Claim (ACC).</a> ‘Submitted by’ will show the User ID of the Service Officer who submitted the ACC.</p>

<p>If a claim that shows as <strong>INTERNAL</strong> <strong>does not</strong> meet the identity requirements for phone claims (see below), their claim is to be <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-22011652-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Rejecting_claim">rejected</a>.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Commencement of Identity (CoI)</strong></li>

A customer can demonstrate CoI in Australia by providing documents that confirm their birth in Australia or proof of arrival in Australia, establishing the customer's existence in Australia</li>

<p>Each identity document will be coded and verified in the Identity Confirmation Dashboard in Process Direct.</p>

<p><strong>Customers must provide consent</strong> before documents can be verified through the Document Verification Service (DVS).</p>

<p>For claims lodged over the phone by Assisted Customer Claim (ACC), customers must agree to the declarations read to them.</p>

<p>These claims will have the keyword <strong>PLDP2NDEXT</strong></p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> any second or subsequent claim allocated for manual assessment must be reviewed to determine if it is a claim extension of the customer’s previously granted claim&#58;</p>

		<li>
even if the claim <strong>does not</strong> have the keyword <strong>PLDP2NDEXT</strong></li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Decide if the current claim is an extension of a customer’s previously granted claim</strong></p>

<p>The customer is asked if their claim is an extension of a previous period. However, staff <strong>must</strong> carefully check the impact reasons and dates of claims through&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the <strong>Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment Summary</strong> (<strong>PLDP_PS</strong>) screen, which outlines start dates and impact reasons, <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
the customer’s online claim question responses to current and previously granted claims, to confirm the name/s of any person </li>
			<ul>			<li>
being cared for <strong>and/or</strong> </li>
			<li>
who tested positive and resulted in the close contact status of the customer or the person the customer is caring for</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>When a claim is an extension of a customer’s previously granted claim </strong></p>

<p>This occurs when <strong>their impact reason has not changed and a customer has been paid for a 7 day claiming period&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>immediately before</strong> their new claim, or</li>
		<li>
that ended <strong>7 days or less</strong> before the start date of their new claim</li>
		</ul>
<p>for example&#58;<br>- a customer lodges a new claim for the period 10 February to 16 February as they tested positive with COVID-19. Their last claim was for the period 1 February to 7 February as they tested positive with COVID-19. There are 2 days between the end date and start date of these 2 claims and this would be considered an extension<br>- a customer lodges a new claim for the period 20 to 26 March as they tested positive with COVID-19. Their last claim was for the period 5 to 11 March as they tested positive with COVID-19. There are 8 days (12 to 19 March) <strong>before</strong> the start date and end date of these 2 claims. This is not 7 days or less, so this would not be considered an extension<br>- a customer lodges a new claim for the period 10 February to 16 February, as they were caring for a person who tested positive with COVID-19. Their last claim was for the period 1 February to 7 February, as they were caring for a person who tested positive with COVID-19. If the names of the person being cared for are different this <strong>would not</strong> be considered a claim extension, as the customer is caring for a different person</p>

<p>If the new claim is considered a claim extension of the customer’s previously granted claim, further assessment is needed on if the customer has completed the required extension questions correctly. <strong>If not </strong>these claims&#58;</p>
			<ul>			<li>
are not valid, <strong>and</strong></li>
			<li>
must be rejected with no further customer contact </li>
