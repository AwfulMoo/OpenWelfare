<p>1</p></td>
<td>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Will this be expanded to all vaccinations?  </strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; No. The Scheme relates only to Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) approved COVID-19 vaccinations that were part of the Australian Government COVID-19 vaccine rollout. </p></td>

<td>

<p>2</p></td>
<td>

<p><strong>Question&#58; My claim relates to a clinical condition in Table 1. Is this automatically covered by the Scheme?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; The Scheme is specific to a list of adverse effects and injuries. These are medically diagnosed clinical conditions considered likely to be related to a TGA approved COVID-19 vaccination. The treating doctor will need to provide an opinion that the condition is most likely caused by the COVID-19 vaccine as part of the patient’s diagnosis.</p>

<tr>
<td>

<p>3</p></td>
<td>

<p><strong>Question&#58; My claim relates to an injury received when the vaccine was administered. Is this covered by the Scheme?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; If the harm relates to the administration of the vaccine, the same evidence requirements would apply from the patient’s treating doctor (rather than the vaccine administrator). </p>

<p>The claim would be referred to a panel of independent legal experts for assessment, who will make a recommendation whether compensation should be paid, and if so the amount.</p>

<p></p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

<p>4</p></td>
<td>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Which COVID-19 vaccinations does the Scheme cover? </strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; The Scheme compensates eligible claimants who have&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
suffered moderate to significant injury, or </li>
		<li>
persons who have died, resulting from the vaccine or its administration of a TGA approved COVID-19 vaccine</li>
		</ul>
<p>The Scheme will not cover compensation for an amount already awarded for the same injury through another scheme or court process.</p>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>

<p>5</p></td>
<td>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Will the Scheme cover TGA approved COVID-19 vaccine booster doses? </strong></p>

<p></p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

<p>6</p></td>
<td>

<p><strong>Question&#58; How long does the Scheme run for?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; The Scheme will remain open for 2 years after the human biosecurity emergency period under the <i>Biosecurity Act 2015</i> ends. You will be able to receive your vaccination and submit a claim for compensation within 2 years after the official end of the emergency period.</p>

<p></p></td>

<tr>
<td>

<p>7</p></td>
<td>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Do I need to identify who caused the injury?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; A person making the claim does not need to establish that anyone in particular was at fault. However, the claimant must provide evidence to establish that the injury (or a person’s death) was likely caused by a TGA approved COVID-19 vaccine or its administration. </p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; When can a claim be made?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; From 6 September 2021, potential claimants have been able to <a target="_blank" class="extwebsitelink" href="https&#58;//www.health.gov.au/initiatives-and-programs/covid-19-vaccine-claims-scheme">register their interest in claiming</a> through the Department of Health and Aged Care website.</p>

<p>It is anticipated that eligible claimants will be able to submit a claim for compensation to Services Australia from mid-December 2021.</p>

<p>All those who have registered interest in claiming with the Department of Health and Aged Care will be notified when the claiming system opens. Individuals who have registered their interest must also submit a claim in order to be eligible to receive compensation. </p>

<p>It is not necessary to register your intent to claim before submitting a claim. Claims will be accepted for up to 2 years after the end of the human biosecurity emergency period under the Biosecurity Act 2015.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; How can I claim?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; </p>

<p><strong>Getting ready to claim</strong></p>

<p>To claim you’ll need&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
to talk to your reporting practitioner about whether you will meet the eligibility requirements of the scheme</li>
		<li>
gather evidence to support the amount you are claiming and know which categories of losses you wish to claim against</li>
		<li>
an outline of what has happened</li>
		<li>
evidence of admission to hospital</li>
		<li>
your reporting practitioner to complete the COVID-19 Vaccine Claims Scheme (CVCS) medical report form (MO063). To assist, bring the information to support what you are intending to claim for</li>
		</ul>
<p>You will need to show how you have calculated the amount you are claiming and provide evidence to support this. </p>

<p><strong>Submitting your claim</strong></p>

<p>You can submit your claim form and supporting documents in any of these ways&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
using your <a target="_blank" class="extwebsitelink" href="https&#58;//www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/services/medicare/medicare-online-accounts">Medicare online account</a> through <a target="_blank" href="https&#58;//my.gov.au/">myGov</a></li>

		<li>
posting the completed claim form and supporting documents to the return address on the form</li>

<p><strong>Question&#58; What happens if my situation changes or I have additional supporting information which may affect my claim and I have already received payment?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; If your application is currently being reviewed and you have additional information to support your claim(s), you can contact 1800 813 617 to have this information considered.</p>

<p>If your application is finalised and compensation has been paid, you will not be eligible to submit a new application to the Scheme.</p>

<p>In specified exceptional circumstances an exemption may be given. Refer to the Department of Health and Aged Care policy document for an outline of these circumstances, available on their website.</p>

<p>11</p></td>
<td>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Who has authority to act on my behalf / how can I give authority for someone to act on my behalf?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; You can authorise someone to act on your behalf by completing the following form and including this with your claim. </p>
		<ul>		<li>
<a target="_blank" class="extwebsitelink" href="https&#58;//www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/mo064">Authorising a person or organisation to act on your behalf – COVID-19 Vaccine Claims Scheme form (MO064)</a></li>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Do I have to be a Medicare Customer / have a Medicare Card, or be an IHI holder to apply for the Scheme?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; The scheme is available to anyone who received a vaccination as part of the Australian Government COVID-19 vaccine rollout. The incidence of significant impacts from the vaccines are low and so it is expected nearly everyone who may be impacted will have a Medicare card.</p>

<p>If there is a case where a patient was not Medicare eligible, the program team can discuss the matter with the impacted party. </p>

<td>

<p>14</p></td>
<td>

<p><strong>Question&#58; What notification(s) can I expect to receive throughout the application process?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Services Australia will endeavour to update claimants via their preferred communication method as soon as possible. There are variables which may impact the ability to meet timeframes, including further information being required and the availability of external experts.</p>

<p>Services Australia will contact claimants or their representatives if further information is required in order to continue assessing their claim.</p>

<p>15</p></td>
<td>

<p><strong>Question&#58; If I have had a reaction to the vaccine and I would like to claim does it have to show on the AIR before it will be accepted?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Yes, we will verify your claim against information we hold on the Australian Immunisation Register.</p>

<p>If your details are incorrect, ask your vaccination provider to update the details on the Australian Immunisation Register.</p>

<p>It can take up to 10 days for a vaccination provider to report your vaccination information.</p>

<p>Answer&#58; </p>

<p>Where the claim is for an amount from $1,000 up to $19,999.99, Services Australia will assess the claim against the eligibility criteria and evidence and make a recommendation to an authorised delegate within Services Australia, as the administrator of the Scheme. </p>

<p>Claims for $20,000 and above will be assessed by a panel of independent legal experts. Complex claims below this amount may also be referred to the panel. A member of the panel will review the claim and may seek additional evidence or advice, including from the claimant, the Department of Health and Aged Care or a medical expert, before making a recommendation to an authorised delegate within Services Australia regarding whether compensation should be paid and if so, the amount. </p>

<p>Claimants will need to agree to authorise Services Australia to access relevant information in order to verify and assess the claim. This may include patient data held in the Australian Immunisation Register, and other relevant bodies such as the Department of Health and Aged Care, including the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), as well as the health practitioner or organisation who administered the vaccine and the hospital where the claimant was hospitalised. </p>

This is up to the amount of that compensation for the same clinical condition or harm from someone else (e.g. from a workers’ compensation insurer).

<p><strong>Question&#58; Is your claim relating to an injury from the COVID-19 vaccine or an injury caused by the administration?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; The Scheme is specific to injuries relating to medically diagnosed clinical conditions considered likely to be related to a Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) approved COVID-19 vaccine. The treating doctor will need to provide advice that the condition is most likely caused by the COVID-19 vaccine as part of the patient’s diagnosis.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; How do state based workers compensation arrangements interact with the COVID-19 Vaccine Claims Scheme? For example, can you only claim for vaccination injuries under the Scheme?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; The intent of the Scheme is not to replace existing workers compensation arrangements. It also does not remove an individual’s right to pursue workers compensation if eligible or seek to litigate in relation to an adverse outcome from vaccination. However, the Scheme will provide claimants with a more efficient administrative option to seek compensation and an outcome similar to a court process, rather than having to undertake a complex and costly court process. </p>

<p>Should a patient seek and receive workers’ compensation payments related to an adverse reaction to a Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) approved vaccine, any payments received by way of workers’ compensation would be taken into account so that the claimant is not compensated twice. Where compensation is also paid under the Scheme for the same injury, the claimant may be required to repay either the Australian Government or the relevant workers’ compensation scheme.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Will employers be responsible for an adverse event that occurred as part of our employee vaccination program?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; The Scheme does not replace workers compensation arrangements. However, the Scheme will provide claimants with an administrative option to seek compensation rather than a complex and costly court process. In assessing claims under the Scheme, the Australian Government will not consider responsibility of employers in relation to harm suffered by a claimant, or death of an employee, that is directly a result of a workplace COVID-19 vaccination. However, employers’ broader responsibilities are not being indemnified through this Scheme.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Could an employee pursue legal proceedings against an employer?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Claimants are not prevented from taking action through the courts. However, the Scheme has been designed as a streamlined alternative to legal proceedings. If a claimant pursues subsequent legal proceedings after receiving compensation under the Scheme, they will be required to repay back to the Australian Government, the lesser compensation amount received.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Will business interruption costs $1,000 and over be claimable under the Scheme?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; The Scheme is designed to only provide compensation to eligible individual claimants who have suffered harm as a result of receiving a TGA approved COVID-19 vaccine. The Scheme will not provide compensation for business interruption costs or any other lost profits or other amounts, including indirect or consequential loss. </p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; What advice should employers provide employees who want to know what compensation cover is in place if they have an adverse effect related to a vaccine sanctioned via the employer?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; The employer should refer the employee (patient) to the Department of Health and Aged Care website at&#58; www.health.gov.au/initiatives-and-programs/covid-19-vaccine-claims-scheme</p>

<p>While side effects from COVID-19 vaccinations can occur, most are mild and last no longer than a couple of days. Serious and life-threatening clinical conditions caused by vaccination are very rare. The Scheme provides a safety net to support those affected, by providing eligible claimants with access to compensation where they suffer a moderate to severe harm or death caused by a TGA approved COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Will employers have rehabilitation and return to work obligations for someone who successfully makes a claim under the COVID-19 Vaccine Claims Scheme? With respect to compensation being paid, will this cover income lost by person/s that need to take time off work to care for someone impacted as a result of the COVID-19 Vaccine Claim Scheme?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Employers should obtain their own legal advice on this issue specific to an individual’s circumstances. </p>

<p>The Scheme is intended to provide a one-off compensation payment to those who have suffered moderate to severe harm or death caused by a TGA approved COVID-19 vaccine. This claim should take into account any other compensation amounts the claimant may have received as a result of the harm. It may include an amount for additional domestic care, if required by the claimant. </p>

<p>The Scheme does not apply to third parties, such as family members of the eligible claimant (with the exception of cases involving death where payment will be made to the Estate and this may subsequently be dispersed to family members).</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; What happens if there is a long-term side effect from the vaccination?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; The Scheme is structured to cover harm that occurs within 2 years after the Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) Declaration 2020 expiring. Claims will be settled having regard to the both past and future costs associated with the harm.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Should employers encourage employees to have a vaccine under the federal scheme, rather than under a formal employer sanctioned vaccine program, to eliminate the risk of a workers compensation claim?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; The consistent message to all people in Australia is to get vaccinated. The Scheme applies to all vaccinations carried out by approved healthcare practitioners as part of the Australian Government’s rollout, including vaccines administered in the context of an employer sanctioned vaccine program. </p>

<p>Employers should seek their own legal advice in relation to whether an employee could make a workers’ compensation claim in respect of a COVID-19 vaccination received in an employer sanctioned vaccination program.</p>

<p>Answer&#58; If an eligible claimant is injured as a result of a TGA approved COVID-19 vaccination received in the workplace, the individual can submit a claim under the Scheme where the minimum threshold is $1,000. </p>

<p>If a claimant is a sole trader or business owner, the impact on their income as a result of the harm suffered as a result of receiving a TGA approved COVID-19 vaccine will likely be relevant to assessing any compensation amounts for lost earnings by that individual.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; I am a nurse working in a private clinic administering COVID-19 vaccinations, what does the Scheme mean for me?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; The Scheme is universally available to eligible claimants who suffer harm as a result of receiving a Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) approved COVID-19 vaccine from an approved healthcare practitioner.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; My patient has suffered an adverse effect to a TGA approved COVID-19 Vaccine, what steps should I take?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; While side effects from COVID-19 vaccinations can occur, most are mild and last no longer than a couple of days. Serious and life-threatening side effects are very rare. The Scheme provides a safety net to support those affected by providing eligible claimants with access to compensation where they suffer a moderate to severe harm or death caused by a TGA approved COVID-19 vaccination. </p>

<p>If your patient has suffered a moderate to significant harm or death caused by a TGA approved COVID-19 vaccine, you can refer them (or the executor or administrator of their estate, in the event of death) to register their interest in making a compensation claim. Do this through a link located on the Department of Health and Aged Care website at&#58; www.health.gov.au/initiatives-and-programs/covid-19-vaccine-claims-scheme</p>

<p>As part of the claims process the patient will need to provide evidence in support of their claim that their harm has been caused by the vaccine. This evidence will include a medical report from their treating doctor or a hospital physician indicating the nature of the harm suffered by the patient post vaccination, the duration of that condition and the causative link to the TGA approved COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

<p>It is also important that any adverse reaction to a TGA approved COVID-19 is reported to the TGA as part of their usual surveillance program.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Would I be subjected to any legal proceedings?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; A key aim of the Scheme is to reduce the risk of a legal action against a healthcare practitioner who is involved in the COVID-19 vaccination program. </p>

<p>The Scheme does not prevent someone from taking action through the courts, however, the Scheme has been designed as a streamlined alternative to court proceedings. </p>

<p>Services Australia or an assessment panel may consider as a result of the information submitted by a claimant that there may have been harm caused by a registered health practitioner in the administration of the vaccine. They may recommend a referral to the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra) for a review of the practitioner’s conduct or performance by the relevant professional board. </p>

<p>Unsatisfactory conduct or performance is relatively rare. However, these steps are in keeping with the Australian Government's intention that health practitioners continue to practise with skill and diligence and to promote confidence in the population being vaccinated. These measures will support the integrity of the COVID-19 vaccination program and the Scheme itself.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; What is the tax treatment?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; The taxation treatment of any compensation paid under the Scheme is a matter to be determined in accordance with applicable taxation laws. Claimants should consider obtaining professional or legal advice on the appropriate tax treatment of any payments they receive under the Scheme.</p>
