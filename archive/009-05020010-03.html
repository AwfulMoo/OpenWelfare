<p>'<strong>S</strong>'elect '<strong>SELF</strong>' from the Care Receiver Summary (<strong>CRS</strong>) screen and go to the Adult Disability Assessment Tool Summary (<strong>ADAS</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>The <strong>ADAS</strong> screen lists a summary of existing or previous ADAT assessments.</p>

<p>Re-use provisions may be applied if 1 of the following is met&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the care receiver is aged 16 years or older at time of claim <strong>and</strong> the carer re-claims for the same care receiver within 26 weeks of CP and/or CA cancellation</li>
		<li>
the care receiver was previously assessed with a terminal illness, with a life expectancy of not substantially longer than 3 months</li>
		<li>
the CP and/or CA (adult) assessment has previously achieved a qualifying ADAT score of 40 or more and the condition is permanent and non-improving, <strong>or</strong></li>
		<li>
the Treating Health Professional (THP) medical report and ADAT assessment scores qualify the carer for the payment being claimed for <strong>and</strong> the most recently recorded medical report was completed no greater than 24 months (THP sign date) prior to the date the carer contacts to claim payment</li>
		</ul>
<p>Although the re-use provisions may apply, Service Officers must be satisfied that the carer meets the daily care and constant care requirements.</p>

<p>Only seek clarification of the provision of care if there are circumstances indicating the carer is <strong>not</strong> providing constant or daily care. In these instances, Service Officers must determine whether a person is qualified for CP and/or CA based on all the relevant material provided, and that <strong>all</strong> of the qualification criteria have been satisfied. If the carer qualifies under re-use and Service Officers have concerns about the provision of constant or daily care, carers and THPs can be contacted to clarify the care that is required and is provided, however carers are <strong>not required</strong> to provide care schedules or care plans.</p>

<p>Consider the following factors&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
when the previous ADAT was conducted</li>
		<li>
the medical condition(s) of the care receiver</li>
		<li>
the carer score - a low carer score raises concerns as to the level of care required</li>
		<li>
if there has been a significant period when no one has received either CP or CA in respect of the care receiver</li>
		<li>
if the care receiver&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
had overseas trips which appear inconsistent with their condition</li>
			<li>
has been employed since the last ADAT</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>The re-use provisions do <strong>not</strong> apply&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
to Medical Reviews, or</li>
		<li>
if the carer has lodged a medical report and carer questionnaire, <strong>and</strong>&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the medical report is an accurate reflection of the care receiver’s care needs</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>Can an existing ADAT assessment be re-used <strong>and</strong> is this a new claim activity?</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>&#58;</li>

review, the effect date will be the date of determination.

In this scenario the response to question 11.1 must be changed to a '<strong>N</strong>', this has no implications on the overall scoring regime for the ADAT</li>
		<li>
<strong>N</strong> at question 11.1 and selected <strong>Y</strong> to 1 or more incorrect answers at 11.2, the THP must be contacted by either phone or fax to clarify the inconsistent responses</li>
		<li>
<strong>Y</strong> at question 11.1, provided answers at 11.2 <strong>and also</strong> indicated they were <strong>not able</strong> to administer the Abbreviated Mental Test at 11.3, this cannot be recorded on the <strong>ADCF</strong> screen. An error message will appear 'E233DL - cannot enter responses to B2 if unable to administer test'. In this scenario the responses to question 11.2 must be disregarded and the response to 11.3 must be used</li>
		<li>
no answers at 11.1, but answered questions at 11.2 <strong>or</strong> they were unable to administer the Abbreviated Mental Test at 11.3, accept that the response at 11.1 would be <strong>Y</strong></li>
		</ul>
<p>If the ADAT produces a qualifying score and there are unanswered questions that have no bearing on the carer's qualification for CP or CA, do not contact the carer or THP, and document this on the carer's record.</p>
