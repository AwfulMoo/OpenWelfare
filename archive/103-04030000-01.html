<p>The Social Security (Administration) Act requires that, unless an exemption has been granted, all payments to customers are to be made via direct credit into the customer's account held at a bank, credit union or building society. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> payments <strong>are not</strong> to be sent to a credit card as these accounts are not directly administered by the issuing financial institution.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The following issues must be taken into consideration when a customer supplies details of an account to be used as their payment destination&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Payment destination details can only be changed by the customer or a person with payment authority for that customer. This can also include a faxed request from a bank, on their letterhead <strong>and</strong> signed by the customer</li>
		<li>
The customer <strong>must have legal access</strong> to the account - it must be in their own name, or their name must appear on the joint account</li>
		<li>
Customers who bank with credit unions must provide their <strong>account</strong> number, not their <strong>member</strong> number, or their payments will reject. This applies even where the customer has historically provided their member number (to Centrelink or any other third party)</li>
		<li>
Payments can only be made to a <strong>child's account</strong> if the account is held in trust for the child by the customer or if withdrawals can only be made by the customer. In these cases it is deemed the customer has legal access to the account</li>
		<li>
It is vital the correct information is coded. Once the payment destination has been updated confirm the change with the customer</li>
		<li>
If the customer receives more than 1 type of payment, confirm with the customer the account details for each payment</li>
		<li>
Is this payment destination used for the receipt of NDIS payments? NDIS payments should be in a separate account as NDIS amounts received for funded support are income, asset and deeming exempt for income support purposes</li>

		<div class="block">

<p>There are certain situations where individual customers can be granted exemptions from the requirement to provide direct credit details. Examples include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Payment to parents for Youth Allowance (YA) customers under 18 years&#58;</strong> Under 18 year olds who are dependent on their parents will have their payments sent directly to the parent (or parents if the parents have a joint bank account). The parent may give permission for the payment to go to the customer's account. Once the customer has turned 18 years of age, the payment must either be paid to an account held by the customer or a <a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-04090000-01.html">Payment Nominee</a> arrangement must be made</li>
		<li>
<strong>Payments for AIC (Assistance for Isolated Children)&#58;</strong> As AIC is claimed by the parent (although paid on the student record) then regardless of the student’s age, the payment destination is always the choice of the parent and can be either&#58; the parent, the student or a third party individual or organisation. If a student contacts to change the payment destination for AIC, note the details in an <strong>ACTDOC</strong> and send it to LPT with keywords of <strong>ACTAIC</strong> and <strong>URGENT</strong> to follow up. See <a href="../payment-delivery/103-04030010-01.html">Changing Payment Destination</a></li>
		<li>
<strong>Payment to parents for ABSTUDY customers under 18 years&#58;</strong> For ABSTUDY, factors such as the type of study and age of the customer will determine if their own account or the parent’s account can be used as the payment destination. See the <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-02070080-01.html">Resources</a> page of Living Allowance for ABSTUDY<br>Regardless of the student’s age, for ABSTUDY students who are&#58; studying at Secondary non-school, tertiary, or Masters and Doctorate level; or undertaking an Australian Apprenticeship; or have Independent status, payment must go to the student or Australian Apprentice<br>For ABSTUDY students who are secondary level and have dependent status and are&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>

				<ul>				<li>
the parent</li>
				<li>
the private board provider, if requested by the parent</li>
				<li>
the student, if requested by the parent</li>
				<li>
the student, if the student is not benefiting from the allowance because the parent uses it for other purposes, for example, gambling, alcohol</li>			</ul>
			<li>
under 16 years old, the payee is one of the following&#58; </li>
				<ul>				<li>
the parent</li>
				<li>
the boarding school, if requested by the parent</li>
				<li>
the private board provider, if requested by the parent</li>
				<li>
the boarding hostel which is a signatory to the Standard Hostels Agreement, if requested by the parent</li>		</ul>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Group schedules&#58;</strong> This allows Services Australia to send payments to an organisation (for example, a nursing home). It is commonly used for customers who are in aged care</li>
		<li>
<strong>Payment nominee&#58;</strong> This allows the agency to send payments to a nominee. It is commonly used for customers who have limited mobility, cannot budget, are very young, or are in aged care (for example, Protective Commission, Power of Attorney, Guardian). To be <a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-04090010-01.html">appointed a payment nominee the customer must complete the Authorising a person or organisation to enquire or act on your behalf (SS313) form</a></li>
		<li>
<strong>Customers who are overseas&#58;</strong> Customers living long term overseas have a separate process for payment via an International Citibank process, depending on the country in which they are living</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Family assistance payments (for example, Family Tax Benefit) can only be deposited into an Australian bank account every 2 weeks</li>
			<li>
If a former family assistance customer is entitled to arrears (for example, from reconciliation) but has moved overseas and closed their Australian bank account, Centrelink International Services (CIS) staff can issue a one-off payment to an overseas address by <a href="../payment-delivery/103-04020010-01.html">a one-off payment or arrears</a>. A one-off payment can also be used to issue payments to overseas estates and for certain other payments where no alternative option is available.

<p>Customers are required to provide bank account details as part of their claim lodgement. Where customers do not have a bank account, a temporary exemption of 28 days can be considered, whilst they are in the process of obtaining their bank account details. If the customer has provided savings investment details which would show the customer has financial institution accounts, an exemption must <strong>not</strong> be granted.</p>

<p>During this 28 day period, a direct credit exemption reason may be coded, but no payment will be issued to the customer as payments by cheque will no longer be issued. If the customer is in severe financial hardship, other payment methods must be explored.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the customer has not provided bank account details <strong>by the end of</strong> the 28 day period, and an extension of the temporary exemption has not been given, the payment will be suspended with a reason No Payment Destination Details (PDD) at the end of the 28 day period</li>
		<li>
If, after the customer's payment is suspended, the customer provides the required bank account details <strong>within</strong> the 13 week period, the payment will again become payable to the customer from the day after their last payment period end date, where they are still eligible for the payment</li>
		<li>
If, after the customer's payment is suspended, the customer provides the required bank account details <strong>after</strong> the 13 week period, the payment will again become payable to the customer from the day on which the details are provided (assuming no other provision of the social security law operates to make the payment not payable to the person). However, if the customer's payment has already been cancelled, a new claim will be required. Depending on when the customer lodges that claim and which start day provision is applicable, the new claim may commence as early as the date the details are provided<br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> ABSTUDY payments may be payable from the suspension date as there is no closing date for acceptance of additional information.
