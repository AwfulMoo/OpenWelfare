<p>New Payments Platform (NPP) is the preferred method of delivery for urgent payments.</p>

<p>Payment by Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) or direct credit will delay the customer's access to the payment by 1 to 2 business days.</p>

<p><strong>NPP</strong></p>

<p>If the customer’s account is reachable via the NPP</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the payment will deliver to the customer’s account immediately, regardless of the time or day of request</li>
		<li>
but the payment fails to deliver, it will automatically re-issue via RTGS if available, or via direct credit</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the account is not reachable via NPP, RTGS will be available.</p>

<p>Payments should only be made by NPP or RTGS when one regular payment has been made to the account.</p>

<p><strong>RTGS</strong></p>

<p>Opening hours are weekdays 8&#58;00 am - 3&#58;30 pm (Victoria/NSW time), excluding national public holidays observed on the same day in both Sydney and Melbourne.</p>

<p>If the RTGS activity is completed after 3&#58;30 pm (AEST) (including QOL), the payment will not issue until the next working day, from 9am. If payment is to the smaller banks and credit unions, it may take up to 2 working days to go into the customer's account.</p>

<p>When offering RTGS, make sure the customer understands their bank may charge a fee for processing the payment, and timeframes vary between banks. Services Australia does not have details of timeframes or fees. The customer will need to negotiate any fee with their bank.</p>

<p><strong>Direct credit</strong></p>

<p>The expected delivery date will be&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
1 working day for payments made via the Newstart System (NSS)</li>
		<li>
2 working days for payment made via all other systems</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Overdrawn accounts</strong></p>

<p>If the customer advises the account is overdrawn, it is their choice whether or not payment is made to the account. Tell the customer that&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the bank may retain some or all of the overdrawn amount; and</li>
		<li>
it will take longer for the payment to be available as manual processing may be required by the bank</li>
		</ul>

New Payments Platform (if available)</li>
