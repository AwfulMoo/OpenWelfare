<p>Job seekers aged 55 to 59 (inclusive) who are within the first 12 months of receiving their current income support payments (including suspension periods of up to 3 months), can choose to fully meet their <a href="../job-seekers/001-09000000-01.html">mutual obligation requirements</a> by undertaking&#58;</p>

30 hours per fortnight of paid work, or</li>

30 hours per fortnight of a combination of paid work and approved voluntary work, <strong>at least 15 hours of which must be paid work</strong></li>
		</ul>
<p>After receiving their current payment for a 12 month period, these job seekers may fully satisfy their requirements by undertaking 30 hours or more per fortnight of any combination of approved unpaid voluntary work and suitable paid work or self-employment. This includes solely through approved unpaid voluntary work.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">

<p>Job seekers under 55 and those with a PCW can partially meet their requirements by undertaking voluntary work only if their Employment Services Provider decides that voluntary work would improve the job seeker's employment prospects.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Principal carer job seekers under 55 getting JobSeeker Payment (JSP), Youth Allowance (YA), Parenting Payment (PP) or Special Benefit (SpB) can fully meet their requirements by undertaking voluntary work, or a combination of voluntary work and other paid work or study, of at least 30 hours per fortnight.</p>

<p>This can only be approved by their Employment Services Provider or the Digital Services Contact Centre (for Workforce Australia – online job seekers), and only if the job seeker lives in a poor labour market, has limited training opportunities available locally and there are significant vocational benefits to the voluntary work.</p>

<p>The job seeker is not automatically suspended from Employment Provider Services while they are 'meeting' their requirements by doing these activities and must stay connected to their provider, and continue to attend regular provider appointments.</p>

<p>The job seeker must still be available to accept suitable paid work, or to accept offers of additional hours of suitable paid work that fit around any study, and is appropriate for their caring responsibilities. The job seeker must also accept all referrals to suitable job interviews while doing the activity.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> for principal carers with a dependent child (unless otherwise requested or agreed by the principal carer), activities and other requirements should be scheduled to occur during school hours, that is, generally between 9&#58;00am and 3&#58;00pm during school terms.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Connection_with">Connection with Employment Services Provider</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>If voluntary work is approved as part of a new claim for an income support payment, the job seeker still must be connected with an appropriate Employment Services Provider and has to attend their initial appointment.</p>

<p>All job seekers can participate in voluntary work as a voluntary activity, however this may not always fully meet their mutual obligation requirements and the job seeker may need to participate in additional activities. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> do <strong>not</strong> update the Job Plan if the customer is a Disability Employment Services (DES) participant.</p>

<p>Services Australia can approve the activity for the job seeker if it meets all the requirements to be considered an approved activity. Once the approved activities are recorded on the job seeker's record and the job seeker is fully meeting their requirements through voluntary work, details are sent to the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, the job seeker will be automatically suspended from their <a href="../job-seekers/001-02060000-01.html">Employment Services Provider</a>. While a job seeker is suspended from Employment Provider Services, they will be fully meeting their requirements.</p>

<p>These job seekers are not required to attend Employment Services Provider appointments unless it is to refer the job seeker for a job or job interview. However, they must stay connected to their Employment Services Provider, be available for suitable paid work, accept offers of additional hours of suitable paid work, and must accept all referrals to suitable job interviews while doing voluntary work.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>For voluntary work to be an approved activity, the organisation must be approved as a <a href="../job-seekers/001-02010040-01.html">voluntary work organisation</a> by Services Australia and included in the <a href="../job-seekers/001-09070060-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Intranet_links02">Local Activities Database (LAD)</a>.</p>

<p>The job seeker must complete a Voluntary Work - Verification of Approved Voluntary Work (SU462) form to seek approval to do voluntary work as an approved activity.</p>

<p>Regardless of the circumstances in which it is undertaken, voluntary work must&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
occur without payment other than for out of pocket expenses</li>
		<li>
have a community focus</li>
		<li>
not be undertaken in the job seeker's own home</li>
		<li>
not primarily promote a particular religious or political view</li>
		<li>
not involve working for the job seeker's (or a family member's) own organisation</li>
		<li>
not involve violence towards people or damage to property</li>
		<li>
not undertake tasks which would normally be done by a paid employee, including a casual or part-time paid employee</li>
		<li>
not reduce hours usually worked by a paid employee or reduce overtime of an existing employee</li>
		</ul>
<p>Voluntary work organisations must provide evidence of their 'not for profit' status and appropriate insurance cover for both Public Liability and Personal Accident when submitting a Voluntary Work - request for Organisational Approval (SU461) form. The timeframe for completing an assessment depends on when the organisation provides the necessary evidence. Service Officers can ask about the status of an organisation's assessment by contacting the Voluntary Organisation Team.</p>

<p>Where an organisation is not <a href="../job-seekers/001-02010040-01.html">approved as a voluntary work organisation</a>, Service Officers should advise job seekers they can start voluntary work but it will <strong>not</strong> contribute to their requirements. To continue getting their income support payment, the job seeker must continue to meet their requirements by doing the approved activities, and continue going to all compulsory appointments. The job seeker must also be willing to enter into a new Job Plan and agree to suitable activities if requested.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the job seeker must attend a 'base' or like place, and is participating in a work-like activity for the duration of their time on call, these hours may count towards their voluntary work hours.</p>

<p>If the job seeker is going about their daily life, without participating in any work-like activity while on call, these hours cannot be counted towards their voluntary work hours.</p>

<p>If Services Australia is approving voluntary work for job seekers 55 years or older who fully meet their requirements, any previous compulsory activities the job seeker was required to do, must be updated on the job seekers record.

However, someone whose voluntary work ceases or reduces below 30 hours per fortnight for the near future is not considered to have a reasonable excuse.
