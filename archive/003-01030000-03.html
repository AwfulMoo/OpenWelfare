<p>However, to avoid customers claiming unnecessarily, before starting an ACC check if the customer meets the residence requirements.</p>

<p>The customer <strong>does not </strong>need to be <strong>present </strong>in Australia at the time of making their claim.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Check if the customer is a legal permanent Australian resident or holds a visa that qualifies them for AGDRP/DRA. Visas, and in some circumstances Australian citizenship, will show on the Legal Residence Details (<strong>RSLEG</strong>) screen. To check if a visa is a permanent visa, see <a target="_blank" href="https&#58;//guides.dss.gov.au/social-security-guide/9/2">Social Security Guide, Chapter 9.2, Visa subclasses and payment eligibility for visas issued after 01/9/1994</a> </li>

have had claims previously rejected or withdrawn, there are inconsistencies in the information provided for the ACC, and more evidence has been requested</li>

have contact phone numbers that are currently linked to other customers</li>

have AGDRP/NZ DRP claim/s for the same event previously rejected as they did not meet the definition of ‘adversely impacted’ and their new claim is giving different impact reasons</li>

have DRA/NZ DRA claims for the same event previously rejected as they did not have income below the AWOTE or the reduction in income was not as a direct result of the disaster event and they are now giving different income amounts to those previously declared or changing how their income was impacted by the disaster</li>

<p>If possible, the claim should be processed without holding for evidence, noting that there are some types of evidence that must be provided, (for example, Mod DP) to correctly link a record or for NZ DRA the evidence of Australian tax participation. As the customer undertakes a declaration via the ACC, this will allow the claim to be finalised without holding for evidence unless absolutely necessary. </p>

<p>If evidence is needed, encourage the customer to <a href="../self-service/133-04060000-03.html">upload documents</a> via the <a href="../self-service/133-04060000-01.html">Upload Documents Service</a> the same day to minimise delays in processing their claim.</p>

<p>ACC may not identify all evidence required to support the DRA/NZ DRA claim.  Review the income advised by the customer in the claim history and compare this to the <strong>Tasks</strong> outstanding to ensure all appropriate evidence has been requested. </p>

		<ul>		<li>
Personal Income Tax Return for Director/Shareholder of a Company/Trust</li>
