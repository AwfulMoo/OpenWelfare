<p>Changes in care arrangement can be a very emotional life event, especially where there is a disagreement about care or it is not occurring in line with a written care arrangement. Be considerate and sensitive to the customer’s experience when discussing and explaining care changes.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Use open ended questions to establish and clarify change in care details including date of event and pattern of care, such as </p>
		<ul>		<li>
What is the actual care that is occurring?</li>
		<li>
When did the change actually occur?</li>
		<li>
When did you last have overnight care?</li>
		<li>
Why did the care change?</li>
		<li>
How was the care change discussed with the other parent?</li>
		<li>
Who is aware of the arrangements?</li>
		<li>
Which child/ren does the change relate to?</li>
		<li>
Is the change intended to be permanent?</li>
		<li>
If the care change is temporary, what is the period of the change?</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p>Confirm with the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the details of the change in care, just discussed</li>
		<li>
the date the change applies from</li>
		<li>
whether the care had been/is occurring in accordance with a court order or written care agreement</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p>Discuss with the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
any impacts on the assessment and the amount payable</li>
		<li>
the facts the decision will be based on</li>
		<li>
options if they disagree with the decision</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p>If a customer reports a change in care that relates to a one-off event, what constitutes a change to the pattern of care will depend upon the individual circumstances of the case. See the <a href="../separated-parents/277-03040010-04.html">References</a> page for a link to the Child Support Guide 2.2.2&#58; Care Determinations &amp; Changes in Care - Change in pattern of care.</p>

<p>Explain to both customers what a change in care is. Advise them the change in care decision is Services Australia’s decision about the amount of care to be used in their child support assessment. The agency does not determine where the child should live or any custody arrangements. The agency reflects the percentage of care of the child that each parent actually has, or the percentage of care established by a written care arrangement. A <strong>care event</strong> is a night of care or several consecutive nights of care that follow a recurring pattern. Confirm the date of event. Future changes in care cannot be taken into account and a decision cannot be revoked unless a new care event has occurred.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If a care decision will result in the receiving parent having a care percentage of less than 35% for a child, check if a child support agreement applies to the child. If an agreement applies, transfer the customer to the <a target="_blank" href="../utils/CustomerReferralGuidelines/Customer-Referral-Guidelines.html?agreement-court-order-received-or-variation.html">Agreements and Court Orders</a> team to discuss the impact on their agreement.</p>

<p>If care is being notified more than 26 weeks after the date the care changed, check if a care decision may result in a care terminating event. If so, contact both customers to ask if they wish to apply for a new child support assessment, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-03040010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Gather_informat_Step08">Step 8 in Gather information and determine likely percentage of care</a> table. </p>

<div class="showcont">


<p>Advise the customer that unless the reported care change results in a change in the cost percentage, there will be no effect on the assessment and a new care determination may not be made. This is because under Section 54H of the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 (see the <a href="../separated-parents/277-03040010-04.html">References</a> page for a link to legislation), a new determination is not required if a material difference to the assessment is not made.</p>

<p></p>

<p>When deciding whether to investigate a care decision that will not affect the cost percentage, consider whether&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the notifying customer seeks to have the change reflected, despite understanding it will not affect the cost percentage, or</li>
		<li>
the care is based on a written care arrangement, or</li>
		<li>
the care has ceased to be in line with a written care arrangement, or</li>
		<li>
there are other circumstances that warrant making a care decision. Circumstances that may warrant further consideration include </li>
			<ul>			<li>
if the notification is for an increase to the other party’s care</li>
			<li>
a history of escalations, objections and dissatisfaction, or </li>
			<li>
Family and Domestic Violence issues</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>If none of the above circumstances exist, make a refusal decision under s54H or s54HA. </p>

<p>If making a care refusal decision use reject functionality in Cuba and record the reason for decision. Send the automatically generated refusal/rejection letters to explain&#58;</p>
			<ul>			<li>
the reported care change has been refused as it would not affect the child support assessment, and </li>

the customer’s objection rights</li>

<p>Ask the customer if they are a current or past Centrelink customer.

<p>The term 'likely' means information gathered from the initial customer only. Identify the date of event by asking the customer what circumstances led to the change in care. When identifying the date of event, consider whether the care that is actually occurring for the child has changed.</p>

<p>Do<strong> not </strong>pend a care change if a determination relating to this care event has already been made (original care decision, objection or appeal). Provide customers with options to seek review of the decision(s).</p>

<p>The date of event is either&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the date both customers confirm the actual care change occurred</li>
		<li>
a date determined by Child Support based on the information and evidence provided by both customers</li>
		<li>
the date customers made a new care arrangement for example the made on date for a new court order</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the date of event used to record the care change will be tentative until the other customer has been contacted.</p>

<p>Questions that may assist in determining the likely date of event include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
which child does the change relate to</li>
		<li>
what date did the care/pattern of care change</li>
		<li>
what caused the change in care</li>
		<li>
was the care change discussed with the other parent</li>
		<li>
is the change intended to be permanent</li>
		<li>
if the care change is temporary, what is the period of the change</li>
		</ul>
<p>If a one-off care event is missed that is likely to be made up/the care is likely to resume to the standard pattern, this means a care change may not have occurred.</p>

<p>If unable to determine the date of event, see Step 2 in the Investigate change in care table in <a href="../separated-parents/277-03040020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Investigate_cha_Step02">Investigation of change in child support care (post 1 July 2010)</a>. </p>

<p>A care period is generally the 12 month period starting from the date of event. In some circumstances, a shorter or longer care period may be appropriate, however judge each case on its own merits. If determining a care period other than 12 months, seek technical support. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-09140000-01.html">Technical support in Child Support</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Care periods longer than 12 months</strong></p>

<p>A care period of more than 12 months may be appropriate where the care arrangement follows a cycle over a period greater than 12 months, for example every 2 years.</p>

<p>See <a href="../separated-parents/277-03040010-05.html">Resources</a> page for examples of care periods longer than 12 months.</p>

<p><strong>Care periods shorter than 12 months</strong></p>

<p>A care period of less than 12 months might be appropriate where the pattern of care will gradually change over definable periods in a specific and measurable way, for example one parent is to increase their care by one day per week every 3 months over the upcoming period.</p>

<p>A shorter care period may also be appropriate where a carer has unexpectedly gained 100% care of a child for a temporary period (generally 4 weeks minimum). In these situations, the Registrar will determine the care over a short care period related to the unexpected circumstance and make a <strong>one-off block of 100% care</strong> determination.</p>

<p>See <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-03040010-05.html">Resources</a> page for examples of care periods shorter than 12 months, and <a href="../separated-parents/277-03040000-04.html">References</a> page in Change in child support care levels (post 1 July 2010) for further information.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> tell the customer Child Support will not give effect to the future events until they notify the change has occurred. If neither customer advises of the subsequent change, the existing percentage of care will continue.</p>

<p>Ask the customer to provide the pattern of care based on what they actually expect to occur during the 12 month care period. In most cases, care is determined by the actual care each parent has. Where a pattern has been established in the past and the Service Officer is satisfied that it will continue in the future, use that pattern to determine the likely percentage of care for the care period.</p>

<p>If the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
requests that care be calculated in a form other than nights, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-03040030-03.html#bp03_tbl_Calculate_and_d_Step02">Step 2 in the Calculate and determine care percentage</a> table in Child support care outcomes and decision making (post 1 July 2010)</li>

<p>Questions that may assist in determining the likely percentage of care include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
have you and the other parent established a pattern of care for the child</li>
		<li>
how many nights do you and the other parent expect to care for your child over the 12 month care period from the date the care changed</li>
		<li>
how did you calculate the expected care (for example, is there a pattern of care)</li>
		<li>
do you or the other parent provide extensive care during the day but little or no overnight care? See <a href="../separated-parents/277-03040030-03.html#bp03_tbl_Calculate_and_d_Step02">Step 2 in the Calculate and determine care percentage</a> table in Child support care outcomes and decision making (post 1 July 2010) - Care other than in nights</li>
		<li>
what is the care based on currently</li>
		<li>
are there any court orders, parenting plans, or written agreements for a different amount of care and what was the commencement date of that arrangement</li>
		<li>
are either you or the other parent trying to enforce this</li>
		<li>
is the other parent likely to agree that these are the new care arrangements</li>
		</ul>
<p>If there is a written care arrangement to which the parents are no longer adhering. Establish whether the parent with the reduced care is or has taken reasonable action to comply with the care arrangement. If so, see <a href="../utils/CustomerReferralGuidelines/Customer-Referral-Guidelines.html">Customer Referral Guidelines</a>.</p>

<p>Cuba will automatically calculate the percentage of care used in the assessment when the number of nights care has been entered into the Care window.</p>

<p>There may be occasions when Service Officers need to manually calculate the percentage of care, or explain how the figures were calculated, as percentages of care calculations have special rounding rules.</p>

<p>Percentage of care = (number of nights / 365) x 100</p>

<p>To calculate a percentage of care the following special rounding rules must be applied (to ensure the total equals 100%). If the percentage of care is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
below 50%, round the number down to the next whole percentage</li>
		<li>
50% or more, round the number up to the next whole percentage</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where each customer has a care percentage of 50%, record the payee as having 50% care, see the <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-30010060-01.html">Care Cuba Process Help</a>. Do not record this as a number of nights. Cuba will automatically change this to show the payee has 51% care and the other party has 49% care. The <strong>Care Reported as 50% </strong>checkbox will be automatically set by Cuba and a care percentage of 50% transferred to Centrelink.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> covering letters to customers who share 50% split care will indicate both parties have 50% care of the child, however the assessment notice will show 51% or 49%. This has no impact on the assessed rate as the same cost percentage is used.</p>

<p>See the <a href="../separated-parents/277-03040010-05.html#bp05090000_Percentage_of_care_">Resources</a> page for examples of percentage of care (special rounding rules).</p>

<p>When Child Support or Centrelink are advised of a care change and determine a new care percentage, the actual Date of Event (DOE) and the date of notification (DON) are recorded. Child Support and Centrelink use these dates to determine when the new care determination affects the child support assessment and FTB eligibility. <a href="../separated-parents/277-03040010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Gather_informat_Step12">Go to  Step 12</a> for further details on FTB (Centrelink) date of effect rules.</p>

<p><strong>Care advised within 28 days</strong></p>

<p>If Child Support or Centrelink is notified within 28 days of a care change, the date of effect will be the date the care changed for both Child Support and Centrelink purposes.</p>

<p><strong>Care advised outside of 28 days </strong></p>

<p>If a care change occurred on or after 1 July 2018, or before 1 July 2018 and Child Support or Centrelink is notified on or after 30 December 2018, the new care determination will be used in the assessment from the date&#58;</p>

<p><strong>Exceptions</strong></p>

<p>There are 4 exceptions to the above date of effect rules when care is notified outside of 28 days&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Interim care determinations </strong>– when care changes within an interim care period a new care determination cannot take effect until after the interim care period ends. If a care determination would otherwise take effect within the interim period, it will take effect from the day after the interim care period ends. Different rules apply to the first care change notified after the end of an interim period but before the end of the maximum interim period</li>
		<li>
<strong>Below regular care determinations</strong> – when a below regular care determination is made and the Registrar was advised within a reasonable period of time, the care determination takes effect from either&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
 the date a parent ceased a pattern of care, or</li>
			<li>
the date a pattern of care that was not established is first used in the assessment </li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>WA Ex-nuptial children</strong> – if the change occurred before 1 July 2018 and the notification date is outside 28 days and <strong>prior</strong> to 15 May 2019 the effective date for all carers is the date of notification</li>
		<li>
<strong>WA Ex-nuptial children</strong> – if the change was late notified after 14 May 2019, the system must be enhanced to treat these customers correctly. <a href="../separated-parents/277-03180000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Late_care_chang_Step">Late care change</a></li>

		</ul>
<p><strong>Terminating events</strong></p>

<p>When a change in care causes the assessment to end (terminating event), the assessment will end from the date the care changed. </p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> prior to 1 July 2018 a child moving from the care of 1 party to another was not a terminating event. If the care was notified&#58;</p>

the customer should ensure their Centrelink relationship and income details are correct to reduce the likelihood of incorrect Centrelink benefits or payments occurring when the care decision is transferred </li>
