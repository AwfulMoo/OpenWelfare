as a lump sum, treat the <strong>contract income</strong> as a remunerative lump sum that can be held as income for up to 52 weeks</li>

<p>If <strong>commission</strong> income is received by employees&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
periodically, as a wage or retainer, treat the commission income as employment income</li>
		<li>
as a lump sum, it is coded as employment income and assessed from the Entitlement Period Start Date (EPSD) of the period in which it is paid for the period it represents, up to a maximum of 52 weeks. For example, commission income paid for work done over April, May and June (1 April to 30 June) is assessed for 91 days, frequency would be LOP</li>
		</ul>
<p>The table on the <a href="../business-and-employers/043-03050030-05.html">Resources</a> page explains how to assess commission income for employees after 7 December 2020.</p>

<p>No deductions can be made for expenses.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when an employee, such as a taxi driver, has takings including Goods and Services Tax (GST), the amount of GST is not considered income if the amount is remitted to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). This is similar to the treatment of business income where GST is forwarded to the ATO.</p>
