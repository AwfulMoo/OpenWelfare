<p><strong>Across states&#58;</strong> FTB customers sharing the care of a child across state borders would receive Schoolkids Bonus based on their child’s age and the customer's state of residence. In some situations this would result in different rates of Schoolkids Bonus being paid.</p>

<p>A Schoolkids Bonus (SKB) debt could arise if the FTB customer was not entitled to the payment for any reason. This includes a retrospective assessment where it is determined that they were not entitled to the payment already received for any relevant bonus test day.</p>

<p>For example, the customer is paid for the child for bonus test day of 1 January 2014. They then advise the child left care on 29 December 2013. They are not entitled to FTB Part A or SKB payment for bonus test day 1 January 2014.</p>

<p>FTB customers who lose FTB eligibility as a result of FTB <a href="../families/007-11010110-01.html">non-lodger processing</a> will also lose their entitlement to SKB payments for the bonus test days in the relevant financial year. See <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-03080000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Debts_and_reass_4">Item 4</a>.</p>

<p>If FTB Part A entitlement is lost&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
on a date<strong> after</strong> the relevant bonus test day, a debt is not raised, e.g. SKB is paid for 1 January 2016 and the FTB customer then advises the child left care on 6 January 2016</li>
		<li>
retrospectively, on a date<strong> on or before</strong> an SKB bonus test day, the FTB customer is not entitled to any SKB paid and the SKB will be raised as an overpayment (this may not apply where FTB is cancelled retrospectively due to a Youth Allowance backdated claim)</li>
		</ul>
<p>If SKB is paid to an FTB customer for a child for a bonus test day and the child then claims and is granted a qualifying income support payment (ISP) for a period covering the bonus test day, see <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-03080000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Eligibility_for01_10">Item 10 in Table 3</a>.</p>

<p>Debts are to be raised as standalone SKB debts as it is a separate payment, not a component of FTB. SKB debts should not be combined with family assistance debts, e.g. reconciliation or FTB qualification debts.</p>

<p>SKB debts can be recovered from an FTB top up or through withholding of ongoing FTB fortnightly payments.</p>

<p>The SKB may be used to offset family assistance debts.</p>

<p>Schoolkids Bonus (SKB) is impacted by FTB reconciliation outcomes.</p>

<p><strong>For 2013 and 2014 bonus test days</strong></p>

<p>To maintain SKB entitlement, a person must remain entitled to FTB Part A at reconciliation. If entitlement to FTB Part A is lost at reconciliation for any reason, an automatic SKB debt is raised. SKB debts may be recovered from an FTB top-up.</p>

<p>An FTB customer not eligible for SKB during the financial year because their estimated adjusted taxable income was greater than the FTB Part A income test is automatically paid SKB when their FTB is reconciled and they gain entitlement to FTB Part A and all other eligibility criteria are met. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> this includes cases where income has been confirmed late, e.g. after the end of the lodgement year.</p>

<p><strong>For 2015 and 2016 bonus test days</strong></p>

<p>To maintain SKB entitlement, a person must remain entitled to FTB Part A at reconciliation and have an adjusted taxable income of $100,000 or less.</p>

<p>An FTB customer not eligible for SKB during the financial year because their estimated adjusted taxable income was greater than $100,000 is automatically paid SKB when their FTB is reconciled if their actual adjusted taxable income was $100,000 or less and all other eligibility criteria are met. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> this includes cases where income has been confirmed late, e.g. after the end of the lodgement year.</p>

<p>SKB top-ups are paid immediately and do not depend on receipt of an ATO wash-up transaction. FTB top-ups and SKB top-ups may be paid at different times.</p>

<p>A letter is not sent advising the SKB payment.</p>

<p><strong>Prohibition of FTB instalments</strong></p>

<p>If SKB was not paid during the financial year due to Prohibition of FTB instalments (PIP), the SKB will be paid when FTB reconciles and Part A eligibility is confirmed and all other eligibility criteria are met, e.g. income test. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> this includes cases where income has been confirmed late, e.g. after the end of the lodgement year.</p>

<p><strong>Debts and debt recovery</strong></p>

<p>If SKB was paid to an FTB customer during the financial year based on estimated income of $100,000 or less and their actual adjusted income for the financial year was more than $100,0000 or they were not entitled to FTB Part A on the bonus test day, an automatic SKB debt is raised. SKB debts may be recovered from an FTB top-up.</p>

<p>Single FTB customers who received an ISP for the 2014-15 and/or 2015-16 financial year had their Schoolkids Bonus (SKB) entitlement reassessed when FTB reconciliation occurred.</p>

<p>The SKB income test did not initially apply to single FTB customers on an ISP on the bonus test day due to the SKB assessment income test exemption rules for FTB instalment customers. The SKB income test did apply when FTB reconciliation occurred.</p>

<p>For most of these FTB customers, this did not change their SKB entitlement. However, for a small group who had a most recent income estimate recorded of over $100,000 an SKB debt (debt reason SIN) was automatically raised for all SKB payments made in the reconciled year. These FTB customers had to provide a <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-05030040-01.html">revised annual income estimate</a> if applicable to have their entitlements reassessed. A revised annual income estimate of $100,000 or less resulted in the SKB debt (debt reason SIN) automatically finalising as no debt.</p>

<p>If an FTB customer becomes an FTB non-lodger and a debt is raised for all FTB Part A received for the relevant financial year, the Schoolkids Bonus (SKB) payments paid for the bonus test days in the relevant financial year are also raised as a debt as a result of the loss of eligibility to FTB Part A.</p>

<p>SKB debts are raised separately to the FTB non-lodger debt as it is not a component of FTB.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
SKB debts resulting from the FTB non-lodger processing are identified as a Schoolkids Bonus Non-Lodger debt (SNL)</li>
		<li>
If the customer is no longer a non-lodger for FTB Part A for the relevant financial year and does not have an entitlement to SKB, the debt is automatically determined as an SKB qualification debt (SNE)</li>
		</ul>
<p>SKB debts as a result of FTB non-lodger processing are automatically determined and Account Payable notices automatically issued. An Account Payable notice is issued for any SKB payments they received during the non-lodger year.</p>

<p>It may be necessary to explain the FTB reconciliation result (non-lodger) as SKB entitlement is lost when FTB is cancelled. See <a href="../families/007-11010010-01.html">Enquiries about FTB reconciliation or lump sum claim</a>.</p>

<p>If FTB Part A eligibility is regained, e.g. tax returns are lodged, SKB entitlement is also regained. The SKB non-lodger debt is zeroed and finalised no debt, any resulting SKB payment adjustment is automatic. A letter is sent advising that the debt is no longer recoverable and does not need to be repaid.</p>

<p>If eligibility is lost for a bonus test day as a result of being an FTB Potential Non-lodger or FTB Non-Lodger, that bonus test day will display on the <strong>Schoolkids Bonus Explanation</strong> screen with the ineligible reason <strong>Potential FTB Non Lodger</strong> or <strong>FTB Non Lodger</strong>.</p>

<p>If an undetermined SKB qualification debt is present for a bonus test day that is subject to FTB non-Lodger processing, this debt will not be picked up by the automated processing. The debt shell will remain on the Activity List (<strong>AL</strong>) screen and will need to be actioned under existing SKB qualification debt processing guidelines.</p>

<p><strong>SKB not paid during the instalment period -SKB  top ups to late lodgers</strong></p>

<p>As SKB is a standalone payment, there are no time limitations applied to payment of SKB top-ups for customers where&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
SKB was not paid during the instalment period as the income estimate was above the SKB income limit, and</li>
		<li>
the adjusted taxable income in reconciliation is equal to or below the income limit</li>
		</ul>
<p>All other eligibility criteria must be met, including the notification of child education details before the end of the lodgement year.</p>

<p>This means SKB top-ups resulting from an over-estimate of income (over $100,000) are payable for the 2014-15 and 2015-16 financial years where actual income has been confirmed late, e.g. after the end of the lodgement year, and is $100,000 or less.</p>

<p>Schoolkids Bonus (SKB) debts created as a result of a person losing SKB eligibility as a result of FTB reconciliation or re-reconciliation were automatically determined with a debt reason code of SIN or SNE.</p>

<p>SKB qualification debts identified as a result of the FTB late lodger process were also automatically determined. In this case the SKB non-lodger (SNL) debt was zeroed and an automatically determined (SNE or SIN) debt was created.</p>

<p>The debt reason code can be viewed on the Debt List (<strong>OPDL</strong>) screen and depends on the reason for the loss of eligibility&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
SNL = SKB debt following an FTB Non-Lodger determination</li>
		<li>
SIN = SKB debt as actual income was above $100,000</li>
		<li>
SNE = SKB debt due to a loss of eligibility for a reason other than income</li>
		</ul>
<p>Automatic SKB debts (SIN, SNE and SNL) <strong>cannot be adjusted manually</strong>&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If there is a subsequent reassessment and the FTB customer regained entitlement to SKB for the relevant child for the bonus test day, the corresponding debt automatically adjusted (finalised no debt) eliminating the need for an SKB override.</li>
		<li>
If the debt did <strong>not</strong> auto-adjust, the case had to be reviewed to establish why this was occurring. E.g. if due to an SKB override, the override needed to be removed (take the override entries for the affected child and bonus test day back to 'Select An Option'). See <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-03080000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Schoolkids_Bonu_Item">Table 4</a> for override coding.</li>
		<li>
SNE debts determined before 13 June 2015 did not automatically adjust. It was only on or after this date that SNE debts automatically adjusted to changes in Schoolkids Bonus entitlement if reconciliation occurred.</li>
		</ul>
<p>SKB debts with a debt reason <strong>other than</strong> SIN, SNL or SNE did not automatically adjust. In these instances, an SKB override was needed to prevent a duplicate payment of SKB and the corresponding SKB debt needed to be adjusted or finalised no debt (FND).</p>

<p>Any change to SKB entitlement was captured on the <strong>Schoolkids Bonus Explanation</strong> screen but any auto adjustments of debts did not display. Check the Payment Summary (<strong>PS</strong>) screen and Activity Results (<strong>AR</strong>) screen to determine if an auto-adjustment occurred before referring an SKB override request.</p>

<p>From 1 January 2015, an income test applied. Eligible families and young people with an adjusted taxable income of $100,000 or less for the year in which the bonus test day occurred were paid Schoolkids Bonus.</p>

<p><strong>Exemptions</strong></p>

<p>There were some exemptions from the income test, including students who received Schoolkids Bonus and the following payments in their own right&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Disability Support Pension (DSP) Blind</li>
		<li>
Special Benefit (SpB)</li>
		<li>
certain veterans’ education allowance payments</li>
		</ul>
<p>Family Tax Benefit (FTB) customers were not exempt from the income test when assessing their eligibility for Schoolkids Bonus for a child who also received SpB or DSP (Blind). For example, a DSP (Blind) parent receiving FTB Part A for a child in school is not exempt from the income test.</p>

<p>The income test did not apply to bonus test days in the 2013 or 2014 calendar years, including assessments made for these bonus test dates after 1 January 2015.</p>

<p><strong>Actual income is more than $100,000</strong></p>

<p>A manual override was coded via the Schoolkids Bonus School Leaver Details and Schoolkids Bonus Override (<strong>!EDSL</strong>) screen for ISP customers with an adjusted taxable income above $100,000 for the year in which the bonus test day occurs.</p>

<p>This resulted in an automatic debt being raised for a Schoolkids Bonus payment made for a bonus test day in the financial year.</p>

<p>The <strong>!EDSL</strong> screen has been decommissioned. The manual debt raising process now applies. See <a href="../debts/107-02010000-01.html">Debt Identification</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Actual income is no longer more than $100,000</strong></p>

<p>If all other eligibility criteria are met, a manual payment may be made using either the One Off Payment (<strong>OOP</strong>) or Payment Adjustment (<strong>PYAJ</strong>) screen.</p>

<p><strong>Single ISP customers</strong></p>

<p>Single customers of an ISP for an entire year were not required to confirm income at the end of the financial year in the same manner as Family Tax Benefit (FTB) customers were. These cases were identified by Services Officers when, for example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
an ISP customer advised they became partnered before a bonus test day and their partner's adjusted taxable income, combined with their own, would preclude Schoolkids Bonus entitlement</li>
		<li>
an ISP customer who received Schoolkids Bonus has their ISP later cancelled due to excess income</li>
		<li>
a dependent YA student's parents' adjusted taxable income for the year in which the bonus test day falls is over the Schoolkids Bonus income threshold</li>		</ul>

<p>A Schoolkids Bonus debt could arise if the customer was not entitled to the payment for any reason.</p>

<p>At the end of the 2014-15 or 2015-16 financial years, if the ISP customer's actual income for the relevant financial year was more than $100,000 their entitlement to Schoolkids Bonus was reassessed. A manual override was previously coded to preclude payment of Schoolkids Bonus.</p>

<p>Information about the customer's income may be received from them self-identifying their actual income, staff identifying the actual income or via existing compliance processes.</p>

<p>If an amount of Schoolkids Bonus was paid under Family Tax Benefit (FTB) for the child for a particular test day and the child then claims and is granted an ISP for the period covering the bonus test day, see below.</p>

<p>If an ISP was granted to a student and Schoolkids Bonus was payable but had already been paid for the student for the same bonus test day to their parent/guardian, the Service Officer would determine if Schoolkids Bonus should be paid to the student by checking the payment destination in the student's claim.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>, the Schoolkids Bonus payment was <strong>not </strong>paid to the student. No Schoolkids Bonus debt was raised on the parent/guardian</li>
