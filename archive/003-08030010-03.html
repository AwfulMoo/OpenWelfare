<p>SpB may be paid to a child&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-08010010-01.html">who is an Australian citizen</a> or an Australian permanent resident, and</li>
		<li>
whose custodial parent is a non-permanent resident of Australia and precluded from receiving any social security payment</li>
		</ul>
<p>See <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-08010010-01.html">SpB for children who are Australian Citizen Children (ACC)</a>.</p>

<p>Obtain proof of citizenship or proof of residence to verify the child is an Australian citizen. For example, the child's birth certificate showing the resident parent’s name.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Any person <strong>born in Australia after 20 August 1986</strong> is an Australian citizen if when they were born at least one of their parents was an Australian citizen or permanent resident of Australia. This applies even if the parent who is an Australian citizen or a permanent resident had separated from the non-resident parent before the child's birth. If neither parent is an Australian citizen or permanent resident visa holder, the person needs to continue to reside in Australia until their tenth birthday when they will automatically acquire citizenship</li>
		<li>
If the child is <strong>below school age</strong> and the custodial parent can prove they have no means of adequately supporting the child, SpB may be paid to the child</li>
		<li>
SpB can only be paid to children <strong>over school age</strong> for the period they or their custodial parent are judged to be homeless or at risk of homelessness. The custodial parent must show they have no reasonable means of support and are in genuine hardship</li>
		<li>
In all <strong>ACC category cases</strong>&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
The custodial parent or responsible adult should be made the child's correspondence nominee as well as their payment nominee. This is to meet notification provisions and appropriate use of payments</li>
			<li>
The custodial parent or responsible adult needs to complete an Authorising a person or organisation to enquire or act on your behalf form (SS313). For more information, see <a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-04090010-01.html">Appointing nominees</a></li>
			<li>
The customer must be coded into the child's record</li>
			<li>
Continue to reassess the custodial parent's residence status</li>		</ul>
		<li>
When the custodial parent has <strong>no means of adequately supporting the child</strong>, referral to a social worker is strongly recommended to help determine if the child is in genuine hardship</li>
		<li>
SpB can only be granted if the custodial parent has taken all<strong> reasonable action to pursue child support</strong> from the non-custodial parent. If child support cannot be pursued due to family and domestic violence, a referral to a social worker is mandatory. The social worker should document an exemption reason on the child's record</li>
		<li>
There is a <strong>safety net for New Zealand citizens</strong> who&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
are the holders of a Special Category Visa (SCV)</li>
			<li>
arrived in Australia at any time on or after 26 February 2001, and</li>
			<li>
do not meet the definition of an Australian resident for social security purposes</li>		</ul>
		<li>
These SCV holders may be exempt from the residence requirements and able to qualify for a one-off payment for up to 6 months of either JobSeeker Payment (JSP) or Youth Allowance (YA). This is subject to other qualification requirements and applies if just before claiming, they&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
are the holder of an SCV, and</li>
			<li>
have resided in Australia continuously for at least 10 years at any time on or after 26 February 2001</li>		</ul>
		<li>
If the New Zealand custodial parent is eligible and receiving the 6 months JSP or YA, the Australian citizen child will not be eligible for SpB. The parent may be eligible for Family Tax Benefit (FTB for the child, whether or not they receive an income support payment</li>
		<li>
FTB is the most appropriate payment for SCV holders. SpB cannot be paid if the custodial parent of the child is receiving FTB to support the child. If the custodial parent is receiving FTB for the child, FTB must be cancelled if a decision is made to pay SpB to a child under this category. This is limited to non-protected SCV holders in certain circumstances</li>
		<li>
Australian citizen children granted SpB are not eligible for Child Care Subsidy (CCS)</li>
		<li>
If the child is aged 16 or 17 years, Youth Allowance may be payable if the child is not in full-time secondary study</li>		</ul>

<p>This category is generally for people who are caring for a child with a medical condition.</p>

<p>The application of SpB provisions for customers with caring responsibilities means they can <strong>only</strong> be paid SpB if <strong>all</strong> of the following are met&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they do not qualify for Carer Payment (CP), Parenting Payment (PP) or any other income support</li>
		<li>
they have no alternative means of support</li>
		<li>
they are unable to work because of caring responsibilities -the caree (child) needs constant care, and there is no other care available, <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
the person being cared for does <strong>not</strong> have sufficient funds to support or partially support the carer</li>
		</ul>
<p>A <strong>single principal carer </strong>is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
not subject to the Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Period (NARWP) for JobSeeker Payment (JSP), Youth Allowance (YA) (job seeker) and Parenting Payment Single (PPS), and</li>
		<li>
not required to have 2 or 4 years qualifying residence for PPS <strong>if</strong> they became a single principal carer of a dependent child since the start of their current period as an Australian resident</li>
		</ul>
<p>See <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-08030010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Newly_arrived_r_NMN">Item NMN</a>.</p>

<p>There should be very few times when a customer with temporary caring responsibilities needs to be paid SpB.</p>

<p>The customer needs to provide confirmation of the circumstances leading to the claim for SpB. Always obtain evidence of the need for care.</p>

<p>Explore and exhaust all avenues of support before granting the claim.</p>

<p>A <strong>social work report</strong> is not compulsory but is strongly recommended before making a decision. The social worker can explore options in the community before SpB is considered, and further assess the caring situation if required. For example, determining the carer's personal care or supervision needs, or information about the level of care or supervision and who is providing it.</p>

<p>Customers who are caring for their dependent child(ren) under normal conditions (non-medical) should be coded under category&#58;</p>

<p>A social work referral and report is compulsory for this category. See <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-12030020-03.html">Unsupported under 16 year olds to be immediately referred to a Services Australia social worker</a>.</p>

<p>This category is for when a parent, guardian or someone else has taken on the long term role of parent or guardian, but cannot provide support for the customer who is under 16 years of age. See <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-08030080-01.html">Assisting a customer aged under 16</a>.</p>

If a customer is an Unaccompanied Humanitarian Minor (UHM), referral to a social worker and the Special Benefit Helpdesk is mandatory. See the <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-08030010-05.html">Resources</a> page for Social Work Service contact details and policy helpdesk query form</li>
		<li>
Full-time students under 16 years of age need to be homeless to qualify for SpB. The definition of SpB homeless person aligns with YA Unreasonable to live at home (UTLAH). A customer can be considered homeless, although living with a parent, if the parent is judged to be homeless</li>
		<li>
Under 16 year olds who are not full-time students can be paid SpB if they are&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
independent (for example, UTLAH) and</li>
			<li>
unable to receive continuous support from a parent, guardian, or the territory, state or fAustralian government</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Family Tax Benefit (FTB) is the most appropriate payment for under 16 year olds</li>
		<li>
The responsibility for the welfare of under 15 year olds lies with state and territory welfare authorities. Refer the customer to a social worker for referral to a welfare authority to complete a protective assessment. No payment can be made until the welfare authority completes the assessment</li>		</ul>

<p>It is rare for an applicant to be assessed under the SOM category. Service Officers should consult a TPS or escalate to Level 2 Policy Helpdesk if they believe an applicant’s circumstances may reflect this category.</p>

<p>A socially marginalised customer is generally considered to be someone who&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
was unable to meet the mutual obligation and reporting requirements for JSP due to a medical condition; and</li>
		<li>
was ineligible for DSP, or because of their medical condition refused to claim DSP</li>

<p>See the <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-08030010-05.html">Resources</a> page for an example.</p>

<p>These factors, however, do <strong>not</strong> disqualify customers from JobSeeker Payment (JSP) or Youth Allowance (YA).Delegates must be aware that if there is any alternative, it is <strong>not</strong> in the customer's best interest to be paid SpB.</p>

<p>Individual customer needs can often be met through better access to rehabilitation programs, labour force programs or specialist counselling.</p>

<p>SpB must be a last resort after exploring JSP incapacity exemptions and/or eligibility for DSP.</p>

<p>When assessing eligibility for socially marginalised applicants, reports on their condition should be obtained from treating doctors and other professionals who know their circumstances. For example, psychiatrists, psychologists, occupational therapists.</p>

<p>A <strong>social work report</strong> is mandatory for this category. The social worker must complete an assessment determining&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
if there are alternatives to granting SpB (for example, if they qualify for DSP)</li>
		<li>
if there is assistance available through external agencies, and</li>

<p>This category is for Nominated Visa Holders who are of workforce age and are capable of working.</p>

<p>TPP customers are subject to Nominated Visa Holders mutual obligation requirements, based on legislation. Ensure the customer has a Jobseeker status ‘<strong>active</strong>’ (JSR/ACT) and is connected to an Employment Service Provider.</p>

<p>Some customers may be exempt from Nominated Visa Holder mutual obligation requirements if they have children under 6 years of age or have caring responsibilities. Code an exemption on the <strong>AEX</strong> screen. See <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-08050000-01.html">Mutual obligation requirements for SpB</a>.</p>

<p>Generally, the long term available funds test applies to this category. However, a Nominated Visa Holder can be paid under the short term available funds test if&#58;</p>

they are unemployed due to a seasonal closure</li>
		<li>
their employer confirms they will be re-employed, and</li>

<p>The PPV was formerly the Spouse Provisional Visa (SPV).</p>

<p>The applicant must be a holder of a PPV (subclass 309 or 820).</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
A subclass 300 visa is not a PPV. Subclass 300 is a temporary visa, and holders of this visa do not meet the residence qualification for any Social Security payment</li>
		<li>
An Assurance of Support (AoS) is no longer required for PPVs from 1 January 2012. AoS arrangements that started before 1 January 2012 will continue for the AoS period</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Newly Arrived Residents Waiting Period (NARWP)</strong></p>

<p>From 1 January 2012, holders of visa subclasses 309, 310, 820 and 826 were not exempt from the NARWP for SpB if they were the family member (usually a partner) of an Australian citizen or permanent resident who has resided continuously in Australia for 2 years. Although the NARWP for PPV starts from the application date, only the physical presence of the visa holder can be counted towards the NARWP.</p>

<p>For PPV holders, the NARWP starts from the later of&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the date the customer applies for the PPV (not the grant date), or</li>
		<li>
the date of arrival in Australia</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Change in circumstances</strong></p>

<p>If the PPV holder can demonstrate a substantial change in circumstances beyond their control, resulting in financial hardship and a reduction in available funds, they can be exempt from the NARWP to qualify for SpB. They may also be exempt from the NARWP if another qualifying residence exemption reason applies. For example, they are the family member of a refugee or former refugee.</p>

<p>A PPV holder claiming SpB due to a substantial change in circumstances beyond their control must substantiate their claim with documentation. Referral to a social worker is strongly recommended. Social workers can explore the complex change in circumstances and community support options.</p>

<p>If family and domestic violence is present, referral to a social worker is mandatory. See the <a target="_blank" href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-15000000-01.html">Family and domestic violence</a> procedure. In these cases, a social worker is to assess and document the customer's situation. Information provided by the social worker should contribute to a decision about qualification for SpB. However, the delegate, not the social worker, makes the final decision about qualification.</p>

<p>The social worker has the delegation to <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-12060010-01.html">assess Crisis Payment applications in family and domestic violence claims/situations</a>.</p>

<p>If the PPV holder is not eligible for SpB because they cannot demonstrate a substantial change in circumstances beyond their control, consider paying the partner at the single rate under Section 24 if the partner is on income support. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07120080-01.html">Treatment of a partnered person as single under Section 24 new determinations</a>.</p>

<p>Ensure a <a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-06090030-01.html">review is coded</a> to check the status of the visa and to transfer the customer to another payment when permanent residency is granted.</p>

<p><strong>Principal carers</strong></p>

<p>PPV customers who are principal carers with a youngest child aged&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
under 6 are exempt from the SpB mutual obligation requirements. Leave blank the <strong>Payable Under&#58;</strong> field on the SPL Other Details (<strong>NSOD</strong>) screen </li>
		<li>
over 6 will have partial work capacity. Code '<strong>JSP</strong>' condition in the <strong>Payable Under</strong>&#58; field on the <strong>NSOD</strong> screen</li>
		</ul>
<p>Code principal carer status on the Principal Carer Circumstances Details (<strong>PCCD</strong>) screen.</p>

<p><strong>PPV partner on Parenting Payment PP</strong></p>

<p>If the PPV customer has a partner receiving PP for the dependent children, it would not be appropriate to exempt the SpB customer from mutual obligation requirements as well. In this situation, the customer should be subject to the SpB mutual obligation requirements.</p>
