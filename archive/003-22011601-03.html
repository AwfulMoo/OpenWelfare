For a person born in Australia (or migrated to Australia) after approximately 1959, <a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-11030010-01.html">Historical Family Allowance (HFA) records may exist</a>. For help, see&#58;</li>

			<li>
If they do not have access to OLS, Service Officers should speak with their Team Leader</li>		</ul>
		<li>
For a person born (or migrated to Australia) after approximately 1988 links to a parent should exist. For example, family assistance, Child Care payments, maternity payments</li>
		<li>
The person could have been linked as a partner / nominee to a person who has previously received a payment from Services Australia</li>
		<li>
In Customer First, complete a <a class="modal-link" href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-21120238-03.html#bp03_tbl_Actions_to_prev_Conduct_">SMS/Email (SMEM) search</a>&#58;</li>
		<li>
If, after completing a SMEM search, there are concerns about a customer’s identity as the search results indicate the mobile number is being used to create multiple records, see <a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-09110100-03.html">Identity Fraud</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>If extensive checks and searches return no existing customer record, staff must make sure they are satisfied the caller is who they say they are and the information is genuine before <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07030030-01.html">adding a customer to the system</a>.</p>

<p>Create the record in the correct environment. This stops the need to complete an <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-03020000-01.html">Inter-environment change of address (ICoA)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the record is created in the incorrect environment and a claim is granted, the customer will <strong>not</strong> receive a payment. If this has occurred, contact <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-20090748-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Contact_details">Technical Peer Support</a> who must contact the Level 2 Helpdesk using the <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-20090748-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Templates">payment query template</a>.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Reason 1&#58;</strong> Customer or their <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-22011601-03.html#bp03_tbl_Common_definiti_3">immediate family member</a> were admitted to hospital due to an illness or injury </li>

		<li>
<strong>Reason 3&#58;</strong> Being affected by a separate <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-22011601-03.html#bp03_tbl_Common_definiti_4">disaster event</a></li>
		<li>
<strong>Reason 4&#58;</strong> Customer has been impacted by a state or territory health authority as the&#58; </li>
			<ul>			<li>
state or territory health authority made a decision <strong>not</strong> to process a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, <strong>and</strong></li>
			<li>
state or territory health authority advises the customer their PCR will not be processed and refers them to take a Rapid Antigen Test (RAT), <strong>and</strong></li>
			<li>
RAT was positive</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Reason 5&#58;</strong> A customer is a seasonal worker in Tasmania who incorrectly lodged a claim using the EM252 Claim for Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment form</li>
		<li>
<strong>Reason 6&#58; </strong>Processing delays with a claim previously lodged mean a customer cannot lodge a claim for a new self-isolation, quarantine or caring period within 14 days of the start date of that period</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>For reasons 1, 3 and 5 only&#58;</strong></p>

<p>Ask the customer <strong>how</strong> the reason impacted them from lodging a claim within the 14 day claiming period. For reason 5, this may be due to receiving incorrect advice from the agency, their employer or other third party agencies.</p>

<p><strong>For all 6 reasons&#58;</strong></p>

<p>Staff must consider if the period between the late claim reason and lodging the claim is reasonable. If not, the customer’s claim cannot be accepted. </p>

<p>Staff may need to consider how certain sensitive situations can impact a person over a longer period of time. </p>

<p>For example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the death of an immediate family member may cause longer term impacts for a customer. A delay in lodging a late claim could be reasonable in this instance </li>
		<li>
a customer may have been admitted to hospital due to the effects of COVID-19. They may have recovered not long after the 14 day claiming period ended however chose not to lodge a claim for another 3 months. A delay in lodging a late claim may not be reasonable in this instance  </li>
		</ul>
<p>For help, contact Technical Peer Support.</p>

<p>Does the customer’s reason meet at least 1 of the 6 reasons <strong>and</strong> is the period between the late claim reason and lodging the claim reasonable? </p>
