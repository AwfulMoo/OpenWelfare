<p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
uses strong magnetic fields to generate images used to diagnose conditions such as cancer and strokes</li>
		<li>
is especially effective on soft tissue, and</li>
		<li>
does not use ionising radiation, unlike some other imaging equipment such as x-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans</li>
		</ul>
<p>MRI is an expensive and sophisticated technology and since its introduction on the Medicare Benefits Schedule, MRI has been carefully managed through requester, provider and item level restrictions. These controls help support the provision of high quality, safe and cost-effective health care for all Australians.</p>

<p>The majority of MRI services must be ordered by specialist medical practitioners or consultant physicians in order to attract a benefit. A restricted group of procedures can also be ordered by GPs and specialist dentists.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>To be eligible for Medicare benefits, an MRI service must be provided within a diagnostic imaging practice, or the radiology department of a hospital, that offers a comprehensive range of diagnostic imaging procedures, has an <strong>eligible MRI equipment and MRI accreditation</strong>. </p>

<p>The Department of Health and Aged Care (Health) is responsible for the granting of MRI licenses which give diagnostic imaging practices eligibility to claim Medicare benefits. Agreements and eligibility may differ from site to site. Services Australia must ensure that the MRI license has been issued by Health to a diagnostic imaging practice before adding an eligible MRI to the LSPN Register. Should Services Australia receive a request to add or change the MRI details recorded at a diagnostic imaging practice, the request will need to be confirmed with Health. </p>

<p>If Services Australia receives advice from Health about MRI eligibility, Services Australia <strong>must</strong> ensure that the relevant LSPN form has been received <strong>before</strong> making changes to the LSPN register. The exception to this requirement is where MRI eligibility is transferred for a <strong>temporary period</strong> to another site. A LSPN form is <strong>only required</strong> to be completed for temporary transfers if an MRI has not previously been recorded at the temporary site and if MRI provider eligibility is required.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>To provide services on eligible MRI equipment a specialist must have ongoing participation in the Royal Australian College of Radiologists' quality and accreditation program. Failure to do so will result in the cancellation of Medicare eligibility to provide MRI services.</p>

<p>The proprietor or authorised representative of an LSPN site with an eligible MRI advises Services Australia of the specialists that are to provide MRI services. By completing these details on the relevant LSPN form the proprietor or authorised representative is confirming that the practitioners listed are specialists in diagnostic radiology, are participants in the Royal Australasian College of Radiologists Quality and Accreditation Program, and will provide MRI services on the eligible MRI equipment located at the relevant LSPN.</p>

<p>Provider eligibility is effective from the date a complete LSPN form is received by Services Australia or a future date if specified.  </p>

<p>All requests for backdating eligibility to perform MRI services are to be escalated to Provider Services Support via a Team Leader. Provider Services Support forward to the Provider Eligibility and Accreditation Section – Diagnostic Imaging and Pathology Team.</p>

<p>Regardless of the location, once an eligible MRI is replaced, the original MRI scanner ceases to be eligible. If eligibility is transferred to another location the practice is required to submit&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
an LSPN amendment form to request the removal of the MRI machine, and</li>
		<li>
a second amendment form adding the MRI machine at the new location (LSPN). This form should include a list of providers providing MRI services at this location</li>

active MRI equipment is located at the LSPN site</li>
		<li>
the provider names and numbers listed on the form are specialists in radiology with access to Medicare benefits, and</li>

the address of the provider location matches the address of the LSPN site</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p>If the provider is eligible link them to the LSPN. The system will automatically add the MRI specialty code 118 to the Provider Stem and Location</p>

<p>When an MRI provider is linked to the LSPN register, the system will check whether the LSPN address exactly matches the provider location address. If there is a match, the provider location address will be locked and cannot be amended.</p>

<p>The provider location cannot be edited until the&#58;</p>

LSPN address is amended to be different to the provider location, or</li>

<p>To prevent inappropriate claiming, whenever the specialty codes 046 or 047 are end dated, the specialty code 118 on the provider stem and provider locations will need to be end dated at the same time.</p>

<p>If an MRI provider is unlinked or end dated from an LSPN then the system will end date the 118 at the relevant provider location with the same end date.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>The Department of Health and Aged Care is required to notify Services Australia when a transfer of MRI eligibility has been granted from one LSPN site to another or to MRI equipment at the same site. Health will advise the MRI equipment details (make, model, serial number), if eligibility is for partial or full access, and the eligibility start and end dates. The MRI transfer details must be recorded on the equipment register of the relevant LSPN/s and the MRI accreditation must be current before Medicare benefits are payable. Irrespective of the location, once MRI eligibility is transferred to another MRI the original MRI ceases to be eligible. </p>

<p>Where the transfer of MRI eligibility is for a limited period Health will provide the date and details for the return of eligibility to the original site or equipment. Where ineligible MRI equipment exists at the receiving site and this equipment is receiving Medicare eligibility for a limited period, it is not necessary to end date this equipment. The ineligible equipment is not assessed for Medicare purposes and the LSPN register will allow the same serial number, make and model to be recorded where the equipment codes are different (that is, MR1, MR3 and MR4).</p>

<p>The same applies if equipment has partial eligibility and the site is getting full eligibility. The equipment with partial eligibility will retain this eligibility during and after the transfer has ceased (that is, the MBS items claimable on the partially eligible MRI can be claimed on the fully eligible MRI).</p>

<p>While an application form is not required to be completed for temporary transfer of MRI eligibility, the practice at the new site must complete a LSPN form to gain access to Medicare benefits for practitioners providing MRI services using the eligible equipment.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> for a transfer of eligibility, the MRI start date at the new site cannot overlap the end date at the previous site.</p>

<p>Ineligible MRI equipment is optional information for LSPN purposes as Medicare benefits are not payable for services provided on this equipment. Ineligible MRI equipment is not defined as ‘primary information’ for purpose of LSPN registration under the Health Insurance Regulations 2018. However, if details are provided by the practice, the equipment is to be recorded on the LSPN register.</p>

<p>The Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA) pay claims for services on ineligible MRI equipment for eligible DVA patients.  However, DVA claims do not check for an ineligible MRI at the LSPN. Providers who wish to provide DVA services on ineligible MRI equipment should contact DVA to notify them of their intention to claim. If the provider does not have a speciality code 118 (MRI) at the location, DVA will assign their own speciality code for the provider on the DVA system.</p>
