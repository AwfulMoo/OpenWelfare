<p>The compliance investigation focuses on all of the relevant facts relating to the work that the job seeker has refused and their reasons for refusing the work. These facts inform the decision on whether a work refusal failure has been committed.</p>

<p>The Service Officer must ensure all of the evidence required to make a good decision is identified and appropriately considered by&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
providing a clear explanation of the work refusal failure that is under investigation, the specific matters that need to be considered to reach a decision and the potential outcomes of the decision</li>
		<li>
identifying the facts relevant to the non-compliance event</li>
		<li>
giving the job seeker the opportunity to respond to any adverse claim that have been made against them and to disclose any further information they would like considered</li>
		<li>
making contact with the provider or employer to assist in establishing the facts, where evidence provided by the job seeker contradicts the reported non-compliance event</li>
		<li>
consultation with a specialist officer, PST-skilled social worker or Indigenous Cultural Consultant maybe appropriate to establish the impact of job seeker circumstances on suitability of work or reason for refusal. See <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-12080010-01.html">Accessing a PST-skilled social worker</a> for information on when consultation with a PST-skilled social worker may be required or appropriate</li>

<div class="showcont">


<p>A work refusal failure is only a failure under social security law if the work was suitable for the job seeker based on their circumstances at the time they refused the work. Suitability of work is based on the conditions of the position that were offered and consideration of the job seeker's circumstances such as their skills, experience, qualifications and medical history.</p>

<p>If the work refusal failure was reported by an Employment Services Provider, the suitability is expected to have already been considered by the provider. The PST-skilled Service Officer generally assumes that work was suitable for the job seeker based on the report from the provider unless further information provided during the investigation requires further investigation to substantiate the provider's assessment of suitability of employment. If the PST-skilled Service Officer determines that the work was unsuitable at the time the work was refused, a failure has not been committed and it should be rejected.</p>

<p>Job seekers who have an assessed partial capacity to work, or are a principal carer parent, are not required to accept a job offer if it involves working more than 15 hours per week.</p>

<p>If a work refusal failure has been reported, the job seeker's reasons for committing this failure must be considered.</p>

<p>Identify the main reason the job seeker refused suitable work and record this in the <strong>Compliance Investigation</strong> workflow. Matters that did not significantly and directly impact the job seeker's work refusal cannot be considered when assessing reasonable excuse.</p>

<p>An assessment of prior contact is not undertaken as part of establishing reasonable excuse. However, attempts to make contact with the provider or employer prior to the work refusal may help establish intent at the time of the failure.</p>

<p>Generally, matters within the job seeker's control would not be considered reasonable excuse. For more information, see <a href="../job-seekers/001-10040070-01.html">Assessing reasonable excuse for non-compliance with mutual obligation requirements</a>.</p>

<p>If reasonable excuse is not established, payment is cancelled and a post-cancellation non-payment period applies. These financial consequences reinforce the expectation that participation payments are only available to those who are genuine in their efforts to move into paid work.</p>

<p>For more information about non-compliance cancellation date of effects and the length of the post-cancellation non-payment period, see <a href="../job-seekers/001-18030209-01.html">Targeted Compliance Framework financial penalties and payment cancellations</a>.</p>
