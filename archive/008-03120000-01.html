<p>Unless another portability provision applies, from 1 January 2015 DSP customers can be paid outside Australia for a temporary absence of, or a number of absences totalling, 4 weeks (28 days) in a rolling 12 month period.</p>

<p>All days paid DSP while outside Australia are included in the 4 weeks, with the exception of Approved Temporary Absences .The assessment includes absences from Australia in the 12 months before the customer's date of departure.</p>

<p>Check the DSP portability calculator on the Travel Outside Australia Details (<strong>TOAD</strong>) screen. See the <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03120000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Initial_assessm_Step">Initial assessment of overseas absence for DSP customers</a> table.</p>

<p>Before 1 January 2015, DSP customers could be paid for a temporary absence of up to 6 weeks. </p>

<p>A transitional provision allowed payment to customers under the pre-1 January 2015 DSP portability provisions who&#58;</p>

booked and paid for travel outside Australia before 14 May 2014, and</li>
		<li>
the travel started on or after 1 January 2015, with the customer returning before 1 January 2016</li>

<p>A version of the 4 week portability rules applies to most International agreements, when the DSP recipient travels to a third country (not Australia or the Agreement country). For more information, see <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03120000-01.html#bp01_L2GT_Customers_paid_using">Customers paid using an international agreement</a>.</p>

<p>DSP is portable for a limited time for a temporary departure in any of the following situations. If the customer is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
departing temporarily under the <a href="../australians-overseas/061-01110010-01.html">Medical Treatment Overseas Program (MTOP)</a>, DSP is portable for the duration of the treatment</li>
		<li>
departing temporarily to undertake full time study outside Australia as part of their approved study, DSP is portable for the duration of the study (see full-time study provisions below)</li>

severely disabled and is substantially dependent on and living with a family member posted outside Australia for work. <a href="../australians-overseas/061-01050000-01.html">DSP is portable for the duration of the posting</a></li>
		<li>
departing temporarily for an Approved Temporary Absences, DSP is portable for up to 4 weeks</li>
		<li>
departing temporarily for any other reason and continues to remain an Australian resident for DSP, DSP is portable for up to 4 weeks in a rolling 12 month period</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer is leaving Australia temporarily and has not used 28 days of portability in the last 12 months, a decision can usually be made immediately over the phone. If the temporary absence will be longer, the final decision as to how long payment can continue may not be possible until more information is received (for example medical or study information). An interim decision can be made immediately until the customer supplies more information.</p>

<p>There is <a href="../australians-overseas/061-01050000-01.html">discretion to extend the period of portability</a> in very limited circumstances before DSP payments are due to cease, for example if the customer has departed temporarily and is unable to return to Australia due to unforeseen circumstances such as hospitalisation or ill health.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a customer is travelling outside Australia frequently for long periods, they may be considered to have ceased to live in Australia. If this decision is made, qualification for DSP will stop, even if the customer returns to Australia regularly, unless they are exempt from the ongoing residence requirement.</p>

DSP paid under these provisions is not subject to the proportional rate.</p>

<p>If the customer intends to have an overseas holiday before their approved study, payments will stop when the total holiday period exceeds their allowable portability period (they can be paid outside Australia for up to 4 weeks in a rolling 12 month period before the approved study period).</p>

<p>A customer may be paid for an overseas holiday before studying overseas, between overseas study periods or after an overseas study period only if the period paid DSP overseas before the holiday (including the approved overseas study period) has not or will not exceed 28 days in a 12 month period.</p>

<p>It is reasonable to allow up to 10 days total additional time (to be included as part of the approved study period), either before and/or at the completion of study, for the customer to prepare and/or finalise their affairs and travel back to Australia. Additional travel time may not be added to an overseas holiday period.</p>

<p>Any period paid DSP outside Australia due to overseas fulltime study provisions will be included in the 28 days of allowable portability in a rolling 12 month period.</p>

<p>From 1 July 2021, legislation passed to allow the discretion to extend the period of portability for customers receiving DSP, if they are not able to return to Australia within 26 weeks due to unforeseen circumstances, such as hospitalisation or ill health. This extension allows the customer’s payment to continue for an agreed period, without being proportionalised according to their <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-06030000-01.html">working life residence (WLR)</a>. It would also allow certain add-on payments to continue for the period of the extension. These add-on payments include&#58;</p>

Incentive Allowance</li>

Pharmaceutical Allowance, and </li>

		<div class="block">

<p>A customer intending to travel overseas for more than 4 weeks in a rolling 12 month period (including leaving to live in another country) may be entitled to continue receiving DSP indefinitely if they satisfy the 'no future work capacity' portability provisions. To determine this, the customer must have a medical assessment, including a Job Capacity Assessment, before their departure from Australia.</p>

<p>If they are unable or unwilling to get a medical assessment done before they leave Australia, they will not be eligible for payment under these provisions. A new medical report is generally still required even if the customer has an existing current and valid medical report, unless that report was specifically for portability purposes.</p>

<p>Make the customer aware the result of the medical assessment may be that they no longer satisfy the medical qualifications for DSP that will result in the cancellation of their DSP. For this reason, the customer may decline to have the medical assessment, in which case their portability provisions will be limited.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Generally, customers qualified for DSP under an international agreement can be paid indefinitely while they are inside the agreement country.</p>

<p>The specific rules of the agreement determine the customer's rate. Under some agreements, they will continue to receive their inside Australia rate of DSP (whether this is proportional rate or direct deduction rate) for up to 26 weeks of a temporary absence from Australia. For other agreements, the proportional rate will be paid immediately on departure from Australia.</p>

<p><strong>Transfer to an international agreement while outside Australia</strong></p>

<p>Customers receiving DSP under autonomous rules may have to transfer to an agreement (and from the date of transfer be paid a proportional rate) either&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
on departure (customers who have already used their 4 weeks in a rolling 12 month period, former resident customers or customers ceasing to be an Australian resident), or</li>
		<li>
when they have exceeded their portability period after departure (customers who remain an Australian resident but are outside Australia for more than the maximum portability period)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Generally, a customer must be considered severely disabled to qualify under an international agreement.</p>

<p><strong>International agreement rules for travel to a third country</strong></p>

<p>If a DSP recipient is paid under of an international agreement and they travel outside the agreement country, the agreement might impose its own portability rules or it may refer to autonomous portability rules.</p>

<p>If an agreement refers to autonomous rules, any DSP recipient who is paid by virtue of that agreement and who leaves the agreement country to a third country will be subject to the same time limits as an autonomous DSP recipient departing Australia.</p>

<p>This means that third country portability will generally be limited to 28 days in a rolling 12 month period, but also that third country portability may be granted if travelling for an Approved Temporary Absence or Required Duration Absence reason. For more information, see <a href="../australians-overseas/061-01090000-01.html">Portability under agreements</a>.</p>

<p>When assessing the general portability period for a person currently paid under an Agreement&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
Days the recipient was paid DSP under an Agreement, whilst they were in the Agreement country, are not counted in the 4 weeks</li>
		<li>
Days paid while outside Australia and outside the agreement country are counted in the 4 weeks</li>
		<li>
If the recipient was transferred to the agreement after leaving Australia, days paid DSP in the agreement country before being transferred to the agreement are counted in the 4 weeks</li>

<p>If a customer ceases to be an Australian resident on departure but continues to remain entitled to DSP, or receives payment under the 20 September 2000 portability rules, the basic rate of pension and the Pension Supplement Basic Amount is paid. Transitional rate customers will receive the Transitional pension rate outside Australia from the date of departure. Any add-on payments received such as Rent Assistance (RA) cancel from the date of departure.</p>

<p>If a customer continues to remain an Australian resident for DSP on departure, the Pension Supplement, or the Transitional inside Australian pension rate, will be paid for up to 6 weeks from date of departure. Other add-on payments may continue, if qualified, for a limited period. If the customer is still receiving DSP after 6 weeks absence, they will receive the basic rate of pension and Pension Supplement Basic Amount or the Transitional outside Australia pension rate.</p>

<p>The Department of Home Affairs will generally advise Services Australia when a Centrelink customer leaves or returns to Australia. The system assesses the portability of the payment, regardless of whether the customer notified or not. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> Department of Home Affairs datalink activities should not be cancelled as this may result in departures or returns not being assessed.</p>

<p>Services Australia uses the date of departure or arrival provided by the Department of Home Affairs. If adversely affected, the customer can provide evidence of alternative dates. The agency must consider applying the alternative dates if it is reasonable and results in a beneficial outcome for the customer.</p>

<p>DSP customers must advise the agency if they are leaving Australia temporarily.</p>

<p><img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> In most cases, customers can notify of their departure from Australia via the <a href="../self-service/133-04150030-01.html">Travelling outside of Australia service</a> within their Centrelink online account. If a customer's circumstances are more complex, the system will prompt them to contact Services Australia.</p>

<p>The rules regarding portability of DSP are quite complex. DSP is portable indefinitely for some customers while for others it is not payable for any absence from Australia. There have been a number of significant changes to the rules on 1 July 2004, 1 January 2012, 1 July 2012, 1 January 2013 and from 1 January 2015.</p>

<p>The Portability Script - Departures and Returns will correctly assess the customer's entitlement to payment while outside Australia and record details on the customer's record. If the customer advises in advance, the departure will still be recorded but the absence will not be assessed until the customer actually leaves Australia.</p>

<p>In all other cases, if the script is available, <a href="../australians-overseas/061-02010000-01.html">coding the absence from Australia must be done using the script</a>.</p>

<p>A letter can be sent to the customer confirming the advice and providing contact details for Centrelink while outside Australia. The option to send this letter is contained within the Portability Script.</p>

<p>A person's portability period starts on the day they leave Australia. For portability purposes, a customer is not considered to be inside Australia for any part of the day they departed Australia, regardless of the time of departure. If the customer is travelling outside Australia on a cruise, the date of departure is the date the ship leaves the last Australian port.</p>

<p>The day a customer returns to Australia is not included as part of their absence as they are considered to be inside Australia on that day (regardless of the time of return) and therefore no longer affected by portability. If they leave and return on the same day, for example airline crew, this is not considered a departure from Australia for portability purposes.</p>
