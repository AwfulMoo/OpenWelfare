<p>This document outlines information about the Australian Organ Donor Register (AODR), including how to register, intent and consent to register, age restrictions and who can donate.</p>
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GI_Government_inte"></a>
<h2 id="bp01_L2GI_Government_inte">Government intent</h2>


<p>The AODR is a national register that records people’s decisions about donating organs and/or tissue for transplantation. The register ensures that, in the event of death, the decision to donate is recorded and accessible to Authorised Medical Personnel (AMPs).</p>

<p>In November 2000 the Donor Register was first established. In January 2005, Australian State Health Ministers agreed that the AODR would become a Register of consent, enabling individuals to record their decision to become an organ or tissue donor after death. A recorded registration makes it easier for donors’ wishes to be respected.</p>

<p>In July 2005, Health Ministers agreed that the AODR would be the only national register for organ or tissue donation.</p>

<p>The twin objectives of the national program are to&#58;</p>		<ul>		<li>

Increase the capability and capacity within the health system to maximise donation rates</li>		<li>

Raise community awareness and stakeholder engagement across Australia to promote organ and tissue donation</li>		</ul>

<p>The Australian Organ Donor Register (AODR)&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
is the only national register that records peoples decisions about donating organs and/or tissue for transplantation</li>
		<li>
can be accessed 24 hours a day by AMP who have signed confidentiality agreements covering the access and use of personal information</li>
		<li>
ensures that, in the event of death, the decision to donate is recorded and accessible</li>
		</ul>
<p>For people with serious or life-threatening illnesses, organ or tissue transplantation could mean a second chance at life. More than 30,000 Australians have received transplants in the last 60 years. Improved survival rates now mean that most organ or tissue recipients enjoy many years of high-quality life after their transplant.</p>

<p>Each state and territory has different legislation in regards to organ and tissue donation. For more information, refer the customer to their state DonateLife agency. The <a href="../your-health/011-11000000-05.html">Resources</a> page provides a link to the website.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Donor Only Entitlement</strong></li>
			<ul>			<li>
not linked to a Medicare entitlement</li>

<strong>AODR Entitlement with a Medicare number supplied</strong></li>
			<ul>			<li>
linked to a Medicare entitlement (where the registrant’s Medicare card number is supplied at the time of registering or at a later date to link a donor only entitlement)</li>
			<li>
updates made to the registrant’s personal details with Medicare will automatically update their organ donor registration</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>AODR Entitlement without a Medicare number supplied</strong></li>
			<ul>			<li>
linked to a Consumer ID <strong>without</strong> a Medicare entitlement</li>
			<li>

<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Intent_register"></a>
<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Intent_register">Intent register to consent register</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>In April 2004 a national meeting of Health Ministers agreed that, in all states and territories, the expressed wishes of a deceased person regarding organ and tissue donation should be respected and given effect.</p>

<p>To support state organ donation legislation, which clearly states that the expressed wishes of the deceased should be given effect, Australian Health Ministers agreed that the AODR would become a Register of consent, rather than an expression of a wish to be a donor.</p>

<p>In accordance with the national reform package for organ and tissue donation (2008), even if a consumer has registered their wish to be a donor, their family will still be asked to give consent.</p>

<p>Registrations currently on the AODR are either intent (no signature provided – unauthenticated registration or 16 years old) or consent (signature provided – authenticated registration).</p>

<p>Occasionally the register will receive previous versions of forms including old ‘intent’ forms. To determine if an intent form has been received, look at the wording of the Organ and Tissue donation section. Consent forms will say ‘I wish to register my consent...’ and intent forms will say ‘I wish to register my willingness…’. </p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Service Officers should not answer any questions about clinical medical decisions that would normally be made by a health professional. If a caller requests more details refer them to DonateLife in their state of residence. Frequently asked questions are on the DonateLife website. See External websites on the <a href="../your-health/011-11000000-05.html">Resources</a> page.</p>

<p><strong>Organ donation</strong></p>

<p>The way in which a person dies determines whether they are able to donate organs and/or tissue.</p>

<p>In most cases, a person may only donate organs where they have been declared brain dead and are being artificially ventilated in hospital. Brain death is when blood circulation to the brain ceases, and the brain stops functioning and dies with no possibility of recovery. A series of tests carried out by 2 independent and appropriately qualified senior doctors establishes that brain death has occurred.</p>

<p>People are sometimes concerned or confused about the difference between brain death and being in a coma. A patient in a coma is unconscious because their brain is injured in some way, but their brain can continue to function and may heal. Medical tests can clearly distinguish between brain death and coma.</p>

<p>Organ donation may also be possible after a person's heart has stopped beating, referred to as 'cardiac or circulatory death', but this is less common.</p>

<p><strong>Tissue donation</strong></p>

<p>A greater number of people have the opportunity to donate tissue for transplantation than organs. Unlike organs, tissue may be stored for a period of time and tissue donation does not require the donor’s death to have occurred in the same limited circumstances as organ donation for transplantation to be successful. Eye and tissue donation usually occurs within 24 hours from the time of death. Corneas can be stored for up to 30 days and are usually transplanted within one month of donation. Heart, bone and skin tissue can be safely stored for up to 5 years.</p>

<p><strong>Living/Scientific donations and research</strong></p>

<p>The Donor Register is not for&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
recording decisions about donating organs and/or tissue for scientific research purposes, or  </li>
		<li>
the manufacture of biological medical products. Separate and specific permission is required for donated organs and tissue to be used for research purposes</li>
		</ul>
<p>Whole body donations for Medicalre research/science need to be registered with the nearest university to where the person lives.</p>

<p>The <a href="../your-health/011-11000000-05.html">Resources</a> page contains information about the AODR including Living donation contacts and contact information for the DonateLife and Services Australia website. This is where Facts and statistics can be accessed.</p>

<p><strong>Recording donation decisions in a will</strong></p>

<p>It is not sufficient to record a donation decision in a will as there are very tight time frames around when donation can occur. Delays can affect the viability of the transplanted organ. To ensure a donation decision is considered, people should register a signed consent on the Donor Register. They should also discuss their decision with their family, partner or friend.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>The removal of organs and tissue is no different to any other surgical operation and is performed by highly skilled health professionals.</p>

<p>The donor’s body is always treated with respect and dignity. The donation of organs and tissue does not alter the physical appearance of the body, nor does it affect the funeral arrangements. Sometimes delays can occur when interstate retrieval teams are involved.</p>

<p>There is no discrimination in the organ donation process. Donated organs such as the heart, lungs, liver and pancreas are matched to recipients by blood group and weight and sometimes age. The determining factors are where and how a person dies and the condition of their organs and tissue.</p>

<p>Allocation is a complex process. When an organ (other than kidneys) becomes available for donation, a DonateLife donor coordinator passes the necessary information to transplant units in that state. If there is no suitable recipient, the organ is offered to transplant units in other states and territories. This is on a roster basis that is designed to promote equity.</p>

<p>Anyone can choose to donate organs and tissue. While age and medical history will be considered, no one is too old or not healthy enough. The Donor Register ensures a person’s donation decision can be verified anywhere in Australia. There needs to be an Australian address provided to register. Overseas addresses must not be entered into the register. See also&#58; Not Resident in Australia letter.</p>

<p>Persons aged 18 years and over can register consent (or objection) on the Donor Register. See also&#58; Age restrictions on the <a href="../your-health/011-11000000-05.html">Resources</a> page.</p>

<p>A donation decision can no longer be registered via driver’s licence except in South Australia. If someone previously registered via their driver’s licence in any other state, they now need to join the national register or update details. The Donor Register is the only national donor register and is where AMPs search for organ and tissue donation decisions.</p>

<p>Even if someone has already recorded their donation wishes somewhere else, it is important to update details by registering their decision on the Donor Register. They should then have this decision linked to their Medicare record. This enables Services Australia to keep their personal details up to date.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A Power of Attorney (POA) can place a registration on the Australian Organ Donor Register (AODR) if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
POA has been granted the power to make medical, health and personal care decisions</li>
		<li>
the documentation states that the POA has authority to make medical decisions on the individual’s behalf</li>
		<li>
the documentation is listed and current in Medicare entitlement and matches the form</li>
		</ul>
<p>It is important to note that POA documents vary in each Australian jurisdiction. In addition, POAs and Authorised Representatives are specific to each individual person and the donor can chose to limit certain powers. It is important that a document is checked to ensure that placing the donor on the AODR is within the scope of powers granted. There is an AODR ‘Power of Attorney’ Letter available where a person with current eligibility&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
has a form lodged on their behalf but POA is not yet in CDMS, and </li>
		<li>
no documentation was provided</li>
		</ul>
<p>A POA is no longer valid once the donor is deceased, as the donor's family, partner or close friends will be asked to confirm that the donor's decision has not changed since registering on the Donor Register. For this reason it is not recommended that an Authorised third party signs a form on behalf of an individual.</p>

<p>Where the family of a donor wishes to obtain&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
a copy of the AODR registration form, or </li>
		<li>
documentary evidence confirming their loved one's AODR registration, Services Australia can consider requests in writing by the executor of the deceased person's estate </li>
		</ul>
<p>The request should be addressed and emailed to the Director, Registers and Customer Support. The <a href="../your-health/011-11000000-05.html">Resources</a> page contains a link to the AODR email address.</p>

<p>Services Australia does not typically provide personal registration details to third parties without legal authority, such an Executor of a deceased estate. Documentary evidence is requested to confirm the person submitting the request is the Executor of the estate or demonstrates their legal authority.</p>

<p>As the AODR section of Consumer Directory Maintenance System (CDMS) does not have the provision to enter any POA details or authorised persons. The comments section can be updated with POA details.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>As part of the national reform package for organ and tissue donation, the family of every potential donor will be asked to give their consent to donation if the situation arises. The request will be made by trained health professionals.</p>

<p>Even if someone has registered their wish to be a donor, their family will still be asked to confirm the donation decision. Family/next of kin consent is always sought before donation can proceed.</p>

<p>Where there is no&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
family </li>
		<li>
next of kin, or </li>
		<li>
authorised persons available to provide consent for donation, investigations will be undertaken. This is to confirm whether a decision (either ‘Yes’ or ‘No’) has been registered on the Donor Register</li>
		</ul>
<p>Each state and territory has their own legislation governing organ donation. All refer to a Designated Officer (DO) who provides the final written authorisation for donation to proceed. This includes consideration by a DO of&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
the donor’s expressed wish </li>
		<li>
family consent or in some states, can enable consent if there is no next of kin</li>
		</ul>
<p>Any enquiries should be referred to the enquirer’s local DonateLife Agency who are familiar with DO processes in their state.</p>

<p>The <a href="../your-health/011-11000000-05.html">Resources</a> page contains the DonateLife website. This includes fact sheet ‘How to have the discussion about organ and tissue donation’ and further information.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p><strong>System generated correspondence</strong></p>

<p>All system generated correspondence take up to approximately 14 business days to be delivered to the registrant. This includes confirmation letters of ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ registrations and replacement donor cards.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Manual outbound correspondence</strong></p>

<p>Comments must be added to CDMS for AODR letter templates sent generated from a phone call. All other manual letters should be electronically archived and commented on via PaNDA. Self-service options must be promoted in the first instance prior to actioning manual letters via a phone call. </p>

<p>Information in the <strong>comments</strong> field is visible to AMP’s who have access to the Online Enquiry System via PRODA. Comments must adhere to guidelines and may also be obtained through Freedom of Information requests.</p>

<p>Common scenarios for manual outbound correspondence via phone call to the register are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the existing registrant, third party or member of the public would like a form posted (Brochure Request)</li>
		<li>
the customer requests a donor card but has an existing intent registration (Brochure Request)</li>
		<li>
