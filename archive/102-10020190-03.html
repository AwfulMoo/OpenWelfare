Tell the job seeker to report on their next EPED so that they can receive any payment they are entitled to (for example, to access working credits, payment to remain current during the employment income nil rate period for up to 6 fortnights if they still qualify, or to be paid up to the day before they lose eligibility)</li>
		<li>
If the job seeker is a statement reporter and they want to cancel their payment immediately, tell them to report employment income immediately after cancellation, online or via Centrelink Express mobile app, to receive any outstanding partial payment.

If payment is manually cancelled and the job seeker is on variable reporting (check NSS General Information (<strong>NGI</strong>) screen) they will not be entitled to any payment after the 'authorised to date' (that is, the EPED + 1 of the last Reporting Statement they lodged). If they have received any payment after that date, Services Australia must recover it. Therefore it is important that the job seeker lodges a final Reporting Statement to avoid a debt</li>

<p><strong>Claiming and CAN CLR</strong></p>

<p>Customers must reclaim if they claimed and were paid another Income Support Payment since cancelling their JSP or YA (job seeker) payment.</p>

<p>Customers <a href="../job-seekers/001-19051501-01.html">claiming JSP</a> or <a href="../job-seekers/001-04020000-01.html">Youth Allowance (job seeker)</a> online will see a reduced question set where payments have cancelled within the last 52 weeks.</p>

<p>If the payment is CAN/CLR and then the customer claimed Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment&#58;</p>

<p>Was the customer paid PLDP?</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>, the customer must lodge a new claim if they need an Income Support Payment</li>
		<li>
<strong>No</strong>, payment can be restored, see Step 3 in the <a href="../job-seekers/001-03030030-03.html#bp03_tbl_Restoring_payme_Step03">Restoring payments for JSP and YA customers</a> table</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer states they did not request cancellation of their payment in order to claim PLDP and advises there has been fraudulent activity on their record see <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-20080418-01.html">Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Appeals and CAN CLR</strong></p>

<p>If a JSP or Youth Allowance (job seeker) payment is REJ or CAN/CLR, the customer has the same appeal and review rights as other customers who have had their payments cancelled regardless of the reason for the cancellation.</p>

<p>For more details about the different types of cancellation reasons, see <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-10010180-03.html">Cancellation, suspension and rejection reason codes for Newstart System (NSS)</a>.</p>

<p>Staff must also consider the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the customer has a partner on income support, reassess the partner's entitlement and advise of the effect of the customer's income on their partner's continuing entitlement</li>
		<li>
If the job seeker has a nominee arrangement in place (voluntary or involuntary) contact with the nominee maybe required in some instances before taking action requested by the customer. For more details see <a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-04090000-01.html">Nominees</a></li>
		<li>
Advise customer of possible entitlement to a <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-06040000-01.html">Low Income Health Care Card (LIC)</a></li>
		<li>
If applicable, request and update the <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-05030020-01.html">estimate of income for Family Tax Benefit (FTB)/Child Care Subsidy (CCS)</a>. Estimates may be given over the phone</li>
		<li>
Check if the cancellation reason needs a manual letter. If needed, issue a general cancellation letter Q134 to tell the customer&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the reason(s) for cancellation</li>
			<li>
the section(s) of the act used to make the decision, and</li>
