<p><strong>What's the COVID-19 Consumer Travel Support Program?</strong></p></td>
<td>

<p>It's a one-off grant to support travel agents and tour arrangement service providers who have lost income because of the impacts of COVID-19.</p>

<p>It's to help travel agents and tour arrangement service providers stay viable so they can keep paying refunds and credits to Australian consumers unable to travel because of COVID-19.</p>

<p>The program was announced by the Australian Government on 1 December 2020.</p>

<p>You must read the COVID-19 Consumer Travel Support Program Guidelines on the <a class="extwebsitelink" href="https&#58;//www.grants.gov.au/Search/KeywordSearch?keyword=travel+support+program">GrantConnect website</a> (grants.gov.au) before you make a claim.</p>

<p>Your business may be eligible if it had an annual GST turnover of between $50,000 and $20 million in the 2019 calendar year.</p>

<p>All claims for businesses with a GST turnover amount of over $20 million in the 2019 calendar year (or for annual BAS reporters in the 2018-19 Financial Year) will assessed by Austrade as an <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-20120223-01.html#bp01_L2GT_Exceptional_cir">Exceptional Circumstance</a> Review. </p>

<p>To be eligible, your business must also meet all of the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
lodged a 2018-19 income tax return</li>
