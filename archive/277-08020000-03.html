<p>If the application has been sent by a payee, a payer or a representative of a payee or payer, the applicant should be recorded in Cuba as the payee or the payer.</p>

<p>If the application has been sent by an overseas authority, the applicant should be recorded in Cuba as the overseas authority. If unsure that the application has been sent by an overseas authority, refer to the <a href="../separated-parents/277-08010000-01.html">Central Authority Address Listing for Child Support International customers</a>.</p>

<p>Check carefully if it appears a representative or an overseas authority has sent the application – some applications from overseas third parties acting as a representative may incorrectly appear to be from an overseas authority.</p>

<p>If the application is already recorded on Cuba, issue a unique letter to the customer advising a previous application has been registered.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
a maintenance order for a periodic amount made by a judicial authority of a reciprocating jurisdiction</li>
		<li>
a maintenance agreement for a periodic amount registered by a judicial or administrative authority of a reciprocating jurisdiction</li>
		<li>
a maintenance assessment for a periodic amount issued by an administrative authority of a reciprocating jurisdiction </li>
		<li>
arrears of periodic amounts in relation to any of the above liabilities</li>
		<li>
an Agency Reimbursement Liability (an amount that has been paid to a payee  of a child maintenance liability by an overseas authority for which the overseas authority seeks reimbursement from the payer)</li>
		</ul>
<p>For more information on the types of liabilities that can be registered with Child Support, <a href="../separated-parents/277-08020000-04.html#bp04_L2LL_Policy">References</a> has a link to the Child Support Guide 3.6.1&#58; Registrable overseas maintenance liabilities.</p>

<p><strong>Enforcement orders are not registrable</strong></p>

<p>Some jurisdictions, particularly the U.K., make enforcement orders after they have registered an Australian assessment. Enforcement orders enable the court to take action to collect the registered Australian liability if the paying parent refuses to pay. Enforcement orders are not maintenance orders and are therefore not registrable. </p>

<p>An enforcement order will usually clearly state that it is an order for enforcement (rather than a maintenance order). The enforcement order may be for a different amount than the Australian assessment as the overseas court may make its own assessment of the paying parent’s capacity to pay the registered Australian assessment.</p>

<p>If it is not clear whether the order is a maintenance order or an enforcement order, seek help from an SSO, see <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-30010620-01.html">Technical support Cuba Process Help</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Overseas court order made in response to a transmitted Australian assessment</strong></p>

<p>The order may have been made in response to a transmitted Australian assessment. The domestic laws of some reciprocating jurisdictions require the transformation of Australian assessments into judicial maintenance liabilities (court orders) to enable that jurisdiction to register and enforce it. These orders are different to overseas enforcement orders and can be registered if they are <a href="https&#58;//guides.dss.gov.au/child-support-guide/3/6/1">registrable overseas maintenance liabilities</a>.</p>

<p>The court in the reciprocating jurisdiction may set a level of maintenance that differs from the Australian assessment. </p>

<p>If the overseas order is registered, the Australian assessment will end from the day before the court order is registered. Any arrears that have accrued under the assessment up to the date that the assessment ends, will remain payable.</p>

<p><strong>Liability is registrable</strong></p>

<p>If the order, agreement or assessment is a registrable overseas maintenance liability, check the case to determine if there is a registered maintenance liability in place.  </p>

<p>The maintenance liability in the new application cannot be registered if there is a current liability registered&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
that relates to the same payer, payee and child/ren, and </li>
		<li>
the maintenance liability in the new application was made prior to that Child Support has registered </li>
		</ul>
<p>This is because Child Support only became aware of it after the current liability was registered.  However, the arrears that arose under the earlier liability can be registered.</p>

<p><strong>Liability is not registrable</strong></p>

<p>It the order, agreement or assessment is not a registrable overseas maintenance liability, <a href="../separated-parents/277-08020000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Assessing_an_ap01_Step08">go to Step 8</a>.</p>

<p>A provisional order made in a court of a reciprocating jurisdiction cannot be registered until the order is registered or confirmed in an Australian court. If the Australian court has specified a date from which the confirmed provisional order applies, then the order applies from that date.  </p>

<p>If the Australian court has not specified a date then generally Child Support will give effect to the order from the date it is confirmed by the Australian court, although it may depend on the terms of the order.

<p><strong>Canadian liabilities</strong></p>

<p>Canadian orders for child support do not include end dates. This is because child support is payable in Canada until 1 of the following occurs&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a court of competent jurisdiction determines that support should be terminated</li>
		<li>
the parties agree to end support for a particular child, or</li>
		<li>
the order states that support ends on a specific date or when a certain event takes place and that event has taken place. For example the child finishing post-secondary education</li>
		</ul>
<p>If none of the above applies enter a default end date equivalent to the date the child turns 24 years of age. Document that the end date entered is a default end date.</p>
