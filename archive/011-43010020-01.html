<p>A professional service is defined as a <strong>clinically relevant</strong> service rendered by a medical or dental practitioner, an optometrist or an eligible allied health professional.</p>

<p>A <strong>clinically relevant</strong> service is defined as a service that is generally accepted in the medical, dental, optometric or allied health profession, as being necessary for the appropriate treatment of the patient to whom it is rendered.  Medicare benefits are paid under the Health Insurance Act 1973 (the Act) for professional services in accordance with fees set out in the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS).</p>

<p>The MBS is a publication that is maintained and update by the Department of Health and Aged Care. Each professional services contained in the MBS has been allocated a unique item number.

<p>Services listed in the MBS must be rendered according to the provisions of the relevant Commonwealth, state and territory laws. The day-to-day administration and payment of benefits under the Medicare arrangements is the responsibility of Services Australia.</p>

<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Locum arrangements</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Locum arrangements occur where a locum-tenens (locum) tenders a service on behalf of another provider.</p>

<p>A locum is a provider who temporarily fulfils the duties on behalf of a provider in a practice. It is each locum's responsibility to ensure that their provider number is used on patient accounts. It is an offence to use another provider's allocated number.</p>

<p>Where a locum practices for more than 2 weeks or is at a practice for less than 2 weeks but on a regular basis, the locum should apply for a provider number for the relevant location.</p>

<p>Where either a&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
general practitioner (GP) acts as a locum for a specialist, or consultant physician</li>
		<li>
specialist acts as a locum for a consultant physician</li>
		<li>
GP acts as a locum for a principal provider</li>
		</ul>
<p>the Medicare benefit is only payable at the level appropriate for the qualifications held by the locum, for example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
GP level for GP locum</li>
		<li>
specialist level for a referred service rendered by a specialist</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Account documents</strong></p>

<p>When a locum renders a service on behalf of another provider, the account documents must indicate it is a locum service either by the word 'Locum' or the letters 'LT' (Locum Tenens).</p>

<p>The account must also include both the&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
locum's name and provider number (and their address if required)</li>
		<li>
name, address and provider number of the doctor on whose behalf the locum is acting</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>PAYP lines</strong></p>

<p>A pay provider (PAYP) line is used when an account indicates that the service(s) was performed by a locum, for example, 'locum' or 'LT'. A PAYP line must be keyed regardless of whether a paid or unpaid account is involved.</p>

<p>Keying a PAYP line ensures that Medicare benefits are correctly assessed and made payable to the provider for whom the locum is acting.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> for quality control purposes, locum details must be present for a PAYP line to be keyed.</p>

<p><strong>New referrals</strong></p>

<p>New referrals are not required for acting locums. Referrals to a provider in the practice are accepted as applying to the locum.</p>

<p><strong>Initial attendance</strong></p>

<p>Medicare benefits are not payable at the initial attendance rate for an attendance by a locum if the provider being replaced has already performed an initial attendance in respect of the particular instrument of referral.</p>
