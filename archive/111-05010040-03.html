When customers call Services Australia 13 numbers, the first thing they will hear is an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) service which will announce that this is Services Australia - Centrelink</li>
			<ul>			<li>
This means that when Service Officers answer the phone, it is no longer necessary to announce the name of the agency</li>
			<li>
Customers will also have the opportunity to update or confirm their phone number within the IVR</li>		</ul>
		<li>
When answering a call the Service Officer can use any of the best practice greeting phrases or an appropriate greeting of their own&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
 i.e. <strong>'Hello, this is [Service Officer], can I please start with your name?'</strong></li>		</ul>
		<li>
Service Officers who receive direct calls where the callers do not hear an IVR service should answer the phone&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
'<strong>Services Australia,</strong> <strong>this is [Service Officer], can I please start with your name</strong>?...' or a similar variation to the standard greeting, and offer assistance</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Staff are <strong>not</strong> required to introduce their location</li>
		<li>
<a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-04110000-01.html">Authenticate the Centrelink customer</a> or establish the caller's right to enquire</li>
		<li>
Check <strong>Customer Overview</strong> for any required action for checking/updating the customer’s phone number or that the customer has confirmed or needs to update their family income estimate. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-05030020-01.html">Updating income estimates for the current financial year</a></li>

<p>Provide a professional presentation in all dealings with customers&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
do not make derogatory comments about Centrelink procedures, systems or staff</li>
		<li>
be courteous, respectful, and use a pleasant and varied tone of voice</li>
		<li>
do not project personal feelings, attitudes or opinions</li>
		<li>
never behave in a judgmental or patronising manner – always be impartial, in line with the APS values</li>
		<li>
show a caring attitude by listening and responding to the customer's concerns, giving the customer full attention</li>
		<li>
reassure the customer that they are being listened to by making appropriate active listening responses</li>
		<li>
be aware that cultural and language differences may affect the way in which callers present their circumstances and the way they interpret them</li>
		<li>
be aware that medical conditions or disabilities may adversely affect the clarity of the customer's conversation and make allowances for this</li>
		<li>
silences during phone calls are seldom interpreted positively. If the silence is for concentration, advise the caller appropriately</li>
		<li>
use the caller's name during the conversation. Most people will prefer the respect implied by the use of a title such as 'Mr', 'Mrs' or 'Ms' and will generally be easier to deal with as a result. An exception to this could be if the family name is difficult to pronounce. In this case, use of the caller's first name may be more appropriate.</li>
		<li>
use positive language whenever possible and concentrate on what Centrelink can do to assist the caller, rather than what they cannot do</li>
		<li>
avoid use of the word 'unfortunately' as an introduction to what is going to be said, as it predisposes the caller to think negatively</li>
		<li>
where appropriate, thank the customer for their call</li>		</ul>

<p>There may be occurrences where staff are required to action enquiries for multiple customers within the one contact.</p>

<p>If a third party (for example, Trustees, Financial Advisors, Nominees, etc.) contact with permission to complete business on behalf of numerous clients, staff are required to action these requests under First Contact Resolution. Staff should not be advising they are only able to assist with one enquiry per call and should attempt to finalise all required updates.</p>

<p>The only exceptions are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
if a staff member is due for a scheduled break/activity or requires a people support break. In this instance, the third party representative or next customer must be <strong>transferred</strong> to another Service Officer, after the current customer updates have been actioned, to complete all remaining transactions, or for<br><strong>Customers contacting Participation Solutions Team (PST), via Agency phones&#58;</strong></li>
		<li>
there may be occurrences where the customer has contacted Participation Solutions Team (PST), from a Remote Agency, and at the end of the call they advise there is another customer waiting for the phone. If&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the next person in the line is their partner, then accept the call, undertake POI and if within scope, complete the required action. If action is out of scope for the Service Officer, cold transfer the customer to the relevant telephony queue ensuring that POI verified is <strong>not</strong> checked on softphone before completing the transfer</li>
			<li>
the next person in the line is not their partner, then the Service Officer will accept the call, undertake POI and cold transfer the customer to the relevant telephony queue, including back into the PST CDP queue, ensuring that POI verified is <strong>not</strong> checked on softphone before completing the transfer</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>Staff must inform the customer at the beginning of every call that the call may be recorded for quality assurance and training purposes. Use the following script before proceeding with the call&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>'Before we proceed with this call, I need to inform you that this call may be recorded or listened to for quality and coaching purposes.'</strong></li>
		</ul>
<p>This script to be repeated for <strong>every subsequent customer</strong> or third party that enters the conversation.</p>

<p>If a customer is aggressive or abusive or becomes so during the call, Service Officers should remain calm. Staff can set appropriate and reasonable limits of behaviour in a respectful manner and by using de-escalation techniques, which can reduce the risk of verbal aggression escalating.</p>

<p>In line with the Aggressive behaviour response model, key principles of verbal de-escalation include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Role model the behaviour you would like the person to display. Attempt to transfer your sense of calm and self-control to the person. Avoid feelings of anger or personal offence</li>
		<li>
Wherever possible, preserve the dignity of the person by ensuring privacy and behaving in a non-judgmental way</li>
		<li>
Empathise wherever possible</li>
		<li>
Wherever possible provide autonomy for the person by giving them options, including acknowledging their feelings when answering sensitive questions where required</li>
		<li>
Avoid ultimatums or threats</li>
		<li>
You may have to repeat key information as the person may not be able to effectively hear or understand when they are distressed</li>
		<li>
Use positive phrasing wherever possible</li>
		<li>
Use a calm, gentle and soft tone of voice</li>
		<li>
Use shorter, rather than longer sentences</li>
		<li>
Practice active listening to ensure you have understood, and the person feels that you are committed to understanding their situation</li>
		<li>
Attempt to find things which you can agree on with the person</li>		</ul>

<p>Thank the customer for calling and terminate the call using Services Australia Softphone, you may want to use one of the phrases or a variation, i.e. <strong>'Thanks/thank you for calling, goodbye/bye.'</strong> This is to be used in conjunction with the wrapping up process of summarising the call and checking for understanding with the customer.</p>

<p>Record on a <strong>DOC</strong> any action taken as a result of a phone call from or to a customer.</p>

<p>Sometimes, despite your best efforts, de-escalation may not work and you should disengage from the interaction. Disengaging involves terminating a call.</p>

<p><strong>Warn the customer before terminating the call.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Handling a call placed on hold by the customer&#58;</strong></p>

<p>If a customer phones Services Australia and places the call on 'Hold', for example to take another incoming call, or leaves their telephone unattended, the general rule is to allow 30 seconds for the customer to come back to the call.</p>

<p>If the customer wishes to take another incoming call&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
tell the customer their call will be terminated if they do not return within 30 seconds</li>
		<li>
If the customer does not return within that time the call should be terminated and the customer will need to call back</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Customer aggression&#58;</strong></p>

<p>Explain the call will be terminated if the customer continues to be aggressive. Explain that the agency expects its staff to be treated with respect and courtesy and it is difficult to help when a customer is not acting accordingly.</p>

<p>Consider if notifying or referring the call to a team leader is appropriate. Talk to your supervisor so appropriate escalation procedures are followed and you receive support. Record details in ESSentials, where you have been impacted / injured by the incident.</p>

<p>A referral to a social worker should be initiated If the customer is extremely distressed or there are concerns for their immediate wellbeing or safety including if the customer has indicated that they are threatening self-harm. See <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-12010000-01.html">Social work service referral</a></p>

<p><strong>If the customer persists with aggressive or counterproductive behaviour after being warned, advise them that the call will be terminated, and do so using Services Australia Softphone.</strong></p>

<p>If the customer’s Voiceprint has been recorded in the IVR but enrolment to Voice Biometrics has not occurred due to customer aggression, please follow <a href="../self-service/133-04160050-01.html">Voiceprints for phone self service</a>. Enrolment declined or enrolment fails process.</p>

<p>If the customer has made threats see the <a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-07020000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Responding_to_p_Step">Responding to phone threats to harm staff or agency property</a> table in <a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-07020000-01.html">Customer aggression - Response</a>.</p>

<p>All incidents of aggressive behaviour must be recorded in <a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-07020050-01.html">Customer Incident Management System</a>.</p>

<p>Record on a <strong>DOC</strong> any action taken as a result of a phone call from or to the customer.</p>
