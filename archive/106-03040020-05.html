<p>Mary advises of going into hospital for a major operation on 28 September and is unsure about the length of confinement.

<p>Sarah advises of an overseas trip, departing on 22 November until 10 February and will not have access to the internet. As Sarah will not be able to re-contact to lodge a claim until close to the course commencement date, discretion can be applied to accept the claim earlier than 13 weeks. This allows the claim to be taken when Sarah first contacts on 20 November.

<p>Alex's parent has contacted to enquire about travel entitlements for Alex to attend the interview at the boarding school. To qualify for Orientation and Special Purpose Visit travel, Alex must meet the eligibility criteria for the Schooling B Award. The earliest a claim could normally be lodged would be 2 October.</p>

<p>Where outreach/remote servicing teams are visiting communities and a customer lodges a claim with the team, however the customer's qualification start date is, for example, 15 weeks away, it would be appropriate to accept the customer's claim.

<p><strong>Scenario 1</strong>&#58; Scott contacts in June to advise that Scott's child, Matt, is turning 18 in October. Scott is enquiring about Matt's ability to claim Youth Allowance now to ensure the transfer to these payments is smooth. Matt's birthday is on 17 October and the earliest a claim can normally be accepted is 18 July. Matt is currently in Year 12 and living with his parents.</p>

<p>It is not appropriate to apply discretion and take Matt's claim early (prior to 18 July) in this circumstance. There are no extenuating circumstances for Matt to be claiming earlier than 13 weeks prior to qualification. Matt should be advised to lodge a claim within 13 weeks prior to the date of qualification and that this will allow sufficient time for the claim to be finalised for a smooth transition between payments.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 2&#58;</strong> James is commencing university in the new year. James' course commences on 26 February and contacts on 14 November to make a claim for ABSTUDY. James is anxious to have the claim processed due to leaving employment to commence the course and wants to ensure there will be no problems with the payments commencing.</p>

<p>James' qualification start date will be 26 February and the earliest date ABSTUDY can be claimed is 27 November. It is not appropriate to apply discretion and take James' claim this early as there are no extenuating circumstances for James to be claiming more than 13 weeks prior to qualification. James should be advised to re-contact within 13 weeks from qualification, allowing sufficient time for the claim to be processed before commencement of the course.</p>

<p>If the customer elects to commence from 1 January the agency can pay the customer from this date as it is within 13 weeks of the claim being lodged. The YA customer’s parent will continue to receive FTB for the YA claimant until YA commences.</p>
