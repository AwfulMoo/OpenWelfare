<p>To determine that adequate security exists for the Home Equity Access Scheme (the Scheme) loan, the factors that must be considered are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
current market value of the real estate being offered as security</li>

<p>Separate the items of real estate being offered as security for the loan from other items of real estate that may be owned by the customer. The decision on whether adequate security is being offered can only take into account the customer's <strong>nominated</strong> properties and <strong>not</strong> the total value of real estate owned by the customer.</p>

<p>Establish the customer’s share of the current market value of the nominated real estate and record it in the <strong>Loan Security Value</strong> field on the Loan Details (<strong>PLS</strong>) screen.</p>

<p><strong>Determining customer’s share</strong></p>

<p>If the customer is partnered, divide the current market value by 2 to determine the customer’s share of the asset value. Members of a couple are deemed to have 50% ownership for the purposes of determining the loan security value for the Scheme purposes. This is regardless of their actual ownership percentage.</p>

<p>A customer can request to have the real asset value determined based on their actual ownership percentage (for example, if they own 100% of the property and their partner owns 0%) however this would only be agreed to in limited circumstances. For example, if each member of the couple owned a separate property and wished to use their own property as loan security.</p>

<p>Generally the full value of the real estate offered as loan security is used for determining adequate security for the Scheme purposes, however customers can choose to use only part of the value if they wish. The amount they choose to reduce the value by is known as the <strong>Nominated Amount</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, if the current market value of the real estate is $400,000, and the customer decides to use only $350,000 as security, the Nominated Amount is $50,000.</p>

<p>The Nominated Amount is recorded on the Loan Details (<strong>PLS</strong>) screen. If both members of a couple are applying for the loan, confirm with the couple what portion of the Nominated Amount is to be applied to each member (generally this will be 50% apportioned to each person).</p>

<p>The Nominated Amount is not quarantined from recovery by the Commonwealth. For example, if the person’s loan balance exceeds $350,000 due to interest continuing to accumulate, they are still required to repay the balance in full.</p>

<p>Prior to 1 July 2019 the Nominated Amount was known as a Guaranteed Amount.</p>

<p>Establish the value of any applicable deductions and record the amount in the <strong>Deductions</strong> field on the Loan Details (<strong>PLS</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>Decisions on adequate security are subject to the discretion of the delegate and will depend on the individual circumstances of the case. The <strong>Home Equity Access Scheme grant and projection calculator</strong> should be used to estimate the future balance of the loan to help identify if the balance will exceed the real asset value. See <a href="../older-australians/065-08000000-05.html">Home Equity Access Scheme</a> to access the calculator.</p>

<p>Does the real asset value provide adequate security to secure repayment of the loan?</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>, customer has offered adequate security to be eligible for the loan. To determine if the customer meets other eligibility criteria for the Scheme see <a href="../older-australians/065-19041642-01.html">Eligibility for the Home Equity Access Scheme</a></li>
		<li>
<strong>No</strong>, customer has not offered adequate security to be eligible for payments. Loan application to be rejected, or if already current on payments, ongoing loan payments will cancel. For more information, see <a href="../older-australians/065-19060321-01.html">Home Equity Access Scheme cancellation and rejections</a></li>

<p>To be eligible for the Scheme, the customer must have adequate and appropriate insurance for the Australian real estate they use as security for the loan. When lodging a new claim for the Scheme, applicants must provide their current certificate of insurance for the real estate.</p>

<p>Adequate and appropriate insurance for the Scheme purposes is generally considered to be an insured amount that is equivalent of at least 90% of the value of all buildings on the real estate property or properties.</p>

<p>The Scheme participants are required to notify Centrelink of any significant changes to the insurance policy covering the property used to secure a Scheme loan, including if the insured amount falls below the current market value of all buildings on the property.</p>

<p>If a customer wants to sell the real estate securing their Scheme loan, the delegate will need to determine whether repayment of the outstanding loan is required at this time.</p>

<p>A caveat is lodged by the Commonwealth over the real estate to ensure Services Australia is advised of any impending change of title for the real estate used to secure a Scheme loan. This allows the agency time to arrange for the loan's repayment or renegotiation as appropriate.</p>

<p>The question of whether repayment of the debt is required is one that must be addressed by the delegate having regard to the circumstances of the case.

<p>A reverse mortgage will not prevent a customer from accessing the Scheme. However, the delegate will need to determine whether they are able to calculate the maximum loan amount available for the customer in light of the reverse mortgage and its ongoing effect on the available equity for the Scheme.</p>

<p>As the debt incurred by a reverse mortgage increases over time without any reduction in the capital outlay, it is important that the delegate ensure that there is sufficient equity available to protect Government outlays under the Scheme.</p>

<p>One of the requirements of the Scheme is that the value of the real assets is sufficient to secure the payment of any outstanding loan amount that may become payable to the Commonwealth under Division 4.</p>

<p>In practice, most prospective Scheme participants with an existing reverse mortgage would fail to satisfy the conditions for being granted a Scheme loan because either&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the forecast equity in the property would be insufficient to secure the payment of the forecast Scheme debt, or</li>
		<li>
there is insufficient information available to be able to calculate a forecast end value of the reverse mortgage, meaning the Secretary cannot be satisfied that the Scheme loan amount could be recovered from the customer's equity in the property</li>
		</ul>
<p>In effect, it is only where the forecast end value of the reverse mortgage can be reasonably calculated and the remaining equity would be sufficient to recover the forecast Scheme debt that a loan could be granted to a person.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> any decision about whether a person's real assets meet this requirement is one that must be made on an individual basis, in the particular circumstances that apply. To enable an informed decision to be made, the customer should be asked via written request to provide a copy of the agreement or contract for the reverse mortgage, including details of the terms and conditions, and a forecast of the future value of the reverse mortgage from the lender. If a forecast end value is unable to be provided, the Scheme cannot be paid.</p>

<p>If the lender’s terms and conditions preclude the customer from entering into other loan arrangements using the same real estate property, approval of the Scheme loan cannot be considered without written consent to the loan from the lender.</p>

<p>The Scheme loan balance is an allowable deduction against the assessable asset amount (not including exempt amounts) for secured properties.</p>

<p>The deduction is applied by manually coding the loan balance amount in the <strong>Mortgages/Loans</strong> field on the Real Estate Detail (<strong>RE</strong>) screen for the secured property.</p>

<p>When a loan is granted, a Manual Follow Up (MFU) is set up for an annual review of the real estate used as security for the loan, which includes reviewing and updating the deduction of the loan balance. The deduction can be updated at any time between the annual review. This procedure describes the steps to take to assess and update the deduction coding at any time, either as part of the annual review or an adhoc assessment (for example, at the customer’s request).</p>

<p>For more information about the annual review, see <a href="../older-australians/065-08020060-01.html">Home Equity Access Scheme reviews</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when reviewing the Scheme secured properties, always consider the proximity of the current balance to the Maximum Loan Amount (MLA) against the age of the property value. If the property may have reduced in value, additional information may be required before the loan deduction can be recorded. For example, it may be necessary to request a Real Estate Details (MOD R) form the customer or a valuation. Ensure any required information has been provided and relevant updates made before proceeding with the deduction coding.</p>
