<p><strong>Who is eligible for the payment?</strong></p>

<p>For the purposes of the annual payment to carers, a 'care receiver' is a child that attracts Carer Allowance (CA) (child) including CA (auto) - but <strong>not</strong> Health Care Card (HCC) only - for the carer on 1 July.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
An individual is eligible for the annual payment for carers if they were receiving CA (child) on 1 July. If a carer's entitlement was suspended or cancelled for 1 July, and then subsequently restored, they will become eligible for the annual payment</li>
		<li>
The care receiver must be a child under age 16 or extended under the CA (child) provisions. Hence adult care receivers granted as part of 'care provided for a disabled adult and one or two children with a disability or medical condition', and child care receivers over 16 years, are not entitled to Child Disability Assistance Payment (CDAP)</li>
		<li>
HCC only Carer Allowance (child) recipients are <strong>not eligible</strong> for the annual payment for carers</li>
		<li>
If a HCC only carer is reviewed and found to be eligible for CA (child) payment level, then the CDAP is only payable if the start date of payment (date of effect of the review) is on or before 1 July</li>
		<li>
A person can receive CA (child) because they are caring for <strong>two disabled children</strong> who have Child Disability Assessment Tool scores of less than 1, and have Treating Health Professional scores of greater than zero. In these cases, the <strong>care receivers are counted as one</strong> for the purposes of determining the amount of annual payment payable</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the system will allow for manual zero of a payment of the CDAP if it is required.</p>

<a class="anchor" name="bp05_tbl_FAQ_examples_2"></a>
<p>2</p></td>
<td>

<p><strong>Does the carer have to apply for the payment and when will it be paid?</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
No application is required for the CDAP to be paid to eligible customers</li>
		<li>
Where possible, carers who are in receipt of CA (child) on 1 July will be automatically paid the annual payment usually with their first instalment of CA paid after 1 July</li>
		<li>
The instalment will be paid into the same bank account that CA is paid to but will not appear as a separate entry</li>
		<li>
For carers who are eligible in July each year, it is expected that payments will be made automatically until September each year</li>
		<li>
When carers are granted or restored retrospectively after September, there will be a warning for the Service Officer to make the payment manually on the Carer One Off Payment (<strong>COOP</strong>) screen</li>
		<li>
Manual payment procedures may be required if carer was backdated prior to 1 July and payment has not automatically occurred</li>		</ul>

<tr>

<td>

<p><strong>How much is the payment?</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
The annual payment is <strong>$1,000</strong> for eligible recipients of CA (child). The payment may be less than $1,000 if there is a shared care arrangement</li>
		<li>
A CA (child) carer cannot get more than <strong>$1,000 for each care receiver</strong>, although there may be instances where a care receiver attracts more than $1,000 in total (for example, if there is a change of carer where each carer receives an instalment for 1 July). That is, payment to the second carer is not dependent on recovery of the payment from the first carer</li>		</ul>

<a class="anchor" name="bp05_tbl_FAQ_examples_5"></a>
<p>5</p></td>

<p><strong>What happens when there is a change of care or shared care?</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Where there is a change of care and retrospective grant on or before 1 July, the new carer will receive the annual payment irrespective of whether the previous carer received the bonus. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> recovery action should be taken on the other carer if a Carer Allowance (CA) debt is raised for a period including 1 July</li>
		<li>
If an individual receives CA (child) under a <strong>shared care</strong> arrangement the rate of CA applying on 1 July is used to calculate the rate of CDAP. For example, two carers may each receive 50% of CA and therefore each receive 50% or $500 CDAP or where only one carer has applied for CA and have 50% of the care their rate however will be 100% CA and therefore 100% of CDAP</li>
		<li>
Shared care rate decisions apply only from the date of the decision and are rarely backdated however of the shared care percentage on 1 July is subsequently updated (for example, through review), then the CDAP amount can be updated retrospectively to pay a top up of the annual payment to the carer with the increased percentage. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> recovery action should be taken on the other carer only if a CA debt is raised for a period including 1 July</li>
		<li>
A system warning and help text will be displayed when the <strong>shared care % is changed</strong></li>		</ul>

		<ul>		<li>
CA (child) carers whose child care receiver died within 14 weeks of 1 July (25/3 - 1/7) are also entitled to CDAP for this child. As this bereavement payment is paid in a lump sum when the death is notified, they are not in receipt of an ongoing payment on 1 July but have been paid for a period covering 1 July</li>

Payments will be made to the last known account of the person receiving CA in cases where the care receiver has died before payment of CDAP has been made</li>		</ul>
