<p>This document explains the assessment of entitlement to social security payments where a customer advises a new shared care arrangement or a change to an existing arrangement. The decision for social security payments is separate to the decision for Family Tax Benefit (FTB).</p>

<p></p>
<div class="twisty">
	
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Shared_care"></a>
<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Shared_care">Shared care</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Shared care is where a child is jointly cared for by 2 or more people who are not members of the same couple. If a child spends time, for example on weekends or school holidays, with someone else (such as their other parent if the parents are separated), each carer can be deemed to have a shared care arrangement.</p>

<p>A shared care assessment should be completed in all cases, even if only one person is claiming income support or if each person has another qualifying child solely in their care. The shared care assessment will determine the principal carer status which will determine a customer's entitlement and in some cases will affect the rate and income test applied for ongoing entitlements for single principal carers Customers with shared care arrangements, but are not the principal carer may still be entitled to a 'with child' rate of payment for JobSeeker Payment (JSP), Youth Allowance (YA) and Special Benefit (SpB). Care should be taken to ensure the change in care is not a temporary change in care, for more information on temporary changes, see <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-05050020-01.html">Child leaves customer's care/custody</a>.</p>

<p>Customers may become eligible as a principal carer due to an increase in their level of shared care of a child. In such cases, the care arrangement must be confirmed with the other person caring for the child. Investigate all notifications of a change in care by gathering relevant information from both customers (even if customers are reporting a reduced level of care for themselves).</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Mutual_customer">Mutual customer</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Where a shared care assessment is in place for an existing customer, updates may be required which will affect the customer's income support where a mutual customer notifies the Services Australia of changes to their care arrangements.</p>

<p>If the customer notifies Child Support of a change, the percentage of care will be assessed and transferred across from Child Support. A revised decision may be required for social security purposes when the new assessment from Child Support is received. A <a href="../separated-parents/277-51160010-01.html">Child Support Manual Follow-up (MFU)</a> is generated to identify customers whose social security rate may need to be reassessed following a care determination from Child Support.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Eligibility_for_extr">Eligibility for extra assistance</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Customers may be entitled to the following extra assistance where they have a child in their care, including being assessed as a principal carer, or as having a dependent child in care where the care is shared care or regular care. Regular care entitles a customer to extra assistance even though the <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-01030000-01.html">dependent child definition</a> is not met&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the person <a href="../families/007-02050010-01.html">considered to be the principal carer of the child</a> may qualify for Parenting Payment (PP) if they have an eligible child in their care under 6 years of age Parenting Payment Partnered (PPP) or 8 years of age Parenting Payment Single (PPS)</li>
		<li>
the person <a href="../families/007-02050010-01.html">considered to be the principal carer of the child</a> may qualify for JobSeeker Payment (JSP), Special Benefit (SpB) or Youth Allowance (YA) (job seeker) at a higher 'with child' rate if they are single and have a child in their care aged under 16 years</li>
		<li>
JSP and SpB single principal carers have access to a separate income test where they can earn more before income affects their payment, have reduced participation requirements and access to the Pensioner Concession Card</li>
		<li>
The <a href="../families/007-02050020-01.html">'with child' rate may be payable</a> to single JSP, YA and SpB customers who have a dependent child in their care (14% or more) but who are not considered a principal carer. Customers with a dependent student child from 16-22 years of age inclusive, may also continue to receive the 'with child' rate</li>
		<li>
An additional child income free area may be available for PPS customers who have a dependent child in their care but who are not considered the principal carer of that child. There is no restriction on the percentage of care the customer needs to have for the child, providing they continue to have at least one child under 8 in their principal care</li>
		</ul>
<p>In some cases, the higher rate may be payable to JobSeeker Payment and Youth Allowance (jobseeker) if the dependent child definition is not met due to the level of care if the customer has regular care of the child (14% or more). The customer must have either legal responsibility (alone or jointly with another person) for the day to day care, welfare and development of a child <strong>or</strong> a family law order or parenting plan which states the child is supposed to live with the customer.</p>

<p>For the customer to be assessed as having a 'regular care' child in care the customer needs to demonstrate that&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they have at least 14% care of the child in the current instalment period (one night per week during the fortnight), or</li>
		<li>
the pattern of care shows they have at least 14% care of the child over either a 14 or 28 day period. This may include a past or future period but should include at least part of the current instalment period</li>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Customers may be eligible to claim family assistance for children in their care. The <a href="../families/007-02050000-05.html">Resources</a> page contains standard text to be used in the Q888, inviting the customer to claim Family Tax Benefit (FTB). Customers caring for a child from a previous relationship may need to take action to obtain child support to receive more than the base rate of FTB Part A for a child. Customers may claim Child Care Subsidy (CCS) to help with the costs of child care if they are eligible.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Confirmation_of">Confirmation of change of care</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A mandatory attempt to confirm the change of care with the previous carer must be made to ensure that payments are made to the correct person, that each customer receives their correct entitlement and to reduce the need for reviews.</p>

<p>If the previous carer has not notified the change of care, or there is disagreement over the care arrangement, the customer must provide evidence to support the actual care arrangements.</p>

<p>It is important that claims are processed quickly to reduce the chance of an overpayment for the previous carer and to ensure that the customer claiming is not disadvantaged.</p>

<p>If a change of care is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
temporary, the current customer may remain entitled to payments for the child and may remain the principal carer of the child during the absence, see <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-05050020-01.html">Child leaves customer's care/custody</a></li>
		<li>
part of a pattern of care (care of the child is shared between 2 or more people over a certain period), a shared care assessment may be needed. The customer may wish to claim a shared care income support payment, see <a href="../families/007-02050000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Customer_advises_tha_Step03">Step 3 in Change in care arrangements table</a></li>
		<li>
disputed, a customer may continue to receive FTB for the child for a period between 4 and 52 weeks and may remain the principal carer if the child has left their care without their consent or if it is disputed care. See <a href="../families/007-02040020-01.html">Notification and assessment of shared care arrangements for Family Tax Benefits (FTB)</a>. For changes in care that occur on or after 1 July 2012, discretion can be applied to disputed care and left <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-05050040-01.html">care without consent</a> cases to decide the percentage of care be immediately based on the actual level of care if there are special circumstances which support that outcome. See <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-05050040-01.html">Child out of care without consent</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>A mutual customer of family assistance and Child Support can notify Services Australia of changes to their care arrangements. After the care determination is made, the <a href="../separated-parents/277-51130110-01.html">care information will be transferred</a> for the assessment of family assistance and child support entitlements.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> where the change in care relates to a child receiving Youth Allowance or ABSTUDY as a dependent the parent for the purposes of the Parental Means Test may have also changed.
