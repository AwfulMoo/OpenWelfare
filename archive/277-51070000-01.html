<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Child_support">Child support</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Child support, also known as maintenance, refers to financial and material support for children from their separated non-custodial parent(s). The terms maintenance and child support are often used interchangeably and generally have the same meaning. Maintenance is a term used by Centrelink and includes child support as well as support for a partner from a previous relationship (spousal maintenance).</p>

<p>It is important to remember that regardless of a customer's personal income, both parents are responsible for providing financial support for their children.</p>

<p>Generally, a customer is considered to be taking maintenance action and will meet the MAT if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
an application is made for a child support assessment for a child</li>
		<li>
a customer has a child support assessment for a child</li>
		<li>
an application is made for a child support agreement to be accepted for a child</li>
		<li>
a customer has a child support agreement accepted for a child</li>
		<li>
a customer has an exemption from taking maintenance action</li>
		</ul>
<p>Even if a customer's personal income means they will only receive base rate FTB Part A, they should be encouraged to take reasonable action to obtain child support. If the customer's income later reduces and they already have a child support assessment in place, they can automatically receive more than base rate FTB.</p>

<p>A child support assessment will usually end when the child turns 18 years of age. To continue meeting the MAT after an FTB child turns 18, customers with a child support case in place prior to the child turning 18 must apply to Child Support to extend the child support assessment if the child will be in full-time secondary education on/after their 18th birthday. They must do this <strong>before</strong> the child turns 18 years of age.</p>

<p>Information is exchanged automatically between Child Support and Centrelink. For further information, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-04080000-01.html">Centrelink-Child Support information exchange</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Norfolk Island, Cocos (Keeling) and Christmas Islands</strong></p>

<p>Since 1 July 2016, residents of Norfolk, Cocos (Keeling) and Christmas Islands have been eligible to apply for a child support assessment.</p>

<p>Due to legislative changes effective from 1 July 2016, child support assessments can be made where the paying parent is a resident of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Christmas Island or Norfolk Island.</p>

<p>If the customer and/or their partner is under the age of consent, then the customer is treated as single under family assistance law.

		<div class="block">

<p>The MAT ensures that reasonable action is taken to obtain child support for a child from a previous relationship particularly where the customer is claiming more than the base rate of FTB Part A for the child. FTB Part A for a child is limited to the base rate if a customer (or their current partner) is required to take action to obtain child support but fails to do so.</p>

<p>First check that an application for child support assessment is needed. In some cases, it is not applicable for a customer to take action to obtain child support.</p>

<p>There are some situations when a customer is not required to take reasonable action to obtain child support and satisfy the MAT. In these cases, the customer may apply for a <a href="../separated-parents/277-51070090-01.html">maintenance action test exemption</a>.</p>

<p>If the customer has children from more than 1 relationship, they need to take separate action for each child from each previous relationship.</p>

<p>In most cases, the customer will need to apply for a <a href="../separated-parents/277-51010010-01.html">child support assessment</a>.</p>

<p>Customers may&#58;</p>

<p>If the customer does not take action to obtain child support within the 91 day DMA period, they cannot be paid more than base rate FTB Part A for the child/ren.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
The Pseudo DMA Event (<strong>PDE</strong>) MAT code can be recorded manually to simulate a 91 day DMA period. This will generally be required when the above 5th DMA dot point applies as this event is not automated like the other 4 DMA events. See the <a href="../separated-parents/277-51070000-03.html">Process</a> page for further information</li>
		<li>
A customer may claim FTB after their DMA period. This may occur when a customer arrives from overseas and is not yet residentially qualified for FTB Part A due to serving a <a href="../families/007-05020020-03.html">NARWP</a>. Consider whether it is reasonable to expect the customer to have known to take maintenance action upon arriving in Australia. If the answer is no, consider extending the DMA period</li>
		</ul>
<p>At every chance, <strong>advise customers of their obligation</strong> to take reasonable action to obtain child support.</p>

<p>A Maintenance Action Requirement Notification (MARNL) letter will generally issue to a customer or their current partner if they are required to take maintenance action for a child in their care and they are within their 91 day DMA period. A reminder MARNL issues 21 days later if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they are still within the DMA period</li>
		<li>
no child support assessment data has been received from Child Support, and</li>
		<li>
the initial MARNL was sent on or before day 63 of the DMA period</li>
		</ul>
<p>The MARNL letter displays as a 'NOTFAOOSC' letter on the History Summary (<strong>HS</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>Customers unable to collect their full child support entitlement privately may need to ask Child Support to collect their child support payments on their behalf, or seek a partial exemption.

<p>Customers who have care of a child from a previous relationship must take reasonable steps to obtain child support to be eligible for more than the base rate of FTB Part A.</p>

<p>To continue to receive more than the base rate of FTB Part A for a full-time secondary student once the child turns 18 years of age, the payee in a child support case must apply to Child Support for an extension to their child support assessment prior to the child's 18th birthday. The assessment can be extended until the last day of the secondary school year that falls within 365 days of the child's 18th birthday. In some cases, an extension is not required/appropriate. See the <a href="../separated-parents/277-51070000-03.html">Process</a> page for examples and coding required to ensure the customer continues to pass the MAT in these cases.</p>

<p>If the child support payee does not obtain an extension to the child support assessment prior to the child turning 18, the MAT will not be met and only the base rate of FTB Part A will be payable from the child's 18th birthday until the last day of secondary school for the year in which their child turns 18 years of age. MAT requirements cease at the end of the school year in which the child turns 18 years of age, but FTB can be paid until the end of the calendar year in which the child turns 19 years of age if they satisfy <a href="../families/007-07040060-01.html">education/training requirements</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the application to extend the child support case is not made prior to the child's 18th birthday, the extension to the assessment will only be granted if there were exceptional circumstances which prevented the application being made before the child's 18th birthday. The <a href="../separated-parents/277-51070000-04.html#bp04_L2LL_Policy">References</a> page contains a link to the Child Support Guide 2.5.5&#58; Application to have an assessment continue past a child's 18th birthday.</p>

<p>If the payee does not obtain an extension to the child support assessment prior to the child's 18<sup>th</sup> birthday, or they do apply for an extension and it is rejected, the MAT requirement will not be met and only the base rate of FTB Part A will be payable from the child's 18th birthday. If the payee has not applied for an extension to the child support assessment, Service Officers are to refer them to Child Support to apply/discuss, even if the child has turned 18 years of age.</p>

<p>If Child Support has refused the payee's application for an extension to the child support assessment, the customer can lodge an objection to the decision with Child Support.</p>

<p>Where a Deciding Maintenance Action (DMA) event occurs within 13 weeks of the child's 18th birthday and the child is a full-time secondary student (FTSS) or exempt from FTSS, the customer would not have had access to their full 13 week DMA period in which to take reasonable maintenance action for the respective child prior to the child's 18th birthday.</p>

<p>As the customer has not had access to their full DMA period, they are not required to meet the MAT and will not be required to seek an extension for the respective child prior to the child's 18th birthday.</p>

<p>However, if a customer starts a child support case for the child within the reduced DMA period, they will be required to seek an extension to the child support assessment for the child, past the child's 18th birthday, as they have already taken maintenance action. It would often be the case that this would occur at the same time the child support assessment application was undertaken with Child Support.</p>
