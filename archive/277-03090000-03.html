<p>Check the customer's income details to ensure the customer is assessed to pay the FAR correctly.</p>

<p><strong>Update income details</strong></p>

<p>Where possible, update any incomes relevant to the nominated period that have a status of 'Currently Used'. For assistance with updating an income, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-07010000-01.html">Income Processing for Child Support customers</a>.</p>

<p>If the customer received an income support payment (ISP) for any period within the last relevant year of income (LRYI), Cuba does not automatically create a FAR of child support. The <a href="../separated-parents/277-03090000-04.html#bp04_L2GT_Policy">References</a> page contains a link to the Child Support Guide 2.4.11&#58; Fixed Annual Rate of child support for certain low income parents. </p>

<p>If the customer received an ISP for any period during the LRYI, ensure the ISP box for the relevant income record on the Client Income window is checked. This will automatically amend the assessment so the FAR is not applied. Check the assessment rate for the relevant period to see if the FAR is no longer present. If so, advise the customer the FAR is no longer relevant.</p>

<p>Check the Client Benefits window, Client Income window and Income Details window&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
if no ISP details can be found and the customer stated they received an ISP during the relevant year</li>
			<ul>			<li>
complete the CLNK Refresh and the <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/elements/macros/CentrelinkCSPInformationExchange.html">Centrelink/Child support information exchange</a> macro</li>		</ul>
		<li>
shows ISP or the Centrelink/Child support information exchange confirms ISP </li>
			<ul>			<li>
if the ISP box does not automatically populate there may be a data integrity issue with the Centrelink exchange of information. Escalate the issue to BSI via the SSO network</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>Parental Leave Pay (PLP) is not an ISP. Therefore, if the customer only received PLP in the LRYI, do not check the ISP box in the Client Income window.</p>

<p>If the customer is still assessed to pay the FAR, <a href="../separated-parents/277-03090000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Application_rec_Step04">go to Step 4</a>.</p>

<p>The FAR applies per child (the rate payable is capped at 3 times the FAR) and will not apply for any child where the parent has at least shared care of that child.</p>

<p>Confirm the care the applicant has for each child of the assessment. If the customer advises of a different care level, determine whether the care in the assessment should be changed. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-03040000-01.html">Change in child support care levels (post 1 July 2010)</a>.</p>

<p>If the care arrangements are up to date, and the customer now has at least shared care of all children they are assessed to pay child support for, the application may not need to proceed.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> a change to the care percentage will only apply from the date of notification or the date of the change in care, if the customer notifies within 28 days of the change. The FAR may still apply for the period prior to the relevant date. If the FAR remains in place for part of the child support period (or a previous child support period), <a href="../separated-parents/277-03090000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Application_rec_Step03">go to Step 3</a>.</p>

<p>If the customer is still assessed to pay the FAR for any child/ren of the assessment, the application for the FAR not to apply must be considered</p>

<p>If the income and care changes removed the FAR, their FAR not to apply application is no longer considered.</p>

<p>Where there is a pending FAR not to apply in Cuba, that is no longer considered, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-30010340-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Apply_FAR_not_t">Apply FAR not to apply decision</a> table of Fixed annual rate (FAR) not to apply Cuba Process Help.</p>

If they respond yes, ask whether the kind and amounts of expenses incurred and deductions claimed in the examined tax return, have been included in their calculation of their current income (annualised). If they respond yes then this is sufficient information to be satisfied about their current income (annualised).</p>

<p>If their response indicates the historic information is not relevant to their current circumstances then request current documentation including a profit and loss statement. The customer should be able to provide documentation such as the most recent BAS or financial statement or current budget to support the calculation of their current income (annualised). </p>

<p>When a customer's income is equal to or less than the Parenting Payment - single maximum basic amount, Services Australia can accept the customer's application if it is also determined that it is unjust and inequitable for the customer to pay the FAR.</p>

<p>This means considering whether the parent has access to additional resources not considered in their income. The <a href="../separated-parents/277-03090000-04.html#bp04_L2GT_Policy">References</a> page contains a link to the Child Support Guide 2.5.3&#58; Application to have the Fixed Annual Rate of child support not used.</p>

<p>Consider whether the applicant has provided a plausible reason for their income being low, such as they are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
supported by current partner</li>
		<li>
a full-time student in high school</li>
		<li>
a full-time university student</li>
		<li>
under 25 and supported by their family</li>
		<li>
in receipt of worker's compensation</li>
		<li>
a prisoner (application for reducing a minimum assessment to nil can be considered at the same time)</li>
		<li>
estimating and they are currently on income support, and</li>
		<li>
on FAR due to low income (no income support) in the previous year but are currently on income support</li>
		</ul>
<p>Also consider whether the applicant&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
has an active ABN or links to partnerships, companies, trusts or any investment properties</li>
		<li>
has substantial funds in cash savings or assets</li>
		<li>
is meeting expenses that exceed their reported income</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
has provided a plausible reason and none of the above circumstances apply, it would generally be unjust and inequitable for them to pay the FAR. <a href="../separated-parents/277-03090000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Determine_wheth_Step03">Go to Step 3</a></li>
		<li>
has any of the circumstances listed above, and/or the reason they provide for their low income is not included in the above list, <a href="../separated-parents/277-03090000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Determine_wheth_Step02">go to Step 2</a></li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the customer may have discretionary (disposable) assets, which means it would not be unjust or inequitable for them to pay the FAR. Significant cash savings, extensive investment portfolios, multiple rental properties, etc. might indicate the parent could afford to pay the FAR.</p>

<p>If a parent has such assets, determine whether the assets produce income. If the assets do, that income should be included in the calculation of the parent's current income (annualised). If the assets are not income producing, carefully consider whether they could be disposed of or drawn upon by the parent to release funds to pay the FAR. For example, if the parent has significant money in the bank, the parent could withdraw some of it to pay the FAR, if there are multiple rental properties, one could be sold and the funds used to pay the FAR.</p>

<p>Ask the customer the following questions&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Why are you not in receipt of an ISP?</li>
		<li>
How do you support yourself financially?</li>
		<li>
Do you own any assets worth at least the current FAR amount? If so, what sort and what is their value?</li>
		<li>
Do you have any money saved or invested, for at least the current FAR amount?</li>
		<li>
What kind of accommodation do you live in?</li>
		<li>
How much do you pay for accommodation costs?</li>
		<li>
How do you meet these costs?</li>
		<li>
Do you own a car or other vehicle, such as a motorbike or boat? If so, what sort?</li>
		<li>
How do you pay for expenses associated with the vehicle?</li>
		<li>
How do you pay utilities?</li>
		<li>
How do you meet your daily living expenses (groceries, clothes, etc.)?</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer's answers to these questions suggests their expenses outweigh their reported income, or their lifestyle is beyond the means of their reported income, it may be decided it would not be unjust and inequitable for them to pay the FAR, despite their current income (annualised) being low. Similarly, if the customer has substantial funds that could be used to pay the FAR, it may not be unjust and inequitable.</p>

<p>Where a customer has received a lump sum payment, such as because of a compensation or disability settlement, consider whether this amount has already been counted in their ATI. Also consider the purpose of the payment and the customer's reasonable expenses. For example, if a customer received a redundancy payout and chooses not to find new employment until those funds are depleted, it may not be unjust and inequitable to expect them to still pay the FAR. Whereas, if a customer was injured and received a payment to cover their expenses for the rest of their working life, as they will never be able to work again, it likely would be unjust and inequitable for them to pay the FAR.</p>

<p>A customer may also receive non-cash benefits through their association with partnerships, trusts or businesses.</p>

<p>A self-employed person may have nil or minimal expenditure because all their personal expenses are met through their business.</p>

<p>Some people may be able to structure their income so their personal expenses are met through salary packaging, trusts, or other financial structures, such they report a low income.</p>

<p>People may also claim tax deductions which can be considered as non-cash benefits. For example, a self-employed person who has a home office can claim deductions relating to the family home. If these deductions are higher than what could reasonably be associated with the business, then these non-cash benefits must be included in the consideration of whether it would be unjust and inequitable for the customer to pay the FAR.</p>

<p>If the customer receives substantial benefits from structuring their affairs through their business, salary packaging, or financial structures, then it may not be unjust and inequitable for the customer to pay the FAR.</p>

<p>For example, if a customer's entire mortgage repayments are paid by their business, it is not unjust and inequitable for them to be assessed on the FAR because their reported income does not reflect the benefit they receive by structuring their affairs through their business. Another example could be where a customer's business pays 10% of their electricity bill because they operate a home office 5 days a week.</p>

<p>Farmers will usually have a link to a company or ABN, and should be treated in the same way as other small businesses. <strong>However</strong>, farmers may be drawing on different forms of income assistance that indicate they have genuinely limited resources. For example, they may be in receipt of Drought Relief or may be drawing on a Farm Management Deposit (FMD, formerly known as an Income Equalisation Deposit). A farmer may also be supported by their partner or may be increasing their indebtedness, and it may be unjust and inequitable for them to pay the FAR.</p>

<p>A customer, such as a self-funded retiree, may advise they have arranged their affairs so they can meet their living expenses from a very modest income. They may own their house and car and have limited expenses for those items. If a self-funded retiree is not using any income minimisation to report an artificially low income then it would likely be unjust and inequitable for them to pay the FAR.</p>

<p>If help is required to determine if it would be unjust and inequitable for the customer to pay the FAR, seek assistance from a SSO. Where a customer's financial resources are difficult to determine, a referral to CTP may also be appropriate.</p>

<p>Generally, a parent who meets the requirements for FAR not to apply to them will contact Child Support to discuss the amount they are required to pay, rather than paying the FAR. This is because they are unlikely to have sufficient income. Determining a date in the past for FAR to cease to apply will rarely create an overpayment.</p>

<p>However, in some cases the parent may not have been aware they could apply for the FAR not to apply, and/or enforcement action may have been taken to collect the amounts. For example, a parent may not have received income support in the last relevant year of income, but they now receive Centrelink benefits. Child Support may have been collecting up to 3 times the minimum payment from the parent's Centrelink benefits. This may occur if the parent was assessed to pay the FAR, and the parent may not have known to apply for the FAR not to apply (or may not even have known they were being assessed to pay the FAR).</p>

<p>If it is determined the FAR should cease to apply from a date in the past and this would cause an overpayment, consider whether the parent could have been expected to contact Child Support earlier. Consider whether&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the parent was aware they were assessed to pay the FAR</li>
		<li>
the parent understood they could apply for FAR not to apply to them</li>
		<li>
there were any circumstances that made it difficult for the parent to contact us, for example extremely remote areas or incarceration</li>
		</ul>
<p>Previous letters and notices of assessment sent to the parent, as well as documented communication, may indicate whether or not the parent should have been aware of their options. If the parent was aware of their options and could have contacted Child Support but did not, then select a date that will not create an overpayment. If the parent was not aware of their options and/or could not reasonably have been expected to contact us, it will normally be appropriate to backdate the decision for FAR not to apply, even if this will cause an overpayment.</p>

<p>If help is required to determine the date from which the parent should cease to be assessed to pay the FAR, seek assistance from a SSO.</p>

<p>Document the decision in the Child Support Period window.</p>
