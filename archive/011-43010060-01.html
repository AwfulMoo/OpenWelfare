a patient or claimant lodges their own claim for payment of benefits for a paid account</li>
		<li>
the Medicare benefit is made payable to the claimant.</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> in these cases the payment of the Medicare benefits is strictly a transaction between the patient and Services Australia.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Enquiries from practice staff or health professional representatives</strong></p>

<p>Practice staff or health professional representatives can work for more than 1 health professional at a medical practice.</p>

<p>When an enquiry is received from the practice staff or health professional representative a <a href="../health-professionals/012-40030000-01.html">health professional security check</a> must be completed to identify the health professional.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if there are further enquiries that relate to other health professional at the same location, additional security checks are not required. Confirmation must only be sought to verify that all of the health professionals work at the same location. </p>

<p>The <a href="../your-health/011-43010060-03.html">Process</a> page contains information on when to release Medicare card numbers.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>PDVC cheque enquiries</strong></p>

<p>After confirming the person's identity Service Officers can release pay doctor via claimant (PDVC) cheque information to the health professional or member of their staff about services connected with that cheque only.</p>

<p>The <a href="../your-health/011-43010060-05.html">Resources</a> page contains a table providing details on the information that can be released to health professionals for PDVC cheque enquiries, information on definitions for finalised and not yet finalised claims, and information that can be disclosed to a claimant and health professionals for pay doctor via claimant (PDVC) cheque enquiries.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Release of concessional status to health professionals </strong></p>

<p>A health professional can check a patients concession for claiming bulk billing incentive payments through Health Professional Online Services (HPOS) using a Medicare Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Individual Certificate or by contacting the Medicare provider enquiries line. The <a href="../your-health/011-43010060-05.html">Resources</a> page provides contact details.</p>

<p>The agency can release a patient's concessional entitlement status to a health professional if they have the patient's consent and have explained to the patient why they need this information.</p>

<p>A patient’s concessional eligibility can be displayed in the patient history enquiry screen (Mainframe) or for further details Service Officers can query the PBS concessional information.</p>

<p><strong>Previous address provided</strong></p>

<p>If an old or new card number is found, but the address given does not match, and a previous address can be supplied, Service Officers can give the Medicare card number to the health professional and advise them to inform the patient that the card details need updating.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Previous address not provided</strong></p>

<p>If an old or new card number is found, and the address does not match, and no previous address can be provided, the Medicare card number cannot be given.</p>

<p>Service Officers must advise the health professional or the member of their staff that the card number cannot be found, and the patient needs to be advised to update their records at a Service Centre.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Homeless persons</strong></p>

<p>Where the health professional or the member of their staff identifies the patient as being a homeless person Service Officers can provide the Medicare card number.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>To simplified billing agents and private health insurers</strong></p>

<p>Simplified billing agents and private health insurers can request patient Medicare card details as they are involved in facilitating a claim. They will need to undergo a simplified billing or billing agent security check and supply health professional details.</p>

<p><strong>See also&#58;</strong> <a href="../your-health/011-40040000-01.html">Perform telephone security check for private health insurers in Medicare</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>To patient or claimant on the same Medicare card</strong></p>

<p>Service Officers can release a Medicare card number over the telephone to a person identified as the cardholder or one of the adult card members on the Medicare card. To identify themselves, the person requesting a Medicare card number <strong>must</strong> pass a <a href="../your-health/011-40020000-01.html">security check</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> for the purposes of Medicare claiming, an adult is someone 14 years and over.</p>

<p>If there are any discrepancies, including the person either&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
being evasive</li>
		<li>
unwilling to undergo or unable to pass a security check</li>
		</ul>
<p>Service Officers are to advise the person that they must attend a service centre with <a href="../your-health/011-40020000-01.html">appropriate identification</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>To a hospital</strong></p>

<p>Hospitals should not use Services Australia as a primary source of information about patients' Medicare card numbers. This type of enquiry does not confirm a patient's identity. As a rule, hospitals must insist patients produce their Medicare card.</p>

<p>The service to public hospitals should be limited to circumstances where the hospital believes that the person presenting for admission is not an eligible person.</p>

<p>Hospital staff are <strong>not to be provided</strong> with the patient's Medicare card number. They should only be advised whether a person of a given name, address and date of birth is registered as an eligible person. The information provided can include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
eligibility dates</li>
		<li>
whether the person has restricted access due to the Reciprocal Health Care Agreements (RHCA visitor)</li>
		<li>
the particular type of Ministerial order giving eligibility (visa restriction)</li>
		</ul>
<p>This should provide hospitals with enough scope to resolve any real concerns that they may have about ineligible people obtaining free treatment.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
a hospital security check is conducted through the Mainframe using QPVI hospital provider number, not through the Provider Directory Service (PDS)</li>
		<li>
staff from Queensland Hospitals working under the COAG 19.2 agreement frequently call for patient card information on behalf of health professionals</li>
