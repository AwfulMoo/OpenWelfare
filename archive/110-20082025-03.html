<p><strong>Limiting date has a reason of Bulk Update (BLK)</strong></p>

<p>If there are limiting date impacts and the reason is <strong>BLK</strong> in the required system, some of these limiting dates can be moved. APS5 staff with access to change limiting dates can <a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-20082025-05.html">move the limiting date</a>.</p>

<p>Moving the limiting date to an earlier date will let the reassessment occur before the BLK limiting date. This should adjust income credits and identify underpayments. In this case, the system can complete the remediation.</p>

<p>The limiting date cannot be moved for any other reason, e.g. DOC, LNK, ULK, NCL or BTR.</p>

<p>If the following occurs, refer to staff with access to change limiting dates&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>NSS</strong> and <strong>PGA</strong> system <strong>BLK</strong> limiting dates can be moved even if the customer is not current</li>
		<li>
<strong>PEN</strong> system <strong>BLK</strong> limiting dates <strong>cannot</strong> be moved unless the customer is current in the <strong>PEN</strong> system</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Limiting date has a reason of Remediation Update (REM)</strong></p>

<p>If there are limiting date impacts in the required system with the reason <strong>REM</strong>, manual action is needed when making updates to the customer’s record that will interact with the recorded averaged income information.</p>

<p>The <strong>REM </strong>limiting date will be the debt end date plus one day of the averaged debt. Staff need to remediate the customer’s record, returning it to its pre-averaged state, from the first EPSD of the coding of the averaged income review period.</p>

<p>A limiting date that is after the debt end date may prevent a correct result, Staff will need to complete a manual calculation.</p>

<p>In most cases, arrears will not be payable to the customer. If an update to a customer’s record has created arrears payments outside the debt period, make a decision under section 109(4) or 109(5) of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 if these are payable to the customer.</p>

<p>If the arrears do not match the income compliance debt or if the decision is to pay the arrears generated, the case must be referred to a Quality Development Officer (QDO) for advice on how to progress the activity.</p>

<p>If arrears are present, ensure adjustments are made only on income support payment arrears. If there are arrears for Families or Student payments, these will need to be assessed separately. If needing more help to action Families or Student arrears, refer to a QDO. See <a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-20082025-06.html">relevant training</a>.</p>

<p>Moving the limiting date to an earlier date will let the reassessment occur before the BLK limiting date. This should adjust income credits and identify underpayments. In this case, the system can complete the remediation.</p>

<p>The limiting date cannot be moved for any other reason, e.g. DOC, LNK, ULK, NCL or BTR.</p>

<p>If the following occurs, refer to staff with access to change limiting dates&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>NSS </strong>and <strong>PGA</strong> system <strong>BLK</strong> limiting dates can be moved even if the customer is not current</li>
		<li>
<strong>PEN</strong> system <strong>BLK</strong> limiting dates <strong>cannot</strong> be moved unless the customer is current in the <strong>PEN</strong> system</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Limiting date has a reason of Remediation Update (REM)</strong></p>

<p>If there are limiting date impacts in the required system with the reason <strong>REM</strong>, manual action is needed when making updates to the customer’s record that will interact with the recorded averaged income information.</p>

<p>The <strong>REM </strong>limiting date will be the debt end date plus one day of the averaged debt. Staff need to remediate the customer’s record, returning it to its pre-averaged state, from the first EPSD of the coding of the averaged income review period.</p>

<p>In most cases, arrears will not be payable to the customer. If an update to a customer’s record has created arrears payments outside the debt period, make a decision under section 109(4) or 109(5) of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 if these are payable to the customer.</p>

<p>If the arrears do not match the income compliance debt or if the decision is to pay the arrears generated, the case must be referred to a Quality Development Officer (QDO) for advice on how to progress the activity.</p>

<p>If arrears are present, ensure adjustments are made only on income support payment arrears. If there are arrears for Families or Student payments, these will need to be assessed separately. If needing more help to action Families or Student arrears, refer to a QDO. See <a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-20082025-06.html">relevant training</a>.</p>

<p>If staff cannot determine what the working credit balance should be, a manual calculation using Multical is needed. This is to check if the customer has been paid the correct rate of payment. The calculation needs to cover the period from the start of the remediated income until after the hard limiting date. This will allow the correct calculation of working credits.</p>

<p>Staff may need to correct the customer’s working credit balance to allow the system to make further assessments to identify other impacts. For more information on amending working credit balances, see <a target="_blank" href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07020000-01.html">Working Credit</a>.</p>

<p>Check the customer record to see if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer has a subsequent income related debt raised for the same payment type after the review, and</li>
		<li>
the debt was raised before the limiting date</li>
		</ul>
<p>If there is a subsequent debt, the manual calculation will start from the EPSD of the averaged income until the end date of the subsequent debt. If the subsequent debt needs amending, see <a target="_blank" href="../debts/107-04010050-03.html">Changing account details on debts raised in the Debt Management and Information System (DMIS)</a>.</p>

<p>Consider impacts to the customer’s rate after the debt period where incorrect working credit balance was applied due to coding of income averaged ATO data. The customer may have reported earnings with an event date after the debt period.</p>

<p>If having coding issues with MultiCal, see the <a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-20082025-05.html#bp05_L2GT_MultiCal_Proble">Resources</a> page for the Multical Problems guide. For more help, check with a QDO.</p>

<p>All MultiCal debt calculations must be saved to FileNet and printed, scanned and uploaded to the customer's record. See Steps 12 and 13 in <a target="_blank" href="../debts/107-03020030-03.html">Using the MultiCal debt calculator</a>.</p>
