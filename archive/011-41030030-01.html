<div class="twisty">
	
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_CDBS_eligibility"></a>
<h2 id="_Toc344898764">CDBS eligibility</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The CDBS covers part or the full cost of some basic dental services for eligible children when&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they are eligible for Medicare</li>
		<li>
they are between 0 and 17 years old for at least 1 day that year, and</li>
		<li>
the parent/guardian gets an eligible payment that is specific to each child/teenager for at least 1 day in the year, or</li>
		<li>
the child/teenager gets an eligible payment for at least one day in the year</li>
		</ul>
<p>The <a href="../your-health/011-41030030-05.html">Resources</a> page has links to the CDBS page and eligible payments on the Services Australia website.</p>

<p>A child/teenager's eligibility for the CDBS is assessed at the beginning of each calendar year and is valid for the entire year. If the child/teenager is not eligible at the beginning of the year, and becomes eligible at a later date they can claim a CDBS service from 1 January of that calendar year. Lump sum customers will receive eligibility in the calendar year following the financial year to which their Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A lump sum claim relates.</p>

<p>The eligibility criteria does not need to be met on the same day, however the child/teenager must be Medicare eligible at the date of service.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the child/teenager (or their parent or guardian) should contact their dentist to confirm if the dentist is participating in the CDBS before making an appointment.</p>

<p><strong>FTB Part A eligibility for CDBS</strong></p>

<p>A child/teenager’s eligibility for the CDBS varies depending on the way a parent/guardians FTB Part A claim is paid. There are 2 types of FTB Part A claims&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Instalment customers - includes zero rate and those who have elected to defer their instalments</li>
		<li>
Lump sum customers</li>
		</ul>
<p>A parent/guardian or a child/teenager who is aged 0 to 17 year on any one day of the calendar year and is in receipt of FTB Part A is eligible to receive benefits under the CDBS.</p>

<p>Partners of the child/teenager who are in receipt of FTB Part A are eligible to receive benefits under the CDBS, provided they also meet the age and Medicare eligibility criteria.</p>

<p>For further details about FTB Part A eligibility, see <a target="_blank" href="../families/007-07040000-01.html">Eligibility for FTB</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Instalment customers</strong></p>

<p>Child/teenagers are considered eligible for that calendar year when a fortnightly FTB Part A payment or assessment is received at any time during a calendar year before 31 December.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Current FTB customers can choose to receive payments fortnightly or at the end of the financial year for FTB Part A if they are eligible (including zero rate)</li>
		<li>
Eligibility for CDBS is dependent on all eligibility criteria being met</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Zero rate</strong></p>

<p>Customers who think their income estimate may reach the threshold, nominate the zero rate option to prevent any overpayments occurring. These customers are still entitled to CDBS based on their income estimate however, they are not able to claim CDBS services until after they have lodged their tax return at the end of the financial year and received their FTB Part A payment.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if Centrelink stops instalment payments because the customer’s estimate is too high, the customer will change from an instalment claimant to a lump sum claimant. The customer will miss eligibility for the current calendar year due to changing the method of how the FTB Part A payment is claimed.</p>

<p><strong>Lump sum customers</strong></p>

<p>A parent/guardian who claims FTB Part A as a lump sum for eligible children will be eligible for the CDBS in the calendar year immediately following the financial year that the FTB Part A claim relates. The child needs to be aged between 0 to 17 years on any one day of the calendar year that the claim relates.</p>

<p><strong>Examples&#58;</strong></p>

<p>If the FTB lump sum claim is lodged and processed between 1 July and 31 December, CDBS eligibility will be granted from the beginning of the next calendar year for a period of 12 months. Customers that claim their FTB (A) by instalment will be deemed eligible for CDBS immediately following their FTB (A) being granted by the agency.</p>

<p>If the FTB lump sum claim is lodged and processed between 1 January and 30 June for the previous financial year the customer will receive CDBS eligibility as soon as the payment is granted. They will be eligible for the whole of that calendar year. Customers that claim their FTB (A) by instalment will be deemed eligible for CDBS immediately following their FTB (A) being granted by the agency.</p>

<p>A child/teenager must be aged 0-17 years for at least 1 day of the calendar year in which the FTB (A) payment grants them eligibility. The <a href="../your-health/011-41030030-05.html">Resources</a> page outlines the period of CDBS eligibility for the relevant FTB Part A claim period.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> eligibility for CDBS may be confirmed after the actual period of eligibility has passed. Under these circumstances, a notification to confirm CDBS eligibility is not issued.</p>

<p><strong>DVA eligible child/teenager</strong></p>

<p>Veterans' Children Education Scheme (VCES) and Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act Education and Training Scheme (MRCAETS) eligible children/teenagers are only included under the CDBS once their parent or guardian has consented to the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) to provide the child/teenager’s details to Services Australia.</p>

<p>DVA is responsible for identifying recipients of the payments, eligible children/teenagers and seeking consent. Without their parent or guardian’s consent, these children/teenagers are not eligible for CDBS.</p>

<p>Enquiries about DVA eligibility should be directed to Department of Veterans’ Affairs. For contact details see Child Dental Benefits Schedule (CDBS).</p>

<p>The <a href="../your-health/011-41030030-03.html">Process</a> page has instructions on how to view the relevant 2 year period in CDBS.</p>

<p><strong>Patients eligible for the second year of the CDBS</strong></p>

<p>In the second calendar year, the child/teenager will only be able to access dental services under CDBS if they meet the eligibility criteria again.</p>

<p><strong>Patients NOT eligible for the second year of the CDBS</strong></p>

<p>There could be a number of reasons why a child/teenager will not qualify for eligibility in the second calendar year for CDBS.</p>

<p>Child/teenager is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
not eligible for Medicare</li>
		<li>
has lost eligibility for certain Government payments through Centrelink which granted eligibility for CDBS in the first year</li>
		<li>
not aged between 0 and 17 years</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Issuing a notification for the second year of the CDBS</strong></p>

<p>Children/teenagers who become eligible for the second year of the CDBS are automatically sent a notification of their eligibility. Notification letters are also available through myGov for customers that prefer their mail electronically.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the maximum benefit cap was used in the first calendar year and the child/teenager is still eligible in the second calendar year a notification will still be sent advising of eligibility.</p>

<p><strong>Cap balance/amount for the second year of the CDBS</strong></p>

<p>If the full benefit cap is not used in the first year, the remainder can be used in the second year providing the child/teenager remains eligible.</p>

<p>If the maximum benefit <a href="../your-health/011-41030020-01.html">cap</a> was used in the first calendar year and the child/teenager is eligible in the following calendar year, they will not be able to access services under CDBS in the second calendar year period. Benefits for CDBS services over the benefits cap will not be paid.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the remaining benefit cap is not transferable between children/teenagers under any circumstances.</p>

		<li>
equal shared care arrangements - if the percentage of care is equal shared care and both are receiving the payments then both parents/guardians will receive a notification of eligibility</li>

<p>Eligibility of the child/teenager is determined using customer data from either Centrelink or DVA and is matched to their Medicare records. Eligibility data is provided to the Medicare system from&#58;</p>

Centrelink daily</li>

DVA monthly</li>

<p>Lump sum Family Tax Benefit (FTB) customers receive a notification of eligibility in the calendar year following the financial year to which their FTB Part A claim relates.

<p>A CDBS notification may not have been issued/reissued or received if the&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Child/teenager is newly eligible and the notification has not been issued yet. The parent/guardian or child/teenager or their partner who claims Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A as a lump sum is eligible for the CDBS in the calendar year immediately following the financial year that the FTB Part A claim relates. For example, in 2021 the customer lodged a lump sum claim for the 2020 financial year, therefore eligibility for CDBS will be granted in the 2022 calendar year.</li>
		<li>
Information has not been received from the Centrelink system, DVA, or the information is incomplete or does not match Medicare service records (referred to as unmatched or mismatched data).</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Unmatched data</strong></p>

<p>When a child/teenager's details are sent from either the Centrelink or DVA system and does <strong>not match</strong> Medicare data, the child/teenager is not recognised as eligible for CDBS. This could be due to inconsistencies or missing details within each program when the data is transmitted to Medicare.</p>

<p>The following customer details may be affected&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
full name</li>
		<li>
date of birth</li>
		<li>
gender</li>
		</ul>
