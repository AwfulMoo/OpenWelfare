<p>A student or apprentice who has a change in circumstances may no longer be entitled to away from home rate. A Service Officer is required to determine whether the change in circumstances warrants the cessation of away from home rate, and if so, the appropriate date for it to cease.</p>

<p>The most common changes in circumstances that affect eligibility to away from home rate are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the student is moving or has moved back to the permanent home</li>
		<li>
the circumstances that made the student eligible for away from home rate have changed</li>
		<li>
a student discontinues or completes a course of study</li>
		<li>
a secondary non schooling, tertiary student or Australian Apprentice is temporarily returning to the parental home and not maintaining their residence at the study or Australian Apprenticeship location</li>
		</ul>
<p>The correct end date for payment of away from home rate is determined by the activity the student is involved in.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic which occurred in Australia from March 2020, some students were required to leave their on campus term accommodation. Many students also transitioned to online study as face-to-face teaching was unavailable.</p>

<p>Students who were receiving the away from home rate, and temporarily transitioned to online learning as a result of COVID-19, remain eligible for the away from home rate. Tertiary students must return to face-to-face study as soon as it becomes available to continue to be eligible for the away from home rate.</p>

<p>Where a student had to move out of education provider accommodation (such as on campus) and are, or were temporarily staying with their parents, will remain eligible for the away from home rate providing they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
remain enrolled in their course of study, and</li>
		<li>
intend to return to their campus accommodation as soon as the education provider allows them to return</li>
		</ul>
<p>This includes students who&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
had their accommodation arrangement cancelled by the education provider and have moved their belongings out of that accommodation</li>
		<li>
were approved for the Residential Cost Option (RCO)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the away from home rate of ABSTUDY Living Allowance can be paid for any period that the education provider does not charge a residential fee, rather than the reduced rate of Living Allowance.</p>

The ABSTUDY must continue to remain current until the end of the term entitlement period, for example, 31 December, and then the YA can be granted if eligible.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Prior to 1 January 2019, the end date for payment of away from home allowances for a secondary school student who ceases eligibility for away from home rate, was significantly different for students who reside at a boarding school, in an approved ABSTUDY Homestay arrangement, or at a hostel which is a signatory to the <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-02060040-01.html">ABSTUDY Hostel Agreement</a>.</p>

<p>Students who resided at a boarding school, ABSTUDY Homestay arrangement, or at a signatory hostel, had their <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-02060020-01.html">payments directed to the boarding institution</a>. In some circumstances, the school or hostel could retain the boarding allowances for a period after the student had discontinued boarding at the institution. Schools that would, as a condition of their enrolment policy, retain full term payment for a student who discontinued during a term, were entitled to retain the full ABSTUDY term-in-advance payment, see the <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-02070150-05.html">Resources</a> page.</p>

<p>A hostel that is a signatory to the ABSTUDY Hostel Agreement was entitled to retain the away from home rate entitlements until either the&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>sixth Friday of the school term</strong> if they became eligible for Living Allowance <strong>from</strong> the commencement of the term entitlement period, or</li>
		<li>
<strong>the sixth Friday after the student became eligible for Living Allowance</strong>, if they began to receive Living Allowance <strong>after</strong> the commencement of the term entitlement period, provided this does not extend beyond the end of the term entitlement period</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the student discontinues study, or leaves the hostel after 6 weeks of taking up residence, then the hostel is entitled to payments up until the date they discontinue studies or residing at the hostel, whichever was earlier.</p>

<p>Under no circumstances could a boarding school or hostel retain boarding allowances for a student who did not commence at all in a term, irrespective of their fee policy.</p>

<p>In this circumstance, whilst the boarding institution or hostel was entitled to retain away from home entitlements already received via a term-in-advance payment for a period after the student discontinues, the student is deemed to have <strong>ceased eligibility to</strong> away from home rate from the date determined by this procedure.</p>

<p>The above did not apply to boarders with private boarding arrangements. In these situations, entitlements to term-in-advance and other entitlements such as School Fees Allowance (Group 2) are subject to the entitlement provisions for Living Allowance.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the student was <strong>not</strong> entitled to any fortnightly <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-02060020-01.html">residual boarding entitlement</a> from the date they are deemed to have ceased eligibility for the away from home rate. The student could not access alternate ABSTUDY allowances for any period the boarding institution or hostel retained ABSTUDY away from home allowances.</p>
