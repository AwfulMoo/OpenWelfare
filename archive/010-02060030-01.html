<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic which occurred in Australia from March 2020, some boarding providers closed and others had reduced capacity due to social distancing requirements within the board facility. Additionally, some students may not be able to return to their private board arrangements. Students who returned to the permanent home and did not return to their boarding arrangements in Term 2, 3 or 4 in 2020 or Terms 3 or 4 of 2021 may continue to be entitled to the away from home rate.</p>

<p><strong>Continuing students</strong></p>

<p>Students remain entitled to the away from home rate in Term 2, 3 and 4 in 2020 or Term 3 and 4 of 2021 if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they were approved for boarding entitlements in the term immediately prior</li>
		<li>
their board provider holds a boarding place for them</li>
		<li>
the student intends to return to board as soon as possible, and</li>
		<li>
the school/board provider continues to support the student study remotely using other methods, such as online</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Continuing students who changed board providers</strong></p>

<p>Entitlement to the away from home rate for continuing students who commenced with a new board provider in Term 2 in 2020 or Term 3 of 2021 was dependant on their study mode and enrolment or acceptance date, regardless of whether they qualified in Term 1 2020 or Term 2 2021. The following students remained entitled&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
students who attended in person, or</li>
		<li>
students studying remotely and who were accepted to board before the end of Term 1 in 2020 or Term 2 of 2021 to commence in Term 2 in 2020 or Terms 3 of 2021, and</li>
		<li>
continue to meet an <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-02060000-01.html">away from home</a> criteria for Term 2 in 2020 or Term 3 of 2021</li>
		</ul>
<p>Students with a new boarding provider, who were accepted to board after the start of Term 2 in 2020 or Term 3 of 2021 were not entitled to the away from home rate for Term 2 in 2020 or Term 3 of 2021 where they did not attend in person.</p>

<p>Continuing students who started with a new boarding provider in Term 3 or 4 in 2020 or Term 4 of 2021 were only entitled if they physically attended the new boarding provider during the term they commenced.</p>

<p><strong>New Claims</strong></p>

<p>For ABSTUDY boarding claims granted from 1 April 2020, a student will be entitled to the away from home rate in Term 2 if they were&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
accepted to board before the end of Term 1 and will study either in person or online during Term 2, or</li>
		<li>
accepted to board after the start of Term 2 and will physically attend at the boarding provider during Term 2</li>
		</ul>
<p>For ABSTUDY boarding claims granted from 1 July 2021, a student will be entitled to the away from home rate in Term 3 if they were&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
accepted to board before the end of Term 2 and will study either in person or online during Term 3, or</li>
		<li>
accepted to board after the start of Term 3 and will physically attend at the boarding provider during Term 3</li>
		</ul>
<p>For ABSTUDY boarding claims granted from 1 July 2020 for Term 3 or 1 October 2020 or 2021 for Term 4, the student is entitled to the away from home rate only where they physically attended the boarding provider during the term they commenced.</p>

<p>Where students with new claims were entitled to the away from home rate, claims should be assessed as per <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-02020050-01.html">Assessing a claim for ABSTUDY Schooling B Award, Tertiary Award and Masters and Doctorate Award</a>.

<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, which occurred in Australia from March 2020, some students were required to leave their on campus term accommodation. Many students also transitioned to online study as face-to-face teaching was unavailable.</p>

<p>Students who were receiving the away from home rate, and temporarily transitioned to online learning as a result of COVID-19 remain eligible for the away from home rate. Tertiary students must return to face-to-face study as soon as it becomes available to continue to be eligible for the away from home rate.</p>

<p>Where a student had to move out of education provider accommodation (such as on campus) and are, or were temporarily staying with their parents, they will remain eligible for the away from home rate providing they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
remain enrolled in their course of study, and</li>
		<li>
intend to return to their campus accommodation as soon as the education provider allows them to return</li>
		</ul>
<p>This includes students who&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
had their accommodation arrangement cancelled by the education provider and have moved their belongings out of that accommodation</li>
		<li>
were approved for Residential Cost Option (RCO)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the away from home rate of ABSTUDY Living Allowance can be paid for any period that the education provider does not charge a residential fee, rather than the reduced rate of Living Allowance.</p>

<p>The coding required for a secondary school student varies slightly in respect of students boarding at hostels, boarding schools, or in an approved ABSTUDY Homestay arrangement, and students boarding privately. Some coding specific to tertiary, secondary non-schooling students and Australian Apprentices is also different to secondary school students. This reflects key entitlement differences between secondary, secondary non-schooling and tertiary students, with additional allowances available to secondary students.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> ABSTUDY secondary school students approved for the away from home rate are entitled to receive the full package of away from home allowances for the full <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-02060010-01.html">period of eligibility for away from home rate</a>.
