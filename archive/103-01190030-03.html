<p>To determine if Voluntary Income Management is appropriate, advise the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
how Income Management works</li>
		<li>
when they are exited from an agreement, a 21 day waiting period will apply from the date they are exited, before any new agreement can be entered into, and</li>
		<li>
they can only apply for Voluntary Income Management four times in any 12 month period</li>
		</ul>
<p>Consider the customer's net payment when discussing options with the customer.</p>

<p>If the customer is receiving an insufficient amount of income support payment, Voluntary Income Management may not benefit the customer. For example, a customer may only receive income managed funds of $50 due to earnings and the only expense that can be covered is electricity. In this case, Centrepay would be a better choice for the customer.</p>

<p>Discuss alternative options with the customer about managing their money. For example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Have they considered <a target="_blank" href="../payment-delivery/103-09000000-01.html">Centrepay deductions</a>?</li>
		<li>
Have they considered a payment <a target="_blank" href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-04090010-01.html">nominee</a>?</li>
		<li>
Have they considered participating in <a target="_blank" href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-11020000-01.html">Financial Wellbeing and Capability Activities</a> or financial counselling?</li>
		<li>
Advise the customer they can visit <strong>servicesaustralia.gov.au/managingmoney</strong> for useful information and resources</li>		</ul>

<p>Before progressing with the interview, provide the customer with an overview of a Voluntary Income Management Agreement, including&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the mandatory 13 week period of Voluntary Income Management</li>
		<li>
how they can request to end Income Management any time after 13 weeks, or</li>
		<li>
the agency can end Income Management if they lose eligibility or it is no longer feasible</li>
