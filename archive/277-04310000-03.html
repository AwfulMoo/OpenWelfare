the incomes used in the assessment for all relevant parties</li>
		<li>
the use of estimates of income.

		<li>
the use of all Amended Taxable incomes since 1 July 2008 to ensure they are in line with the revised amended taxable income policy. If not, an error correction submission needs to be completed and emailed to a Service Support Officer (SSO) for review</li>
		</ul>
<p>Ensure all relevant collection options have been investigated and appropriate administrative enforcement actions taken.</p>

<p>The Debt Enforcement PSM will make an initial decision on whether the case may be suitable for debt enforcement action. Because the customer and the Child Support Registrar cannot take court action for the same debt, at this point there may need to be discussion with the customer about their intentions.</p>

establish their reasons for taking court action, for example inaction/delay, new information, hope that action will prompt payment , and if the customer has not sought legal advice suggest that this is an option they should consider</li>
		<li>
ask what orders/enforcement action they will be seeking from the court. Advise that where possible the agency will implement any court orders which impact on the assessment but will not enforce orders obtained if the customer who owes the debt fails to comply</li>
		<li>
advise that while they are taking enforcement action, the agency is not prevented from continuing or commencing administrative collection action. Therefore, it is essential that open communication occurs to ensure collection action undertaken by either party is not jeopardised</li>
		<li>
advise that because the debt may change, they should contact the agency prior to any court date or settlement to confirm the current amount of the debt. It is also important that they notify the agency of any changes to care, income and Naps throughout the process</li>
		<li>
advise that both the assessment and the debt may change in the future as a result of updated information or review of the assessment, that is by a change of assessment or objection, and any changes to the assessment will be confirmed to them in writing</li>
		<li>
advise of any relevant action taken, or about to be taken, to collect or correct the debt. This will allow the customer to make an informed decision on whether to continue their court action. Do not discuss the advantages and disadvantages of their court action or discuss if they should continue</li>

<p><strong>Inform the customer of debt collection and correction</strong></p>

<p>While the customer is taking action to legally enforce collectable debt, the agency must keep them informed of any action taken to correct or collect the debt. The case must be monitored and the customer kept informed. The information to be provided may include the details of&#58;</p>

debt correction</li>
		<li>
any payment arrangements made with the customer who owes the debt</li>

any successful administrative action which may include s72A notices, Employer Withholdings, Tax Refund Intercept Payments etc.</li>
		<li>
lodgement of a proof of debt if the customer is an undischarged bankrupt</li>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> do not provide personal information about the customer who owes the debt or third parties such as employer names when advising the customer of any correction/collection action.

<p>The applicant customer can file a court application for enforcement of the debt. The agency is not a party to the enforcement proceedings brought by the applicant customer.

There is no time limit for the applicant customer (after giving the agency at least 14 days' notice) to file an enforcement summons application to the court.</p>

<p>Generally, the agency will only consider intervening if the customer owes a debt on more than 1 case and there is an indication that there is a viable collection opportunity. This will ensure that the court considers the customer's total debt and that any resulting court order on this debt assists with child support collection on all relevant cases.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when the agency intervenes in a customer enforcement proceeding, the agency becomes liable for our costs and may be subject to costs orders.</p>

<p>Once approval to intervene has been received, the Litigation and Information Release Branch (LIR) will instruct an external legal service provider. The case will be allocated to a Debt Enforcement Service Officer in the relevant litigation team. </p>

<p>The Debt Enforcement Service Officer will email the GO requesting the Recovery of Debt by Customers Register be updated. From this point on, the case will be managed in line with the <a href="../separated-parents/277-04220030-01.html">Taking a Child Support customer to court</a> procedure.</p>

<p>Contact both customers by phone to discuss the case and any actions the agency have taken or will take in relation to legal action. Also advise both customers of the current debt and ongoing liability. Inform them they will need to contact the agency prior to any court dates or settlements to confirm if the debt has changed.</p>

<p>Advise the customers that where possible, the agency will provide any documentation they require for the court action, at their request. For example, assessment letters, notes or transaction statements. </p>

<p>The agency is still bound by privacy and secrecy provisions and even in response to a subpoena, the agency may not be able to provide all documentation they request.

		<ul>		<li>
the agency wishes to intervene in the proceeding, or </li>
		<li>

<p>Also advise that where possible the agency will implement any court orders which impact on the assessment but will not enforce orders obtained by the applicant customer if the customer who owes the debt fails to comply.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> until the customer is served with the copy of the applicant’s court application, the agency cannot discuss or advise the customer who owes the debt of the proposed enforcement action. Therefore, the Service Officer should contact the applicant customer in the first instance to confirm if service has been effected on the respondent customer.</p>

<p><strong>The general apportionment process does not apply.</strong></p>
