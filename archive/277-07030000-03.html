<p>The residency status of a parent will affect what income information Child Support is able to use in a child support assessment. When calculating adjusted taxable income for parents living overseas different rules apply about what information to use and how to obtain it depending on the parent's residency.</p>

<p>Prior to determining a parent's adjusted taxable income, ensure the residency of the parent has been considered and decided. If residency has previously been determined, check if the parent's residency status had changed&#58;</p>

during the last relevant year of income</li>

<p>Child Support may be required to determine an income for a parent when making an assessment at the commencement of a new child support period. All assessments use the last relevant year of income to determine a parent's adjusted taxable income for a child support period. However, the income period of the last relevant year of income may differ depending on the customer's residence status at the beginning of the child support period.</p>

<p>The receipt of a new overseas taxable income does not trigger a new child support period. The <a href="../separated-parents/277-07030000-04.html">References</a> page contains a link to information about when child support periods start.</p>

<p>Where a new overseas taxable income is received and there is no trigger for a new Child Support Period, <a href="../separated-parents/277-07030000-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Load_income_inf">load the income</a> with a recorded status. This allows for the information to be available in the future if/when a new child support period is created.</p>

<p>The <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/elements/macros/InternationalIncomeConverter.html">International Income Converter</a> provides the conversion rates for the financial years of different countries.</p>

<p>If the International Income Converter does not list the currency or the year to be converted, convert the income manually using the average exchange rate of the financial year in which the money was earned or derived and round off to the nearest whole dollar. Request the exchange rate to apply, email the International Disbursements Team.</p>

<p>If a parent is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction at the commencement of a new child support period, the income period for the last relevant year of income is the last completed financial year for the country in which the parent is resident. Child Support will determine the parent's adjusted taxable income using any income earned or derived (whether overseas or in Australia) during that income period.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>

<p>Jane is a resident of New Zealand. A new child support period is due to commence on 1 May 2008. Because the New Zealand financial year runs from 1 April to 31 March, Child Support will request details for the income period 1 April 2007 to 31 March 2008.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>

<p>Jim left Australia in July 2008 and is currently a resident of the UK. A new child support period is due to commence on 7 September 2008. The UK financial year runs from 6 April to 5 April and so, because Jim is currently a resident of the UK, Child Support ask Jim to supply details of income earned in Australia for the income period 6 April 2007 to 5 April 2008.</p>

<p>If the parent is currently resident in a reciprocating jurisdiction, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-07030000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Determine_incom_Step02">Step 2 in Table 2</a>.</p>

<div class="showcont">


<p>If the parent was a resident overseas for a time, but is a resident of Australia at the commencement of a new child support period, the income period for the last relevant year of income is the last completed Australian financial year.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>Jo lived in New Zealand up until January 2008, but relocated to Australia in February 2008. A new child support assessment is due to commence on 2 July 2008. Because Jo currently lives in Australia, Child Support will determine Jo's income using the Australian financial year 1 July 2007 to 30 June 2008 as the income period.</p>

<p>If the parent is currently a resident of Australia, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-07030000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Determine_incom_Step04">Step 4 in Table 2</a>.</p>

<p>Jake is a resident of a non-reciprocating jurisdiction. Jake claims child support for children who are citizens of Australia (and eligible children). A new child support assessment is due to commence on 6 November 2008. Child Support will determine Jake's income according to the domestic income rules, using the Australian financial year 1 July 2007 to 30 June 2008. Any income that Jake earned during this income period may be included as either Australian taxable income (if it was earned in Australia and is taxable income) or as target foreign income (if it was earned outside Australia).

<p>Most child support periods generate automatically, however in some instances they need to be created manually. In these cases a New Income intray is generated by Cuba. This alerts Child Support that an income has been lodged by a parent in Australia which affects their assessment, requiring the creation of a new child support period. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-30010120-01.html">Child Support Period Management Cuba Process Help</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Child Support's business rule is that it is practicable to make an assessment in the month that the tax assessment issues if it issues on or before the 15th of the month. If the tax assessment issues after the 15th of the month the Registrar will make the assessment in the following month and commence that assessment and a new child support period on the first of the month after that.</p>

<p>The Child Support business rule must be adhered to when manually creating new child support periods. This applies even if the month in which the tax assessment was issued has passed.</p>

<strong>New Income</strong> - when a new income is received for a payee from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO)</li>

<p>Income information for payers located in New Zealand is sourced from Inland Revenue, New Zealand (NZIR).</p>

<p>NZIR provide the incomes at the end of May and are saved in the G&#58; drive under Hobart - Int - NZ - NZ Incomes (YEAR). For access to this drive, email the International NZ Administration Team to request the income.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the request from Child Support identifies payers located in New Zealand at a specific point in time.

<p>Where a parent is a resident of Australia and they have earned or derived income from an overseas jurisdiction, this may be recorded as Target Foreign Income. Target Foreign Income is included in the adjusted taxable income used in their assessment.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a person earns income from overseas, and they are an Australian resident for taxation purposes, they may be required to declare this income to the ATO. The ATO may make a decision that amounts of income earned overseas do not need to be included in their taxable income.

<p>If a parent's residency status changes during the last relevant year of income, a combination of different types of income may be required.</p>

<p>If a parent was a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction for part of the relevant income period but is a resident of Australia at the commencement of a child support period, use the person's Australian taxable income and any overseas income earned during the financial year.</p>

<p>If a parent was residing in Australia but is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction at the commencement of a child support period, use their overseas income and any Australian income earned during the financial year that most recently ended in the country where the customer now resides.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>Lauren moved to Germany in August 2008. The new child support period commences in March 2009. As Lauren is a resident of Germany when the child support period commences, the income period Child Support will use will be the most recently ended German financial year (01 January 2008 to 31 December 2008).</p>

<p>Lauren lived in Australia for part of this period (January to July 2008). Child Support will combine Lauren's Australian income for that period with the German income for the period August to December 2008 to provide an overall income figure for use in Lauren's assessment.</p>

<p>When making a new assessment for child support it is essential to obtain the most accurate income information possible from both customers. The best possible income information available should be used. The priority of incomes to use in assessments is the same for both domestic and international parents. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-07010000-01.html">Income processing for Child Support customers.</a></p>

<div class="showcont">


<p>Contact the parent by telephone to obtain a verbal Income Tax Declaration (ITD). For international telephone calls, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-01010000-01.html">Contact with Child Support customers</a>.</p>

<p>Explain to the customer that an ITD is a formal declaration of their income for a past financial year and should include all sources of income. Use the <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/elements/macros/CustomerDeclaredIncome.html">Customer declared income (ITD) macro</a> to record the parent's income details.</p>

<p>The Service Officer must be satisfied that the income details provided by the parent are a reasonable approximation of their last relevant year of income. This assessment will be made on a case by case basis.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>Child Support are currently using an income of 2/3 MTAWE to calculate Joseph's child support. Joseph contacts Child Support and advises that his income for the Last Relevant Year of Income (LRYI) was £50,000. This amount is supported by detailed verbal information provided about Joseph’s earnings, deductions, employment type and hours worked. Based on Joseph's income history, employment circumstances and the income information supplied, the Service Officer is satisfied that £50,000 is Joseph's income for the LRYI.</p>

<p>If the Service Officer is not satisfied that the income declaration is a reasonable approximation of income, written evidence must be requested from the parent.</p>

<p>The type of evidence that can be required will vary from case to case, but may include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a copy of a tax assessment issued by the relevant taxation authority in the parent's country of residence</li>
		<li>
certification from employers such as a group certificate equivalent or payslips</li>
		<li>
a statement from a relevant government department showing payments made to the parent</li>
		<li>
documentation from an accountant or tax agent</li>
		</ul>
<p>The <a target="_blank" class="extwebsitelink" href="https&#58;//www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/customer/forms/cs4145">Income Declaration - Overseas Income (IDF) form</a> provides guidance around what information Child Support should request.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> some countries, for example the USA, allow couples to lodge joint tax returns. Child Support is not necessarily limited to apportioning 50% of the return as evidence of income.</p>

<p>The following steps will enable a determination to be made&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Analyse the document to see if an apportionment has already been determined by the other jurisdiction, and if not</li>
		<li>
Determine if the parent has made a clear notation of the apportionment or provided extra evidence, that is a letter from accountant or employer enabling a decision to be made, and if not</li>
		<li>
Contact the parent and query the apportionment. If the figure quoted is inconsistent with apportionments in previous years or seems unreasonable, seek clarification from the parent. If contact cannot be made, seek help from a Service Support Officer. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-09140000-01.html">Technical support in Child Support</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>Apportionment may be possible using historical information. That is if the income was a 70/30 split in previous years it may be considered reasonable for this to apply. In the absence of any information other than the joint tax return a 50/50 split may be considered the most appropriate apportionment.</p>

<p>If Service Officers are not satisfied that the income provided by the customer is accurate, it is not appropriate to use that income to assess child support. This may be the case if the Service Officer locates other income the customer is unwilling to include in their declaration of income or, cannot explain.</p>

<p>If contact with the parent has been established and the Service Officer is satisfied there is sufficient and accurate income information to determine the parent's adjusted taxable income, <a href="../separated-parents/277-07030000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Gather_the_most_Step05">go to Step 5</a>.</p>

<p>If contact with the parent has been established, but the Service Officer is not satisfied the income information they provided was sufficient or accurate&#58;</p>

<p>If an OS taxable income is not recorded for a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction for the LRYI, then a provisional income will be applied.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
a zero income will be applied automatically by Cuba if the circumstances of the case permit it</li>
		<li>
an income based on sufficient information for the LRYI can be manually calculated and loaded as a <strong>Derived income</strong> in Cuba</li>
		<li>
if an OS taxable income has been recorded for the financial year immediately prior to the LRYI, Cuba will apply the ATI indexation factor to this income and use it to calculate child support if it is higher or lower than 2/3 MTAWE. (Cuba will display a <strong>Deemed</strong> income)</li>
		<li>
if an OS taxable or ATO taxable income has been recorded for an older financial year, Cuba will apply the ATI indexation factor to this income and use it to calculate child support if the income is greater than or equal to 2/3 MTAWE. (Cuba will display an <strong>Indexed Default</strong> income)</li>
		<li>
if no OS taxable or ATO taxable income has been recorded, 2/3 MTAWE will be used to calculate child support. (Cuba will display as <strong>2/3 MTAWE</strong>)</li>
		<li>
if a provisional income is recorded for a customer, attempt to locate a better income including&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
contacting the customer and asking them to provide their income details</li>
			<li>
manually deriving an income based on the available income information for the relevant financial year, and</li>
			<li>
send a Request for Overseas Income letter</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>For additional information, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-07010000-01.html">Income processing for Child Support customers.</a></p>

<p>In any circumstances where Child Support intends to use a provisional income for a parent who is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction a s162A(1) notice must first be issued where a valid address exists for the parent and/or where there is a Central Authority from whom Child Support can reasonably request income information, that is, New Zealand, Sweden or Norway.</p>

<p>If unable to obtain income information for a parent who resides in a reciprocating jurisdiction and a s162A(1) notice in respect of that parent is not able to be issued, see the <strong>Apply a Zero Income</strong> section below.</p>

<p>Child Support will only update a provisional income with another provisional income if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Child Support have new income information that is more reliable and more accurate than the old provisional income</li>
		<li>
the new information enables Child Support to calculate a <strong>Derived Income</strong>, and</li>
		<li>
all efforts to contact the parent to obtain a parent supplied income have failed</li>

<p>It may be appropriate to determine a provisional income of an amount other than 2/3 MTAWE if a response to a 'Request for Overseas Income' letter has not been received and&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
sufficient income information to manually calculate an income for the relevant financial year has been located. Load a Child Support derived income according to the <a href="../separated-parents/277-07010000-01.html">Income processing for Child Support customers.</a> A manually derived income could be based on a combination of income information provided from the customer and other information the Service Officer has located. This income can be higher or lower than 2/3 MTAWE</li>
		<li>
the Service Officer confirms the parent's current occupation and has a reasonable idea of what their income would be (based on relevant evidence). If this amount is greater than 2/3 MTAWE this is a more reliable default income to use in the assessment. Load as a <strong>Default</strong> income in Cuba</li>
		<li>
an internet search shows the parent is a director of a multi-national company and based on relevant evidence the Service Officer has a reasonable idea of what their income would be, then this amount should be loaded as a <strong>Default</strong> income in Cuba</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if Child Support is using a <strong>Default</strong> income, they cannot use an income less than 2/3 MTAWE if calculating an overseas income. This is always the case, even if they consider that a parent’s income is likely to be less than 2/3 MTAWE because, for example, Child Support is aware the parent lives in a developing country.</p>

		<li>
the parent was not required to lodge an Australian tax return for the LRYI, and</li>
		<li>
Child Support cannot determine an income amount for the parent</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Service Officers can issue a Request for customer's overseas income from CA letter to Sweden and Norway and can obtain information from New Zealand via the hook-up <a href="../separated-parents/277-08260000-01.html">spreadsheet</a>. If the parent is resident in any other reciprocating jurisdiction Service Officers are unable to issue a section 162A(1) notice to the relevant central authority.</p>

<p>Generally, Child Support will assume that a person who has not been a resident of Australia for any part of the most recently ended Australian financial year is not required to lodge an Australian tax return for that year.</p>

<p>Before determining a parent is untraceable, Service Officers must&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
contact the other parent to ask if they have any new contact information for the parent, and</li>
		<li>
attempt to locate the parent using internet search engines such as Google, and any other electronic telephone directories that may be available</li>
		</ul>
<p>This zero income will be loaded into Cuba as a DEFAULT income as there is currently no better option to use in Cuba. However, the zero income is not a default income and should not be referred to as such. Child Support are legislatively unable to apply a default income of less than 2/3 MTAWE. For a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 requires that a section 162A(1) notice be issued before a default income is applied. In circumstances where Child Support cannot issue a s162A(1) notice to the parent or the Central Authority, Child Support are therefore legislatively unable to determine any income amount for the parent.</p>

<p>If the parent can be located and better income information is found at a later time, update the parent's income as appropriate.</p>

<p>Where the most recently ended overseas financial year is the same as the Australian LRYI for the child support period (even if the financial year dates do not exactly align), Child Support can simply record the converted overseas income amount in Australian dollars as an <strong>OS Taxable</strong> for the same LRYI as would be normally used.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>

<p>Jack who lives in the UK has a new child support period commencing on 7 September 2008. Jack provides Child Support with income details for the UK 2007/2008 financial year (6 April 2007 to 5 April 2008), stating that GBP20, 000 was earnt. The average exchange rate for the UK in the 07/08 UK financial year was 2.31309. Therefore the calculation is 20,000 x 2.31309 = AUD$46,262.00 (rounded).</p>

<p>As the parent is a resident of the UK and the child support period starts on 7 September 2008, the LRYI is the UK financial year for 2007/2008. This is aligned with most recently ended financial year for Cuba purposes. Therefore the income is recorded in Cuba as an OS Taxable Income of $46261.80 for 2007/2008.</p>

<p>Where the most recently ended overseas financial year is not the same as the Australian LRYI, Child Support must record the overseas income details as an <strong>OS Taxable</strong> for the Australian LRYI, even though they are different.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>

<p>Jess who lives in New Zealand has a new child support period commencing on 1 May 2008. Inland Revenue, New Zealand has advised Child Support that Jess's taxable income for the 2007/2008 New Zealand financial year was NZ$54,000.00. The New Zealand financial year runs from 1 April 2007 to 31 March 2008. The average exchange rate for New Zealand for their 07/08 financial year was 0.8652. The conversion calculation is therefore 54,000 x 0.8652 = AUD$46,721.00 (rounded).</p>

<p>As the parent is a resident of New Zealand when the income for the assessment is being calculated, and because the child support period starts on 1 May 2008, the most recently ended New Zealand financial year is the 2007/2008. This is not the same as what the Australian LRYI for this child support period would have been (2006/2007). Therefore this amount is applied to Cuba as an OS Tax Income of $46,721.00 (rounded) for the 2006/2007 financial year to enable Cuba to use it to calculate the assessment.</p>

<p>A parent must provide up to date income information when a new assessment is generated. If no income is provided a provisional income is used in the assessment. If the parent later provides evidence their actual income was lower than the provisional income Child Support may not be able to backdate the income amount to be used in the assessment.</p>

<p>When Child Support has requested income information from a parent under s162A(1) via a UQ42.00 Request for Overseas Income letter they may be able to replace a provisional income with a lower actual income if the parent has responded to the request within 12 months of receiving the s162A(1) notice.</p>

<p>Child Support will consider the parent has responded to the notice within a 'reasonable time' if they respond within 12 months. If the response is received after the 12 months, consideration should be given as to whether there are any special circumstances for the delay.</p>

<p>The following will assist with selecting the correct date to enter new international income information. If the supplied income is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
higher than the provisional income (response to s162A(1) notice not applicable), the provisional income will be replaced for the entire child support period</li>
		<li>

lower than the provisional income and a response to s162A(1) notice was not received within a reasonable timeframe, the provisional income will be replaced from date of notification unless special circumstances apply</li>

<p>If Child Support has used an OS taxable income for the last relevant year of income to calculate child support, the customer is able to lodge an estimate of income. For overseas parents this will be loaded into Cuba as an OS ESTIMATE. The eligibility criteria for lodging an overseas estimate is the same as for domestic parents, however there are 2 additional steps&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Convert the parent's estimated income amount to Australian dollars</li>
			<ul>			<li>
to do this, use the same average exchange rate for the relevant financial year of the country as was used in calculating the original taxable income</li>
			<li>
use the <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/elements/macros/InternationalIncomeConverter.html">International Income Converter</a> to determine the exchange rate that was in place at the time, if this is not documented in the income notepad</li>
			<li>
if the currency or the year to be converted is not available on the International Income Converter, To request the required exchange rate send an email to International Disbursements Team</li>
			<li>
Ask the parent to supply evidence of their estimate. Evidence can include copies of payslips and official documentation from a benefit provider, for example an organisation playing a similar role to Centrelink</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> international parents are asked to supply evidence because Child Support cannot as easily perform a reconciliation of the parent's actual income with their estimate. Supplying evidence is not a legislative requirement, and is not by itself a reason to refuse the estimate - however, if the parent has not supplied evidence, Child Support may refuse the estimate because they are not satisfied the parent will not earn more than the amount they estimated.</p>

<p>Estimates must be approved by a Service Officer 4 (SO4).</p>
