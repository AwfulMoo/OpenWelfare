<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_NEIS_overview>Self-Employment Assistance replacing NEIS</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>From 1 July 2022, the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR) implemented Self-Employment Assistance. This is replacing NEIS Assistance.</P>
<P>From 1 July 2022:</P>
<UL>
<LI>new participants will only be able to participate in Self-Employment Assistance (unless on Norfolk Island)</LI>
<LI>any participant in NEIS Assistance with more than 3 months of NEIS Assistance remaining will transition to Self-Employment Assistance</LI>
<LI>any participant in NEIS Assistance with less than 3 months NEIS Assistance remaining will remain in NEIS Assistance</LI></UL>
<P>Due to system limitations, the Services Australia system was not updated to reflect the changes to Self-Employment Assistance. These changes will be made at a later date. The Services Australia system will continue to display <STRONG>all</STRONG> participants as 'NEIS Pre-Training' or 'NEIS Assistance'.</P>
<P>For Services Australia staff, the NEIS/Self-Employment Assistance Operational Blueprint provides necessary information to cover both programs. See <A href="../job-seekers/001-02100000-05.html">Resources</A> for further information.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>NEIS/Self-Employment Assistance offers flexible services to help people who are interested in becoming self-employed or people who are existing micro-business owners. Participants can choose the services they wish to access, selecting from 6 free services including:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Exploring Self-Employment Workshops</LI>
<LI>Small Business Training (previously NEIS Pre-Training) (fully meets mutual obligation requirements and meets the short course guidelines for the <A href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-08050000-01.html">Education Entry Payment (EdEP)</A>)</LI>
<LI>Business Plan Development</LI>
<LI>Business Advice Sessions</LI>
<LI>Business Health Checks (for existing micro-business owners), and</LI>
<LI>Small Business Coaching (previously NEIS Assistance) (fully meets mutual obligation requirements)</LI></UL>
<P>Further detail on each of these is available on the <A href="../job-seekers/001-02100000-05.html#bp05_L2LL_External_websit">Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR) website</A>.</P>
<P>If eligible, NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance may be paid for up to 39 weeks.</P>
<P>NEIS/Self-Employment Assistance:</P>
<UL>
<LI>is administered by DEWR</LI>
<LI>is delivered by small business specialist providers</LI>
<LI>runs for 52 weeks</LI></UL>
<P>Participation in some elements is considered to be an approved activity for payments with mutual obligation requirements.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P></P>
<DIV class=twisty><A name=bp01_L2GT_NEIS_enquiry_by class=anchor></A>
<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_NEIS_enquiry_by>NEIS/Self-Employment enquiry by customer</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>If the customer is already connected to an employment services provider, the Service Officer should advise them to contact their Workforce Australia or Disability Employment Services (DES) provider for information.</P>
<P>All other customers should be advised to search for their local NEIS/Self-Employment Assistance provider on the Workforce Australia website.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P></P>
<DIV class=twisty><A name=bp01_L2GT_PreNEIS_activi class=anchor></A>
<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_PreNEIS_activi>Eligibility for Self-Employment Assistance</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>To be eligible customers must satisfy all of the following criteria:</P>
<UL>
<LI>be at least 15 years of age (a customer must be 18 years of age to access Small Business Coaching)</LI>
<LI>be an Australian citizen, or the holder of a permanent visa, or a nominated Visa holder (including a New Zealand Special Category Visa, Temporary Protection Visa Holder and a Safe Haven Visa Holder)</LI>
<LI>not be an undischarged bankrupt</LI>
<LI>not already be in education and/or employment for more than 25 hours per week</LI></UL>
<P>If the customer is already self-employed or already has a business idea, their local Self-Employment Assistance provider will work with them to assess whether their business or business idea is eligible.</P>
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Community Development Program (CDP) job seekers cannot participate in NEIS/Self-Employment Assistance.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P></P>
<DIV class=twisty><A name=bp01_L2GT_Information_abo01 class=anchor></A>
<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_Information_abo01>NEIS Assistance/Small Business Coaching</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Business mentoring and support is an essential component of NEIS/Self-Employment Assistance. Participants will receive business mentoring for 52 weeks under the NEIS Assistance/Small Business Coaching phase. Participants will also receive advice about organisational, financial and marketing issues to support the development of their business.</P>
<P>Participants can receive NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance for the first 39 weeks of the 52 week NEIS Assistance/Small Business Coaching phase. The amount of NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance payable will not be affected by income from the job seeker's business, as the allowance is paid by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR).</P>
<P>The NEIS/Self-Employment Assistance provider is able to arrange additional mentoring and support for some individuals and Indigenous Australian job seekers where they consider it to be appropriate.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P></P>
<DIV class=twisty><A name=bp01_L2GT_Participation_i class=anchor></A>
<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_Participation_i>NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Most NEIS/Self-Employment Assistance participants transfer from their income support payment to NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance after they complete NEIS Pre Training/Small Business training and commence in NEIS Assistance/Small Business Coaching.</P>
<P>Certain customers may be receiving a higher rate of income support than the amount paid under NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance, for example:</P>
<UL>
<LI>JobSeeker Payment (JSP) and Special Benefit (SpB) job seekers who are single with a dependent child</LI>
<LI>JSP, SpB and Youth Allowance (job seeker) (YA) single principal carers with long term exemptions</LI>
<LI>JSP and SpB job seekers aged 60 and over, who have been in receipt of an income support payment for more than 9 continuous months, and</LI>
<LI>JSP and SpB job seekers who are assessed as either 'Illness Separated', 'Respite Care Couple' or 'Partner in prison'</LI></UL>
<P>These job seekers, if they have no affecting income, should be eligible to continue to receive a partial rate of their income support payment on top of their NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance after the dollar for dollar reduction is applied. The partial rate paid by Services Australia is paid as a manual rate and is subject to the income and assets test. If these job seekers also receive employment income, they may be eligible for Working Credit.</P>
<P>Customers in receipt of:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Carer Payment (CP)</LI>
<LI>Age Pension</LI>
<LI>Parenting Payment Single (PPS)</LI>
<LI>Disability Support Pension (DSP)</LI>
<LI>Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) Partner Service Pension, or</LI>
<LI>War Widow(er) Pension</LI></UL>
<P>can elect to remain on their income support payment while participating in NEIS Assistance/Small Business Coaching, up to the maximum of 52 weeks, providing all other pension/payment and NEIS Assistance/Small Business Coaching eligibility criteria are met. Alternatively, they may elect to receive the NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance and a partial rate of their income support payment.</P>
<P>NEIS/Self-Employment Assistance rental assistance is available for up to 26 weeks to NEIS Assistance/Small Business Coaching participants if eligible.</P>
<P>NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance recipients who do not receive an income support payment may be eligible for a <A href="../additional-products-and-services/101-06040000-01.html">Low Income Health Care Card (LIC).</A></P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P></P>
<DIV class=twisty><A name=bp01_L2GT_NEIS_and_Disabi class=anchor></A>
<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_NEIS_and_Disabi>NEIS/Small Business Coaching and Disability Employment Services (DES)</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Customers may concurrently participate in DES and NEIS Assistance/Small Business Coaching. Once a job seeker is participating with DES, the job seeker may be referred by their DES provider to participate in NEIS Assistance/Self-Employment Assistance, which includes Small Business Coaching.</P>
<P>Participating in NEIS/Small Business Coaching or DES satisfies the mutual obligation or participation requirements for income support payments. Participants will still be required to report regularly to Services Australia to receive income support payments, including partial rates. Any business income must be declared and assessed as normal.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P></P>
<DIV class=twisty><A name=bp01_L2GT_Payment_amount_ class=anchor></A>
<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_Payment_amount_>Rate of NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>The amount of NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance paid is equivalent to the 'single, 22 and over, with no children' rate of JobSeeker Payment (JSP). NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance reduces income support on a dollar for dollar basis, meaning participants may no longer be entitled to their income support payment.</P>
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> customers receiving NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance cannot obtain <A href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-09020000-01.html">early release of superannuation</A>. NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance is specifically excluded by this legislation. Queries regarding this should be referred to Department of Employment and Work Relations National Customer Service Line.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P></P>
<DIV class=twisty><A name=bp01_L2GT_NEIS_allowance_ class=anchor></A>
<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_NEIS_allowance_>Eligibility for income support after NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance ceases</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>The maximum period that NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance is payable to a participant is 39 weeks from the start of the 52 week NEIS Assistance or Small Business Coaching period.</P>
<P>As a result, these customers may contact the agency to test their eligibility for an income support payment for the final 13 weeks of NEIS Assistance/Small Business Coaching. Provided these customers meet all other eligibility requirements, participation in NEIS Assistance/Small Business Coaching does not preclude them from income support.</P>
<P>Participation in NEIS Assistance/Small Business Coaching fully satisfies a customer's mutual obligation requirements or compulsory participation requirements. This means the job seeker will not be referred to a provider where they claim an income support payment during the last 13 weeks of NEIS Assistance/Small Business Coaching, because they are already connected to a NEIS/Self-Employment Assistance provider and not eligible for other employment services.</P>
<P>See the <A href="../job-seekers/001-02100000-03.html">Process</A> page for coding procedures where a NEIS Assistance/Small Business Coaching participant contacts the agency to claim an income support payment, or to have their rate of payment restored to full rate, following the cessation of their NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance after 39 weeks. <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> the NEIS Assistance/Small Business Coaching participant will be prompted by their provider to supply their NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance cessation letter as evidence.</P>
<P>NEIS Assistance/Small Business Coaching participants who were receiving JobSeeker Payment (JSP) or Youth Allowance (YA) and whose payment was reduced or cancelled due to receiving the NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance, will receive an advice from Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR) to verify that their NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance has ceased.</P>
<P>Where a JSP or YA customer re-applies for payment after 39 weeks, Service Officers will need to manually zero the NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance on the Other Government Payments (<STRONG>OGP</STRONG>) screen, and end any manual rate overrides that existed to continue partial rate payments during the 39 weeks of NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance.</P>
<P>If an AGE, Carer Payment (CP), Parenting Payment Single (PPS) or Disability Support Pension (DSP) customer re-applies for payment after 39 weeks and their rate was reduced by NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance, the system will automatically zero on the <STRONG>OGP</STRONG> screen at 39 weeks. Service Officers will not have to manually zero NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance for these customers as part of a new claim or to restore payment back to full rate.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
