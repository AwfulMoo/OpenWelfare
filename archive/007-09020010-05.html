<P>Examples of suggested text for Q999 for primary/secondary claimants when a primary claimant is transferring their PPL entitlement to their partner:</P>
<P><STRONG>Q999 - Primary claimant only has lodged a claim - customer is transferring their full PPL entitlement and has returned to work before lodging PPL claim.</STRONG></P>
<P>'In your claim you indicated that you have returned to work and intend to transfer your full Parental Leave Pay entitlement to another person. Before we finalise your claim for Parental Leave Pay, the person you intend to transfer your payment to, must lodge their claim. If they do not lodge their claim within 14 days of this notice being issued, Parental Leave Pay may not be payable for &lt;child's name&gt;.'</P>
<P><STRONG>Q999 - Invite primary/secondary claimant to lodge a PPL claim</STRONG></P>
<P>'We are writing to invite you to claim Paid Parental Leave for &lt;child's name&gt;. You can lodge your claim by either accessing your Centrelink online account through myGov and selecting 'Make a claim', or if you are unable to use our online services, contact us on 136 150. You must lodge your claim within 14 days of this notice being issued or Parental Leave Pay may not be payable for &lt;child's name&gt;.'</P>
<P><STRONG>Q999 NEF text to secondary claimant - primary claimant did not submit an effective PPL claim</STRONG></P>
<P>'We cannot pay you Parental Leave Pay because &lt;your partner&gt;&lt;the person who is transferring their Parental Leave Pay entitlement to you&gt; has not submitted a claim for Paid Parental Leave. To be paid Parental Leave Pay for &lt;CHILD NAME&gt; you will need to contact us once &lt;your partner&gt;&lt;the person who is transferring their Parental Leave Pay entitlement to you&gt; has submitted their claim.'</P>
<P><STRONG>Q999 NEF text to primary claimant - secondary claimant did not submit an effective PPL claim</STRONG></P>
<P>'We cannot pay you Parental Leave Pay because &lt;your partner&gt;&lt;the person you are transferring your Parental Leave Pay entitlement to&gt; has not submitted a claim for Paid Parental Leave. To be paid Parental Leave Pay for &lt;CHILD NAME&gt; you will need to contact us once &lt;your partner&gt;&lt;the person you are transferring your Parental Leave Pay entitlement to &gt; has submitted their claim.'</P>
<P><STRONG>Q999 text to secondary claimant when claim cannot be finalised until closer to the PPL nominated start date</STRONG></P>
<P>'As the nominated start for your Parental Leave Pay is not until &lt;date&gt;, we cannot finalise your claim until &lt;Nominated Start Date&gt;. If &lt;your partner&gt;&lt;the person who is transferring their Parental Leave Pay entitlement to you&gt; changes their nominated start date for the Paid Parental Leave to an earlier date, you will need to contact us on 136 150 so we can assess your claim sooner.'</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<P>Sarah and Rob are expecting their first child. Sarah enquires about making a per-birth claim for PPL.</P>
<P>Sarah has not been working and does not meet the work test. Sarah enquires if partner Rob is eligible for PPL instead.</P>
<P>Rob works and has arranged to take leave from work to be at home to care for their newborn child and support Sarah.</P>
<P>As the birth mother, Sarah must be assessed as the primary claimant for PPL unless exceptional circumstance criteria are met. As Sarah intends on caring for the newborn child and is capable of doing so, exceptional circumstances are not met. Sarah must first meet all the eligibility as a primary claimant if Sarah wanted to transfer the PPL to Rob.</P>
<P>PPL provides birth mothers who have been in the work force with the opportunity to take time off work to care for their newborn child and to recover following the birth.</P>
<P>Sarah is advised that Newborn Supplement and Newborn Upfront Payment are available. Sarah is invited to claim and test eligibility for Family Tax Benefit (FTB).</P>

<P><STRONG>Claim lodged by partner of birth mother</STRONG></P>
<P>John lodges an online claim for PPL on 5 August for baby born on 2 August. A scanned copy of the Newborn Child Declaration (FA081) is provided as proof of birth.</P>
<P>John's partner Julie is the birth mother but John has claimed because Julie is still in hospital and John has taken time off work to care for the family.</P>
<P>Julie is still capable of caring for their baby.</P>
<P>John's PPL claim is rejected reason '<STRONG>PPC</STRONG>', due to not being considered the primary claimant.</P>
<P>On 21 August, Julie submits an online claim and provides all information required to assess the claim, including work test and income test information. The FA081 lodged by John can be used as proof of the child's birth.</P>
<P>If Julie is not eligible for PPL, for example, because of the work or income tests, John will not be eligible as a secondary claimant. Julie or John should be invited to claim and test their eligibility for Family Tax Benefit, and be advised that Newborn Supplement and Newborn Upfront Payment may be paid instead.</P>

<P>Sally has a baby on 10 August and lodges a claim for PPL 2 weeks later.</P>
<P>Sally plans to return to work on 5 October (2 months after the birth), and states in the claim that Sally's partner Jim will look after their baby from that date. Sally will only be eligible for PPL up until returning to work.</P>
<P>Jim also lodges a claim and is eligible for PPL, it is agreed that Jim will claim and receive PPL for the remainder of the PPL period. Jim provides all information required for the claim to be assessed.</P>
<P>Sally receives PPL for the period until 4 October, the day before returning to work, and transfers primary care to Jim. Sally's PPL period cancels from 5 October, reason '<STRONG>TTP</STRONG>' (Transfer portion of PPL entitlement to partner).</P>
<P>Jim also meets all PPL eligibility requirements and receives PPL for the period 5 October to 13 December as a secondary claimant.</P>
<P>As Flexible PPL days can be claimed before or after the primary claimant has returned to work, Sally can:</P>
<UL>
<LI>claim them on days that she is the child’s primary carer and is not working, or</LI>
<LI>choose to give permission for Jim to claim some or all of her Flexible PPL days</LI></UL>

<P>Naomi is a teacher who is receiving PPL. Naomi plans to return to work on the first day of term despite not receiving the full 12 week PPL period.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, as the baby is unwell for the first 3 days of term, Naomi is unable to leave the baby at child care and applies for carer leave for this period. Naomi has access to 2 days paid carer leave and takes the third day as unpaid carer leave. Naomi starts work on the fourth day of the term.</P>
<P>As Naomi has not performed one hour or more of paid work prior to the fourth day of term, the fourth day is the return to work date. Naomi’s PPL period is paid up to the fourth day of term as she is not considered to have worked on days 1 to 3. </P>

<P>Mary has a baby on 3 August and lodges a claim for PPL 3 weeks later.</P>
<P>Mary indicates in the claim that Mary wants to transfer the full PPL period and give permission to claim all 30 Flexible PPL days to partner, Paul, from the child's date of birth as Mary had returned to work a few weeks after the birth on 19 August.</P>
<P>As Mary is transferring the full PPL entitlement from the child's date of birth, Mary only needs to meet limited eligibility criteria of the:</P>
<UL>
<LI>work test and income test, and</LI>
<LI>residence test on the date the child is born</LI></UL>
<P>Before Mary's claim is assessed, Paul needs to lodge a PPL claim at the same time. A Q999 is sent to Mary requesting Paul lodges a claim within 14 days. A Q999 is sent to Paul advising to lodge a claim for PPL within 14 days.</P>

<P>Fiona has a baby on 4 July and lodges a claim for PPL 4 weeks later.</P>
<P>In the PPL claim, Fiona indicates that Fiona transferred primary care of the child to partner Philip, on 20 July and returned to work on the same day. Fiona also wishes to transfer the full PPL period and give permission to claim all 30 Flexible PPL days to Philip from 1 August.</P>
<P>Fiona meets all PPL eligibility for each day from the child's date of birth, up to and including 19 July (the day before Fiona returned to work). As Fiona is eligible for PPL, Fiona's full PPL entitlement can be transferred to Philip. Before Philip can be paid PPL for the child Phillip must:</P>
<UL>
<LI>submit an effective claim at the same time as Fiona</LI>
<LI>be eligible for PPL as a secondary claimant, and</LI>
<LI>satisfy the full PPL eligibility criteria from 20 July, when Phillip became the child's primary carer</LI></UL>
<P>Before finalising Fiona's claim for PPL, Philip's claim must be lodged. As Philip has not lodged a claim, a Q999 must be sent to Fiona advising that Philip must submit a claim for PPL within 14 days and a Q999 must be sent to tell Philip to lodge a claim for PPL within 14 days. If Philip does not submit a claim within the timeframe it will not meet the 'lodged at the same time' criteria.

<P>Lisa has a baby on 20 September. Lisa's partner, Steve, lodges a claim for PPL on 20 October.</P>
<P>In the PPL claim, Steve advises of claiming PPL because Lisa is transferring the full PPL period to Steve. Before assessing Steve's claim, a Q999 must be sent to Steve advising that Lisa must submit a claim for PPL within 14 days before Steve's entitlement to PPL can be assessed. A Q999 must be sent to Lisa advising to lodge a claim within 14 days.</P>
<P>On 2 November, Lisa lodges a claim for PPL and in the claim indicates that Lisa has returned to work and transferred primary care of their child to Steve on 16 October. Lisa also advises the intention to transfer the full PPL period and all 30 Flexible PPL days to Steve from 16 October.</P>
<P>As the primary claimant's claim must be assessed before the secondary claimant's claim, the Service Officer assesses Lisa's claim first and establishes Lisa meets the relevant PPL eligibility criteria from the child's date of birth up to and including 15 October (the day before returning to work). Lisa's claim is finalised with:</P>
<UL>
<LI>a PPL period level rejection</LI>
<LI>Flexible PPL days are current with a balance of zero unclaimed days and 30 days given to another person</LI></UL>
<P>As Lisa's claim has been finalised, Steve's claim can now be assessed.</P>
<P>Until Steve claims all 30 Flexible PPL days, Lisa can remove permission and claim the days for dates when the child is in Lisa’s primary care.</P>

<P>Betty is currently receiving Parenting Payment Partnered (PPP) for Betty's 3 year old child. Betty was working casually for the last 13 months and has submitted an effective PPL claim for the newborn child.</P>
<P>Betty elects to receive PPL for the 18 weeks following the birth of the child by connecting all 30 Flexible PPL days to the end of the PPL period. The PPL income causes Betty's PPP to be '<STRONG>CAN</STRONG>'celled/'<STRONG>INC'</STRONG>ome. Betty will be required to provide an updated estimate of income for Family Tax Benefit (FTB).</P>
<P>When the PPL payments ceases Betty will need to contact Services Australia to have PPP reinstated.</P>

<P>Jane is 37 weeks pregnant and is seriously injured in a car accident with partner Simon.

<UL>
<LI>Sue is expected to have care of the baby for at least 26 weeks, and</LI>
<LI>the baby is under one year of age when entering Sue's care, and</LI>

<P>Daniel was Alfie’s primary carer from birth. Melissa and Daniel both returned to work on 10 February. On 3 March Daniel finished work to care for Alfie. Melissa transferred the full PPL entitlement to Daniel and nominated a start date of 3 March.
