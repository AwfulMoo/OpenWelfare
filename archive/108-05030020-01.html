<p>This document outlines updating income estimates for the current financial year. For Family Tax Benefit (FTB), most customers have to provide an annual income estimate that reflects their family's financial circumstances for the whole financial year. All customers receiving Child Care Subsidy (CCS) need to provide a family income estimate. If the family's circumstances change, the estimate must be updated to reduce the risk of having to repay an overpayment of FTB or CCS after the end of the financial year.</p>

<p>The following customers are to review their family income estimate at every contact&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>All</strong> Child Care Subsidy customers</li>

			<ul>			<li>
not on an income support payment</li>

one or both members of the couple are receiving an income support payment at nil rate due to employment income</li>		</ul>

<p>If the customer has Voice Print Authentication, the estimate may be checked in the IVR. The <strong>income estimate</strong> instructions on <strong>Customer Overview</strong> will confirm if the customer has indicated their estimate needs updating.</p>

<p>Customer Overview will display cards with a <strong>green</strong> icon for successful interactions that need no further action, that is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer has confirmed their estimate is accurate in the IVR</li>

<p>Customer Overview will display cards with an <strong>amber</strong> or <strong>red</strong> icon if Service Officer action is needed. Standard business imperative processes apply, that is&#58;</p>

customer advised they would like to review or update their estimate for the current or next financial year, or</li>
		<li>
there was a technical error in the IVR</li>

<p>If the customer does not have Voice Print Authentication no card will display regarding FTB income estimates within Customer Overview.

<p>Single Touch Payroll (STP) is an Australian Taxation Office (ATO) initiative where employers submit payroll data to the ATO with each pay event. Where a customer is a mutual client of Centrelink and the ATO, the ATO will share the customer’s STP data with Services Australia.</p>

<p>STP data helps identify customers at risk of underestimating their annual income. Electronic reminders (SMS or email) are sent to identified customers prompting them to check the accuracy of their family income estimate. This reduces the likelihood of a Family Tax Benefit (FTB) overpayment at reconciliation time.</p>

<p>Customers who are confident their estimate is accurate do not need to do anything. The messages are a prompt only.</p>

<p>A document will show on the customer's record if they received an electronic message and detail the reason it was sent. A customer can be selected for multiple reasons. Staff can view this document&#58;</p>

<p>The <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-05030030-01.html">date of event to record for a revised estimate</a> depends on when it is provided and whether it results in an increase or decrease to the customer's ongoing FTB rate.

the <a href="../families/007-07070010-01.html">effect of income support entitlement on the rate of FTB and/or CCS</a></li>

their annual income estimate used for FTB/CCS <strong>must</strong> include&#58;</li>

			<li>
the coronavirus supplement paid with taxable income support payments</li>
			<li>
all employment income for the financial year (received and expected) as taxable income</li>		</ul>

		<li>
their notification obligations for their income support payment are different to those for FTB/CCS. For their income support payments they must report their actual earnings, not just an estimate</li>

if they are revising their annual income estimate due to a change in employment income, review current earnings and reporting requirements for income support payments</li>

<p>When a family income estimate does not include a person's full Centrelink income support payment, it may be automatically flagged as unreasonable and a review started.
