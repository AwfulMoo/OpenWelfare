<P>'Early school leavers':</P>
<UL>
<LI>are YA job seekers who are under 22 and have not completed Year 12 (or equivalent) or a Certificate III or higher</LI>
<LI>are required to undertake approved requirements and/or job search to meet their mutual obligation requirements. For job seekers aged 18-21, some combinations of study and work may meet requirements</LI></UL>
<P>As with other job seekers, YA early school leavers will generally only have study or a combination of activities including study, approved by their provider once they have commenced in employment services.</P>
<P>Study, training and job search may be undertaken in combination with other approved activities:</P>
<UL>
<LI>if undertaking approved requirements, it must be for at least 25 hours per week</LI>
<LI>if undertaking an combination of approved requirements and job search, their provider will determine the number of job searches required in addition to their other activities</LI>
<LI>if undertaking only job search they must look for work for at least 25 hours per week and the number of job searches will be determined by their provider</LI></UL>
<P>Job Seekers with a partial capacity to work or temporarily reduced capacity to work of 15-29 hours per week or who are principal carers are expected to undertake at least 15 hours of approved study or approved combinations of activities.</P>
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> job seekers with a temporarily reduced work capacity or partial capacity to work of 0-14 hours per week will be exempt from the study requirement. These job seekers will only need to attend a compulsory quarterly interview with Services Australia to meet their mutual obligation requirements. However, study or training may be undertaken on a voluntary basis.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_Fulltime_study01>Full-time study and mutual obligation requirements</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>YA job seekers (who are not eligible as a student or apprentice) are expected to focus on job search. However, some short courses may be appropriate if the job seeker is unlikely to find work with their existing skills, and the course will enhance their immediate employability. As such, they are generally subject to short course approval policy.</P>
<P>The issue of whether a job seeker can have their full-time study approved by their employment services provider or not does not determine their qualification for YA (job seeker). A job seeker can be determined to not qualify for YA (job seeker) due to full-time study, <STRONG>only</STRONG> where:</P>
<UL>
<LI>they have been advised (either at grant or at a later time) by their provider that their full-time study will not fully meet their mutual obligation requirements, <STRONG>and</STRONG></LI>
<LI>the job seeker is <STRONG>not</STRONG> willing to satisfy other mutual obligation requirements such as job search</LI></UL>
<P>Otherwise, it is up to the provider to negotiate appropriate activities for the job seeker and to instigate compliance action as necessary for failure to meet points target.</P>
<P>In general, when a person is studying full-time, they should <A href="../students-and-trainees/010-07010010-01.html">test their eligibility for a student payment</A>. However, full-time study in certain circumstances, for example, courses of less than 12 months may be approved by a provider or Services Australia as an approved requirement for job seekers.</P>
<P>If a YA job seeker is already connected with a provider or has claimed YA and is referred to a provider through normal processes, they should be advised to discuss approval for any full-time study with their provider.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_Services_Austra>Services Australia role</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>In limited circumstances, Services Australia can approve full-time short courses as fully meeting requirements and making job seekers Centrelink managed prior to them commencing in employment services.</P>
<P>Services Australia should not be approving and coding a short course for a job seeker who is already provider managed, in accordance with the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations Short Course Guidelines. The job seeker should be referred to their provider to discuss their participation and approval in a short course. This is important because it may impact on the level of servicing the provider can offer. If the provider approves the short course, they will code the course details in the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations system. However, if the job seeker is enrolled in a course of study that would make them eligible for a student payment, then this should be discussed with the job seeker and where necessary a transfer to another more appropriate income support payment done.</P>
<P>If a job seeker is undertaking a course of full-time study which cannot be approved under short course policy, and they are not eligible for a student payment, they will not remain qualified for YA unless they can reduce or re-organise their hours of study so that the course is considered part-time, and/or they can still undertake job search or other requirement to fully satisfy their mutual obligation requirements. In this way, full-time study which cannot be approved can be undertaken as long as the job seeker continues to meet all of their mutual obligation requirements and meet their points target, including attending appointments and accepting offers of employment.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_Provider_fullt>Provider full-time short course approvals</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Employment Services Providers have the primary role in the approval of short courses full-time study for YA job seekers, regardless of the current Stream of the job seeker. The provider can approve a full-time short course for YA job seekers at any time after they have commenced participation with the provider.</P>
<P>Providers can approve short courses for a job seeker on the condition that the course is:</P>
<UL>
<LI>vocationally orientated</LI>
<LI>less than 12 months</LI>
<LI>highly likely to provide a job seeker with a qualification that will result in an Employment Outcome, improve their employability or lead to qualifications in an identified area of skills shortage</LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> providers are responsible for identifying what training relates to skills in demand in each particular Employment Region, as there is no defined list.</P>
<P>When an Employment Services Provider approves a job seeker to undertake a full-time short course, Services Australia will receive notification automatically from the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Services Australia, in limited circumstances, can approve a full-time short course as an approved requirement if the job seeker is undertaking qualifying study for YA job seekers. The agency can only approve full-time study for YA job seekers who are Centrelink managed (if they have not yet commenced in employment services) if <STRONG>all</STRONG> the following conditions apply:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the course is full-time (or at least 15 hours per week for principal carers or job seekers with a partial capacity to work of 15-22 hours per week)</LI>
<LI>the job seeker has a confirmed offer of employment in writing from the employer, pending the completion of a specified short course</LI>
<LI>the course runs from one to 13 weeks</LI>
<LI>the course has a clear vocational application; and</LI>
<LI>the job seeker is prepared to meet any costs involved</LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<LI><STRONG>YA job seekers who are principal carers</STRONG> - 15 or more hours per week (or 30 hours per fortnight), including any combination of contact and non-contact hours, regardless of whether the study is classified as full-time or part-time by the institution or organisation providing the course</LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>If a full-time short course requirement is approved by Services Australia for a Centrelink managed job seeker, the job seeker will be deemed to be satisfying their mutual obligation requirements for the duration of the course. Where a provider approves the short course, job seekers are still required to look for and accept work, but not where it conflicts with the time of the course or if it would prevent them from completing the course. Job seekers will be required to undertake up to 20 job searches a month. There is no automatic reduction in job search for undertaking a full-time short course. Job seekers are required to accept any suitable work that does not conflict with the course and they are not permitted to limit their job searches only to areas relating to the course.</P>
<P>Job seekers with full-time mutual obligation requirements who are undertaking full-time short courses are required to remain connected with their provider. Job seekers are also required to attend an appointment with their provider or the agency if notified of a requirement to do so. However, appointments should be scheduled for times that do not conflict with the job seeker's study timetable.</P>
<P>Job seekers (excluding those with Disability Employment Services (DES) and ParentsNext), may have their job search requirements reduced by their provider if they are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>connected to a Workforce Australia provider, and</LI>
<LI>undertaking 40 or more contact hours of study and/or work per fortnight</LI></UL>
<P>If the job seeker is undertaking 70 or more contact hours of study and/or work per fortnight, their job search requirements may be fully met.</P>
<P>Job seekers must negotiate their job search requirements with their Workforce Australia provider.</P>
<P>Job seekers with part-time mutual obligation requirements (for example, principal carers or people assessed with a partial capacity to work of 15-29 hours per week) undertaking an approved full-time short course are deemed to be fully satisfying their mutual obligation requirements. However, they are still connected with the provider, although their Stream Service would be suspended.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<H2 id=bp01_L2GT_Parttime_study>Part-time study</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>YA job seekers must undertake study or training to meet their mutual obligation requirements unless they can provide verified evidence of completion of Year 12 (or equivalent) or a Certificate III or higher.</P>
<P>For other YA job seekers, any type of part-time study which cannot be approved under short course policy can be undertaken as long as the job seeker continues to meet all of their mutual obligation requirements, including attending appointments and accepting offers of employment. For example, a job seeker may be studying at night and willing to look for work during the day. If the job seeker is seeking and willing to undertake suitable work, and their studies do not appear to be fixed in time or place so as to restrict their ability to satisfy their mutual obligation requirements, they will remain qualified for YA, even where the course cannot be approved as fully meeting or counting towards their mutual obligation requirements.</P>
<P>However, such study can only be approved by their provider. Services Australia staff need only record details of any part-time study on the job seeker's record.</P>
<P>Principal carers on YA can participate in approved study of at least 15 hours per week (30 hours per fortnight) in any combination of contact and non-contact hours to fully meet their mutual obligation requirements. This is whether the institution regards the course as full-time or part-time. If the study is less than 15 hours per week, the principal carer must participate in another requirement. This could be a combination of paid work and study, or self-employment and study. If no other requirement can be approved to fully meet the job seeker's requirements, they will have job search requirements, in addition to their hours of study.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<P>YA job seekers with less than 12 months of their course remaining who are not eligible for YA as a student may have the remainder of their course as a full-time student approved by a provider as an approved requirement. In all cases, an assessment should first be made as to whether the job seeker has exhausted their allowable/satisfactory progress time, and whether they have any eligibility for a student payment or not. The progress time limit may be extended if they have failed a subject for reasons beyond their control, such as illness, family trauma, or a natural disaster.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
