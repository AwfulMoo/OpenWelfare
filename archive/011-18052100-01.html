<p>Reasonable out of pocket transport costs to allow a claimant and a support person to attend treatment(s) claimable under DHCAS.</p>

<p>Costs incurred for travel using private vehicles will be paid at the same rate as employees of Services Australia. Air travel costs are to be paid at economy rates.</p>

<p><strong>Travel claim document requirements</strong></p>

<p>Claims for out-of-pocket transport costs, where a private vehicle, air, rail, taxi or public transport are used must be lodged using the Disaster Health Care Assistance Scheme Motor Vehicle, Travel and/or Accommodation Out-of-Pocket application. Claimants using a private vehicle will also be reimbursed all associated fees, charges and tolls, for instance parking fees, bridge, freeway, ferry incurred.</p>

<p>Traffic infringement notices are the responsibility of the claimants and are not eligible for reimbursement.</p>

<p>Petrol costs for private travel will not be reimbursed – this is covered under the private vehicle travel allowance rate.</p>

<p><strong>Assessing travel claim is related to treatment</strong></p>

<p>It must be confirmed that the claimant’s travel costs are directly related to the attendance of the treatment claimable under DHCAS.</p>

<p>To process the claim in full it is preferable that claimants submit all documentation related to their travel costs at the same time they submit their claim for reimbursement for goods or services. </p>

<p><strong>Accommodation claim </strong></p>

<p>Reasonable accommodation costs for the claimant and a support person are also claimable under DHCAS.</p>

<p>Reimbursement is to be for room only - food and beverage costs including mini bar charges are not covered under the guidelines and are not to be paid.</p>

<p>Accommodation can only be claimed where the claimant’s usual residence is in a different town or region located more than 50 kilometres from the health care provider.</p>

<p>If the claimant is required to attend an appointment with a health care provider and accommodation is required for more than 10 consecutive days, approval must be obtained in advance from Programme Management.</p>

<p>The number of mental health sessions can be counted across more than one provider. For example, if a claimant changes providers after 5 sessions (in the middle of their initial 10 or further continuing 12 sessions), the count does not start again with the new provider.</p>
