These records are managed by Business Integrity Division, see <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-10020000-01.html#bp01_L2GT_Cancellation_of01">Cancellation of payments when security notice issued</a>.</p>

<p>This document outlines the circumstances under which a customer's payment should be cancelled. It also provides links to further information for each specific payment type.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Cancellation of payment should occur when a customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
no longer meets the qualification and/or payability provisions for their current income support payment</li>
		<li>
fails to comply with the notification requirement and/or recipient obligations</li>
		<li>
claims a more suitable payment for which they are eligible</li>
		<li>
requests that the payment is cancelled</li>
		</ul>
<p>Before cancelling a customer's payment, care should be taken to establish that the customer is no longer eligible for that payment.</p>

<p>Payments that can no longer be granted (for example, Partner Allowance and Widow Allowance) should not be cancelled where a customer notifies multiple events within 14 days, when the first notifiable event results in an adverse decision and second notifiable event results in a favourable decision which nullifies the earlier adverse decision. An example of when a payment that can no longer be granted, should not be cancelled, see Partner Allowance (PA) qualification and savings provisions.</p>

<p>Payment that has been suspended and not restored must be cancelled after a period in accordance with relevant policy guidelines.</p>

<p>If a decision is made to cancel a customer's payment, they must be immediately advised about the decision and their right to <a target="_blank" href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/109-02000000-01.html">request an explanation or apply for a formal review</a>. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> this includes customers who request to have their payment cancelled.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>From 1 December 2014, new provisions require Services Australia to cancel a person's welfare benefit or concession card when the Attorney-General provides a security notice to the Minister for Social Services.</p>

<p>The Attorney-General can issue a security notice in relation to a person, when he/she considers the individual should not be eligible to receive welfare benefits for national security reasons.</p>

<p>It is expected that many individuals subject to a security notice will not be in receipt of welfare payments or Family Tax Benefit, however future entitlements will be effected for as long as the security notice remains in effect.</p>

<p><strong>Loss of eligibility</strong></p>

<p>Customers who are the subject of a security notice are not entitled to receive any payments or concession cards until the security notice has been revoked by the Attorney-General. If they lodge a claim for a payment or concession card it will be rejected. The security notice stays in force until the Attorney-General revokes the notice. The Attorney-General must review the decision to issue a security notice every 12 months whilst the security notice is in force. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> affected customers may have an FTB child in their care. The Attorney-General may recommend, via a Security Notice that family assistance payments can continue to be paid to a payment nominee, who must act in the best interest of the dependents.</p>

<p>Customers will be advised of the cancellation of payment or rejection of their claim by letter. The letter will also tell the customer that the action taken by the agency is as result of a security notice issued by the Attorney-General and not a decision that is made or changeable by the agency.</p>

<p><strong>Customer management</strong></p>

<p>Records subject to a security notice are made 'Restricted Access' to minimise application or re-application for payment. A new cancellation and rejection reason <strong>SNI -Security Notice Issued</strong> has also been introduced. These records are managed by Business Integrity Division. Customers must <strong>not</strong> be provided with contact details of the responsible Restricted Access Officer.</p>

<p>Given the sensitivities of these cases, a central processing team has been established to make sure security notices are actioned immediately. Service Zone Leaders are advised of any security notices received for customers within their Zone by the Business Integrity Division.</p>

<p>Customers or their nominees contacting the agency to discuss the cancellation of payment as a result of a security notice should be advised of the following&#58;</p>

<p>'The decision to issue a security notice is made by the Attorney-General. The cancellation of the payment and/or concession card is because the security notice has been issued and is not a decision made by an officer from this agency. If you do not agree with the decision made by the Attorney-General to issue a security notice, you may wish to seek legal advice'.</p>

<p>If the customer is <strong>not qualified for payment</strong> and the decision to cancel payment is made, ensure an advice is sent to the customer with the cancellation reason and their <a href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/109-03000000-01.html">review and appeal rights</a>.</p>
