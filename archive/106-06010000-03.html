<p>To qualify for any social security payment, concession card, family assistance or parental leave payment, a customer must generally be an Australian resident.</p>

<p>An Australian resident is a person who is residing in Australia and is either&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
an Australian citizen, or</li>
		<li>
the holder of a permanent resident visa, or</li>
		<li>
a protected Special Category Visa holder</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Residing in Australia</strong></p>

<p>A person is residing in Australia if they are living in Australia on an ongoing basis. The factors to consider when assessing this are contained in section 7(3) of the Social Security Act 1991. For assistance with determining if someone is an Australian resident, see <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-06010010-01.html">Assessing if the customer is an Australian resident</a>.</p>

<p>A customer can qualify residentially for SpB, family assistance and parental leave payments or LIC if they hold certain temporary visas that qualify customers for some payments and they are residing in Australia.</p>

<p>A customer can qualify residentially for Paid Parental Leave scheme payments, family assistance and concession cards other than Ex-Carer Allowance Health Care Card if they are a non-protected SCV holder residing in Australia.</p>

<p>A customer who is a non-protected SCV holder residing in Australia may qualify for JobSeeker Payment (JSP) or Youth Allowance (YA) for up to 6 months if they meet certain requirements under the New Zealand 10 years residence exemption.</p>

<p>A protected SCV holder is a New Zealand citizen who arrived in Australia using their New Zealand passport and were given a '444' visa subclass. If the customer was in Australia on 26 February 2001, they are considered to be 'protected'. There are a few other rules relating to residence around this date where a customer can also be considered protected. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-06010020-01.html">Australian Residence Rules for New Zealand citizens</a>.</p>

<p>Most payments <strong>except</strong> Age Pension and Disability Support Pension (DSP) for customers who are exempt from the ongoing residence requirement, require a customer to remain an Australian resident during all periods of payment after grant in order to remain qualified.</p>

<p>Once the customer stops being an Australian resident, any payment other than Age or DSP for customers who are exempt from the ongoing residence requirement, will also cease. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> Carer Payment (CP), Double Orphan Pension (DOP) and Parenting Payment Single (PPS) may still be able to be paid to a customer who is not an Australian resident using an international agreement as long as they are a resident of the agreement country.</p>

<p>Where a customer ceased to be an Australian resident as their visa was cancelled and that visa is later reinstated, the customer's payment can be restored provided they are still otherwise eligible.</p>

<p>A non-protected SCV holder who qualifies for JSP or YA under the New Zealand 10 year residence exemption must continue to hold a Special Category Visa to maintain qualification to payment under this exemption.</p>

<p>See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-06010000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Residence_quali_6">Item 6</a> for more information on how an absence from Australia can affect ongoing qualification.</p>

<p>Most social security payments require a person to be an Australian resident for a minimum period before they qualify for payment. This is either a <a href="../migrants-refugees-and-visitors/005-02020000-01.html">qualifying residence period</a> or a <a href="../migrants-refugees-and-visitors/005-02020000-01.html">Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Period (NARWP)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Qualifying residence period</strong></p>

<p>The following payments have a qualifying residence period&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Age Pension</li>
		<li>
Disability Support Pension (DSP)</li>
		<li>
Parenting Payment (PP)</li>
		</ul>
<p>The qualifying residence period for Age Pension and DSP can be served outside Australia as long as the customer remains an Australian resident. The qualifying residence period for PP must be served in Australia.</p>

<p>The qualifying residence period for PP must also be served alongside the NARWP if no exemption applies. This only applies to customers granted their first qualifying visa on or after 1 January 2019.</p>

<p><strong>NARWP</strong></p>

<p>Customers who have recently arrived to live in Australia and are claiming a payment or concession are required to have been an Australian resident and physically in Australia for the required duration of the NARWP, either in one period, or in a number of periods before the payment or concession is payable.</p>

<p>Temporary absences from Australia in the waiting period do not restart the NARWP but the days that a customer is overseas do<strong> </strong>not count towards meeting the NARWP requirements. For example, a customer claiming JobSeeker Payment may have a 2 or 4 year NARWP. If they leave Australia temporarily for 3 weeks the NARWP period does not recommence, but the absence extends the NARWP end date by 3 weeks.</p>

<p>The requirement to have been in Australia for a period or periods totalling the required duration of the NARWP, allows for broken periods of residence in Australia to count <strong>if</strong> the person continued to be an Australian resident. For example, a customer who has returned to live in Australia after several years living overseas may have previously lived in Australia as an Australian resident. The period of former Australian residence would count towards any current NARWP requirements.</p>

<p>Generally it is not a requirement that the period of residence required for the NARWP occurred immediately before claiming.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> The NARWP only needs to be served once for the applicable payment.</p>

<p>A customer claiming SpB can serve the NARWP during any period that they hold certain temporary visas that qualify customers for some payments.</p>

<p><strong>No minimum residence period required</strong></p>

<p>The following payments do not have any qualifying residence period requirement or NARWP&#58;</p>

		<li>
Double Orphan Pension (DOP)</li>
		<li>
Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part B</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Coding for correct residence assessment</strong></p>

<p>The system can generally correctly assess whether a customer has served the minimum residence period as long as the Country of Residence (<strong>CRES</strong>) screen, Legal Residence Details (<strong>RSLEG</strong>) screen and absences from Australia are correctly coded. Absences from Australia are usually only assessed by the system from the Immigration Advised Movements (<strong>RSIM</strong>) screen, which is populated by the Immigration Datalink.</p>

<p>The system can also correctly assess whether a NARWP applies and, if so, the projected end date. For coding assistance, see&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<a href="../initial-contact-general/106-06020050-01.html">Recording legal residence status</a> and</li>
		<li>
<a href="../initial-contact-general/106-06020010-01.html">Coding the Country of Residence (CRES) screen</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>In some cases, certain <a href="../migrants-refugees-and-visitors/005-02020020-01.html">Qualifying Residence Exemptions (QRE)</a> must be manually recorded. See relevant 'Residence assessment for' procedure relating to the specific payment type for coding.</p>

<p><strong>Coding Immigration Limiting Date (ILD)</strong></p>

<p>The Immigration Limiting Date (ILD) must be set correctly for the relevant absences to be included in the NARWP or qualifying residence assessment. The default date needs to be adjusted if there is data prior to the default date which needs to be assessed for a correct claim outcome.</p>

<p>For example, an absence in the last 2 years which extends the NARWP or a departure from Australia that needs to be assessed.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
Residence also impacts significantly on payments while a customer is outside Australia. Former resident rules limit portability if a customer has recently returned for residence and claimed a pension. See <a href="../australians-overseas/061-01060010-01.html">Former resident provisions</a></li>
		<li>
Generally, Age Pension and DSP for customers who are exempt from the ongoing residence requirement, can be paid to a customer who is leaving Australia to live in another country.

A customer arriving in Australia on a New Zealand passport after 26 February 2001 will generally not be an Australian resident except in a <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-06010020-01.html">few limited circumstances</a>. A New Zealand citizen needs to be a protected SCV holder or obtain a permanent visa to satisfy residence requirements for most payments. A non-protected SCV holder may still be able to claim Paid Parental Leave scheme payments, family assistance and concession cards (other than Ex-Carer Allowance Health Care Card (EHC)) or a payment under the New Zealand Agreement</li>
