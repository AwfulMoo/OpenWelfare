Is this the first secondary victim claim for the deceased person?</li>
			<ul>			<li>
If monies have already been paid to eligible secondary victims for the deceased person no further claims can be accepted</li>
			<li>
If a claim is currently under consideration, this claim must be considered at the same time</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Are they claiming for a declared terrorist act? The Prime Minister must declare the event as a terrorist act for the purposes of an AVTOP</li>
		<li>
Have they lodged their claim within the claiming period? Secondary victims have two timeframes that must be considered when determining eligibility;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Did the claimant lodge their claim within 12 months of the death of their close family member? To calculate the claiming period, use the AVTOP claim period calculator, on the <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-04020020-05.html">Resources</a> page</li>
			<li>
Did the deceased die within 2 years of the day the terrorist act occurred? For the end date of this eligibility period, refer to the specific Operational Blueprint in <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-14000000-01.html">Emergency management events</a>.</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Claims may be lodged after the claiming period has closed, however claimants will need to meet special circumstances to be assessed for a payment. Refer to <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-17051800-01.html">AVTOP claims lodged outside of the time limit</a></li>
		<li>
Has the claimant <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-09010000-01.html">confirmed their identity</a>? Claimants who are 16 years and older must satisfy <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07040070-01.html">LOA 3</a> requirements</li>
		<li>
Was the claimant a <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-06010010-01.html">resident of Australia</a>, or held a qualifying residence exemption, on the day of the terrorist act?</li>
		<li>
Was the deceased in the place where the terrorist act occurred?</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Claimants can provide travel documents such as a travel itinerary, smart traveller records, evidence of discussions with Australian Government officials, that demonstrate the deceased was in the place where the terrorist act occurred</li>
			<li>
Service Officers should complete a <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-06020030-01.html">Department of Home Affairs link check</a></li>		</ul>
		<li>
Was the deceased's death a direct result of the declared terrorist act?</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Claimants must provide evidence to substantiate their claim</li>
			<li>
If the claimant has indicated this information has been previously provided, they can provide permission for this information to be used for this claim</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Has the claimant declared that they, and/or their close family members, were not involved in the commission of the terrorist act? When the claimant lodges their claim, they make a declaration that they and their close family members were not involved in the commission of the terrorist act. This declaration may or may not be sufficient for the claim to proceed. If there is any evidence or information from any source that suggests any level of involvement in the terrorist act by either the claimant or any of their close family members use the Payment Query Template on the<a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-04020020-05.html"> Resources</a> page to refer the claim to the Emergency Management Level 2 Helpdesk for further advice</li>
		</ul>
<p>To code the claim on the AVTOP Processing Tool refer to the Coding a new AVTOP Claim table in the AVTOP processing task card on the <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-04020020-05.html">Resources</a> page.</p>

<p>If no, or insufficient, supporting documents have been provided for any of the eligibility criteria, contact the claimant to discuss the documents needed. See <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-04020020-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Requesting_clar">Requesting clarification and/or evidence</a> table.</p>

<p>When the eligibility evidence has been received, document in the AVTOP processing tool how the claimant meets the relevant criteria. Make sure the documents are <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-10010030-01.html">scanned onto the system</a>.</p>

<p>Agency social workers are available to provide support to AVTOP claimants and AVTOP telephony and processing teams.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Check the 'circumstances to refer or consult with a social worker' section on the Background page of this Operational Blueprint to determine if a social worker should be contacted to support the claimant. If any of the circumstances are applicable contact a social worker in line with the below processes</li>
		<li>
If at any time during the AVTOP process a claimant is distressed and needs immediate help, refer them to a social worker via Services Australia Workspace &gt;Social Work - Disaster - AVTOP</li>
		<li>
For all other situations, if the claimant has indicated, either verbally or via the AVTOP claim form, they would like to speak to a social worker, send an email with the following details&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Claimants name</li>
			<li>
Contact number</li>
			<li>
CRN (if applicable)</li>
			<li>
Referral reason</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>For contact details, see Social workers - referrals.</p>

<p>Unless there is an immediate need for a claimant to speak to a social worker, it is important to use the email contact process. This will make sure a social worker with the appropriate skill set can be engaged to call the claimant back.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the claimant may also need a referral to an external organisation. Offer to warm transfer the claimant at the end of the phone call. The <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-04020020-05.html">Resources</a> page has a link to the Services Australia website where the Payment Finder can be located.</p>

<div class="showcont">


<p>On the claim form the claimant is asked to provide evidence that substantiates the deceased person died as a direct result of the terrorist act.</p>

<p>Service Officers must examine the evidence that has been supplied, or source other evidence, to determine if there is a direct link between the deceased person's death and the terrorist act. For example, the claimant may provide a police report that states the deceased person was killed when the terrorist bomb exploded in a market place. See the <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-04020020-05.html">Resources</a> page for the types of evidence that can help in establishing the close family member died as a direct result of the terrorist act. </p>

<p>Evidence for this can come in a number of forms with some sources more reliable than others. Service Officers will need to analyse any evidence provided, or found, to determine how much weight should be given to each piece of evidence and how it supports the facts. Influencing factors to be considered when weighting the evidence include the&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
nature and integrity of the evidence, for example, an official document versus verbal testimony,</li>
		<li>
source of the evidence, for example, primary versus secondary source of evidence, eye witness, expert account</li>
		<li>
age of the evidence - is it still relevant to the issue being decided</li>
		</ul>
<p>It may be that several pieces of evidence will be needed to determine if the deceased person died as a direct result of the terrorist act.</p>

<p>If the claimant has provided medical evidence that needs an assessment, the claim should be considered by Assessment Services Branch.</p>

<p>If there are difficulties in sourcing the death as a direct result evidence consult with Social Work Services for help. Social workers may be able to help with advice on sourcing evidence, assessing evidence and management of the interactions with the claimant. Contact a social worker as per the instructions in Step 3.</p>

If the Health or Allied Health Professional assessing the claim needs further supporting documents, they will send an email to the AVTOP processing team to ask for this from the claimant. The claimant should be given 14 days to supply the required documents. Put claim on hold for 14 days. For contact details, see Emergency payments - claiming - AVTOP</li>

<p>Complete a family tree of close family members to determine additional eligible claimants who may be invited to submit a secondary victim claim. Record family tree in the AVTOP processing tool.</p>

<p>Before sending invitations to additional close family members, consideration must be given to the payable amount for the initial claimant in line with the hierarchy of close family members table.</p>

<p>Invitations to claim should only be sent to those close family members who may be entitled to a payment.</p>

<p>For example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The partner/spouse of the deceased person lodges a claim as a secondary victim. In their claim they advise that at the time of the terrorist act the deceased person had no children<br>In this example, as the partner/spouse is entitled to 100% of AVTOP it would not be appropriate to send an invitation to claim to other parties as, under the hierarchy of close family member rules, they would not be entitled to any portion of the AVTOP.</li>
		<li>
The partner/spouse of the deceased person lodges a claim as a secondary victim. In their claim, they advise that at the time of the terrorist act the deceased person also had a child. At present the child of the deceased person has not lodged a secondary victim claim<br>In this example, the child of the deceased person must be invited to claim as they are entitled to 50% of the portion of AVTOP (with partner/spouse entitled to the remaining 50%). If the child of the deceased did not lodge a claim, the partner/spouse would qualify for the full 100% of the payment.</li>
		<li>
Both parents of one child have died as a direct result of the same terrorist act. The legal guardian of the child lodges a secondary victim claim for both parents. However, the maximum payment that can be made to any one secondary victim in relation to a single terrorist act is $75,000.<br>In this example, the child of the deceased parents can only receive a maximum of $75,000 and as such will receive $37,500 from each claim. As there is still a proportion of the $75,000 unpaid for both of the child's parent, the parents of the partners/spouses (the child's grandparents) may qualify for a payment according to the hierarchy of close family member rules.</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if there are complex family relationships or it is possible that one person could qualify as a secondary victim for more than one deceased person from a single terrorist act, use the Payment Query Template on the <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-04020020-05.html">Resources</a> page to escalate to the Emergency Management Level 2 Helpdesk for advice.</p>

<p>When appropriate, send the AVTOP SV Invitation reminder to claim letter using the invitation option. The due date on the letter must be a date of no less than 30 days after the notice is dated. Scan and upload a copy of the AVTOP SV Invitation to claim letter to the customer's, and if applicable the nominee's, record. See the <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-04020020-05.html">Resources</a> page for a link to all AVTOP letters.</p>

<p>For example, if the invitation to apply letter is sent on 12 September the earliest due date is 12 October.</p>

<p>If multiple invitations to apply are being sent, make sure all due date periods are of the same duration.</p>

<p>Review the invitation/s after 14 days and send the AVTOP SV Invitation reminder to Claim letter using the reminder option with the same due date as the initial letter. Scan and upload a copy of the AVTOP SV Invitation reminder to claim letter to the customer's, and if applicable the nominee's, record.

If at any time during the AVTOP process a claimant is distressed and needs immediate help, refer them to a social worker via Services Australia Workspace &gt;Social Work - Disaster - AVTOP</li>

<p>On the claim form the claimant is asked to provide evidence that substantiates the deceased person died as a direct result of the terrorist act.</p>

<p>Service Officers must examine the evidence that has been supplied, or source other evidence, to determine if there is a direct link between the deceased person's death and the terrorist act. For example, the claimant may provide a police report that states the deceased person was killed when the terrorist bomb exploded in a market place. See the <strong><a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-04020020-05.html">R</strong>esources</a> page for the types of evidence that can help in establishing if the close family member died as a direct result of the terrorist act.</p>

<p>Evidence for this can come in a number of forms with some sources more reliable than others. Service Officers will need to analyse any evidence provided, or found, to determine how much weight should be given to each piece of evidence and how it supports the facts. Influencing factors to be considered when weighting the evidence include the&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
nature and integrity of the evidence, for example, an official document versus verbal testimony,</li>
		<li>
source of the evidence, for example, primary versus secondary source of evidence, eye witness, expert account</li>
		<li>
age of the evidence - is it still relevant to the issue being decided</li>
		</ul>
<p>It may be that several pieces of evidence will be needed to determine if the deceased person died as a direct result of the terrorist act.</p>

<p>If the claimant has provided medical evidence that needs an assessment, the claim should be considered by Assessment Services Branch.</p>

<p>If there are difficulties in sourcing the death as a direct result evidence consult with Social Work Services for help. Social workers may be able to help with advice on sourcing evidence, assessing evidence and management of the interactions with the claimant. Contact a social worker as per the instructions in Step 3.</p>

<p>Complete a family tree for close family members to determine additional eligible claimants who may be invited to submit a secondary victim claim. Record family tree in the AVTOP processing tool.</p>

<p>Before sending invitations to additional close family members, consideration must be given to the payable amount for the initial claimant in line with the hierarchy of close family members table.</p>

<p>Invitations to claim should only be sent to those close family members who may be entitled to a payment.</p>

<p>For example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The partner/spouse of the deceased person lodges a claim as a secondary victim. In their claim, they advise that at the time of the terrorist act the deceased person had no children.<br>In this example, as the partner/spouse is entitled to 100% of AVTOP it would not be appropriate to send an invitation to claim to other parties as, under the hierarchy of close family member rules, they would not be entitled to any portion of the AVTOP.</li>
		<li>
The partner/spouse of the deceased person lodges a claim as a secondary victim. In their claim, they advise that at the time of the terrorist act the deceased person also had a child. At present the child of the deceased person has not lodged a secondary victim claim.<br>In this example, the child of the deceased person must be invited to claim as they are entitled to 50% of the portion of AVTOP (with partner/spouse entitled to the remaining 50%). If the child of the deceased did not lodge a claim, the partner/spouse would qualify for the full 100% of the payment.</li>
		<li>
Both parents of one child have died as a direct result of the same terrorist act. The legal guardian of the child lodges a secondary victim claim for both parents. However, the maximum payment that can be made to any one secondary victim in relation to a single terrorist act is $75,000.<br>In this example, the child of the deceased parents can only receive a maximum of $75,000 and as such will receive $37,500 from each claim. As there is still a proportion of the $75,000 unpaid for both of the child's parents, the parents of the partners/spouses (the child's grandparents) may qualify for a payment according to the hierarchy of close family member rules.</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if there are complex family relationships or it is possible that one person could qualify as a secondary victim for more than one deceased person from a single terrorist act, use the Payment Query Template on the <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-04020020-05.html">Resources</a> page to escalate to the Emergency Management Level 2 Helpdesk for advice.</p>

<p>When appropriate, send the AVTOP Invitation reminder to claim letter using the invitation option. Scan and upload a copy of the AVTOP SV Invitation reminder to claim letter to the customer's, and if applicable the nominee's, record. See the <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-04020020-05.html">Resources</a> page for a link to all AVTOP letters.</p>

<p>For example, if the invitation to apply letter is sent on 12 September, the earliest due date is 12 October.</p>

<p>If multiple invitations to apply are being sent, make sure all due date periods are of the same duration.</p>

<p>Review the invitation/s after 14 days and send the AVTOP Invitation reminder to claim letter using the reminder option with the same due date as the initial letter. Scan and upload a copy of the AVTOP SV Invitation reminder to claim letter to the customer's, and if applicable the nominee's, record. See the <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-04020020-05.html">Resources</a> page for all AVTOP letters.</p>
