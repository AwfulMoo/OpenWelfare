<p>This page contains scenarios of the Residential Costs Option (RCO). These examples show how the RCO may or may not be advantageous to the student. It also contains examples to assist when determining whether RCO is payable to someone who has already received a Relocation Scholarship for the same period.</p>

<h2 id=bp05_L2GT_Rent_assistance>Rent assistance</h2>
<div class=collapsible_container>
<div class=block>
<p>Rent Assistance is only calculated for the time a student is paying residential costs. Therefore, when considering whether the RCO is more beneficial this needs to be taken into account when calculating the entitlements. Generally, a student will only pay residential costs for the period of study and not during the vacation periods. Therefore, whilst a student can be paid the away from home rate during the vacation period, they do not continue to receive rent assistance during that period.</p></div></div></div>

<p>In the first year of study it is more beneficial if Bowie does not claim the RCO.</p>
<p>However, in the <strong>second and subsequent years of study</strong>, the RCO may be more beneficial due to the decrease of the Relocation Scholarship. <strong>Note:</strong> the rate of an Indigenous CAS does not decrease after the first year and is usually more beneficial than the RS.</p>
<p>Using the above figures (<strong>note:</strong> these will change with CPI and other increases) if Bowie is qualified for the regional rate of Relocation Scholarship in the second year of study, the total for No RCO would be $19,902.60. If Bowie is not qualified for the regional rate of Relocation Scholarship, the total for No RCO would be $18,630.60. Let's assume Bowie does not qualify for the regional rate of Relocation Scholarship. As both of the No RCO totals are less than what Bowie would receive under the RCO option, it would be more beneficial if Bowie accepted the RCO in the second and subsequent years of study.</p></div></div></div>

Charlotte is now living on campus, and has applied for a Rural Residential Scholarship of $3,350 which contributes to the accommodation costs. Charlotte is granted the Rural Residential Scholarship.

The residential college charges a contract break fee of $750 and the remainder of the 4 weeks residential charges of $2300. Amy is unable to pay the whole amount and requests ABSTUDY assistance. Amy has negotiated with the college and reduced the residential charges down to 2 weeks with a balance of $1150. Amy applies for ABSTUDY Additional Assistance. Additional Assistance can be approved as Amy and her family would be placed in significant financial hardship and risk of withdrawing from studies to cover these costs.</p>

Jake advises the on campus, residential fees are $400 per week.
