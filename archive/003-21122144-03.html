<p>If the customer is single and has dependent children, it can affect their rate of payment if DRA is granted. The customer <strong>does not</strong> need to be the <strong>principal carer</strong> of the child/ren. </p>

<p>To be paid at the single, with child rate of DRA/NZ DRA the customer must have at least 14% care of the child coded in their care.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> system issues currently prevent a customer from recording a child in their care who was 16 years at time of claim lodgement but was under 16 years at time of the disaster. If the customer is single and has a child listed on their record who was under 16 years on any day of the disaster consider whether the customer should be paid at the ‘single with dependent child rate’.</p>

<strong>Payment Destination<br></strong>If the customer receives regular payments and provides a new account number that has not been recorded before, confirmation may be needed to avoid ‘payment hijacking’. If there are concerns, request evidence to support the change in bank account details.

<p>This includes screens to confirm a customer’s legal residence status, country of citizenship, New Zealand residence status and visa details.</p>

<p>The system does not automatically assess a customer’s residence status.</p>

<p>To avoid granting payments incorrectly, review all screens to make sure a customer meets the <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-01010000-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Eligibility_cri">residence criteria</a>.</p>

<p>The customer <strong>does not</strong> need to be in Australia at the time of making their claim. If the customer does not meet all other eligibility criteria, the following does not need to be checked, however staff will need to progress through the screens&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Check if the customer is a legal permanent Australian resident or holds a visa that qualifies them for DRA. Visas, and in some circumstances Australian citizenship, will show on the Legal Residence Details (<strong>RSLEG</strong>) screen. To check if a visa is a permanent visa, see <a target="_blank" href="https&#58;//guides.dss.gov.au/social-security-guide/9/2">Social Security Guide, Chapter 9.2, Visa subclasses and payment eligibility for visas issued after 01/9/1994</a> </li>
		<li>
Customers may have 2 <strong>current</strong> visas showing on the <strong>RSLEG </strong>screen, for example a 444 visa and a 010 visa</li>
		<li>
Staff <strong>must</strong> check the Residence Results Explanation screen (<strong>RSREX</strong>) to check if the customer meets the residence criteria. See <strong>DRA additional eligibility</strong> and <strong>NZ DRA additional eligibility</strong> in <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-01010000-01.html">Eligibility for DRA and NZ DRA</a></li>
		<li>
To do this&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Key <strong>RSREX </strong>next to<strong> Super Key </strong>and press<strong> [Enter]</strong></li>
			<li>
The <strong>RSREX</strong> screen will show which visa is current</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Note&#58;</strong> for NZ citizens (<strong>Visa Sub Class Code </strong>will be 444)</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Staff must carefully check the <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-06010020-01.html">New Zealand Residence Status</a></li>
			<li>
Grandfathered (GRF) is a protected Special Category Visa (SCV) holder and should apply for DRA, as an Australian resident</li>
			<li>

		<li>
Travel documents, such as passports, will show on the Immigration Enquiry (<strong>RSIMME</strong>) screen</li>
		<li>
If a customer has travelled since 1 September 1994, movement information should show on the Immigration Advised Movements (<strong>RSIM</strong>) screen</li>
		<li>
A customer may have a successful immigration link but no movements if they have a passport but have not travelled since 1 September 1994</li>
		<li>

		<li>
If it is identified the customer has claimed the incorrect payment (that is, claimed DRA instead of NZ DRA or vice versa), the claim needs to be cancelled. See the <strong>Review claim details </strong>step in <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-21122144-03.html#bp03_tbl_Review_claim_Step06">Table 1</a></li>

For example, if 8 weeks income was declared, total income and divide by 4.<strong> </strong>If a different period of income is being used to assess income loss, use the amount derived as per <a target="_blank" href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-03010000-03.html">Eligibility for DRA and NZ DRA</a>. This calculated figure should be used in place of the customer’s ‘regular income’ where it was provided </li>

If customer has uploaded evidence that provides different amounts (for example, the income declared in the online claim may have been net figures whereas payslips will provide gross figures) the <strong>actual </strong>income must be used in the calculations</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Note&#58;</strong> negative amounts must be recorded for self-employed business and farmers advising they were operating at a loss. Do this by entering ‘<strong>-</strong>‘ immediately before the amount. These customers will have answered that they were trading at a loss before the disaster</li>
		<li>
<strong>Customer’s Disaster affected fortnightly income&#58;<br></strong>This refers to the customer’s fortnightly income after their income reduced as a direct result of the disaster. Service Officers need to calculate the fortnightly income based on the information provided by the customer&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Record the customer’s average fortnightly disaster affected income for the period after the date their income reduced. If the customer has provided an amount of the expected/ earned income for the 13 weeks from the date their income reduced, divide by 6.5 to get a fortnightly rate</li>
			<li>
Negative amounts must be recorded for self-employed business and farmers operating who have advised they were trading at a loss by entering ‘<strong>-</strong>‘ immediately before the amount</li>

Disaster affected income - the fortnightly rate of disaster affected income</li>

<p>Review the <strong>Claim Summary</strong> or the paper claim to get details of other income the customer has declared. </p>

<p>The online claim does not ask for details of other income pre-disaster and post loss of income.

<strong>Financial investments<br></strong>From the <strong>Claim Summary</strong>, total all financial investment balances as at the date of the disaster impact. If the customer has provided bank balances from the date of claim lodgement, these can also be accepted and coded from the date of income loss. Calculate the <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-05050000-01.html">deemed interest amounts</a> from the total of financial investments. This includes bank accounts, managed investments and shares. Enter the <strong>fortnightly</strong> amount of deemed income here (not the totalled amount of financial investments) </li>
			<li>
<strong>Business<br></strong>D<strong>o not</strong> include income from self-employment or wages from trust/companies if the customer is a shareholder/director of that company and the income has already been recorded on the <strong>Employment Details</strong></li>
			<li>
<strong>Real Estate<br></strong>The online claim asks the customer to provide <strong>gross</strong> income for any rental or non-rental income. Review the evidence provided to determine if a net figure is available on a Rental Schedule in an Income Tax Return. Enter a fortnightly amount of this net income figure in this table. The online claim also asks for other information not relevant to the assessment of DRA. <strong>Only</strong> use the information that is required for the calculation of loss of income. Other details provided do not need to be recorded on <strong>REBS</strong> for record correctness. These questions will be removed from the online claim in a future system update. If necessary, contact the customer to obtain this information and accept a verbal declaration of the required income details</li>
			<li>
Add any other income from the following sources as appropriate&#58;<br>-<strong>Trust and Companies</strong> - (<strong>do not</strong> include income where the customer is a director/shareholder of the trust/company and is paid wages as an employee.
