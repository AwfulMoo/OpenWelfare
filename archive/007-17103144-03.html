Does the customer's/partner's <a href="../families/007-17103115-01.html">activity details (ATD)</a> need updating to reflect their current circumstances?</li>

they cannot provide a safe level of care for the child/ren due to those circumstance(s)?</li>

		<li>
medical certificate. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> a standard medical certificate (including Centrelink medical certificates) advising an individual 'is unable to work' is insufficient. A medical certificate&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
should confirm the customer's diagnosis (where a serious illness), and</li>
			<li>
<strong>must</strong> include the practitioner's confirmation the customer is not able to engage in <strong>any</strong> recognised activities (not just work), and are unable to safely care for the child/ren</li>		</ul>
		<li>
death certificate</li>
		<li>
declaration of natural disaster</li>

			<ul>			<li>
 the customer's circumstances</li>
			<li>
confirmation they are not able to engage in any activity (not just work), and</li>
			<li>
the customer is unable to safely care for the child/ren</li>		</ul>
		<li>
receipts and invoices of medical and funeral expenses</li>
		<li>
fire report, police report or insurance report</li>
		<li>
any other evidence that could explain their circumstances</li>
		<li>
Commonwealth Statutory Declaration with <strong>all </strong>relevant information where documentation cannot be provided (for example, due to an emergency situation)</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer uses <a href="../families/007-17103119-01.html">In Home Care (IHC)</a>, the customer is also required to provide their Family Management Plan developed by the IHC Agency (not their IHC service).</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> evidence must outline that the customer is unable to participate in <strong>any</strong> recognised activities and provide a safe level of care for the child/ren due to those circumstance(s). If the customer requests the assessment be backdated up to the eligible 28 days (to the beginning of the CCS fortnight before the CCS fortnight in which the request is made), the evidence must cover this period.</p>

<p>If special circumstances apply, the extension options available will depend on the timing of the request with respect to the relevant deadline. The extension end date should be decided after discussing the circumstances with the customer.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> on 30 June 2020, the Department of Education, Skills and Employment (DESE) announced that the 1st deadline date for 2018-19 financial year would be extended until 31 March 2021. This allowed customers who had not met their CCS reconciliation requirements for 2018-19 to retain their CCS entitlement until 5 April 2021. The 2nd deadline for the 2018-19 remained 1 July 2021.</p>

		<li>
before the 2nd deadline with either&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
no 1st deadline extension applied previously</li>
			<li>
1st deadline previously granted which has since expired, or</li>
			<li>
1st deadline still in effect</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Determine the end date for the special circumstances extension</strong></p>

<p>The end date should be the soonest reasonable date the customer will be able to meet the requirement/s and must be an appropriate period of time to meet that requirement. This will depend on the circumstances affecting the customer. For example, it may be sufficient to only extend an income confirmation timeframe by a few months to give the customer time to lodge an income tax return.</p>

<p>CCS reconciliation requires all previous ex-partners income. If a customer is unable to meet income requirements by the 1st deadline only due to the inaction of an ex-partner, the customer can request a Most Recent Estimate (MRE) exception. This allows the balancing process to complete using the most recent estimate of the ex-partner's income from the 1st deadline.</p>

<p>Discuss the ex-partner's income and known circumstances with the customer to establish a reasonable income estimate. Investigation should not include browsing ex-partner records. Only information mentioned in conversation, or contained in the CCS customer's record (such as activity test details or previous estimates provided during the partnered period) should be used to establish income and likelihood of tax lodgement.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the MRE exception is being requested before the 1st Deadline, advise the customer that the balancing process will not commence until after the 1st Deadline. Also advise the customer that if the ex/previous-partner lodges a tax return in the meantime and all other requirements have been met, reconciliation will be triggered using the actual annual taxable income (ATI)<br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> even though the 2018/19 1st deadline has been extended until 31 March 2021, MRE Exceptions for that year will still be triggered from 1 July 2020 when this coding is completed</li>
		<li>
If the 1st Deadline has already passed and the customer's CCS is being affected by 1st deadline penalties, applying the MRE Exception will resume CCS entitlement based on customers circumstances from the start of the next CCS fortnight. It will also and trigger relevant year reconciliation if all other requirements are met. The customer will not receive arrears for the period already assessed at 0<br>Advise the customer that once reconciliation occurs using the ex-partner MRE and the ex-partner subsequently lodges an Income Tax Return, a new assessment will be untaken and re-reconciliation will occur using the actual income details and this could result in a top up, a nil payment, or an overpayment</li>

<p>Service Officers should discuss the ex-partner's income and known circumstances with the customer to establish whether the customer legitimately had no idea that the ex-partner's income estimate was going to be incorrect.</p>

<p>Investigation should not include browsing ex-partner records. Only information mentioned in conversation, or contained in the CCS customer's record (such as activity test details or previous estimates provided during the partnered period) should be used to establish income and likelihood of tax lodgement.</p>

<p>If the Service Officer is investigating customer's reconciliation result and can see an overpayment has been caused by underestimation of the ex-partner income, the ATI of the ex-partner is not to be discussed with the customer due to privacy concerns. The Service Officer may discuss the general circumstances around ex-partner employment or the reasons for the underestimation and if they are satisfied the debt is unexpected and causing the customer hardship, they may discuss reassessing the reconciliation result using the CCS percentage used during the year based on ex-partner estimates.</p>
