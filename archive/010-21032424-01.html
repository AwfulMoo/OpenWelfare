		<ul>		<li>
have completed Year 12 or equivalent qualification study, immediately before commencing tertiary studies</li>
		<li>
undertake a full-time, or an approved 66% concessional study load in a TAP approved tertiary course (Certificate IV and above)</li>
		<li>
be studying a course with a duration of at least 1 academic year. See the Resources page for <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-21032424-05.html#bp05_L3TT_Determining_if_">Determining if course is 1 year in duration for TAP</a> table</li>
		<li>
be studying on campus or via blended delivery. <strong>Note</strong>&#58; customers who have moved to live near and study at a Regional University Centre can still qualify for the TAP even where their course is online only</li>
		<li>
be under 23 years of age on the day they commence the TAP approved tertiary course</li>
		<li>
relocate because their family home is at least 90 minutes by public transport from their education institution</li>
		<li>
their family home is in an inner regional, outer regional, remote or very remote area as per the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). See the <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-21032424-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Internet_links">Resources</a> page for a link</li>
		<li>
Australian residence rules as they apply to YA (students), see <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-06020130-03.html">Residence assessment for customers claiming Youth Allowance (YA) and Tertiary Access Payment (TAP)</a></li>
		<li>
parent(s)/guardian(s)’ combined income is below $250,000 for the relevant tax year</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; in special circumstances, exemptions may apply to the eligibility criteria.</p>

<p>A student does not need to be in receipt of another Social Security Payment to qualify for the TAP, nor does another Social Security payment preclude them from TAP. They can qualify for both a Social Security Payment, including the Relocation Scholarship (RS), and the TAP.</p>

<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Parental_Income"></a>
<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Parental Income Test (PIT)</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The TAP is subject to the Parental Income Test (PIT), and the parent(s)’/guardian(s) combined income must be less than $250,000, for the relevant tax year.</p>

<p>For the purposes of TAP, the parent(s)/guardian(s) is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the natural, adoptive or relationship parent(s) of the student, if the student normally lives with them</li>
		<li>
the parent and step-parent, if the student normally lives with them</li>
		<li>
the person they are dependent on if the student does not normally live with their parent(s) and they are wholly or substantially dependent on someone other than a parent</li>
		<li>
the parent they last lived with if the student does not normally live with parent(s) and they are divorced or separated. If that parent has gained a new partner, the step parent's income is not taken into account</li>
		<li>
the adoptive parent if the student has a parent under traditional Torres Strait Islander adoption, the birth/natural parent is no longer the parent</li>
		<li>
the parent they last lived with if none of the above applies. If that parent has gained a new partner, step parent's income is not taken into account</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; in shared custody situations, including parents separated under one roof, use the parent with primary care responsibility. In 50/50 shared care situations the student may nominate which parent they want to use.</p>

<p>Generally the relevant tax year is the base tax year, however the current tax year income may be used, where an increase or decrease from the base tax year has occurred.</p>

<p>The TAP will only be payable once the parental income (base or current year) is verified, see documents accepted as evidence of parental income.</p>

<p>The current tax year should be applied where&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
combined parental income substantially decreases in the current tax year, and</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the decrease is likely to last for at least two years from the later of 1 January of the current tax year, or the date of the decrease, or</li>		</ul>
		<li>
the first TAP assessment date is from 1 October to 31 December and there is an increase in the combined parental income for the current tax year that exceeds&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
25% of the base tax year income and 25% of Parental Income Free Area (PIFA)</li>
			<li>
<strong>Note</strong>&#58; the Parental Income Free Area (PIFA) for TAP is the same as for Youth Allowance. See <a target="_blank" href="../utils/RatesChart/rateschart.html">Rates and Thresholds</a> for the current Youth Allowance Parental Income Test (PIT) free area</li>

<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Exemption from providing parent(s)/guardian(s) income </h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Unlike other dependent payments, a PIT exemption is not applied where the parent(s)/guardian(s) are in receipt of certain social security benefits, pensions or DVA payments.</p>

<p>Only in the following circumstances, are TAP students exempt from providing their parent(s)/guardian(s) income details to claim TAP&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
has (or has had) a dependent child</li>
		<li>
is an orphan</li>
		<li>
parents are unable to exercise parental responsibilities, for example, parents are in prison or a nursing home</li>
		<li>
cannot live at home because it is unreasonable to live at home (UTLAH)</li>
		<li>
is a refugee</li>
		<li>
is in State Care</li>
		<li>
Special Adult Status in a traditional community (indigenous only)</li>
		<li>
currently have care of another person's child</li>
		<li>
16yrs or older, living in an Indigenous community after previously living with a non-indigenous family for more than two years (indigenous only)</li>
		<li>
are 18 or over and have been in lawful custody for 6 months</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the student meets one of the above categories, the family home address for TAP purposes will be where they usually resided 6 months before their course commencement date.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; if a student is assessed as independent under a different reason for their income support payment (for example. PSS/PSC), the parent(s)/guardian(s) income is still required for TAP purposes, unless they also meet one of the above criteria. Examples of other independence for income support that cannot be used for TAP&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
PSS - worked in full-time employment averaging 30 hours or more per week for at least 18 months during any period of 2 years</li>
		<li>
PSC - working full-time for average of at least 30 hours per week for 18 months within a 2 year period including the COVID-19 concession period</li>
		<li>
aged 22 years or older and considered independent for other Income Support Payments</li>

<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Family home and relocation requirements</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>To be eligible for the TAP the student must have moved away from the family home, and the family home must be located in&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
inner regional</li>
		<li>
outer regional</li>
		<li>
a remote, or</li>
		<li>
a very remote area</li>

<p>Assessing the TAP family home address depends on whether the student needs to supply their parental income, or if they are exempt from doing so.</p>

<p>For students who need to supply their parent(s)/guardian(s)’ income the family home&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
is/was the address where the student's parent(s)/guardian(s) reside on the day they commenced  the relevant TAP approved course, and</li>
		<li>
remains the family home up to the first TAP assessment date</li>

<p>To meet the relocation eligibility criteria, customers must&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
be studying face to face, or in dual delivery method, for at least part of the course duration or be a registered student at a Regional University Centre (RUC), and</li>
		<li>
be studying at an education provider which is at least 90 minutes travel time from the TAP family home, including via public transport. This includes walking time and waiting times between different modes of transport or legs of a journey</li>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; customers who have moved to live near and study at a Regional University Centre can still qualify for the TAP even where their course is online only. The customer must still meet the 90 minute travel time criteria.

<p>A student can update their study and address details online through their Centrelink online account via myGov. Updating parental information, requires completing a SY105 - Tertiary Access Payment parent(s)/guardian(s) details form. Parental income already verified for another income support payment, can be accepted for the TAP. The SY105 is not available as a stand- alone form. Print the SY105 section of the SY104 to issue to customers. The SY104 is available within Online Forms on the Intranet.
