<p>This document outlines information about eligibility requirements for Veterans' Affairs Processing (VAP).</p>

<p>The Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) issues health cards to veterans, their war widow(er)s and dependants to ensure they have access to health and other care services.</p>
<div class="twisty">

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Gold_cards_D">Gold cards - 'DVA Health card - For all conditions'</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A Gold Card (Personal Treatment Entitlement Card (PTEC)) entitles the holder to DVA funding for services for all clinically necessary health care needs, and all health conditions, whether they are related to war service or not.</p>

<p>The card holder may be a veteran or the widow(er) or dependant of a veteran. Only the person named on the card is covered.</p>

<p>Prior approval for some services may be required.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_White_cards_">White cards – ‘DVA Health Card – For specific conditions’</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A White Card (Specific Treatment Eligibility Card (STEC)) entitles the holder to care and treatment for&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
accepted injuries or conditions that are war caused or service related</li>
		<li>
malignant cancer, pulmonary tuberculosis, any mental health condition whether war caused or not</li>
		<li>
the symptoms of unidentifiable conditions that arise within 15 years of service (other than peacetime service)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Services covered by a DVA White Card are the same as those for a Gold Card but must be for one of the above conditions. The veteran will have received a letter from DVA specifying their accepted disability.</p>

<p>A White Card (Specific Treatment Entitlement Card (STEC)) can also be issued to eligible personnel for the treatment of malignant neoplasm (cancer) and pulmonary tuberculosis and any mental health condition under the Non-Liability Health Care arrangements (NLHC). A formal diagnosis is required for cancer and pulmonary tuberculosis applications. </p>

<p>The card also entitles the holder to transport related to treatment of their accepted condition and access to the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</p>

<p>Generally, those medical services listed on the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) are available to White Card holders, as long as they are required to treat the veteran’s accepted disability. Any limits that apply are consistent with limits imposed under the MBS. Medical services not listed in the MBS may be considered in exceptional circumstances. Prior financial authorisation must be obtained from DVA. Where a veteran needs treatment for a health condition that is not an accepted disability, the health provider should not bill DVA.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>PAMT Initiative</strong></p>

<p>Provisional Access to Medical Treatment (PAMT) determination was introduced by DVA Policy in July 2018. A number of White card holders will be included in the initiative which allows for a group of white card conditions to be covered under the single heading of PAMT.</p>

<p>If a DVA client eligibility is listed as PAMT, payment for claims should only be given where the condition being treated relates to 1 or more of the 20 specific conditions approved for PAMT. To view the 20 specific conditions, see the <a href="../your-health/011-17010000-03.html">Process</a> page.</p>

<p>No other treatment should be approved under PAMT eligibility unless a PARS approval is provided.</p>

<p>See the <a href="../your-health/011-17010000-05.html#bp05_L2GT_External_websit01">Resources</a> page for a link to the DVA website which has more information on PAMT for veterans.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Optical and Dental services should not be paid under PAMT.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) conditions</strong></p>

<p>Spinal Cord injury white card holders have accepted conditions for certain spinal cord injuries.</p>

<p>From 23 November 2020, any SCI conditions from the SCI conditions list are covered for treatment according to the manifestations list. To view the SCI conditions and manifestations list, see the <a href="../your-health/011-17010000-03.html">Process</a> page.</p>

<p><strong>ADF Firefighters Cancer Screening </strong></p>

<p>The ADF Firefighter Scheme is a 2021-22 Budget measure designed to support those who may have been exposed to hazardous chemicals while participating in fire training at the RAAF Base Point Cook Fire Training School between 1 January 1957 and 31 December 1986. </p>

<p>From 20 September 2021, access to free screening for melanoma and colorectal cancer for white card holders that have been accepted as having ADF firefighter scheme eligible service. Treatment under the scheme entitles the veteran to the following services in accordance with existing MBS/RMFS items&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Colorectal cancer screening&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Faecal occult blood test</li>
			<li>

<p>The message <strong>2-NIL ELIG</strong> is displayed when the system detects that the DVA file number does not have entitlement at the date of service claimed. This message can also be displayed for gold and white cardholders when eligibility dates are not present. This might indicate that&#58;</p>

an interstate transfer is in progress</li>
		<li>
the veteran has lost their entitlement</li>
		<li>
a date of death is recorded</li>
		<li>

<p>Australian gold card veterans who reside overseas have their eligibility dates removed when they leave Australia. If the veteran returns to Australia they might be issued with a temporary letter from DVA advising of their entitlement to have their medical treatment billed to Services Australia. Payment is to be made in accordance with any attached letter.</p>

<p>The message <strong>2-CHK ELIG</strong> is displayed when the service claimed needs to be verified against the patient's entitlement or when a Gold cardholder (Personal Treatment Entitlement Card (PTECT)) without eligibility dates also has White card (Specific Treatment Entitlement Card (STEC)) eligibility types, for example War Caused Injury (WCI), Treatment of Malignant Neoplasia (TMN).

		<div class="block">

<p>In November 2012, the Repatriation Commission agreed to cover the health care costs of infant(s) of an entitled gold card holder while both the mother and infant(s) are in hospital.</p>

<p>As a result of this decision the costs of health care provided to the infant(s) will be covered until the mother has been discharged from hospital. Any ongoing medical costs of the infant(s) are not covered unless the infant(s) has an entitlement to health care in their own right, that is, entitlement to a Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) Health Card.</p>

<p>In situations where an infant is formally admitted to hospital as an in-patient, for example, neo-natal intensive care, health complications, or is a subsequent child of a multiple birth, DVA will cover the hospital expenses for the infant until either the mother or the infant(s) are discharged from hospital, whichever occurs first.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>Australian veterans are entitled to receive cancer treatment irrespective of whether this condition is war caused.</p>

<p>Australian veterans with cancer and no other treatment entitlement are issued with a white card.</p>

<p>Veterans with entitlement for Treatment of Malignant Neoplasia (TMN) (cancer) are eligible to receive treatment for all cancer conditions, not just the initial cancer identified. Eligibility for subsequent cancer is effective from the same date as the earlier condition, regardless of the time between diagnoses.</p>

<p>Treatment of hyperkeratoses, or similar conditions, may also be authorised if the veteran is currently receiving treatment for basal or squamous cell carcinoma. In these cases a Prior Approval and Referral System (PARS) record authorising treatment must be raised prior to payment. If there is no prior approval present refer to Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) South Australia for consideration.</p>

<p>Veterans may receive treatment for other conditions, symptoms or sequelae associated with the treatment of their cancer. For example, the provision of an artificial eye to replace one lost as a result of radiotherapy for malignant neoplasia. In these cases a PARS check confirming their eligibility for treatment is required prior to payment. If there is no prior approval present refer to DVA for consideration.</p>

<p>Veterans from all other countries must have their cancer accepted as a disability by the relevant overseas authority and are only entitled to receive treatment for the particular cancer accepted.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> in some instances hospital accommodation items may create a pseudo Prior Approval and Referral System (PARS) record even though DVA has declined approval for the admission of an ineligible person. When an eligibility message is returned for Treatment Other Countries veterans, check VEPI to see whether there is a PARS record with the status of R.

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Some veterans can lose their treatment eligibility if their service pension is reassessed. Where there has been a partial loss of eligibility, veterans will have their gold card cancelled and white card issued. In these cases, accepted disabilities will be available in pend processing.</p>

<p>Where eligibility has been lost completely the VEXI screen will indicate Personal Treatment Entitlement Card (PTEC) as the last card but the veteran will have no accepted disabilities.</p>

<p>It is possible for a person transferring interstate to have PTEC recorded with no accepted disabilities, however in the majority of cases this is due to eligibility loss.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> this only applies to veterans.</p>
