<UL>
<LI>ETS are community based schemes where goods and services are exchanged without money</LI>
<LI>ETS schemes have a local unit of exchange, often called an 'eco', but other names for the unit of exchange are also used</LI>
<LI>To be exempt from the Income Test, the scheme has to be an 'approved scheme' under the Act</LI></UL>
<P>The Secretary may class an ETS as an 'approved scheme' if all the following are met:</P>
<UL>
<LI>it is a local community-based system</LI>
<LI>its primary purpose is to help people maintain their labour skills and keep them in touch with the labour market</LI>
<LI>it is not a system run by a person or organisation for profit</LI></UL>

<P><STRONG>International Agreements - payments exempted</STRONG></P>
<P>For all Agreements, Australia disregards from the Income Test the social welfare payments (income tested payments) which the Agreement country makes. It is very rare to find any Agreement country paying its social welfare payments to people in Australia.</P>
<P>Most Agreement countries only make such payments to people residing in (and usually present in) their own territory. In those cases, Australia disregards the payments from its Income Test. If cases occur where people in Australia are receiving such payments (whether legally or illegally), they must be disregarded from Australia's Income Test in line with the provisions of the particular Agreement.</P>
<P>Remember that when a pensioner is receiving a pension under the direct deduction provisions of an Agreement, social welfare amounts (although disregarded under the Income Test) are included in the overseas pension amount directly deducted.</P>

<P>If a customer is granted NEIS and their partner is receiving PP Partnered (PPP), NEIS is not treated as income for PPP.</P>
<P>Drought Relief (DRP) payments were treated as income for PP purposes. This income can only be added in the PGA system.</P>
<P>DRP became Exceptional Circumstances Relief Payment (ECRP).</P>
<P>ECRP is income for PP purposes. It can only be recorded in the PGA system.</P>
<P>Gifts and allowances received as 'one off' payments are not taken into account for either pensions or allowances.</P>
<P>Farm Family Restart Scheme (FFR) Payment (now known as Farm Help) is income for PP purposes. It can only be recorded in the PGA system.</P>
<P>Gifts and allowances for all social security benefits except Special Benefit are assessed as income only if the gifts are made on a regular basis. However, gifts made by members of the immediate family are not considered income.</P>
<P>From 1 July 2017, any periodical payment or benefit by way of gift or allowance from an immediate family member (parent, child, brother or sister) will be considered exempt income for the purposes of the income test for all social security benefits (and ABSTUDY) excluding Special Benefit, aligning with current rules applied to social security pensions.</P>
<P>Special Benefit has a direct deduction income test and all income including any gifts and allowances must be assessed.</P>
<P>For dependent Youth Allowance, ABSTUDY and AIC customers, a parent receiving a PP listed under section 1067G-F3, is exempt from the Parental Income Test.</P>

<P>Spousal maintenance is money (or in kind payment) made to a former partner following a divorce or separation. It does not include payments for dependent children. Payments are usually made periodically, but can be received as lump sums. Spousal maintenance is distinct from a property settlement, which is the return of a person's own property.</P>
<P>For the person who receives spousal maintenance from a legally enforceable agreement, the maintenance is <STRONG>not</STRONG> assessed as ordinary income under the Income Test for income support purposes. However, it is taken into account under the Maintenance Income Test for family assistance payment purposes.</P>
<P>However, in cases where the arrangement to pay spousal maintenance is not documented in a legally enforceable manner, the gross amount of income is used in assessing the payer's rate of income support. For example, where the only evidence of any arrangement is a verbal agreement or statutory declaration.</P>
