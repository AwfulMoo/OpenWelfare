<p>If a transfer to Age Pension is not submitted online, via ACC or the Transfer to Age Pension (SA383) is not returned by the customer's Age Pension eligibility date, their (and their partner's) current payment will be suspended. Identified Indigenous customers will not have their payments suspended in this case.</p>

<p>CP becomes taxable income when they reach Age Pension age.</p>

<p>Once a CP customer reaches Age Pension age, they have access to the <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010130-01.html">Work Bonus</a> whether they remain on CP or transfer to Age Pension.</p>

<p>As CP has no upper age limit they can choose to transfer to Age Pension or stay on CP.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the 14 week bereavement period ends after 1 July, Service Officers must not transfer the customer from CP to Age Pension until after this date. This ensures the carer is paid the annual <a href="../carers/009-07010000-01.html">Carer Supplement (CS)</a> payment. If the carer has gone overseas either before or after the start of the bereavement period and their allowable portability period ends before 1 July, they should be transferred to Age Pension while in receipt of CP. This also applies if they are in the 14 week extension of CP when the care receiver has permanently entered an institution.</p>

<p><strong>Disability Support Pension (DSP)</strong></p>

<p>If a customer has returned temporarily to Australia following an extended absence, be very careful about transferring them to Age Pension if they are likely to return overseas within the next 2 years.</p>

<p>If a transfer to Age Pension is not submitted online, via ACC or the Transfer to Age Pension (SA383) is not returned by the customer's Age Pension eligibility date, their (and their partner's) current payment will be suspended. Identified Indigenous customers, with the exception of single DSP customers in receipt of Rent Assistance, will not have their payments suspended in this case.</p>

<p>Once transferred to Age Pension, a customer cannot be transferred back to DSP unless they would be better off financially - that is, loss of eligibility to Pensioner Education Supplement (PES), change in RA rate due to sharer provisions or in rare cases receiving a lesser rate due to proportional portability, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if transferred back to DSP following a review of the decision to transfer to Age Pension, they will retain their previous status (for example, DSP grandfathered group/DSP transition group).</p>

<p>DSP becomes taxable when they reach Age Pension age.</p>

<p>Once a DSP customer reaches Age Pension age, they have access to the <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010130-01.html">Work Bonus</a> whether they remain on DSP or transfer to Age Pension.</p>

<p>DSP has no upper age limit if claimed before reaching Age Pension age. DSP cannot be claimed once Age Pension age is reached as stated in section 28 of Social Security (Administration) Act 1999.</p>

<p>If a DSP customer has been transferred to Age Pension in error, or they are financially better off on DSP, escalate to Technical Peer Support (TPS)/Service Support Officer (SSO) for corrective action. DSP cannot be granted or re-granted after a customer has turned Age Pension age, it can only be restored. See <a target="_blank" href="../people-with-disability/008-03130020-01.html">Restoration of DSP</a>.</p>

<p>If a customer wants to transfer back to DSP for any other reason, they will need to request a review of decision. See <a target="_blank" href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/109-02000000-01.html">Request for an explanation, quality check or review (CLK)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>DSP (Blind) customers</strong></p>

<p>These customers do not have to have a medical assessment to transfer to Age Pension (Blind).</p>

<p>If the Pension Disability Information (<strong>PDI</strong>) screen shows <strong>Y</strong> in the <strong>Means not Disclosed Ind&#58;</strong> field, the customer is exempt from the income and asset test and does not have to advise of their income and assets. Customers who are currently receiving DSP (Blind) free of the means test will be issued a modified version of the SA383 without the superannuation question.</p>

<p>If the customer has a partner who is on or applying for an income support payment (other than Blind), details of the customer's superannuation are needed to determine their partner's eligibility.</p>

<p><strong>DSP is suspended due to returning to work</strong></p>

<p>These DSP customers are eligible to claim Age Pension using the online transfer, via ACC or Transfer to Age Pension (SA383). As their DSP can be suspended for up to 2 years they must be contacted to check all details on their record are still current and a reporting regime considered for employment income.</p>

<p>As qualification and/or pay ability of DSP and Age Pension is not overlapping or continuous in these cases, the transfer provisions of section 12 of the Social Security (Administration) Act (SSAA) 1999 do not apply in regards to backdating of up to 13 weeks. Where lodgement is after the Age Pension qualification date, the start day must be determined in accordance with the <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-05010010-01.html">start day rules for new claims</a>.</p>

<p>The birth dates requiring this extra step are 31 March, 29, 30, or 31 August, 31 October and 31 December. For customers born on these days, whose Age Pension age is a half year, use the following dates as date of grant of Age Pension&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
for 31 March, use 1 October (as September has only 30 days)</li>
		<li>
for 29 August, use 1 March, or 29 February if it is a leap year (as February has 29 days in a leap year, and 28 days for all other years)</li>
		<li>
for 30 and 31 August, use 1 March (as February has a maximum of 29 days)</li>
		<li>
for 31 October, use 1 May (as April has only 30 days)</li>
		<li>
for 31 December, use 1 July (as June has only 30 days)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Leap years&#58;</strong> to check if a year is a leap year, divide the year by 4. If the answer is a whole number it is a leap year. As 2004 is divisible by 4, it is a leap year.</p>

<p>The residence exemption no longer applies if the customer ceases to qualify for Widow Allowance (WA) or Partner Allowance (PA) on the day immediately before the day their reach Age Pension age.</p>

<p>Example&#58;</p>

<p>A WA customer is under Age Pension age with less than 10 years residence. They become partnered 2 weeks before reaching Age Pension age and their WA is cancelled.</p>

<p>In this case the customer loses entitlement to the payment applicable under section 43(1)(c) of the Social Security Act 1999 before turning Age Pension age. Therefore, they do not qualify for Age Pension as they do not have the 10 year residence required and at the time they turn Age Pension age they were not in receipt of WA the day immediately before.</p>
