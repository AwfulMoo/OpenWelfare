<p>Customers <strong>must</strong> be advised of how often they can be paid an advance, prior to any advance being finalised, so the customer has a chance to change the amount.</p>

<p>Customers can receive multiple advance payments (as long as the minimum amount is available each time). If the customer selects to have an advance at the maximum amount they are only eligible for one advance every 13 fortnights.</p>

<p>Over a 13 fortnight period, a pension customer could choose to receive&#58;</p>

one advance payment of the maximum amount available, or</li>

one or two advance payments of an amount greater than the minimum and up to the maximum, or</li>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; before finalising the application, fully inform the customer of the payment amount available and the option of receiving up to 3 multiple advance payments over a 13 fortnight period.</p>

<p>A consumer price index (CPI) increase can affect a customer's entitlement for an advance due to the increasing minimum and maximum rates. </p>

<p>Customers ineligible to use digital services to apply for an advance are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Customers who have a nominee arrangement in place</li>
		<li>
Family Tax Benefit (FTB) customers who are under 18 can claim via telephone or a service centre. They are required to have a discussion either over the phone or in person prior to applying to ensure consideration has been taken regarding the impacts/risks or an advance payment</li>
		<li>
Weekly payment customers can apply via telephone or at a service centre but cannot use self service channels</li>
		<li>
Independent customers under 18 years of age are considered 'at risk' customers and must have a face-to-face interview when applying for an advance (except if rural and/or remote). Rurally isolated customers are those who live in rural or remote areas who live more than 90 minutes from a service centre and have no access to a service centre</li>
		<li>
Customers who face physical or intellectual barriers to accessing digital options can apply over the telephone or in person</li>

<p>An advance payment can only be granted if the customer can afford to repay the advance without being placed in financial hardship. This is determined by the amount the customer states they can afford each fortnight after they consider their regular fortnightly expenses.</p>

<p>If a customer states they have $40 left over each fortnight they will only be offered an amount equal to 13 times this amount even though they may have otherwise been eligible for a higher amount.</p>

<p>If a reduced or suspended repayment arrangement is in place for an existing advance (for example, Family Tax Benefit (FTB)), this should be reviewed before any new advance is assessed. If the repayments on the existing advance cannot be returned to the standard rate without causing financial hardship, a further advance should not be granted.</p>

any delays in repaying a previous advance payment granted more than 6 months ago</li>
		</ul>
<p>A system limitation exists for advance payments of pensions that arises when an advance payment was granted on the customer's Entitlement Period End Date (EPED). The <a href="../payment-delivery/103-05040070-05.html">Resources</a> page contains further information and examples of calculating the next advance date manually.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> it is not appropriate to estimate the next available date for an advance payment by using the <strong>Deduction End Date</strong> field within the Manage Advances action in Process Direct as this is not the only factor that affects eligibility for an advance payment.</p>
