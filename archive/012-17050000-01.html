<p>This document outlines information about hospital claims processing for Veterans’ Affairs Processing (VAP).</p>
<div class="twisty">
	
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Hospital_claims"></a>
<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Hospital_claims">Introduction to hospital claims processing</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The Treatment Account System (TAS) allows accounts received from private hospitals and public hospital (limited items) to be processed. Hospital services include private hospital accommodation fees, theatre fees and miscellaneous items such as prostheses. When processing claims received from hospitals, ensure that&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
claim forms are signed in accordance with business rules</li>
		<li>
each service entered into the system is a complete and accurate reflection of the services shown on the account</li>
		<li>
the results of processing are checked against the details on the account before the claim is paid</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where there is any discrepancy between the results of processing and the amount claimed, the situation must be clarified with a supervisor.</p>

<p>The Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA) and Services Australia in collaboration have developed a paperless claiming system for hospitals through ECLIPSE Release 6.</p>

<p>The majority of hospitals are now using the paperless In Hospital Claiming (IHC) system but hospital claims may still be received manually.</p>

<p>DVA has contracts with a large number of private hospitals including Day Procedure Centres (DPC) throughout Australia in order to provide veterans with a comprehensive range of hospital services. The contracts governing the provision of these services are often complex and the Hospital Contracts Maintenance System (HCVS/VAMM) is used to store details of these contracts.</p>

<p>DVA is responsible for negotiating and managing contracts with private hospitals. They are also responsible for ensuring that existing contracts are renegotiated in a timely manner and for checking to ensure that contract details are correct.</p>

<p>The contract information held by the system is used when contracted private hospitals lodge claims for services provided to veterans. It allows individual claims to be compared with contract details so that claims are paid according to the rates and conditions agreed to in those contracts.</p>

<p>When processing claims lodged by contracted private hospitals, the system checks the contract that applies on the date of service involved and calculates payment at the rate agreed to in the contract. If items claimed are not in the contract on the date of service, the system will not be able to calculate payment. If this situation occurs operators may reject the service with <strong>RSN</strong> code <strong>201</strong>. The payment made for services rendered by contracted private hospitals will be the amount agreed to in the contract regardless of the amount claimed. Public hospital claims are paid according to the relevant item’s scheduled fee held on the DVA Item Fee File (QITI).</p>

<p>If a provider requires this information their request must be made in writing. All requests for confidential information are sent to the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) for approval. Please forward all written requests to release confidential information to the VAP Helpdesk.</p>

<p>Veterans' Affairs Processing is able to confirm the accuracy of confidential information or respond to general processing enquiries on the VAP Hotline.</p>

<p>Hospital contract information is <strong>Commercial in Confidence</strong> and must be kept in an area that prevents access by unauthorised persons. Details of contracts held in our processing systems must not be disclosed to unauthorised persons.</p>

<p>Personal information such as a veteran's date of birth, address or disabilities must not be disclosed over the telephone and any requests for such information must be made to DVA.</p>

<p>A veteran's file number or claim information may be disclosed to providers and hospital accounts staff if sufficient information can be given to uniquely identify the veteran and information is requested in the course of usual claiming procedures.</p>

<p>When in doubt as to whether information can be disclosed, discuss the matter with a supervisor or manager before releasing the information that has been requested.</p>

<p>Before details of a service provided in a private hospital can be keyed in the data entry screen, the claim must be registered. Each in-hospital claim is for a single patient only. Outpatient or emergency services may be processed for multiple patients within the same claim.</p>

<p>Private hospital services are keyed on the private hospital data entry (<strong>VKHC</strong>) screen, while public hospital services are keyed on the public hospital data entry (<strong>VKRC</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>The details that need to be entered vary depending on the type of service provided. The <a href="../health-professionals/012-17050000-03.html">Process</a> page provides instruction on the data entry requirements for each type. </p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> for public hospitals there is no provision for entering account reference or invoice numbers. Therefore, account reference or invoice numbers cannot be printed on the Statement of Benefit.</p>

<p>Overnight accommodation claims and day only claims containing theatre fees require details of the operation or procedure performed to be keyed in addition to the accommodation lines involved. The details determine the benefit payable.</p>

<p>A certified complex procedure is when the following Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) items are involved&#58;</p>

40309</li>
		<li>
40312</li>
		</ul>
<p>The claim certifies the procedure involved was complex. Complex certification increases the amount paid for theatre fees for the items involved.</p>

<p>Procedure groupings are used to determine the amount paid for theatre fees. When all of the services are rendered at the same attendance, the procedure discount rule will be applied to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
all of the services involved</li>
		<li>
each individual group of services, where they are rendered at different times on the same day</li>
		</ul>
<p>When the amounts claimed for theatre fees rendered on the same day are not listed in amount order, it is advisable to key them in amount order to avoid additional pend actions. This will also ensure the correct amounts are printed on the statement of benefit.</p>

<p>When surgically implanted prostheses items are claimed, the appropriate Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) item number must be identified in the Schedule.</p>

<p>The system will pay up to the amount shown on the Schedule. Payment will be limited to the amount claimed, if the amount claimed is less than the amount listed.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If the hospital lodges a prostheses claim and no claim is made for accommodation services, the prostheses item can be processed on its own.</p>

<p>The system will pay up to the maximum amount shown on <strong>QITI</strong> for the prostheses item claimed. Refer to the appropriate prostheses list to confirm the maximum fee payable. If the amount claimed for the prostheses item is less than the amount listed in the schedule, payment will be limited to the amount claimed.</p>

<p>Where multiples of the same prostheses item are claimed, these items can be bulked by entering the total number of prostheses claimed in the <strong>NO</strong> field and adding the total charge together and entering the total charge in the amount field.</p>

<p>A restriction applies to some prosthetic items when claimed multiple times on the same date of service from the same hospital. The restriction is applied by the Department of Health and Aged Care, and therefore also applied to DVA prostheses claims and payments. If there is a restriction in <strong>QITI</strong> on claiming a prostheses item more than once on the same date of service, payment should not be made unless there is a DVA approval for the second and subsequent prosthetic item(s). </p>

<p>DVA no longer pays handling fees for prosthesis claims.</p>

<p><strong>Public hospital claims for prostheses</strong></p>

<p>The Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA) has advised that all claims from public hospitals where the date of service is after 30 June 2016 should be rejected with RSN 547.</p>

<p>When surgically implanted prosthesis items are claimed&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the invoice should be checked</li>
		<li>
