<p>Compare the DMA report to the JCA report. Ensure all medical conditions are assessed in the JCA report, are considered and recorded in the DMA report. Conditions assessed as <strong>customer or recipient reported</strong> or <strong>other</strong> in the JCA report do not have to be considered by the GCD, but may be assessed if medical evidence is provided or obtained during the course of the assessment.</p>

<p>In some cases, the GCD</p>
		<ul>		<li>
disagrees with the JCA about the presence of a medical condition. </li>
		<li>
determines the customer is <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03030140-03.html">manifestly medically eligible</a>. GCD must record the manifest indictor in the report. They need to mark the condition as permanent and verified by medical evidence. It is not mandatory to mark the condition as fully diagnosed, treated and stabilised (FDTS) or assign Impairment Rating(s)</li>
		</ul>
<p>The GCD must outline this in the section titled <strong>Does your report differ from the JCA?</strong> In these cases, it is considered that the medical condition has been assessed.</p>

<p>The GCD&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
must not provide an alternative diagnosis to that documented in the medical evidence, or a provisional diagnosis of a medical condition, and</li>
		<li>
may determine the customer has additional medical conditions or the medical condition/s selected by the JCA are incorrect. Check this is clearly explained in the DMA report</li>
		</ul>
<p>Medical conditions assessed separately in the JCA report must be assessed separately in the DMA report. If a GCD has chosen to combine or separate out medical conditions as documented in the JCA report, check this is clearly explained in the DMA report.</p>

<p><strong>Contributing GCD assessments</strong></p>

<p>For some DMA referrals, multiple GCDs may be involved in assessing the customer's medical conditions. The customer will have their DMA assessment conducted by the Primary GCD. A Contributing GCD completes the assessment of other conditions as needed.</p>

<p><strong>The Primary GCD</strong> is assigned based on the medical condition with the highest functional impact/combined functional impact as indicated in the DMA referral. If their nature is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
physical, a Medical Practitioner is assigned</li>
		<li>
psychological, a Clinical Psychologist is assigned</li>
		<li>
split between physical and psychological, a Medical Practitioner is assigned</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the Primary GCD can assess the secondary conditions they can do so, but a <strong>Contributing GCD</strong> is <strong>compulsory</strong> if the customer has 2 primary conditions that attract 20 points each on different tables. For example, 20 points on a <strong>physical</strong> table and 20 points on a <strong>psychological</strong> table.</p>

<p>The Primary GCD may consider obtaining a Contributing GCD assessment if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they feel the secondary conditions are out of scope of practice. For example, if a DMA has primary physical conditions and significant psychological secondary conditions such as intellectual disability or mental health conditions</li>
		<li>
FDTS, or impairment rating recommendations for the primary conditions are significantly different to the JCA or SA471 (Disability Medical Assessment during appeal)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where multiple GCDs have been involved in the DMA assessment (assessing different medical conditions), the PDF version of the DMA report contains information from each GCD. The Primary GCD's complete assessment is followed by the Contributing GCD's complete assessment.</p>

<p>The report must be returned if a GCD indicates&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they cannot assess some medical conditions, even if the primary medical condition attracts 20 points or more. Return the report for the additional conditions to be assessed, before it is used to process a claim or undertake a review of decision</li>
		<li>
that 'assessment of secondary medical conditions are not relevant for the purposes of this assessment' (or similar wording), and there are secondary medical conditions which have not been assessed</li>
		<li>
the customer meets manifest criteria, but the relevant indicator is not displayed in the DMA report</li>
		</ul>
<p>Does the DMA report consider all medical conditions supported by medical evidence and assessed in the JCA report?</p>

<p>The GCD must show they have formed an independent view on all medical conditions the customer has at the time of the assessment. This must include <strong>at least</strong> all conditions assessed in the JCA report which are supported by medical evidence. The GCD must not rely solely on the JCA report to form their opinion or advise they are not qualified to complete an assessment of particular medical conditions. If text in the DMA report substantially relies on or copies the text in the JCA report, the DMA report <strong>must</strong> be returned.</p>

<p>To show an independent view of all medical conditions, the report should contain enough medical information and justification of recommendations for the Delegate to feel confident the recommendations are evidence-based and comply with legislation.

<p>If a customer has multiple conditions rated on the same Impairment Table, the combined functional impact must be assigned against 1 of the medical conditions. The second or subsequent time that Impairment Table is used, an impairment rating of zero must be applied.</p>

<p>If a customer has 2 or more medical conditions with a common impairment, only one relevant table should be applied and a single impairment rating assigned to reflect the combined impairment. It would be inappropriate to assign a separate impairment rating for each medical condition as this would result in the same impairment being assessed more than once (double counting).</p>

<p>Sometimes GCDs need to contact a customer's THP to verify medical evidence. In limited cases, a DMA can be completed with the customer's THP, for example when the person is in prison, psychiatric confinement or deceased.</p>

<p>If THP contact is needed, a GCD must document the following.</p>

<p>For successful contacts&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the date they contacted the THP</li>
		<li>
the name of the person they spoke with, and</li>

the dates (2 different business days) on which they tried to contact</li>
		<li>
which THP they tried to contact, and</li>
		<li>
what information they needed from the THP</li>
		</ul>
<p>If this information is not included, return the report for the information to be added.</p>

<p>Refer all submitted DMA reports conducted without contact with the customer <strong>or</strong> the THP to the GCD Liaison Officer for advice before acceptance. In the referral, explain why the DMA report should or should not be accepted. The GCD Liaison Officer will provide advice on how to proceed.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; in certain circumstances, DMA appointments are booked to be completed with a THP as a directive from Services Australia. To identify these cases, check the referral note in the DMA referral. If the GCD has been unable to contact the THP, the GCD will record this in the additional comments section in the DMA report. Do not refer these cases to the GCD Liaison Officer.</p>

<p>If a final employment income payment is received in the first entitlement period which is above the income threshold, DSP is not payable. The legislation states a customer cannot access a nil rate employment income rate (CUR/CZR) in the first entitlement period. The start date is to be moved in this situation (excluding claims for DSP Blind customers exempt from the income and asset test).</p>

<p>Compare the DMA report to the JCA report to ensure that at a minimum, all medical conditions assessed in the JCA report have been considered and recorded in the DMA report. Conditions assessed as <strong>customer or recipient reported</strong> or <strong>other</strong> in the JCA report do not have to be considered by the GCD, but may be assessed if medical evidence is provided or obtained during the course of the assessment.</p>

<p>In some cases, GCD&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
disagrees with the JCA about the presence of a medical condition</li>
		<li>
determines the customer is manifestly medically eligible. GCD must record the manifest indictor in the report. They need to mark the condition as permanent and verified by medical evidence. It is not mandatory to mark the condition as FDTS or assign Impairment Rating(s)</li>
		</ul>
<p>GCD must outline this in the section titled <strong>Does your report differ from the JCA?</strong> In these cases, it is considered that the medical condition has been assessed&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the GCD must <strong>not provide an alternative diagnosis</strong> to that documented in the medical evidence, or a provisional diagnosis of a medical condition</li>
		<li>
the GCD may determine the customer has additional medical conditions or the medical condition/s selected by the JCA are incorrect. Check this is clearly explained in the DMA report</li>
		</ul>
<p>Medical conditions assessed separately in the JCA report should be assessed separately in the DMA report. If a GCD has chosen to combine or separate out medical conditions as documented in the JCA report, check this is clearly explained in the DMA report</p>

<p><strong>Contributing GCD assessments</strong></p>

<p>For some DMA referrals, multiple GCDs may be involved in assessing the customer's medical conditions. The customer has their DMA assessment conducted by the Primary GCD and a Contributing GCD completes the assessment of other conditions as needed.</p>

<p><strong>The Primary GCD</strong> is assigned based on the medical condition with the highest functional impact/combined functional impact as indicated in the DMA referral. If the primary functional impact(s)&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
is physical in nature, a Medical Practitioner is assigned as the Primary GCD</li>
		<li>
are psychological in nature, a Clinical Psychologist is assigned as the Primary GCD</li>
		<li>
are split between physical and psychological, a Medical Practitioner is assigned as the Primary GCD</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the Primary GCD can assess the secondary conditions they can do so, but a Contributing GCD is <strong>compulsory</strong> if the customer has 2 primary conditions that attract 20 points each on different tables, for example, 20 points on a <strong>physical</strong> table and 20 points on a <strong>Psychological</strong> table.</p>

<p>The Primary GCD may consider obtaining a Contributing GCD assessment if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they feel the secondary conditions are out of scope of practice, for example if a DMA has primary physical conditions and significant psychological secondary conditions such as intellectual disability or mental health conditions</li>
		<li>
the fully diagnosed, treated and stabilised (FDTS) or impairment rating recommendations for the primary conditions are significantly different to that of the JCA or SA471 (Disability Medical Assessment during appeal)</li>
		</ul>
<p>If multiple GCDs have been involved in the DMA assessment (assessing different medical conditions), the PDF version of the DMA report contains information from each GCD. The Primary GCD's complete assessment is followed by the Contributing GCDs complete assessment.</p>

<p>If report must be returned if a GCD indicates&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they cannot assess some medical conditions, even if the primary medical condition attracts 20 points or more. Return the report for the additional conditions to be assessed, before it is used to process a claim or undertake a review of decision</li>
		<li>
that 'assessment of secondary medical conditions are not relevant for the purposes of this assessment' (or similar wording), and there are secondary medical conditions which have not been assessed</li>
		<li>
the customer meets manifest criteria but the relevant indicator is not displayed in the DMA report </li>
		</ul>
<p>Does the DMA report consider all medical conditions supported by medical evidence and assessed in the JCA report?</p>

<p>The GCD must demonstrate they have formed an independent view on all medical conditions the customer has at the time of the assessment. At a minimum, this must include all conditions assessed in the JCA report, supported by medical evidence. The GCD must not rely solely on the JCA report to form their opinion or advise that they are not qualified to complete an assessment of particular medical conditions. If text in the DMA report substantially relies on or copies the text in the JCA report, the DMA report <strong>must</strong> be returned.</p>

<p>If a customer has multiple conditions rated on the same Impairment Table, the combined functional impact must be assigned against 1 of the medical conditions. The second or subsequent time that Impairment Table is used, an impairment rating of zero must be applied.</p>

<p>If a customer has 2 or more medical conditions with a common impairment, only one relevant table should be applied and a single impairment rating assigned to reflect the combined impairment.

		</ul>
<p>If this information is not included, return the report for the information to be added.</p>

<p>All submitted DMA reports conducted without contact with the customer <strong>or</strong> the THP should be referred to the GCD Liaison Officer for advice before acceptance. In the referral, explain why the DMA report should or should not be accepted. The GCD Liaison Officer will provide advice on how to proceed.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; in certain circumstances, DMA appointments are booked to be completed with a THP as a directive from Services Australia. To identify these cases, check the referral note in the DMA referral. If the GCD has been unable to contact the THP, the GCD will record this in the additional comments section in the DMA report.

Both primary and secondary medical conditions must be completed to a satisfactory standard. Once a DMA referral is in a status of finalised it cannot be referred back to the GCD for amendment.</p>

<p>When quality issues are identified with a DMA report after it has been accepted, delegates are to discuss with an SSO before returning the report. An SSO may contact the GCD Contract Management Team for advice if required, see <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03030130-05.html">Resources</a>. <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03030130-03.html#bp03_tbl_Check_a_DMA_rep01_Step08">Go to Step 8</a> to hold DMA and refer to SSO.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when updating the DMA Referral Activity page staff <strong>must</strong> ensure they save or cancel any changes before exiting - <strong>do not</strong> simply hit the clear record button.

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> staff must exit the record immediately following DMA acceptance, regardless of the claim outcome that is grant or reject.</p>

<p><strong>Do not return to the customer record</strong>. Staff <strong>must not</strong> return to the customer's record after accepting the DMA report unless the claim is allocated via WLM for action.</p>

<p>The auto-finalisation process is triggered when the Delegate exits the customer's record. Accessing the record again will interrupt the auto-process being completed and these claims will not auto-finalise.</p>

<p>Acceptance of the DMA report triggers the system to auto-finalise the claim. The system attempts&#58;</p>

auto-population of the DMA data to the <strong>MC</strong> screen and <strong>WC</strong> screens</li>
		<li>
auto-unlock and acceptance of the JCA report</li>

<strong>Grant&#58;</strong> claims will attempt to auto-grant if the DMA supports a grant outcome, and the above 2 steps have completed successfully</li>
			<li>
<strong>Rejection&#58;</strong> where claims are to be rejected, follow the auto-finalisation process steps above, to ensure the customer record has been populated with the DMA/JCA report information. A claim rejection outcome will not auto-finalise under <strong>any</strong> circumstance</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>If the DMA <strong>supports</strong> a grant (including manifest), the DSP claim will be auto-finalised. Where the auto-finalisation process is unable to be completed, the claim will be flagged and presented through the Workload Manager for action. See <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03030130-05.html">Resources</a> page if system cannot finalise DSP new claim activity. If the system is successful in granting the claim for DSP, the customer is issued the grant letter and the record is <strong>DOC</strong>'d. No Service Offer Interview is required for these customers.</p>

<p>If the DMA <strong>does not support</strong> a grant, the auto-finalisation process will not be completed and the claim will be flagged and presented to the Delegate through the Workload Manager for action.</p>

<p>If the system cannot auto-finalise the grant of DSP claim and a manual action is required, see <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03030130-03.html#bp03_tbl_Manually_grant_01_Step01">Step 1 in Table 4</a>.</p>
