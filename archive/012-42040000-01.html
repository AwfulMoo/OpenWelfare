<p>The After Hours Other Medical Practitioners (AHOMPs) program closed to new applicants from 1 January 2019. See <a href="../health-professionals/012-42040000-01.html#bp01_L2GT_Important_chang01">Important Changes to OMPs Programs</a> for more information.</p>

<p>The intent of the AHOMPs program is to recognise the value of after-hours services provided by non-vocationally recognised general practitioners.</p>

<p>The program provides access to higher general practitioner Medicare benefits (group A11 and A22 in the MBS) for non-vocationally recognised medical practitioners providing after-hours general practice services through an accredited general practice or an accredited Medical Deputising Service (MDS)</p>

<p>Medical practitioners on the AHOMPs are required to obtain fellowship within 6 years of registration on the AHOMPs program. Under the AHOMPs guidelines the period can be extended if there are extenuating circumstances. Requests for extensions are approved on a case by case basis by the Department of Health and Aged Care. All enquires and applications for extension should be referred to Health.</p>

<p>Applications to apply for inclusion in the AHOMPs program are available on Health’s website. The <a href="../health-professionals/012-42040000-05.html">Resources</a> page contains a link to the website.</p>

<p>The specialty code for AHOMPs is 199.</p>

<p><strong>Eligibility requirements</strong></p>

<p>To be eligible for the AHOMPs program, a medical practitioner <strong>must </strong>satisfy all the following criteria&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Be a participant in an Other Medical Practitioners (OMPs) program on or after 1 January 2019</li>
		<li>
Be registered as a medical practitioner with the Medical Board of Australia</li>
		<li>
Be a non-vocationally recognised medical practitioner </li>
		<li>
<strong>Already</strong> be eligible to claim Medicare benefits, as the AHOMPs program alone will not allow access</li>
		<li>
Provide after-hours general practice services through an accredited general practice or Medical Deputising Service (MDS)</li>
		<li>
Commit to undertake assessments and attain Fellowship of the RACGP or ACRRM within 6 years of starting on the Program</li>
		<li>
Satisfy ongoing continuing professional development requirements</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Eligible locations</strong></p>

<p>To be an eligible location for the AHOMPs program, a location must be either a general practice or an MDS that holds accreditation from one of the Australian Government nominated accreditation bodies.</p>

<p>The accreditation bodies are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Australian General Practice Accreditation Limited (AGPAL) and</li>
		<li>
Quality Practice Accreditation Pty Ltd (QPA)</li>
		</ul>
<p>These bodies accredit service providers against the Royal Australian College of General Practitioner (RACGP) standards for general practice.</p>

<p><strong>Definition of After-Hours</strong></p>

<p>For the purposes of the AHOMPs program, after-hours is defined as between 6pm and 8am on weekdays, before 8am and from 12pm on Saturday, all day Sunday and public holidays.  Participants cannot claim GP after-hours MBS items for consultations or attendances they perform outside of these specified hours.</p>
