<p>The Department of Home Affairs will generally advise Services Australia when a customer or child returns to Australia. The system assesses portability of the payment, regardless of whether the customer notified or not. <strong>Note</strong>&#58;<strong> </strong>Department of Home Affairs datalink activities should not be cancelled.</p>

<p>Services Australia (the agency) uses the date of departure or arrival provided by the Department of Home Affairs. If adversely affected, the customer can provide evidence of alternative dates. The agency should consider applying the alternative dates, if it is reasonable and results in a beneficial outcome for the customer.</p>

<p>In many cases customers do not need to advise the agency when they have returned to Australia from a temporary absence.</p>

<p>However, there are situations where customers must advise of a departure before leaving Australia or contact when they have returned to Australia.</p>

<p>Customers who have been outside Australia long-term or are paid using an international agreement and continue to receive a payment while they are outside Australia should advise the agency of their date of return to Australia to ensure that their payment will continue at the correct rate.</p>

<p>The Portability Script - Departures and Returns can be used to assess a return to Australia. The purpose of the portability script is to assess the return rules associated with the payment and, where possible, update the record. The portability script cannot process a return in all cases (for example, customer returning to Australia after living overseas or paid under the New Zealand (NZ) Agreement).</p>

<p>If the script cannot complete the assessment or coding, it will advise the Service Officer and create a review for manual follow-up of the activity where required.

<p>Where a customer on a pension payment returns to Australia and has been on a proportional rate, the rate generally ceases to be proportional from the date of return. Some international agreements have provision for the rate paid under the agreement to continue for the first 26 weeks of a temporary return to Australia.</p>

<p>Australian residents who return to Australia will be issued with a concession card from the date of return or once their payment has been restarted.</p>

<p>If a customer returns to Australia temporarily and is not an Australian resident they are not entitled to any add-ons, including concession cards, unless they are paid under the Agreement with New Zealand. For more information, see <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04024000-01.html">New Zealand Agreement and foreign pension information</a>.</p>

<p>If a customer returns to Australia and leaves again the same day, the portability period is reset. A new portability period begins for the latest departure. For example an Age Pension customer will cease to be on a proportional rate on the day of return and for the first 26 weeks of the subsequent departure. The resetting of portability rules does not apply to customers who have limited payments such as Disability Support Pension or if they are subject to return rules.</p>

<p>If these payments have ceased to be payable or are reduced for portability reasons (the customer was outside Australia for more than 6 weeks) and they return to Australia and resume payment they must generally remain in Australia for at least 6 weeks before these payments are portable. The exact rules vary according to which payment(s) the customer receives.</p>

<p>It is very important that a customer who is planning on returning to Australia and going overseas again contacts before they return to Australia.

		<div class="block">

<p>If the customer repeatedly goes overseas for long periods with short returns to renew their portability, this may indicate that the person is actually residing overseas. Customers receiving Age Pension do not need to remain Australian residents to continue to be entitled to payment. Disability Support Pension (DSP) customers exempt from the ongoing residence requirement may also continue to be paid if they cease residing in Australia. These customers do not have to remain in Australia for any minimum period before payment is portable again and, if the customer is paid a proportional rate, their rate will increase from the date of their return to Australia.</p>

<p>However, determining whether customers receiving the above payments are Australian residents or not is still important as it can affect&#58;</p>

entitlement to either the 20 September 2000 portability savings provisions or the 1 July 2004 portability provisions</li>

qualification for payment if they receive payment solely because they have a qualifying residence exemption because they are a refugee</li>

<p>If an absence, or multiple absences with short returns to Australia between the absences, exceeds approximately 3 years, continuing Australian residence is questionable.</p>

<p>Customers who were overseas immediately before 1 July 2014 were payable according to rules that applied prior to 1 July 2014. Customers will retain this savings provision on their return to Australia; however they will lose this provision if they remain for 26 weeks or more. When they lose this savings provision, payment for any future absence will be according to the rules that apply at departure. It is not relevant whether the return to Australia is temporary or not, only the length of presence in Australia is important.</p>

<p>The savings provision also applies to customers who resided outside Australia and who were temporarily inside Australia immediately before 1 July 2014. These customers retain the savings provision if they departed Australia on or before 29 December 2014.</p>

<p>The payments affected are Age pension, Disability Support Pension (DSP) or payments made under the terms of an International Agreement.</p>

<p>Customers saved from the 1 July 2014 AWLR changes are generally paid a proportional rate using their own AWLR (international agreement and certain saved 20 September 2000 customers may use their partners AWLR).</p>

<p>Customers who have the savings provisions generally require 300 months (25 years) AWLR in order to receive the maximum means tested rate of payment (some international agreements apply different rules).</p>
