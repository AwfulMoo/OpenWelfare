		<li>
Be entitled to FTB Part A at a rate greater than nil (legislative rate of FTB Part A). <strong>Note&#58;</strong> NBS is added to the customer's maximum FTB Part A rate before the <a href="../families/007-07070000-01.html">Part A income test</a> is applied. This means that for the period NBS is paid (up to 13 weeks) it increases the income limit at which their FTB Part A rate reduces to nil</li>
		<li>
Not be paid Parental Leave Pay (PPL) for the same child</li>
		</ul>
<p>NBS is included as a component of a customer's maximum FTB Part A rate (Method 1) or FTB Part A base rate (Method 2). For more information, see <a href="../families/007-07060000-01.html">Rate of FTB</a>.</p>

<p><strong>FTB Part A payment choice&#58;</strong></p>

<p>Customers who are only entitled to FTB Part A base rate or who choose to receive base rate will be paid the NBS with their FTB instalment. NBU will also be paid.</p>

<p>Customers who choose to receive nil rate FTB Part A during the year will receive their NBS and NBU when FTB reconciliation occurs after the end of the financial year.</p>

<p>If the customer changes or cancels their payment choice, payment of NBS/NBU depends on when their first day of NBS eligibility occurred.</p>

<p>Customers can make an FTB early claim up to 97 days before the child's expected date of birth or entrustment to care as part of an adoption process.</p>

<p>NBU will be paid as an immediate payment (with some exceptions, see <a href="../families/007-07040020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Eligibility_for_7">Item 7</a>) when the FTB claim has been assessed and eligibility to NBS confirmed.

<p>There are 2 <a href="../families/007-07060000-01.html">NBS rates</a>. A higher rate is paid for the customer's first newborn child, the first child under 1 year of age entrusted to their or their partner's care, the first child entrusted to their or their partner's care as part of an adoption process, and for each child of a multiple birth/entry into care. A lower rate is paid for a second or subsequent child.</p>

<p>A <strong>reduced rate of NBS</strong> for second or subsequent children will apply.</p>

<p>Customers will receive the reduced rate of payment where the second or subsequent child has the same relationship type as previous children in the family. There are 3 relationship types considered when determining the rate&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
birth mother</li>
		<li>
adoption</li>
		<li>
entrusted into care</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Birth parents of newborn children</strong></p>

<p>Where a parent is claiming for their newborn child, the rate of NBS is based on whether the child is the birth mother's first or subsequent biological child. If the birth mother has had previous birth children, NBS will be paid at the reduced rate. A partner's child(ren) from a previous relationship would not impact the rate.</p>

<p><strong>Adoptions</strong></p>

<p>Where a child of any age (FTB eligible) is entrusted to the primary care of a person as part of the process of adoption, and the child is the second or subsequent child to be entrusted to the primary care of the family as part of an adoption process, the customer would receive the lower rate of NBS.</p>

<p><strong>Child entrusted to care</strong></p>

<p>Where a newborn child is entrusted to the primary care of another person (such as a foster carer) before the child is aged one, the rate paid would depend on the circumstances of the new carer, and whether other children aged under 1 had previously been entrusted to their care. Previously adopted or biological children would not impact the customer's NBS rate.</p>

<p><strong>Multiple births/entry into care</strong></p>

<p>Children born as part of a multiple birth (for example, twins) and children entrusted aged under 1 or children entering care as part of the same adoption process, will be paid at the higher NBS rate per child regardless of the number of other children in the family.</p>

<p>These requirements only apply to the natural parents of a newborn child. They do not apply to children born overseas.</p>

<p>Parents must notify Services Australia that they have applied to register the child's birth with the state or territory births registry. Customers may notify this verbally.</p>

<p>If the customer notifies that the birth has been registered after the FTB claim has been finalised, in Customer First&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
go to the <strong>CHS</strong> screen and select the relevant child with an ‘<strong>S</strong>’</li>
		<li>
type <strong>CCH</strong> in the <strong>next</strong> field</li>
		<li>
on the <strong>CCH</strong> screen code '<strong>Y</strong>'es in the <strong>birth registration</strong> field</li>
		<li>
enter the source and the receipt date</li>
		<li>
navigate to the <strong>AR</strong> screen and check the Payment Summary to ensure NBS/NBU is being paid and if the results are correct, the activity can be finalised</li>
		</ul>
<p>To receive NBS/NBU for a child who dies shortly after birth, parents are required to satisfy birth registration requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Time limit for notification</strong></p>

<p>Parents must notify the agency by 30 June of the financial year following the financial year that includes the last day on which the NBS can be paid for the child.</p>

<p><strong>Example&#58;</strong> for a child born on 1 May 2014 where the customer is eligible for NBS from that date, the last day NBS can be paid is 30 July 2014. As the last NBS day is in the 2014-15 financial year, the customer must notify by 30 June 2016.</p>

<p>The shared care percentage does not affect the <a href="../families/007-07060000-01.html">NBS rate</a>.</p>

<p>For example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If a shared care arrangement exists before the start of the NBS eligibility period, each person caring for the child may be eligible for the full amount of NBS and NBU if they each meet all eligibility criteria</li>
		<li>
If a couple separate before the end of the NBS period and a shared care arrangement begins, each person may be entitled to NBS for the number of days remaining in the NBS period. The ex-partner would not be entitled to NBU as this was paid while they were a couple</li>
		</ul>
<p>See the <a href="../families/007-07040020-05.html">Resources</a> page for examples.</p>

<p>Eligibility is assessed according to each customer's circumstances. Customers must have at least 35% actual care of the child. See <a href="../families/007-02040020-01.html">Assessment of shared care arrangements for FTB)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> a system issue has been identified that impacts a current FTB customer and any NBS/NBU already paid to them, if a separation is coded within the customer's now ex-partner's FTB new claim activity.</p>

<p>To avoid these issues, when Service Officers process claims that include shared care in respect of any potential NBS child, all coding to separate the current FTB customer <strong>must be finalised in a separate activity</strong> on the current FTB customer's record before the ex-partner's FTB claim can be assessed with all relevant shared care coding.</p>

<p>A non-parent (for example, foster carer and grandparent) may be eligible for NBS for a child if neither they (nor their partner) is the child's parent. The questions on the <strong>NBSQ</strong>/<strong>!NBSQ</strong> page will vary depending on the customer/child relationship coded on the Child Relationships (<strong>CHRE</strong>/<strong>!CHRE</strong>) page.</p>

<p>For a non-parent&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
Is this child entrusted to care as part of a multiple entrustment to care event?</li>
		<li>
Has this customer previously had a child entrusted to care?</li>

		<li>
Will you or did you have this child in your care for at least 13 consecutive weeks?</li>
		<li>

<p>Depending on the response to 'Will you or did you have this child in your care for at least 13 consecutive weeks?' the result will be&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>, entitlement to NBS/NBU will be assessed as part of their claim</li>
		<li>
<strong>No</strong>, NBU/NBS will not be paid. If the child does remain in care, the customer would need to contact to advise this so that the response could be updated from '<strong>No</strong>' to '<strong>Yes</strong>' to assess NBU/NBS</li>
		<li>
<strong>Unsure</strong>, NBU/NBS will not be paid, instead an automatic Future Activity List (FAL) review (I703FY) will be set to recheck eligibility 21 days after the 13 continuous weeks (21 + 91 = 112 days) from the date the child entered care. If the child has remained in care when the review matures, NBU/NBS will be automatically assessed</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer indicates they or their partner intend to claim Parental Leave Paid (PPL) for this same child, NBS/NBU will not be paid with the claim for FTB. If PPL is not payable, the customer may be eligible for NBS/NBU.</p>

<p>In cases where an activity causes a Newborn Upfront Payment (NBU) debt as NBU eligibility is lost, for example FTB Part A cancelling, and a subsequent activity is paying arrears for NBU, the system will automatically offset these arrears with the debt. To allow the automated withholdings process to offset arrears, <strong>do not suppress the arrears and do not code the FTB Newborn Manual Assessment and Decision (FMAD) screen</strong>.</p>

<p>Withholdings will be automatically applied from the NBU payment to the outstanding amount of an existing NBU debt. This will not occur until the <a href="../payment-delivery/103-04030020-01.html">payment strip has been run</a>.</p>

<p>This offsetting also occurs where multiple activities are processed in the one day, the first paying arrears of NBU and then a subsequent activity causing a loss of eligibility resulting in a debt. If these activities are on the same day, the offset will occur so that a payment is not issued and then subsequently raise a debt on the same day.</p>

<p>If a NBU debt has been paid in full and a reassessment is made to re-grant NBU, the system will pay this amount to the recipient, as the previous debt had been paid no offsetting will need to occur.</p>

<p>NBS and NBU can be affected by <a href="../families/007-11010000-01.html">FTB reconciliation</a>.</p>

<p>As NBS is an FTB Part A rate component add-on, it is added into a family's maximum and base rate of FTB Part A and is subject to reconciliation.</p>

<p>Depending on the customer's circumstances (for example, rate of FTB Part A), the amount of NBS payable may be reduced or increased due to income and maintenance income tests.</p>

<p>The NBU is a one off payment and is not included in the FTB rate calculation.</p>

<p>If a customer is found not to be entitled to FTB Part A, or entitled to a reduced base rate as a result of FTB reconciliation, an NBS and/or NBU debt may arise. The NBU will be raised as a separate qualification debt where there is no NBS entitlement due to nil entitlement to FTB Part A.</p>

<p>For example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the customer's reconciliation has resulted in <strong>no entitlement</strong> to FTB Part A for a period where the NBU and NBS were paid, there will be a resultant debt for both NBU and NBS</li>
		<li>
If the customer's reconciliation has resulted in a <strong>lower FTB Part A base rate</strong> for a period where NBS was paid, there will be a resultant debt of NBS</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Top-ups</strong></p>

<p>A customer may be eligible for a top-up of NBS where they were previously receiving a tapered base rate of FTB Part A and reconciliation has resulted in an increased entitlement.</p>

<p><strong>Re-establishing entitlement</strong></p>

<p>Where a customer is found not to be eligible for FTB Part A in a financial year and has the NBU and NBS raised as a debt, if entitlement to FTB Part A is established again for a later period within the same year or in the subsequent year, the NBU and NBS may be paid to the customer again where all other eligibility criteria are met.</p>

<p>See the <a href="../families/007-07040020-05.html">Resources</a> page for examples.</p>

<p><strong>Debt offsetting</strong></p>

<p>Debt offsetting will occur within the FTB reconciliation process in circumstances where arrears are payable in the next financial year.</p>
