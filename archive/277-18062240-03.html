<p>Customers or their representatives can notify Child Support of a potential change in the care percentage&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
in person (via telephone, counter enquiry or Change of Assessment conference)</li>
		<li>
<img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" />electronically (CSAonline or email)</li>
		<li>
through an overseas Central Authority, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-08010000-01.html">Central Authority Address Listing for Child Support International customers</a></li>
		<li>
in writing (via form or letter)</li>
		</ul>
<p>When customers notify Child Support of a care change, investigate all notifications of a change in care by gathering relevant information from both customers (even if customers are reporting a reduced level of care for themselves).</p>

<p>If customer reports a care change online or in writing and the information they have provided is unclear or incomplete, contact the notifying customer to ensure all relevant information is gathered and discussed. </p>

<p>If a customer reports a change in care that relates to a one-off event, what constitutes a change to the pattern of care will depend upon the individual circumstances of the case. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-18062240-04.html">References</a> for a link to the Child Support Guide 2.2.2&#58; Care Determinations &amp; Changes in Care - Change in pattern of care.</p>

<p>During discussions explain to both customers what a change in care is. Advise them the change in care decision is Services Australia's decision about the amount of care to be used in the customer’s child support assessment. The agency does not determine where the child should live or any custody arrangements. The agency reflects the percentage of care of the child that each parent actually has, or the percentage of care established by a written care arrangement. A <strong>care event</strong> is a night of care or several consecutive nights of care that follow a recurring pattern. Confirm the date of event - future changes in care cannot be taken into account and a decision cannot be revoked unless a new care event has occurred.</p>

<p>The circumstances around care changes can be distressing, especially where the care is disputed or not occurring in line with a written care arrangement. Be considerate and sensitive to the customer’s experience when discussing and explaining care changes.</p>

<p>Confirm with the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the details of the change in care</li>
		<li>
the date the change applies from</li>
		</ul>
<p>Discuss with the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
any impacts on the assessment and the amount payable</li>
		<li>
facts the decision will be based on</li>
		<li>
options if they disagree with the decision</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Registrar’s discretionary power</strong></p>

<p>Advise the customer that unless the reported care change results in a change in the cost percentage, there will be no effect on the assessment and we may not revoke the existing care or make a new care determination. This is because under Section 54H of the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 (see the <a href="../separated-parents/277-18062240-04.html">References</a> page for a link to legislation), we have discretion to revoke care and make a new determination that would not make a material difference to the assessment. In the event a change in care is contested. A care percentage decision will only be made if it would result in a change to the child support assessment. The exception is where a written <strong>care arrangement</strong> exists that has not yet been recorded or applied by Child Support. In this situation the written care arrangement needs to be recorded in Cuba as&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a new care determination with the appropriate written care type if being adhered to, or</li>
		<li>
for information only if the actual care is different to that described in the written care arrangement</li>
		</ul>
<p>For more information, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-03040020-01.html">Investigation of change in child support care (post 1 July 2010)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if it is evident the reported care change will not vary the cost percentage, the <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/elements/macros/ChangeInCareDetails_WAEXNUP_and_PRE23MAY2018.html">WA Ex-nuptial and pre 23/05/2018 Change in care details</a> macro must still be used to guide the customer conversation and accurately calculate the reported care percentage.</p>

<p>Ask the customer if they are a current or past Centrelink customer. If so, advise them to ensure their Centrelink relationship and income details are correct to reduce the likelihood of incorrect Centrelink benefits or payments occurring when the care decision is transferred. Update these details before finalising the care decision in Cuba. After discussing child support matters, offer to cold transfer the customer to Centrelink to update their relationship and income details if required.</p>

<p>Ask the customer if they have reported the care change details to Centrelink for each child in their care for whom they are claiming Family Tax Benefit (FTB).

<p>Where a parent delays in notifying Child Support or Centrelink of changes in care, they may report multiple changes at once.</p>

<p>Treat each notification as a separate care change using the care period as 12 months from the date of the event. Calculate the care percentage for the first event as though the subsequent event had not occurred. The resulting care percentage for each care change event will be used in the assessment to the day before the date of effect of the subsequent care change (assuming the subsequent event results in a different care percentage and the customer has notified of the change within 28 days). </p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the date of notification for a care change is more than 28 days after the event date, follow this process even though the change may not be used in the Child Support assessment. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-18062240-03.html#bp03_tbl_Gather_informat_Step05">Child Support date of effect</a> for more information about when a new care percentage will be used in the assessment.</p>

<p>The term 'likely' means information gathered from the initial customer only. Identify the date of event by asking the customer what circumstances led to the change in care. When identifying the date of event, consider whether the care that is actually occurring for the child has changed.</p>

<p>The date of event is either&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the date both customers confirm the actual care change occurred</li>
		<li>
a date determined by Child Support based on the information and evidence provided by both customers</li>
		</ul>
<p>Although a Child Support care change will only be applied from the date of effect, the date of event may be used by Centrelink if the customer has an FTB assessment.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the date of event used to record the care change will be tentative until the other customer has been contacted.</p>

<p>Questions that may assist in determining the likely date of event include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
which child does the change relate to</li>
		<li>
what date did the care/pattern of care change</li>
		<li>
what caused the change in care</li>
		<li>
was the care change discussed with the other parent</li>
		<li>
is the change intended to be permanent</li>
		<li>
if the care change is temporary, what is the period of the change? <strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a one-off care event is missed that is likely to be made up/the care is likely to resume to the standard pattern, this means a care change may not have occurred</li>

<p>If unable to determine the date of event, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-03040020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Investigate_cha_Step02">Step 2 in the Investigate change in care</a> table 'Gather information from the other customer'.</p>

<p>A care period is the 12 month period starting from the date of event. In some circumstances, a shorter or longer care period may be appropriate, however judge each case on its own merits. If determining a care period other than 12 months, seek technical support. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-09140000-01.html">Technical support in Child Support</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Care periods longer than 12 months</strong></p>

<p>A care period of more than 12 months may be appropriate where the care arrangement follows a cycle over a period greater than 12 months, for example every 2 years.</p>

<p>See <a href="../separated-parents/277-18062240-05.html">Resources</a> page for examples of care periods longer than 12 months.</p>

<p><strong>Care periods shorter than 12 months</strong></p>

<p>A care period of less than 12 months might be appropriate where the pattern of care will gradually change over definable periods in a specific and measurable way, for example one parent is to increase their care by one day per week every 3 months over the upcoming period.</p>

<p>A shorter care period may also be appropriate where a carer has unexpectedly gained 100% care of a child for a temporary period (generally 4 weeks minimum). In these situations, the Registrar will determine the care over a short care period related to the unexpected circumstance and make a <strong>one-off block of 100% care</strong> determination.</p>

<p>See <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-18062240-05.html">Resources</a> page for examples of care periods shorter than 12 months, and <a href="../separated-parents/277-18052501-04.html">References</a> page in WA Ex-nuptial child support cases - Change in child support care levels (post 1 July 2010) for further information.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Child Support will not give effect to the future events until the customers advise that they have actually occurred. If neither customer advises of the subsequent change, the existing percentage of care will continue.</p>

<p>Ask the customer to provide the pattern of care based on what they actually expect to occur during the 12 month care period. In most cases, care is determined by the actual care each parent has. Where a pattern has been established in the past and the Service Officer is satisfied that it will continue in the future, use that pattern to determine the likely percentage of care for the care period.</p>

<p>If the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
requests that care be calculated in a form other than nights, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-03040030-03.html#bp03_tbl_Check_and_proce_Step02">Step 2 in the Calculate and determine care percentage</a> table in Child support care outcomes and decision making (post 1 July 2010) - Care other than in nights</li>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a customer wants to estimate future or possible care changes themselves, refer them to the Care Estimator available on <a target="_blank" class="extwebsitelink" href="https&#58;//www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/child-support">servicesaustralia.gov.au</a>.</p>

<p>Questions that may assist in determining the likely percentage of care include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
have you and the other parent established a pattern of care for the child</li>
		<li>
how many nights do you and the other parent expect to care for your child over the 12 month care period from the date the care changed</li>
		<li>
how did you calculate the expected care (for example, is there a pattern of care)</li>
		<li>
do you or the other parent provide extensive care during the day but little or no overnight care? See <a href="../separated-parents/277-03040030-03.html#bp03_tbl_Check_and_proce_Step02">Step 2 in the Calculate and determine care percentage</a> table in Child support care outcomes and decision making (post 1 July 2010) - Care other than in nights</li>
		<li>
what is the care based on currently</li>
		<li>
are there any court orders, parenting plans, or written agreements for a different amount of care</li>
		<li>
are either you or the other parent trying to enforce this</li>
		<li>
are you seeking a new court order, parenting plan, or written agreement, or are you aware of the other parent seeking such a new care arrangement</li>
		<li>
is the other parent likely to agree that these are the new care arrangements</li>
		</ul>
<p>If there is a <a href="../separated-parents/277-03040030-03.html">care arrangement</a> to which the parents are no longer adhering, establish whether the parent with the reduced care is taking reasonable action to either ensure the care arrangement is complied with or to seek a new care arrangement. If so, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-03040030-03.html#bp03_tbl_Calculate_and_d_Step08">Step 8 in the Calculate and determine care percentage</a> table in Child support care outcomes and decision making (post 1 July 2010) - Disputed care.</p>

<p>Cuba will automatically calculate the percentage of care used in the assessment when the number of nights care has been entered into the Care window.</p>

<p>There may be occasions when Service Officers need to manually calculate the percentage of care, or explain how the figures were calculated, as percentages of care calculations have special rounding rules.</p>

<p>Percentage of care = (number of nights / 365) x 100</p>

<p>To calculate a percentage of care the following special rounding rules must be applied (to ensure the total equals 100%). If the percentage of care is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
below 50%, round the number down to the next whole percentage</li>
		<li>
50% or more, round the number up to the next whole percentage</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where each customer has a care percentage of 50%, record the payee as having 50% care, see the <a href="../separated-parents/277-30010060-01.html">Care Cuba Process Help</a>. Do not record this as a number of nights. Cuba will automatically change this to show the payee has 51% care and the other party has 49% care. The <strong>Care Reported as 50% </strong>checkbox will be automatically set by Cuba and a care percentage of 50% transferred to Centrelink.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> covering letters to customers who share 50% split care will indicate both parties have 50% care of the child, however the assessment notice will show 51% or 49%. This has no impact on the assessed rate as the same cost percentage is used.</p>

<p>See the <a href="../separated-parents/277-18062240-05.html#bp05090000_Percentage_of_care_">Resources</a> page for examples of percentage of care (special rounding rules).</p>
