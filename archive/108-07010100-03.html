<p>Temporary absence from employment can be indicated by the fact no separation certificate has been issued, leave continues to be paid periodically, or the employee intends to return to same employer immediately afterwards.</p>

<p>Leave payments (including any leave loading representative of the leave period) received for a temporary absence from employment are <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010000-01.html">employment income</a>.</p>

<p>For customers who are currently in receipt of a payment of benefit, no verification is required unless the customer cannot provide full details. Payslips outlining the leave payment may be requested as supporting documentation if required.</p>

<p><strong>Coding&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
The customer must advise the amount of income paid for time off in each entitlement period as well as for work done; there is no need to separate these amounts</li>
		<li>
Record both leave and work on the Employment Income Paid Details (<strong>EAPP</strong>) using 1 entry per employer, per entitlement period</li>
		<li>
If required, code the number of hours ‘worked’ equivalent to the number of hours for which leave was paid, for the relevant entitlement period</li>

Hours to be coded as ‘<strong>HOP</strong>’ with <strong>DOV</strong> = the EPED of the relevant period</li>

<p>In New South Wales (NSW), non-teaching support staff (teacher’s aides, library assistants or other non-teaching staff), are employees of the NSW Department of Education. As they are unable to work during term breaks, they receive a stand down payment, based on them meeting certain criteria.</p>

<p>Stand down payments have never been considered leave payments for Social Security purposes&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Before 20 April 2010, stand down payments were assessed as a remunerative lump sum and held for a 52-week period from the date the customer received it. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010010-01.html">Recording and correcting employment income details</a> for assistance with recording</li>
		<li>
From 20 April 2010, these payments are assessed as ordinary employment income. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010010-01.html">Recording and correcting employment income details</a> for assistance with recording</li>

<p>An employee may earn income but choose to defer payment of the money.</p>

<p>Deferred salary schemes operate in 2 ways. The employee may&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
take a reduction in salary on the basis they will be entitled to leave at a later date, possibly years later</li>
		<li>
‘purchase’ additional leave each year by having ‘leave without pay’ deductions made from each fortnight’s salary</li>
		</ul>
<p>Although the person has deferred being paid the income at the time they have worked, the purchased leave is assessed when it is paid within their gross income.</p>
