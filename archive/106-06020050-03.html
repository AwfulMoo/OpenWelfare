<p>These details are needed to grant payment to any customer who is not recorded as being an Australian citizen, protected Special Category visa (SCV) holder or non-protected SCV holder. As well as the customer's current details, previous visas need to be recorded to allow any waiting period or qualifying residence period to be served.</p>

<p>For example, residence information needs to be recorded for past periods if a customer is claiming any payment, which may be subject to a Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Period (NARWP).</p>

<p>If in doubt, record all visa subclasses from the customer's arrival in Australia.</p>

<p>Customers may have 2 current visas at the same time. Both visas should be recorded. If both are current, the system will use the most beneficial visa to assess their entitlement.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the visa information is left blank or is incomplete, the residence status may be incorrectly assessed which will lead to an incorrect grant or rejection.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Identification Number&#58;</strong> field is optional but should be recorded if known. The visa identification number is usually on the customer's entry documentation (e.g. passport). For help interpreting visas, see <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-06020050-04.html">Chapter 9.1 of the Social Security Guide</a></li>
		<li>
<strong>Subclass Code&#58;</strong> field is required to grant any customer not recorded as an Australian or New Zealand citizen. If keying this field, also key the <strong>Grant Date&#58;</strong> field. The visa subclass is the 3 digit code on the customer's entry documentation</li>
			<ul>			<li>
If the visa grant date is before 1 September 1994 and the customer was a permanent resident of Australia on that date, key subclass '<strong>111</strong>' (or '<strong>444</strong>' for a NZ citizen). <strong>Note&#58;</strong> the codes prior to 1 September 1994 were alpha and numeric codes. They will continue to display and can be updated</li>
			<li>
If a customer's legal residence has been cancelled but it is still being assessed (as per the <strong>RSREX/RSRD</strong> screens) it needs to be manually ended. Centrelink International Services (CIS) will need to record the date of change as advised by the Department of Home Affairs in the visa <strong>Grant Date&#58;</strong> field and code '<strong>NCV</strong>' in the <strong>Subclass Code&#58;</strong> field. <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-06020050-03.html#bp03_tbl_Updating_the_RS_Step06">Go to Step 6</a></li>
			<li>
If the Home Affairs database shows that a customer's permanent residence visa has been reinstated and shows as 'in effect' on the Movement Reconstruction database (e.g. a visa cancellation is overturned on appeal) and '<strong>NCV</strong>' has previously been coded in the <strong>Subclass Code</strong>&#58; field, the '<strong>NCV</strong>' coding will need to be deleted by CIS. <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-06020050-03.html#bp03_tbl_Updating_the_RS_Step06">Go to Step 6</a></li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Grant Date&#58; </strong>field must be keyed if the <strong>Subclass Code&#58;</strong> field or <strong>End Date&#58;</strong> fields are recorded. This is the date the visa was granted or issued</li>
		<li>
<strong>End Date&#58;</strong> field is optional. This is generally the date the visa has been ended, i.e. cancelled, ceased or deleted</li>
		<li>
<strong>Application Date&#58;</strong> field is an optional field for Special Benefit, Low Income Health Care Card (LIC), Family Tax Benefit, Parental Leave Pay, and Dad and Partner Pay customers granted on provisional visas only. Key the date the customer applied for the visa. If this information is not automatically provided from the datalink with the Department of Home Affairs, it can only be obtained from the Department Home Affairs via written request</li>
		<li>
<strong>AOS Indicator&#58;</strong> field defaults to <strong>Yes</strong> if the visa sub class has a mandatory Assurance of Support (AoS) agreement attached to it. If the AoS visa subclass needs to be updated, it must be referred to the AoS team. The <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-06020050-05.html">Resources</a> page contains a link to the list of AOS contacts</li>

<p>The system will generally assess whether the customer is legally entitled to lodge a claim and their residential qualifications based on the information recorded on <strong>RSLEG/CHRSLEG,</strong> information on the<a target="_blank" class="modal-link" href="../initial-contact-general/106-06020010-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Coding_the_Coun"> CRES screen</a>, and overseas absences from the <a target="_blank" class="modal-link" href="../initial-contact-general/106-22011747-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Completing_the_">Customer Advised Travel Information (RSCD)</a> and Immigration Advised Movements (<strong>RSIM</strong>) screens.</p>

<p>Centrelink only receive and react to visa end dates in the following situations&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Permanent visas and visa subclass 444, where visa is cancelled or deleted</li>
		<li>
Temporary visas (other than visa subclass 444), where the visa is cancelled, ceased or deleted</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> For users who have access to the Department of Home Affairs' Immigration Movement Records (MR) Database, the Visa Status in MR will show as C=Cancelled, S=Ceased, Z=Deleted.</p>

<p>Visa end dates on permanent visas and 444 visas that have a visa status of 'S' ceased in the Immigration Movement Records (MR) mean the travel rights of the visa have expired. They do not mean that the visa has ended, or that the customer no longer holds that visa. As a result, these end dates are not automatically updated via the datalink, and should not be manually recorded on the <strong>RSLEG/CHRSLEG</strong> screen.</p>

<p>In most instances, the coding of a valid visa end date will prompt the system to reassess the customer's residence status from that end date and update their record accordingly. This will ensure the customer is not incorrectly assessed as an Australian resident. Any residence prior to the cancellation date still counts towards the appropriate purpose, i.e. qualification, payability etc.</p>

<p>In some circumstances, inserting the end date will not generate a residence reassessment, and the <strong>RSLEG</strong> screen will need to be manually updated with an entry of No Current Visa (NCV) from the date of visa cancellation + 1 day in order to correctly assess the customer as a non-resident. Scenarios where this may be needed include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
customers who still have other qualifying visas coded as current on <strong>RSLEG</strong> that are no longer in effect in MR</li>
		<li>
customers with more than one permanent visa recorded but none of them are current</li>
		<li>
customers whose 444 visa has ended and they have no other current visa in MR but they still have open 444 visas on their <strong>RSLEG</strong> screen</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer's Australian permanent residence visa has been reinstated (e.g. a visa cancellation is overturned on appeal), the NCV coding will need to be deleted for the system to correctly assess the customer as an Australian resident. The <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-06020050-05.html">Resources</a> page contains examples.</p>

<p></p>

			<ul>			<li>
Request to insert NCV coding from xx/xx/xxxx (the date the visa ended + 1)</li>
			<li>
Request to remove NCV coding from RSLEG</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p></p>

<p><strong>In Process Direct&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Go to the Immigration Link Details (<strong>RSIML</strong>) and/or Child's Immigration Link Details (<strong>CHIML</strong>) screen.</li>
		<li>
Click the <strong>Report a problem with Immigration data</strong> link at the bottom left of the screen and the <strong>IMQ</strong> screen will display.</li>

			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Notes&#58;</strong> other fields on this screen cannot be updated by staff outside CIS. The <strong>IMQ</strong> screen presented for a child record through the <strong>CHIML</strong> screen will be on the parent’s record.</p>

<p>If the customer is in hardship, contact CIS to advise that an urgent response is required.</p>

<p>Put the claim on hold for 14 days and check back for the response from CIS.</p>

<p>CIS should update the customer’s record and either create a Display on Access (DOA) <strong>DOC</strong> or end date the existing DOA <strong>DOC</strong> (depending on whether they are inserting or removing NCV coding).</p>

If the customer is a <strong>New Zealand citizen</strong>, protected Special Category visa status may need to be verified before the claim can be finalised. Where this is required, a Manual Follow-up (MFU) will be generated for CIS to verify the customer's status.
