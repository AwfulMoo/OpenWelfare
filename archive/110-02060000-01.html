<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Requests for review information</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>When the income stream product is reviewed under the AISR process, the system will generate an information request notice. It is sent directly to registered product providers or their administrators, at the appropriate review time. The notice will advise what information is needed and by when. The provider sends the information electronically to Services Australia.</p>

<p>If the customer’s product is not matched to the provider’s information, the customer needs to complete an income stream review, (if they are getting an income support payment). The system will generate an income stream review letter asking the customer for the information. This letter will include a due date.</p>

<p>The type of information needed, and how they provide it to the agency will differ, depending on the type of income stream under review. Income stream review letters may also list the income streams of the customer's partner, even if the partner is not receiving an income support payment. The customer must give all of the requested information for each product listed.</p>

<p>If the customer has opted to <a class="extwebsitelink" href="https&#58;//www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/services/centrelink/centrelink-letters-online">receive letters online</a>, they will receive an SMS or email to say the review letter is in their myGov inbox.</p>
