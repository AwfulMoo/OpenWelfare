<p>This document explains Special Employment Advances (SEA). A SEA is a lump sum payment of between $50 and $500 advanced from a customer's future income support. It is not an additional payment.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>To be entitled for a SEA a customer must&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
be currently in receipt of a SEA qualifying entitlement, and</li>
		<li>
have received an income support payment for at least 3 months before claiming, and</li>
		<li>
have requested an advance between $50-$500, and</li>
		<li>
have no debts to the Commonwealth that are being recovered or are likely to be recovered by withholdings from their Social Security payments, and</li>
		<li>
be able to repay the SEA without financial hardship (to determine if a customer will be in financial hardship, look at their income and expenses and make a decision on ability to repay the advance at the current rate), and either&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
<strong>In the case of income that has not been received&#58;</strong> The customer is short of money because&#58;<br>- they (or their partner) have worked but have not received payment for this work, and <br>- the employment income has substantially reduced their Centrelink payment, and <br>- the customer does not expect to receive it within 2 days.<br>The income that has not been received must have had the effect of reducing the applicant's Maximum Basic Rate by at least 50%.<br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> any working credits must be taken into consideration as they reduce the amount of earnings that are counted under the income test. People using working credits are less likely to meet the 50% reduction rule, and the customer must be in severe financial hardship.</li>
			<li>
<strong>In the case of returning to work&#58;</strong> the customer has a firm offer of at least 6 weeks employment and the customer would not be able to take up the offer of employment without the SEA. The expected income from the employment will reduce the customer's Maximum Basic Rate by at least 50% over the relevant paydays (or, the employment will result in loss of qualification for payment)<br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> any working credits must be taken into consideration as they reduce the amount of earnings that are counted under the income test. People using working credits are less likely to meet the 50% reduction rule.</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; Income Management customers who apply for a SEA are exempt from having this payment 100% income managed. See payments not income managed.</p>

<p>When establishing whether the customer's maximum basic entitlement has been reduced by 50%, any working credits (or income bank for Youth Allowance (YA)) must be taken into consideration as they reduce the amount of earnings that are counted under the income test.

They are able to have a maximum outstanding SEA balance at any time of $500. Customers who already have an outstanding SEA <strong>or</strong> normal advance may apply for a further SEA, but will only be eligible for an additional SEA amount if the total of all SEAs outstanding does not exceed $500.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> YA customers who are dependent, under 18 years of age, and have their regular YA payments directed to their parents, may qualify for a SEA, but the payments must be directed to the parents or payment nominee, unless the parent directs otherwise.</p>

<p>Customers must lodge a claim for Special Employment Advance (SU514) and should provide proof of their employment details, including&#58;</p>

the employer's details</li>

the expected earnings</li>

if the customer is claiming a SEA for a specific expense related to returning to work, they must prove that they cannot take up the employment without the item or service for which the SEA is claimed</li>

<p>The claim form and supporting documents can be lodged using the Document Lodgement Service (DLS).</p>

<p>Customers who apply for a SEA in a service centre may be issued with a receipt number and information about the decision that has been made at the time of contact.</p>

<p>Smart Centre Service Officers are able to issue a verbal receipt number to the customer along with issuing the letter claim form (SU514) by mail or online. The form is available to customers to self-print from the Services Australia website or there is a link the form on the <a href="../payment-delivery/103-05050030-05.html">Resources</a> page, so the form can be printed and issued to customers.</p>
