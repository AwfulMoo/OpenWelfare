<P>When a job seeker contacts Services Australia to request a review of a decision, the decision that they do not agree with must be identified so the job seeker can be referred to the appropriate team or organisation.</P>
<P><STRONG>Decision made by the provider</STRONG></P>
<P>Job seekers who contact about a decision made by a provider or triggered by the Employment Services System (ESS) that are not made under social security law should be referred to their provider for an explanation. For example, decisions to apply a demerit or the job seeker's Targeted Compliance Framework zone.</P>
<P>Decisions on non-payability are sent to Services Australia electronically. Participation suspensions are automatically applied by the Services Australia system when a non-compliance event is reported.</P>
<P>Providers have responsibility for notifying the reconnection requirements, basing them on guidance provided by the Department of Education, Skills and Employment. They electronically notify Services Australia when the conditions for lifting the payment suspension have been met. The Services Australia system automatically responds to the electronic notification to restore payment, or cancels payment if notification that the conditions have been met is not received within 29 days of the deemed date of notification.</P>
<P>Job seekers who request a review of these decisions are required to talk with their provider about the non-payability decision first. When the provider has explained the decision, completed the initial reconsideration of the decision, and the job seeker is still not satisfied with the outcome, the provider may refer the job seeker to the Department of Education, Skills and Employment. If the job seeker is still not satisfied with the outcome, Services Australia manage the remainder of the review process.</P>
<P><STRONG>Decisions made by Services Australia</STRONG></P>
<P>When an unemployment preclusion period or Unemployment Non-Payment Period (UNPP) has been applied at new claim, a Service Officer with UNPP security resource is responsible for explaining the decision.</P>
<P>If the job seeker subsequently contacts a Service Centre or Smart Centre for a further explanation, refer the job seeker to the Participation Solutions Team (PST) to explain the decision.</P>
<P>The PST is responsible for explaining:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Targeted Compliance Framework decisions relating to the application of a penalty for a mutual obligation failure, work refusal failure or an unemployment failure</LI>
<LI>Job Seeker Compliance Model decisions relating to decisions to apply a No Show, No Pay failure, connection failure, non-attendance failure, reconnection failure, serious failure or a UNPP</LI></UL>

<P>Where a job seeker requests a review/explanation of a decision made by Services Australia, a decision may be explained by all suitability skilled staff. PST- skilled Service Officers (WNPPD) are the Subject Matter Experts (SME) that undertake a quality check and review of the decision. </P>
<P>PST-skilled Service Officers (PFDEC) must refer the job seeker to a SME after explaining a decision where a quality check and review of decision are required:</P>
<UL>
<LI>If the job seeker has a current contact number, transfer to a PST Virtual Support Queue (VSQ) via a warm hand-off</LI>
<LI>If the job seeker does not have a current contact number, transfer to the PST RJCP CCA Assessment queue via a warm hand-off</LI></UL>
<P>The PST-skilled Service Officer WNPPD/SME undertakes a quality check and review of the decision, irrespective of where the original decision was made.</P>
<P>The SME is responsible for:</P>
<UL>
<LI>establishing the reason why the job seeker is requesting a review of the decision</LI>
<LI>collecting any further information or evidence relevant to the matter</LI>
<LI>updating the job seeker's record if required</LI>
<LI>an explanation of the decision and explaining the review process</LI>
<LI>completing the Internal Review/Explanation script:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>record site code as <STRONG>PST</STRONG></LI>
<LI>where the job seeker is requesting a review of decision for more than one failure event incurred on the same date, run the script for each subsequent failure. In the <STRONG>Original Decision</STRONG> field select '<STRONG>Other</STRONG>' and in the <STRONG>Comments</STRONG> field record that a review has already been recorded for a different failure incurred on the same date.</LI></UL>
<LI>if the job seeker is not satisfied with the outcome, refer to an Authorised Review Officer (ARO) for formal review and advise the job seeker they are required to meet all of their compulsory requirements while the review of the decision is being conducted</LI></UL>
<P>When a decision is varied as a result of a quality check or formal review, the decision is implemented by a PST-skilled Service Officer with a WNPPD security resource. This ICT security resource is required to access the review workflow in the Participation Compliance workflow.</P>

<LI>Applying a financial penalty as a result of a mutual obligation failure, including the amount of the penalty and the instalment period this penalty affects</LI>
<LI>Cancelling payment as a result of a mutual obligation, work refusal or unemployment failure, or failure to comply with a reconnection requirement within 29 days. This includes the date of effect of the payment cancellation</LI>

<P>The outcome of a Capability Assessment is not a decision made under social security law and cannot be appealed.

<DIV class=showcont>
<P>A decision to accept the financial penalty for a mutual obligation failure as part of finalising reporting, rather than contacting Services Australia for a compliance investigation, does not preclude a job seeker from seeking a decision explanation and requesting a review of this decision.</P>
<P>If, after the decision has been explained, a review of a decision is requested, further available information and/or evidence should be collected and considered.</P>
<P><STRONG>Review of decision is requested within 13 weeks of mutual obligation failure</STRONG></P>
<P>PST-skilled Service Officers should take the following action using the Participation Compliance Workflow:</P>
<UL>
<LI>select the mutual obligation failure to navigate to the <STRONG>Completed Compliance Actions Screen</STRONG> and then select <STRONG>Review Decision</STRONG> to commence the investigation</LI>
<UL>
<LI>when the Review Decision link is selected the workflow will automatically change the failure status from 'Applied - job seeker declined investigation (AAP)' to 'Investigation' (INV)</LI>
<LI>record the failure status reason 'Investigated auto-applied failure' (AAP), create a failure activity on the record and launch the Compliance Investigation workflow</LI>
<LI>the penalty start and end date will continue to display on the record while the failure is under investigation</LI></UL>
<LI>use the Compliance Investigation workflow to record any additional evidence provided</LI>
<UL>
<LI>a message will display the first time the Key Information page accessed advising 'Investigation workflow has been launched to review the decision of a failure applied without investigation'</LI></UL>
<LI>where there is sufficient evidence to change the decision under review, record the appropriate rejection reason</LI>
<UL>
<LI>once finalised, the failure status will update to revoke rather than rejected. The decision text in the workflow will display 'Failure revoked following investigation'</LI>
<LI>after the failure is revoked the financial penalty applied will be automatically removed and the penalty start and end date will no longer display. This action may result in the system automatically adjusting financial penalties for mutual obligation failures in the same failure group</LI></UL>
<LI>If there is not enough evidence to vary the decision, the failure must be applied:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>once finalised, the failure status will change to 'Applied (APP)'</LI>
<LI>the existing penalty start and end date applied will not change</LI></UL></UL>
<P>If there is not enough evidence to vary a decision, or the customer is not satisfied with the new decision, the PST-skilled Service Officer then records the job seeker's review request via the Internal Review/Explanation script and completes a quality check of the decision.</P>
<P><STRONG>Review of decision is requested after 13 weeks of mutual obligation failure</STRONG></P>
<P>If the job seeker requests a review more than 13 weeks after notification, <STRONG>the Review Decision must not</STRONG> <STRONG>be selected</STRONG> as this will start the failure investigation and change the failure status to investigation (INV).</P></DIV>

<DIV class=showcont>
<P>When a decision to apply a penalty for a failure is varied, this may impact the penalty applied for other failures within the failure group. A failure group is a sequential series of mutual obligation failures attracting a 1st, 2nd, or 3rd financial penalty. Each financial penalty for a mutual obligation failure in the group is dependent on, or influences, another penalty in the same group.</P>
<P>A new failure group begins each time a job seeker returns to the financial penalty zone after serving a post-cancellation non-payment period.</P>
<P>Financial penalties for other failures that were not part of the failure group will not, however, be adjusted. This policy is in place to protect job seekers from the potential rippling effect that could be caused and issues that would then be driven out of payments retrospectively cancelling.</P>
<P>The job seeker's financial penalties for any subsequent penalties in the group will be adjusted automatically by the system.</P></DIV>

<P>PPR provisions apply when a job seeker is currently serving a UNPP or serious failure period that is being quality checked by a Subject Matter Expert (SME) or under review by an Authorised Review Officer (ARO) or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) first review. Payment may also continue during an AAT second review but only if the AAT has issued a stay order against the imposition of the penalty. Job seekers receiving payment under the PPR provisions are required to comply with all mutual obligation requirements. The PST-skilled Service Officer (WNPPD) is responsible for updating the failure status using the Participation Compliance workflow.</P>
