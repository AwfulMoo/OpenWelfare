<p>The fringe benefits should be recorded as a separate employer on the <strong>EAPP</strong> screen (for example, ‘Fringe benefit work car’). This is because the amount must not be included with any other variable/ongoing income from employment (even if received from the same employer).</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when STP employment income data is reported via Single Touch Payroll (STP), the non-grossed-up amount of income for the fringe benefit will not be recorded separately from the customer’s other income types. This is intended, a separate employer is not required.</p>

<p>Employer contributions&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>are not</strong> counted as income, regardless of the employee's age, <strong>if</strong> the employer <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010050-05.html#bp05_L2GT_External_websit01">contributions</a> are required as part of their SGC obligations, award, collective workplace agreement or superannuation fund rules. SGC rates <a target="_blank" href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010050-05.html#bp05_L2GT_External_websit01">can be found on the ATO website</a>. </li>
		<li>
<strong>will be</strong> counted as income<strong> if</strong> the employer contributions are in excess of the SGC and the employee has the capacity to influence or could have reasonably expected to have or have had capacity to influence. Only the excess amount is counted as income</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> from 1 July 2013, there is no longer a maximum age limit for SGC. Prior to 1 July 2013, all employer contributions to superannuation for employees aged 70 and over were considered additional contributions. </p>

<p><strong>Employer contributions above the SGC</strong></p>

<p>Excess superannuation contributions above the SGC requirements or industry award would not be assessable income if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a person is simply an employee of a small business who&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
has no involvement in the running of the business</li>
			<li>
exerts no control or influence over its operations</li>		</ul>
		<li>
all the employees of the small business receive employer contributions at more than the SGC rate</li>
		</ul>
<p>There may be situations where the arrangement is not described as a salary sacrifice arrangement but any amount contributed above the SGC are still assessable as income. For example, a small family run business agrees to pay its employees 15% employer superannuation contributions but the only employees of the business are family members who share control of the business. In such a situation, the excess amount above the SGC rate would be assessable as employees could reasonably be expected to have the capacity to influence the rate of employer superannuation contributions they are receiving.</p>

<p>In some cases an employer may contribute to their employee’s super, not as part of a salary sacrificing arrangement with a specific employee but as part of a wider business practice in which each employee benefits from. For example, paying 12% rather than 10%. This is done at the discretion of the business. In situations where the employees have no capacity to influence that decision, that is, they do not exert any control of influence over the running of the business (in contrast to the family business example above). The additional superannuation amount paid by the employer above the SGC is not income for social security purposes.</p>

<p>Where an employee directly enters into a superannuation salary sacrifice arrangement with their employer, the employee does have the capacity to influence how much of their salary is paid to them, and therefore the salary sacrificed amounts are counted as income. </p>

<p><strong>Businesses run through private trusts and private companies</strong></p>

<p>If the person is controlling the private company or trust and is paying themselves as an employee of the entity then they could be expected to have the capacity to influence the rate of employer contributions. Any employer contributions above the SGC rate would be assessable income.</p>

<p><strong>Assessable income</strong></p>

<p>The assessable income amount is the person’s gross employment income plus the amount of contribution to superannuation above the SCG where the employee has the capacity to influence or could have reasonably expected to have or have had capacity to influence.</p>

<p>Superannuation statements, personal tax returns and payment summaries must be requested to determine the applicable SCG amount. Where the SCG information is not available, the <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010050-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Calculator">excess superannuation calculator</a> should be used to determine the contributions to be assessed as income. </p>

Ensure the total of any employee's salary sacrificed amounts and/or any assessable employer's contributions are included in the total gross income recorded on the <strong>EAPP</strong> screen</li>

When the customer is over Age Pension age, any contributions made to a superannuation fund after the date of grant add to the balance in the fund as they are made and thus increase the value of the investment that is subject to deeming.

<p>Salary sacrificed amounts used to purchase fringe benefits are considered a valuable consideration. They are included as income for all income support payments. The amount of fringe benefits taken into account in determining a customer’s or their partner’s entitlement is the non-grossed-up amount of fringe benefits. </p>

<p>Sacrificed amounts used to purchase a fringe benefit are assessed differently to fringe benefits received on top of a salary paid. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-05020040-03.html">Assessing fringe benefits for Social Security income test purposes</a> for information on assessing fringe benefits received on top of a salary paid.</p>

<p><strong>If the grossed-up amount has been provided</strong>, calculate the non-grossed-up amount using the method below&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Non-grossed-up amount = grossed-up amount x (100% - Fringe Benefit Tax rate)</li>

<p>Record <strong>all</strong> employment details via the Earnings and Reporting workflow. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the workflow is unavailable, manually update all details on the Employment Income Paid Details (<strong>EAPP</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>Service Officers must code receipt of the fringe benefit component as a separate employer (even if received from the same employer) and clearly identify the fringe benefit in the <strong>Description</strong> on the <strong>EAPP</strong> screen (for example, 'Fringe benefit work car'). The fringe benefit amount must <strong>not </strong>be included with any other variable/ongoing income from employment.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58; </strong>when STP employment income data is reported via Single Touch Payroll (STP), the non-grossed-up amount of income for the fringe benefit will not be recorded separately from the customer other income types. This is intended and a separate employer is not required.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Record the non-grossed-up amount against the separate fringe benefit employer recorded</li>
		<li>
The customer's post-sacrificed gross wage should also be reported. See <a target="_blank" href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010050-01.html#bp01_L2GT_Pre_and_post_sa">Background</a> for more information</li>
