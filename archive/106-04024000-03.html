<p>In New Zealand, social security is similar to Australia in that entitlement to payments is based on residence in New Zealand.</p>

<p>Like Australia, New Zealand also has private pension superannuation-like schemes through deductions from paid employment. However, New Zealand Superannuation is actually the equivalent of Australian Age Pension and not to be confused with superannuation-like payments in Australia. New Zealand Superannuation is not income tested in New Zealand.</p>

<p>New Zealand has a general direct deduction policy for any pensions from other countries, including from Australia. New Zealand's social security agreements with other countries may modify this in some circumstances. New Zealand therefore has similar provisions to Australia requiring a person to claim any entitlement to a pension from another country. This direct deduction policy is reflected in the Agreement and means that Australia will direct deduct pensions from third countries in some circumstances. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04024000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Rules_for_Austr_Rate_cal">Rate calculation</a>.</p>

<p>New Zealand has a general portability scheme based on residence. Special arrangements apply for some Pacific island countries and provisions of New Zealand's social security agreements still apply.</p>

<p>Like the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) in Australia, Veterans' Affairs New Zealand (VANZ) also pay pensions to people who have served in the military. New Zealand Veterans' Pension can be paid instead of New Zealand Superannuation but is not a VANZ payment and not to be confused with other payments such as War Disablement Pension paid by VANZ.

<p>This version of the Agreement was host country style, meaning that only the country in which the person was resident paid the person's pension, which precluded entitlement to a pension from the other country.</p>

<p>Generally, a person could use a period of residence in one country exclusively to meet the requirement for payment in the other country, for example, 10 years residence in New Zealand was used to meet the qualifying residence requirement for Age Pension in Australia.</p>

<p>The 1995 Agreement covered&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Age Pension</li>
		<li>
Disability Support Pension (DSP)</li>
		<li>
Widow B Pension</li>
		<li>
Sole Parent Pension now Parenting Payment Single (PPS)</li>
		<li>
Wife Pension</li>
		<li>
Partner Allowance</li>
		<li>
Parenting Allowance now Parenting Payment Partnered (PPP)</li>
		<li>
Additional Family Payments</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Notes&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Also covered unemployment benefits until removed by protocol in October 2000. Carer Payment was also subject to the Agreement through the partner related provisions (Article 6.1)</li>
		<li>
There was no requirement for DSP customers to be severely disabled</li>
		<li>
Partner Allowance and PPP were only payable to the female partner of an Age Pension or DSP recipient</li>
		</ul>
<p>As a host country agreement, reimbursement provisions applied under the 1995 Agreement. In an annual reconciliation process, each country would reimburse the other for its customers living in the other country based on the customer's residence. Due to the majority of customers living in Australia, the result was always an amount paid by New Zealand to Australia.</p>

<p>In recognition of these provisions in the 1995 agreement and existing customers, reimbursement was projected and agreed amounts scheduled in the transitional provisions of the 2002 Agreement (Article 26).</p>

<div class="showcont">


<p>Payments granted under the 1995 Agreement <strong>continue to be subject</strong> to the provisions of that Agreement but may transfer to the current version of the Agreement if they meet the necessary requirements. A person may not transfer back to the 1995 Agreement.</p>

<p>As a host-country agreement, payment would be cancelled if the person departed permanently. Portability was limited to temporary absences only&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Age Pension - 26 weeks</li>
		<li>
DSP, Wife Pension, Widow B Pension, PPS - 4 weeks</li>
		<li>
Partner Allowance, PPP - same as partner</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Carer Payment deemed to be paid under the Agreement was not portable outside Australia (s11 Social Security (International Agreements) Act 1999).</p>

<p>Any foreign pension from a third country received by a person paid under the 1995 Agreement is treated as a direct deduction in all cases. Each member of a couple is taken to receive half the total amount of foreign pension received by both the customer and their partner.</p>

<p>Any NZ pension received by a person paid under the 1995 agreement or that person's partner is not assessed. In some cases a person who is paid under the 1995 Agreement whose partner receives a NZ pension may be better off by staying under the 1995 Agreement even if it means a period of non-payment, e.g. for portability.</p>

<div class="showcont">


<p>This version of the Agreement was shared-responsibility in nature, meaning that the responsibility for supporting mutual customers was shared between the signatory countries.</p>

<p>The 2002 Agreement covered&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Age Pension</li>
		<li>
Disability Support Pension (DSP) for the severely disabled, and</li>
		<li>
Carer Payment for carer partners of DSP customers</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Lodgement</strong></p>

<p>The 2002 Agreement allowed a NZ citizen residing in Australia as a temporary visa holder (for example non-protected SCV holder) to be regarded as an Australian resident. This enabled customers affected by the <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-06010020-01.html">Australian Residence Rules for New Zealand citizens</a> to claim payments covered by the Agreement.</p>

<p><strong>Qualification</strong></p>

<p>It also allowed customers to totalise to meet any necessary qualifying residence period using Australian historical residence and NZ Working Age Residence. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04024000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Social_Security_Residenc">Residence</a> and <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04024000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Social_Security_NZ_Agree">Working Age Residence (WAR)</a></p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> from 1 November 2012, following a Federal Court decision, DSP customers ceased having to meet the 10-year qualifying residence rule if their Continuing Inability to Work (CITW) occurred when they were residing in Australia (including as an SCV holder who is not protected). If the CITW occurred when the customer was a resident of NZ, the 10-year qualifying residence period still had to be met <strong>however</strong> this could be met by totalising Australian historical residence periods (including those as an SCV holder who is not protected) with New Zealand <strong>historical</strong> residence. This decision was incorporated into the 2017 Agreement revision.</p>

<p><strong>Rate</strong></p>

<p>The main difference from the 2017 Agreement is that customers affected by the 2002 Agreement were paid the NZ proportional rate based on their Working Age Residence if they were long-term outside Australia and present in New Zealand. The direct deduction rate was paid inside Australia unless they were paid the NZ proportional rate and were not long term inside Australia.</p>

<p>This led to anomalies where a customer would 'pass-through' either Australia or New Zealand and become affected by the Agreement and uncertainty as to the application of the rules when the customer went to a third country from Australia.</p>

<p>For example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The NZ proportional rate would apply to a person if they went to NZ for just one day and continue for 26 weeks on departure and then revert to the ordinary rate payable, if any</li>
		<li>
A person on a direct deduction rate who left Australia would remain on the direct deduction rate indefinitely in some cases</li>
		<li>
A person with NZ pension who was living in a 3rd country would immediately become affected by the direct deduction rate for any return to Australia regardless of the duration of the return</li>
		</ul>
<p>Other differences between the 2002 and 2017 rates were&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Treatment of NZ benefits&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Under the 2002 Agreement most payments from New Zealand were ignored in all situations</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Treatment of 3rd country pensions&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Under the 2002 Agreement most 3rd country pensions were directly deducted</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04024000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Rules_for_Austr_Rate_cal">Rate calculation</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Portability</strong></p>

<p>Portability under the 2002 Agreement for travel between Australia and New Zealand was indefinite.</p>

<p>Portability under the 2002 Agreement for travel to 3rd countries was for a maximum of 26 weeks, regardless the intended duration of the absence. That is for both permanent and temporary departures, portability was 26 weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Provisions of the 2002 Agreement that continue to apply</strong> <a title="Read more 6" class="showhead bp03_tbl__History_" onclick="erefshow(this)" href="javascript:;"><span class="showhead bp03_tbl__History_" onclick="erefshow(this)" href="javascript:;">+</span> Read more ...</a></p>
<div class="showcont">


<p>Customers paid under the 2002 Agreement were transferred to the 2017 Agreement from 1 July 2017. While a person could not lose qualification for payment, any rate change due to the change in calculation methods was applied immediately.</p>

<p>Unless they lost qualification for any other reason, customers absent from Australia on 1 July 2017 were able to continue to receive their payment until the end of the portability period under the 2002 Agreement (26 weeks) or their return to Australia or New Zealand, whichever occurs first. Any subsequent departure on or after 1 July 2017 will be assessed under the 2017 rules.

<p>The provisions of an agreement normally only apply to payments made under that agreement with some beneficial provisions also applying to autonomous customers.</p>

<p>The rate calculations under the NZ Agreement will apply to <strong>any</strong> customer who receives a NZ pension or any Age Pension, Disability Support Pension (DSP) or Carer Payment (CP) who is long-term in New Zealand.</p>

<p>This means that an autonomous customer may become 'affected' by the NZ Agreement in various situations and then may subsequently become free of the effect after a period of time because of a further change in circumstances.

<div class="showcont">


<p>Because of the <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-06010020-01.html">Australian residence rules for New Zealand citizens</a> there are provisions in the social security law that allow a customer who is paid under the Agreement to receive a Pensioner Concession Card.</p>

<p>Where the customer is a special category visa holder (SCV) who is not protected, there is an additional income test for concessions cards that is performed after the NZ Agreement rate calculation that determines the rate of the customer's income support payment. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04024000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Eligibility_cri_Qualific">Qualification/Totalisation</a> and <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04024000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Rules_for_Austr01_Rate_cal">Rate calculation on the Australian Payments</a> tab and <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-06050000-01.html">Pensioner Concession Card (PCC).</a></p>

<p>Under the Agreement, the rate of Australian pension may also affect the rate of NZ pension. In some cases, the rate of a third country pension affects the rate of both the Australian and NZ pension simultaneously. </p>

<p>Because of the process and delays involved between the two countries, this may involve a series of negative and positive adjustments, which ultimately affects customers. To avoid this, using an Assumed Rate of NZ pension may be required when processing an Australian new claim or at the same time as the coding of the third country pension. See NZ Assumed Rate in <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04024000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Social_Security_NZ_Agree">NZ Agreement specific terms</a>.</p>

<p>Like Australia, New Zealand apply a policy of requiring a customer to claim any 'comparable foreign payment' to which they are entitled. This only applies to customers in New Zealand so normal Foreign Pension System (FPS) processing is deferred by six (6) months to allow New Zealand to require the customer to make a claim. There is no deferral for customers in Australia. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-08010040-01.html">Foreign Pension System (FPS) statuses and reviews</a>.</p>

<p>This rate is used by New Zealand to limit (cap) the proportional rate of NZ pension paid in Australia (Article 9.3 and Article 10.2) and is manually advised to New Zealand at grant of Australian pension and thereafter when a change occurs through the automatic liaison process.

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> where International Services (CIS) rejects a new claim for Australian pension due to lack of NZ working age residence (NZWAR) to totalise and the person is in receipt of a NZ pension and has at least 12 months NZWAR, it has been agreed to provide a deemed Australian Notional Rate on the liaison (Service Decision) to New Zealand as they may then still pay a proportional rate into Australia.

<p>Where the customer has an Australian Notional Rate greater than zero but an Actual Rate of zero because of the NZ pension direct deduction (including pensions from third countries in some cases), the customer remains current for all other purposes, e.g. concession cards, Residential Care Assessments (RCA) This is referred to as Current Zero Rate (CZR).</p>

<div class="showcont">


<p>Where a customer is CZR and the Australian Notional Rate increases, for example when the Australian CPI is applied in March and September, a small rate may become payable.</p>

<p>However, as New Zealand will increase their proportional rate based on the increase in the Australian Notional Rate, system processing compares the increased Australian Notional Rate to the NZ Notional Rate. If the increased Australian Notional Rate remains less than the NZ Notional Rate, system processing forces the CZR to remain in place. This is referred to as the CZR Override and displays on the Factors Affecting Rate (<strong>PFAR</strong>) screen as 'New Zealand zero rate override'.</p>

<p>The CZR Override rules for partnered cases are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
if both members of a couple have the same Australian Notional Rate, and</li>
		<li>
both customers' NZ Notional Rate is higher than the Australian Notional Rate</li>

<p>Not to be confused with the <strong>date the customer became severely disabled</strong> (see below), the Agreement defines the Date of Severe Disablement (Article 1.1(e)) as either&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the date first assessed under the Agreement, or</li>
		<li>
an earlier date if agreed between Australia and New Zealand</li>

		<li>
mark the end date of a customers’ period of Working Age Residence.</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer was residing in AU or NZ on the date they became severely disabled, DoSD is the date from which the customer's payments commence under, or they become impacted by, the Agreement.</p>

<p>If the customer was residing in a 3rd country on the date they became severely disabled, DoSD is the <strong>Date the customer became severely disabled</strong> (see below).</p>

<p><strong>Notes&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
The DoSD is required for <strong>all</strong> DSP customers who are present long-term in NZ (and who therefore receive a proportional rate) </li>

<p>Customers are generally paid NZS for up to 26 weeks after leaving NZ. To continue being paid, they will need to lodge a ‘portable’ claim, noting the AU claim = FP claim principle applies. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04024000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Rules_for_Austr_Lodgemen">Lodgement rules and start day</a>.</p>

<p>The ‘portable’ rate of NZS will be lower than the ‘domestic’ rate of NZS. If Services Australia continue to maintain the ‘domestic’ rate of NZS, the customer will be adversely affected as it can take some time for NZ to determine the correct rate of ‘portable’ NZS to apply and Services Australia are unable to pay the customer arrears to account for the difference.</p>

<p>The NZ Assumed Rate (ASR) is a calculation of what proportional rate of NZ pension can be paid in Australia. It is used to adjust the Australian rate, in recognition of the fact that the rate of NZ pension will reduce, ensuring the customer receives their full social security entitlement. The ASR must be coded in a new claim if the customer is in Australia and receiving NZS. This is to ensure the arrears issued from the new claim are calculated using the portable rate of NZS.</p>

<p>The ASR is also used where a non-protected special category visa (SCV) holder who is paid a direct deduction rate of Australian pension is granted a third country pension.</p>

<p>That is in recognition of the fact that the rate of NZ pension that is being paid will reduce because of the grant of the third country pension.</p>

<p>Using the ASR offsets any problems with arrears debt calculations or a requirement to make negative adjustments and then positive adjustments of the same value.</p>

<p>The NZ Assumed Rate Calculator is available to International Services (CIS) staff through the International Programme. See the <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04024000-05.html">Resources</a> page for a link.</p>

<p>This is the theoretical maximum rate of NZ pension that could be paid before capping is applied. It is determined by the information provided by New Zealand, i.e. the rate of NZ pension that is compared to the Australian Notional Rate, and is manually coded with the NZ Actual Rate when a NZ pension is granted.</p>

<p>The NZ Notional Rate is used in Current Zero Rate (CZR) processing to avoid paying small rates of Australian pension in the time between increases in the Australian Notional Rate and when New Zealand authorities update the NZ Actual Rate.</p>

<p>Pension age is defined in the Agreement (Article 1.1(j)) as the qualifying age for Australian age pension or New Zealand Superannuation, whichever is the higher.</p>

<p>It is used to determine the minimum qualifying age for both Australian age pension and New Zealand Superannuation (NZS), and the corresponding upper age for Australian Disability Support Pension (DSP) and New Zealand Supported Living Payment (NZI) where the Agreement is required for lodgement or qualification. For example, an NZS claimant present long-term in Australia requires the Agreement for lodgement and therefore needs to be the higher age.</p>

<div class="showcont">


<p>'Present long-term' is defined in the Agreement (Article 1.1(l)). A person is considered present long-term in a country if they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
move permanently or</li>
		<li>
travel temporarily with the intention to remain for more than 12 months, or</li>
		<li>
have been physically present for continuous period of 26 weeks</li>
		</ul>
<p>This is based on the New Zealand policy of accepting a person as ordinarily resident in New Zealand.</p>

<p>The country of long term presence on the <strong>Long Term Country Code&#58;</strong> field on the Residence Savings (<strong>RSS</strong>) screen is used to determine the base rate calculation to apply. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04024000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Rules_for_Austr_Rate_cal">Rate calculation</a>.</p>

<p>System rules exist which automatically determine the present long-term country based on combination of confirmed movement data from the Customer Advised Travel Details (<strong>RSCD</strong>) and Immigration Advised Movements (<strong>RSIM</strong>) screens and residence data from the Country of Residence (<strong>CRES</strong>) screen&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The <strong>Long Term Country Code&#58;</strong> field on the <strong>RSS</strong> screen will be set to the country of residence (<strong>CRES</strong>) where a move is permanent. That is, the country of residence matched the confirmed country of location from <strong>RSCD/RSIM</strong></li>
		<li>
Where a customer is travelling temporarily, that is the country of residence (<strong>CRES</strong>) and the country of presence (<strong>RSIM/RSCD</strong>) do not align, the system will set a review to mature 26 weeks after departure. On maturation of the review, the system will update the <strong>Long Term Country Code&#58;</strong> field on the <strong>RSS</strong> screen to the country of presence if the customer has remained continuously in that country for the entire 26 weeks. If the customer has not remained present in that country, the review is cancelled with no update</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> there is no mechanism for recording a customer's intent in relation to travel. Where a customer is travelling temporarily but intends to remain in the other country for a period exceeding 12 months, the <strong>Long Term Country Code&#58;</strong> field on the <strong>RSS</strong> screen will need to be manually updated. This can only be done by an authorised staff member in International Services.</p>

<div class="showcont">


<p>The SWN is the New Zealand client/ reference number. It is 9 digits long. The correct format is 123456789.</p>

<p>Care must be taken when coding SWNs to ensure the automated liaison process occurs correctly. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04020000-01.html">Agreement liaisons, NZ CICs and exchange of information</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Work and Income New Zealand (WINZ) may ask staff to update customer records with a SWN so they can access the International Verification Facility (the portal).</p>

<p><strong>Staff must not</strong> create a Foreign Pension Details (<strong>FPD</strong>) record just to record a NZ reference number (SWN).</p>

<p><strong>Only record</strong> a SWN on <strong>FPD</strong>&#58;</p>

<p><strong>Special Banking Option (SBO)/Direct Payment Method (DPM)</strong> <a title="Read more 24" class="showhead bp03_tbl__NZ_Agree" onclick="erefshow(this)" href="javascript:;"><span class="showhead bp03_tbl__NZ_Agree" onclick="erefshow(this)" href="javascript:;">+</span> Read more ...</a></p>
<div class="showcont">


<p>There are two banking options available to customers present long-term in NZ&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Special Banking Option (SBO), which is an account in the customer's name but which is managed by the NZ authorities, and</li>
		<li>
Direct Payment Method (DPM), which is an ordinary bank account in the customer’s name</li>
		</ul>
<p>SBO may be used due to New Zealand's general policy of direct deduction of pensions from other countries. Payments from other countries, including Australia, are deposited into the SBO and the NZ authorities pay the person a full rate of NZ pension into a separate account owned by the customer. The NZ authorities retain the amounts deposited into the SBO, offsetting their outlays and avoiding the need for NZ to work out each pay how much ‘top up’ they need to pay.</p>

<p>Any queries about setting up, or issues with, SBO accounts should be referred to the NZ foreign pension authorities.</p>

<p><strong>Notes&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
SBO may be managed by the NZ authorities but Services Australia treats SBO as a normal bank account provided by the customer</li>
		<li>
SBO has a BSB of 031530 and resolves to WESTPAC SPECIAL BANKING OPTION when coded on the Payment Destination Overseas (<strong>PAPO</strong>) screen</li>
		</ul>
<p>SBO cannot be used in all circumstances. If any of the following apply, DPM <strong>must</strong> be used instead&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If a customer does not want to be paid into SBO</li>
		<li>
If the total amount rate of ‘foreign’ pensions received, including Australian pension, is higher than the maximum NZ rate, or</li>
		<li>
If a customer has an existing Australian debt, or debt shell, when they are assessed as being present long-term in New Zealand</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Notes&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Where a customer who is paid into SBO incurs an Australian debt that would normally be recovered by withholdings, it may be possible for the NZ authorities to return amounts through the Arrears Debts Schedules. This is only possible where the customer was paid into SBO for the <strong>entire</strong> debt period. See <a target="_blank" href="../debts/107-05080080-01.html">New Zealand Agreement debt recovery requests - action for International Services (CIS)</a></li>
		<li>
Arrears generated by an Australian claim grant<strong> must not</strong> be released to a customer who is paid via DPM. Arrears must be embargoed within the new claim on the <strong>EMB</strong> screen. See <a target="_blank" href="../initial-contact-general/106-04010000-03.html">Claims for Australian payments under International Agreements</a>.</li>

<p>A special category visa (SCV) is generally automatically issued to a person who enters Australia using a NZ passport. For the purposes of the social security law, SCV holders are either 'protected' or not.</p>

<p>SCV holders who are not protected can only receive either&#58;</p>

<p>This also means that a SCV holder who is not 'protected' and who was residing in Australia at the date they first met the continuing inability to work (CITW) criteria does not need to meet the qualifying residence period for Disability Support Pension (DSP), i.e. does not need to totalise. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04024000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Eligibility_cri_Qualific">Qualification/Totalisation</a>.</p>

<p>For Australian pension purposes under the Agreement only, a person may be accepted as an Australian resident if they have been present in Australia for 26 weeks or intend to remain for 12 months or more that is, they are present long-term in Australia. See New Zealand resident below.</p>

<p>New Zealand will generally accept a person as 'ordinarily resident' in New Zealand if the person has been present in New Zealand for at least 26 weeks or intends to remain for 12 months or more.</p>

<p><strong>Tax treaty</strong></p>

<p>Australia has a double tax agreement with New Zealand, which avoids the need to pay tax in both countries. A person who is 'resident' in one country (according to the definition in the tax agreement) only pays tax on pensions in that country.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> DSP is not taxable income in Australia but any New Zealand Supported Living Payment received in Australia is subject to taxation.</p>

<p><strong>Tax deductions</strong></p>

<p>Like Australia, NZ pensions may be taxed at source in New Zealand. NZ pensions are not taxed in Australia as there is a limit in the Agreement which effectively means a person cannot receive more NZ pension in Australia than the taxed pension rate in New Zealand (Article 9(b)(i) and (ii) and Article 10(1)(b)(i) and (ii)).</p>

<p>The gross rate of NZ pension is maintained.</p>

<p>Where New Zealand is paying a pension and Australia grants a corresponding payment in New Zealand, New Zealand will recalculate their rate in accordance with the Agreement. Due to the direct deduction policy in New Zealand, this results in an overpayment for a period in the past. New Zealand always requests an embargo of the arrears of Australian pension to recover any debt.</p>

<p>Arrears paid to SBO do not need to be embargoed as money paid into SBO accounts is ‘kept’ by NZ. Arrears paid to DPM <strong>must</strong> be manually embargoed on the EMB screen within the new claim. Do not release arrears to a customer paid into a DPM account.</p>

<p>The arrears amount is directed to a holding account by coding in the new claim activity. <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04010000-01.html">See Claims for Australian payments under International Agreements</a>.</p>

<p>Embargoed amounts are sent to New Zealand every month. The Finance team in Zone Tasmania is responsible for making payments and sending a schedule containing information about individual arrears payments to New Zealand.</p>

<p>Consistent with agreements generally, there are two rate calculation types paid under the New Zealand Agreement. Each type has several different variations which are known by the different system codes that are applied&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Direct Deduction</strong><br>Including Rate Calc A and B</li>
		<li>
<strong>Proportiona</strong>l<br>Including Rate Calc C, D, E and F</li>
		</ul>
<p>Form information on the rate calculation method codes, see the relevant rate calculation types below.</p>

<p>The rate calculation method that applies is determined by the country in which the customer is <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04024000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Social_Security_NZ_Agree">present long-term</a> as recorded in the <strong>Long Term Country Code&#58;</strong> field on the Residence Savings (<strong>RSS</strong>) screen&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
A value of ‘AU’ will cause the direct deduction rate to be paid</li>
		<li>
A value of ‘NZ’ will cause a proportional rate to be paid</li>
		<li>
A value of '.' (i.e. leaving the field blank) will cause a non-New Zealand Agreement rate to be paid (where payable).</li>

<div class="showcont">


<p>Unlike other agreements, the Agreement with New Zealand contains specific proportional rate calculations where the person is present long-term in New Zealand (Article 13). Additional child amounts are <strong>excluded</strong> in these proportional rates.</p>

<p>This means&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
customers paid under the Agreement who are outside Australia are paid a proportional rate according to their Australian Working Life Residence (WLR), and</li>
		<li>
the Rate Limiter/Limited Rate does not apply</li>
		</ul>
<p>Unlike Australia's other social security agreements that use Australian Working Life Residence, the New Zealand Agreement uses <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04024000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Social_Security_NZ_Agree">Working Age Residence</a> to calculate the proportional rate when one applies.</p>

<p>There are several proportional rate calculations defined in the New Zealand Agreement. The calculation which applies depends on whether the customer receives Age Pension or Disability Support Pension (DSP) or Carer Payment (CP) and whether the customer has 10 years historical residence in New Zealand or not.</p>

<p>The reason for this is that if a customer has lived in New Zealand for less than 10 years, they cannot qualify for NZ pension without the Agreement, so Australia takes responsibility for periods of residence in third countries (for Age Pension only) and changes the treatment of <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04024000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Social_Security_NZ_Agree">third country pensions</a> (Agreement definition).</p>

<p>This may have a significant impact on the rate paid in New Zealand. Care must be taken when providing advice to customers, see below.</p>

<p>The NZ Agreement does <strong>not</strong> include the proportionalisation of any NZ defined benefit in the income test (Randisi concession).</p>

<p>Although a person may be qualified for an Australian payment or portable outside Australia, if the customer has no WAR the rate of payment outside Australia will be nil.</p>

<p>When a person is paid a proportional rate under an agreement, Rent Assistance (RA) cannot be paid. Other add-ons such as Energy Supplement and Pension Supplement are payable under normal add-ons portability rules. See <a href="../australians-overseas/061-01070000-01.html">Portability of Add-ons</a>.</p>

<p>Examples of when a customer is paid a proportional rate includes (but not limited to)&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
permanently overseas</li>
		<li>
temporarily overseas longer than 26 weeks for age pension</li>

<p><strong>Carer Payment (CP)</strong></p>

<p>CP receives the same proportion as the DSP partner (Article 13.8). <strong>Note&#58;</strong> this also applies during any bereavement period. There are known issues with system processing for these cases. The approved workaround is to place the customer on a manual rate.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Returns to Australia</strong></p>

<p>The NZ Agreement proportional rate continues to apply until the customer is present long-term in Australia (Article 13.9). <strong>Note&#58;</strong> A customer who is paid under the NZ Agreement is entitled to a Pensioner Concession Card (PCC) while they are temporarily in Australia.

<p>Customers in Australia who receive a defined NZ benefit (NZ superannuation (NZS), NZ Supported Living Payment (NZI) or NZ Veterans' Pension (NZV)) are paid a New Zealand Agreement specific direct deduction rate (Article 13.2).</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> </p>
		<ul>		<li>
the direct deduction of any defined NZ benefit applies to <strong>any</strong> Australian Social Security income support payment</li>
		<li>
defined NZ benefits are halved and applied equally to both members of a couple. Where both members of a couple receive a defined NZ benefit, the direct deduction amount is the combined total of both amounts which are then halved and applied equally to each person</li>
		</ul>
<p>Direct deductions generally reduce the maximum amount payable before the income and assets test is applied. Under the New Zealand Agreement, the income or assets test is applied first, giving the Australian Notional rate. The direct deduction of any defined NZ benefit then applies.</p>

<p>If the person is not payable after the income or assets test is applied, that is their Australian Notional Rate is nil, the person is not entitled to income support. If the <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04024000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Social_Security_NZ_Agree">Australian Notional Rate</a> is greater than nil but the rate is nil after the NZ direct deduction is applied the person is considered to be <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04024000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Social_Security_NZ_Agree">Current Zero Rate (CZR)</a> (Article 15.3).</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>All income support payments</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Rate Calc A</strong> - If the customer is an Australian resident&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
NZ benefits covered by the Agreement are ignored as income and direct deducted after the income or assets test (Article 13.2(c)), and</li>
			<li>
third country pensions are assessed as for autonomous customers</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Rate Calc B</strong> - If the customer is a special category visa (SCV) holder who is not protected&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
NZ benefits covered by the Agreement (Article 13.2(c)) and third country pensions (Article 13.7(a)) are ignored as income and direct deducted after the income or assets test</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>The reason for Rate Calc B is that a SCV holder who is not 'protected' will not qualify for Australian pension without the Agreement, so New Zealand takes responsibility for periods of residence in third countries and changes the treatment of these payments.</p>

<p>Because the grant of a 3CP affects both the Australian and the New Zealand rates, the NZ Assumed Rate must be applied. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04024000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Social_Security_NZ_Agree">NZ Agreement specific terms</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Rate Calc B additional income test for concession cards</strong></p>

<p>Because Current zero Rate (CZR) customers may still get a Pension Concession Card (PCC), to avoid providing an advantage over autonomous customers, there is an additional income test for concession cards for customers paid Rate Calc B under the Agreement.</p>

<p>This additional income test applies Rate Calc A, that is, re-introduces third country pensions as income to see if the customer would have had an Australian Notional Rate under that calculation.</p>

<p>If so, the customer is eligible for the concession card but if not, their concession card entitlement will be end dated. This can be seen on the Concession Card Summary (<strong>MCCS</strong>) screen where the reason for the end date of a concession card will be 'NZB'.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Departures to New Zealand</strong></p>

<p>The NZ Agreement direct deduction rate continues to apply until the customer is present long-term in New Zealand (Article 13.3), See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04024000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Social_Security_NZ_Agree">NZ Agreement specific terms</a>.</p>

<div class="showcont">


<p>Where a customer receives a NZ Agreement rate and that customer departs Australia or New Zealand for a third country, the rate calculation method that applies immediately prior to departure, i.e. proportional or direct deduction, generally remains the same for the period the Australian payment is portable under the terms of the Agreement (Article 13.10). That is, it will change immediately for permanent departures or after a defined period for temporary departures. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04024000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Rules_for_Austr01_Portabil">Portability</a>.</p>

<p>Once the NZ Agreement rate calculation method ceases to apply, customers who remain payable, that is autonomous customers or those payable by virtue of another agreement, will revert to the rate that would otherwise have been payable.</p>

<p>This may be a non-proportional rate with or without supplements or a proportional rate based on working life residence (WLR) etc.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Third country pass through situations</strong></p>

<p>If a customer travels to New Zealand from Australia, or vice versa, and subsequently travels to a third country <strong>before</strong> the payment method changes, the payment method continues unchanged in that third country for the period of portability of the payment under the NZ Agreement, i.e. the payment method period resets. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04024000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Rules_for_Austr01_Portabil">Portability</a>.</p>

<p>Regardless of the rate calculation method that may apply, the treatment of defined NZ benefits (NZ Superannuation (NZS)), NZ Supported Living Payment (NZI) or NZ Veterans' Pension (NZV) is dependent on the portability of that payment under New Zealand’s portability rules. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> this can lead to some unusual situations, such as the following where the direct deduction rate may not apply but the NZ pension is still being directly deducted.</p>

<p>For example, an autonomous DSP customer with indefinite portability who receives a NZ superannuation (NZS) departs Australia for a third country for a temporary period of 9 months. In this case&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The direct deduction rate under the NZ Agreement continues to apply for the period of Australian DSP portability under the Agreement (28 days in 12 months)</li>
		<li>
After 28 days the NZ Agreement rate calculation method ceases to apply and changes to the ordinary portability rate (non-proportional with supplements) but the NZS continues to be treated as a direct deduction as the NZS portability period under the Agreement is 26 weeks</li>
		<li>
At 6 weeks the supplements cease to be payable, NZS is still direct deduction</li>
		<li>
At 26 weeks the DSP becomes proportional according to WLR (CITW occurred while resident outside Australia) and the NZS is ignored</li>
		</ul>
<p>In general, any defined NZ benefit paid to a person residing in a third country, will be assessed as income. However, in certain countries both the direct deduction or income testing of defined NZ benefits cease to apply (Article 13.1). This is because New Zealand has special arrangements, or Agreements of their own with these countries, which may alter the way they treat any Australian pension.</p>

<p><strong>New Zealand Superannuation (NZS)</strong></p>

<p>New Zealand Superannuation (NZS) is the equivalent to Age Pension and not to be confused with other private contributory pensions or superannuation in Australia. NZS is not income tested. Partners of NZS recipients who are not yet NZS age may receive a 'non-qualified spouse' payment. This is paid at the equivalent of NZS but is not payable long-term in Australia. If a 'non-qualified spouse' payment is received, the customer's NZS is income tested.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a customer needs to use the Agreement to qualify for NZS, that is, if they are present long term in Australia or they need to totalise, the customer needs to be <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04024000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Social_Security_NZ_Agree">pension age</a> (Agreement definition).</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Supported Living Payment (NZI)</strong></p>

<p>Supported Living Payment (NZI) is equivalent to Disability Support Pension (DSP) and is paid at a double rate where the person is partnered, even if the partner is not otherwise qualified for NZI. For this reason, Carer Payment partners of DSP were included in the Agreement. NZI is income tested in New Zealand but not in Australia.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> care needs to be taken to determine if the partner qualifies for NZI in their own right.</p>

<p>Like DSP, NZI cannot be paid under the Agreement where the customer was living in a third country on the date they became severely disabled. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04024000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Social_Security_NZ_Agree">NZ Agreement specific terms</a>.</p>

<p>A NZI recipient who reaches pension age and is entitled to NZS is no longer entitled to NZI (Article 6.8). For members of a couple, NZI ceases to be payable once both are of NZS age (Article 6.9).</p>

<p>In order to transfer to NZS a new <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04024000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Rules_for_Austr01_Claim_fo">claim form</a> is generally required.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Veterans Pension (NZV)</strong></p>

<p>NZ Veterans Pension (NZV) is the same as NZS with war service criteria. This is not to be confused with NZ War Disablement Pension or Surviving Spouse Pension paid by the New Zealand equivalent of Veterans' Affairs (VANZ). See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04024000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Rules_for_New_Z_Other_kn">Other known payments</a>.</p>

<p>The requirement to claim applies to New Zealand Superannuation (NZS) and Supported Living Payment (NZI).</p>

<p>The requirement to claim NZ pension does not generally apply to a person who has been continuously in receipt of Australian income support payments, including if transferred between payments, since 1 July 2002 (Article 26.4).</p>

<p>However, such a person who goes long-term to New Zealand and claims a NZ pension must maintain that pension if they return to Australia long-term or deprivation of income rules apply, see <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-06010000-01.html">Deprivation</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> there are known issues with system processing to apply this exemption. Cases identified are to be corrected manually by selecting the relevant entry on the Foreign Claim Summary (<strong>FGS</strong>) screen and coding '<strong>FIN-NOM</strong>' in the <strong>Status/Reason&#58;</strong> fields on the Foreign Claim Detail (<strong>FGD</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>Foreign Pension System (FPS) screening for NZ pensions is largely automated although an MFU to determine whether the customer is severely disabled applies for Disability Support Pension (DSP) before a claim is issued.

<p>To be paid in Australia, New Zealand law required a person to make a claim for NZ pension, even if they are already receiving the payment in New Zealand and then travel to Australia long term. Under the Agreement, a person who receives a NZ pension in New Zealand and then travels to Australia long term must claim that NZ pension again within a period based on the portability of the NZ payment&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
26 weeks for NZ Superannuation (Article 6.4)</li>
		<li>
26 weeks for NZ Veterans Pension (Article 6.4), and</li>
		<li>
4 weeks for Supported Living Payment (Article 6.5)</li>
		</ul>
<p>In practise, the 'claim for one equals claim for the other' provision allows the Australian pension claim to be taken to be the claim for NZ pension (Article 17.4) to meet this requirement.</p>

<p><strong>However</strong>, as the rate of NZ pension in Australia is limited to the <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04024000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Social_Security_NZ_Agree">Australian Notional Rate</a>, before the NZ pension claim can be processed, customers must either&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
have their claim for an Australian pension finalised, or</li>
		<li>
if they already receive an Australian pension and are returning to become long term in Australia, must have their rate changed to the 'in Australia' rate</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Notes&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Claim packs containing all the necessary forms to claim a NZ pension are automatically issued through the Foreign Pension System (FPS) at the appropriate time</li>
		<li>
NZ uses a combined claim pack, that is, it covers New Zealand Superannuation (NZS), Veterans Payment (NZV) and Support Living Payment (NZI)</li>
		<li>
NZ pension claims may be reissued if necessary but generally should <strong>not</strong> be issued manually</li>
		<li>
Customers should be informed of the requirements for Services Australia to determine the Australian Notional Rate before the NZ pension claim can be finalised. This can affect the timeliness</li>
		</ul>
<p>Under the Administrative Arrangements, NZ pension forms can be lodged in Australia at any service centre, see <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-08010000-01.html">Foreign pension claims</a>.</p>

<p>Amounts that are treated as a direct deduction under an agreement are exempt from the income test (s8(8)(zc) Social Security Act 1991).</p>

<p>The Agreement with New Zealand includes a general statement that no NZ pension is treated as income unless residing in a third country where NZ does not also direct deduct any Australian pension (Article 13.1). This means that NZ benefits in the scope of the Agreement (NZ Superannuation (NZS), Supported Living Benefit (NZI) or NZ Veterans' Pension (NZV)) are generally treated as either a direct deduction or exempt from the income test but may be income tested in some third countries. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04024000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Rules_for_New_Z_Assessme">Assessment</a> and <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04024000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Rules_for_Austr_Rate_cal">Rate calculation</a>.</p>

<p>Any NZ benefit outside the scope of the Agreement, for example, Domestic Purposes Benefit, is considered in accordance with the social security law and will be regular income in most instances.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> care must be taken to identify the payment correctly&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
NZ Superannuation is the equivalent of Age pension as distinct from any other superannuation-like payments</li>
		<li>
NZ Veterans' Pension is paid by the NZ pension authority as distinct from other Veterans' Affairs New Zealand (VANZ) payments such as War Disablement Pension. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04024000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Rules_for_New_Z_Other_kn">Other known payments</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>Certain payments from New Zealand outside the scope of the Agreement are also specifically exempt under s8(8)(zd) Social Security Act 1991&#58;</p>

Accommodation Benefit</li>
		<li>

<div class="showcont">


<p>The Agreement with New Zealand includes embargo provisions (Article 19.3).</p>

<p>Claims for NZ pension lodged in Australia generally include a request for embargo of any NZ pension arrears when sent by International Services (CIS). However, if the customer is reclaiming their NZ pension when moving long term to Australia, the <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04024000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Social_Security_NZ_Agree">Assumed Rate</a> of NZ pension is applied and there is no embargo.</p>

<p>If requested, New Zealand will normally hold the arrears amount and send a Service Decision advising CIS of the details of the grant.</p>

<p>New Zealand send embargoed arrears on a monthly basis and send a schedule of the individual amounts via Liquid Office. For NZ Liaison Forms, see the <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04024000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Social_Security_Exchange">Exchange of information and liaison forms</a> on the General information tab. Resources in Zone Tasmania confirm receipt to CIS for amounts to be recorded on customer records.</p>

<p>See <a href="../debts/107-04040020-01.html">New Zealand embargoes</a> for further information.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
the rate of NZ pension for the arrears period is converted to Australian dollars using the exchange rate applicable to the month the payment is advised and is coded. The resulting debt amount (if any) is then retained with the remaining arrears (if any) sent to the customer</li>
		<li>
partner debts may be recovered from the customer’s NZ pension arrears only if the ‘Authorisation’ has been completed and noted on the customer record. The authorisation form is included in the NZ claim package</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where New Zealand convert the NZ dollar value of the arrears to Australian dollars using their own conversion rates and pay that amount to International Services (CIS), the debt is considered to be fully repaid, regardless of any difference in the amounts calculated and received.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> where any individual embargo action fails, arrears debts are raised under s1228A Social Security Act 1991 and recovered by normal methods. See <a href="../debts/107-04040000-01.html">Non embargo comparable foreign payment arrears debts</a>.</p>

<p>A <strong>contravention debt</strong> may also occur if the customer does not advise of the grant of their New Zealand payment within their notification period. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-08030000-01.html">Foreign pension coding</a>. Contravention debts, or any other debt as a result of arrears of foreign pensions not resulting from a grant of a pension, cannot be recovered by embargo.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Debt recovery (non-arrears)</strong> <a title="Read more 86" class="showhead bp03_tbl_Rules_for_New_Z_Arrears_" onclick="erefshow(this)" href="javascript:;"><span class="showhead bp03_tbl_Rules_for_New_Z_Arrears_" onclick="erefshow(this)" href="javascript:;">+</span> Read more ...</a></p>
<div class="showcont">


<p>The Agreement with New Zealand is unique in allowing debts from one country to be recovered from the ongoing payments of the other country (Article 19.4). For the purposes of this part of the Agreement, payments are extended to mean any social security income support payment (Article 19.2).</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> family assistance is outside the scope of the Agreement for both the exchange of information and recovery of debts.</p>

<p>Under the Schedule to the Agreement and the Administrative Arrangements, there are a number of conditions that must be met before a debt can be recovered, including minimum amounts (A$400) and the date the debt was first found to be owing (less than 5 years prior to the date of request for recovery). A Debt Certificate is used to request recovery action from the other country, for Australian Liaison Forms see the <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04024000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Social_Security_Exchange">Exchange of information and liaison forms</a> on the General information tab.</p>
