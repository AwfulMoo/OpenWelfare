<p>A notice of judgment or settlement advises Services Australia (the agency) that a decision has been reached about a compensation claim for an amount greater than $5,000 (including legal expenses).</p>

<p>Under section 23 of the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995 (HOSC Act) a compensation payer or their representative must advise the agency within 28 days after the date of the compensation was fixed on&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the Notice of judgment or settlement form (MO022), or</li>
		<li>

<p>Under section 29(3) of the HOSC Act 1995, if a valid notice of judgment or settlement is not received by the agency within 28 days from the date the compensation amount was set, the compensation payer is liable to repay any debts identified in the notice of charge. If a compensation payer has not complied with legislated notice requirements letter (Z2809) will be issued to the compensation payer. Any payment made will be treated as a voluntary payment and will be applied to the notice of charge. </p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Apportionment_o">Apportionment of liability for Medicare Compensation Recovery </h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Apportionment of liability as a result of contributory negligence is a formal agreement or finding that reduces the amount of compensation that would otherwise be payable. Where apportionment of liability applies, the total amount payable to the agency is reduced by the proportion of liability for the injury or illness attributed to the injured person as indicated in the judgment or settlement documents if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the judgment or settlement fixes the amount of compensation on the basis that liability for the injury has been apportioned between the injured person and compensation payer, and</li>
		<li>
as a result, the amount of compensation is less than it would have been if liability had not been apportioned</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Evidence of liability</strong></p>

<p>The agency must only be satisfied that settlement has been fixed on the basis that the original amount of compensation has been reduced as a result of an apportionment of liability.</p>

<p>The MO022 form or settlement documents must include the percentage of apportionment attributed to the injured person.</p>

<p>Acceptable documentation to support an apportionment if the MO022 is not provided are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
judgment or court order</li>
		<li>
consent order</li>
		<li>
terms of settlement</li>
		<li>
deed of release or discharge</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Reducing the amount owed</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
When the amount of compensation is reduced because an apportionment of liability has been applied for contributory negligence, the amount owed to the agency is reduced by the proportion of liability attributed to the injured person</li>
		<li>
For example, if the amount owing is $1,000 but 20% liability has been apportioned to the injured person in the claim, the recoverable amount is reduced by 20% to $800</li>
		<li>
When the notice of charge is issued, the reduced amount owed to the agency is automatically calculated in MCRS. The notice of charge will show the reduction</li>
		<li>
A notice of charge may be amended if a request is made within the 2 year reviewable period and supporting apportionment of liability settlement documents are provided</li>

<p><strong>About advance payments</strong></p>

<p>A compensation payer may choose to make an advance payment under section 33B of the HOSC Act if no valid notice of charge exists on the date of judgment or settlement.</p>

<p>After the agency has received an advance payment, the compensation payer can then release the remainder of the settlement sum to the injured person or claimant before the amount owed to the agency has been determined. Once an advance payment has been made, the compensation payer is not entitled to receive any further information about the case, including&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
details of any debts owed by the injured person, or</li>
		<li>
any amounts deducted from the advance payment</li>
		</ul>
<p>A payment from a compensation payer is only accepted as an advance payment if advice of intent to make an advance payment is accepted <strong>and</strong> other criteria are met.</p>

<p><strong>Advance payments - notification of payment intent</strong></p>

<p>If the compensation payer intends to make an advance payment, they must notify the injured person in writing under section 33A of the HOSC Act before the date the judgment or settlement is fixed.</p>

<p>The notice must state the&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
compensation payer intends to make the advance payment</li>
		<li>
amount of the advance payment</li>
		<li>
circumstances in which the&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
agency can retain some or all of the advance payment, and</li>
			<li>
injured person will be required to make an additional payment to the agency in respect of eligible benefits</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>Confirmation of this notification is provided on the MO022 form.</p>

<p><strong>Advance payments - notification of intent to Medicare</strong></p>

<p>The notifiable persons’ notification to Medicare of intent to pay an advance payment is accepted if any of the following apply&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
either the Yes box is ticked or the amount of 10% is entered in the AP field at Q36 on the NOJS</li>
		<li>
there is an attached deed of release or other official document that specifies the AP intent and amount</li>
		<li>
an amount of money equal to 10% is paid to Medicare</li>
		</ul>
<p>Intent to pay an advance payment is not accepted, regardless of any money paid, if No is ticked at Q36 on the MO022 form.</p>

<p>If advance payment intent is not accepted any payment received will be considered as a voluntary payment (ad-hoc in MCRS) and will be applied to the notice of charge. As there is no written advice that this payment was intended as an advance payment there will be no non-compliance letter issued.</p>

<p><strong>Advance payments - criteria</strong></p>

<p>A compensation payer can make the advance payment in respect of the compensation payable, if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a notice of past benefits has not been issued in respect of the claim in the 6 months preceding the day on which the judgment or settlement is fixed</li>
		<li>
a notice of judgment or settlement under section 23 of the HOSC Act has been given to the agency indicating the compensation payer intends to make an advance payment</li>
		<li>
a notice under section 33A of the HOSC Act has been given to the injured person</li>
		<li>
the total amount of compensation fixed under the judgment or settlement (including legal costs) is fixed at more than $5,000</li>
		<li>
the payment made is equal to 10% of the total amount of compensation payable, <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
the advance payment is made within 28 days after the date of judgment/settlement</li>
		</ul>
