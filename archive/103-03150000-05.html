<p><strong>How will a participant access their money if they have not received, or lose their CDC?</strong></p>

<p>If a participant's payment has been split, and they have not received their CDC, they should obtain a temporary card from a Centrelink Service Centre, Local Partner or eligible Australia Post outlet.</p>

<p>They may request a transfer of funds to their unrestricted account if they are unable to access a temporary card (the card issuer will allow a limited transfer amount per month, see the card issuer's website). Staff may be able to assist the participant by advising of when the payment was sent to the CDC account. Staff cannot contact the card issuer on behalf of the participant.</p>

<p>If a participant loses their card, they will need to contact the card issuer to organise a replacement.</p>

<p><strong>How are Urgent Payments, Crisis Payments, Hardship Advances and Disaster Relief payments treated under the CDC?</strong></p>

<p>These payments are paid into the participant's unrestricted bank account by default, unless they ask for it to be directed to their CDC account. Normal processing and assessments should apply when considering to grant a CDC customer an urgent, crisis or hardship payment.</p>

<p>No additional or special consideration should be given to CDC participants when assessing claims for these payments, including if a participant has lost their CDC. Urgent, crisis or hardship payments for a CDC participant must not be approved, if the request is for the purposes of circumventing the CDC to access cash.</p>

<p>The card issuer does not charge fees to CDC participants. Participants can make unlimited purchases on their card and check their CDC balance or transaction history online for free. Lost or stolen cards will be replaced at no cost.</p></td>

<p>Advance Payments (excluding hardship advances/anticipated payments) are treated as lump sums, and 100% are directed to the CDC. If the participant subsequently requires access to cash, they can discuss their circumstances with the Cashless Debit Card hotline for consideration of a possible transfer of funds to their regular bank account.</p>

<p><strong>Customers in the CDC area temporarily</strong></p>

<p>Customers will be triggered onto the CDC if their home address (or term address if a full-time student) is in a CDC area. If customers are only in the area temporarily (for example, they are travelling), then their address should be coded as Temporary, to avoid being triggered onto the CDC in error.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> care should be taken to ensure the customer has not made an address update solely to avoid the CDC.</p>

<p>If a customer has an incorrect address coded, contact the CDC processing team who will review the customer's circumstances, and if in agreement, will instruct that the customer's address details be corrected. The CDC processing team will then exit the customer from the CDC (if appropriate). Where possible, it is preferred that the customer stays on the phone or in the office in case further information or discussion with the customer is required.</p>

<p><strong>Participant advises their address was incorrect and they had physically moved before the CDC determination date</strong></p>

<p>The CDC is portable and participants will remain on the CDC if they move out of the area (unless they move overseas permanently). If a participant advises they physically moved before the CDC determination date, but had not notified Services Australia or the address update had not been completed correctly, then the participant will be eligible for a review of the decision to be placed on the CDC. These cases should be discussed with the CDC processing team, who will review the decision. In some situations, evidence may be required, and the address details will need to be correctly updated.</p>

<p>If a customer was incorrectly triggered onto the CDC, and the customer's payment has already been split to the restricted bank account, the CDC processing team can request for the card issuer to transfer the funds to the customer's unrestricted account.</p>

<p>Customers who have been on the CDC for some time, and who are subsequently exited, will need to contact the card issuer if they are eligible for those funds to be transferred to a different account. Their payment will default back to being sent to the unrestricted bank account.</p>

These requests should always be referred to the CDC Processing team in the first instance or the Social Work Services Branch for action.</p>
