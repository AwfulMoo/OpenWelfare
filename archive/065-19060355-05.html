<p>In Process Direct the Pensions Assessment (<strong>PNA</strong>) screen displays the customer’s Age Pension age date and the Pensions Assessment Date.</p>

<p><strong>Age Pension age Details</strong></p>

<p>If the customer has reached Age Pension age, the <strong>Age Pension Eligibility</strong> indicator will display 'Yes'. To be eligible for the Scheme the customer must be Age Pension age <strong>or</strong> partnered to a person who is Age Pension age.</p>

<p>To view the partner’s Age Pension age details, select <img src="../resources/images/process_direct_small/relationships_menu_icon.png" alt="relationships_menu_icon.png" title="relationships_menu_icon.png" /> to view the Relations<strong> </strong>menu and select the partner to access their record.</p>

<p><strong>Pensions Assessment (PNA) Date</strong></p>

<p>The PNA date is automatically determined based on the customer’s circumstances, and can be changed if required.</p>

<p>If the customer is current on a pension, no changes need to be made to the PNA date for the purposes of the Scheme application.</p>

<p>If the customer has applied for loan-only loan, the PNA date will default to the date the Scheme application was lodged. For loan-only applications that result in a grant outcome, the PNA date <strong>must match</strong> the Scheme grant date to ensure pension arrears are not paid. The Scheme grant date is the Effect Date recorded on the HEAS Details (<strong>PLS</strong>) screen.</p>

<p><strong>Residence</strong></p>

<p>To be eligible for the Scheme, applicants must meet the qualifying residence rules applicable to their Home Equity Access Scheme qualifying payment. The customer's qualification is automatically assessed based on the residence information held on the customer’s record and any new information entered to the application.</p>

<p>Check the residence information provided by the customer in their Scheme application and make any required updates. Residence updates must be coded even if the application is to be rejected, in order to correctly assess the customer’s eligibility for the Scheme qualifying payment.</p>

<p>Common residence screens to review and update include&#58;</p>

<p><strong>Payment Destination Details (PAS)</strong></p>

<p>The Payment Destination Details (<strong>PAS</strong>) screen is used to record the bank account where the Scheme loan payments will be sent. Payment destination details for the Scheme are recorded against Benefit System PEN – Pensions.</p>

<p>Check the Scheme application to identify which bank account the customer has nominated to receive their loan payments into. Ensure the correct information is recorded on the <strong>PAS</strong> screen for Benefit System PEN – Pensions.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the customer receives a pension, the pension and Scheme loan must be paid to the same bank account. Any changes to the payment destination details for Benefit System&#58; PEN – Pensions will be applied to the pension. If a pension recipient has nominated a different account for their Scheme payments, contact the customer before applying the change to advise that the same account must be used for both payments, and confirm which account they wish to proceed with.</p>

<p>The information on the <strong>TFN</strong> screen will automatically populate with the customers TFN details if already provided. TFN details for the Scheme are recorded against the Service Reason for the Scheme qualifying payment, for example Age Pension (AGE).</p>

<p>Check the information provided in the Scheme application to ensure the populated details are correct, including that the customer has provided authorisation to use the TFN for the Scheme purposes. If a new provisional entry has been automatically created, check the details for correctness and make edits if required.</p>

<p>If the customer is partnered, switch to the partner’s record and ensure their TFN details have also been updated correctly. Partners of the Scheme applicants are requested to provide a TFN, however it is not mandatory unless they are applying for their own Scheme loan.</p>

<p>If the applicant is unable to provide their partner’s TFN, exemption reason SEC (Secretaries Exemption) may be applied to the partner’s record. Recording of the TFN exemption must be applied by the Customer Details Helpdesk. To request an exemption for the partner, submit a request to the Helpdesk.</p>

		<li>
<strong>MAX</strong> – this should only be applied to customer’s who receive less than the maximum rate of pension. The loan amount paid is the difference between the maximum pension rate and the customer’s actual rate. MAX can only be coded for applications lodged prior to 1 July 2019</li>
		<li>
<strong>PCT</strong> – this loan type allows the customer to elect a percentage that is less than the maximum 150%. A percentage between 1% and 150% can entered. The loan amount paid is the difference between the maximum pension rate x the applicable percentage, and the customer’s actual pension rate. If the elected percentage is less than the actual rate payable, no loan is payable (<strong>Note&#58;</strong> post-grant this will cause the Scheme payments to stop and require manual restoration). PCT can only be coded for Effect Dates on or after 1 July 2019</li>

<strong>FIX</strong> – for customers who elect to receive a fixed amount of loan per fortnight. The fixed amount plus the customer’s actual pension rate cannot exceed the maximum amount payable (which from 1 July 2019 is the maximum pension rate x 150%)</li>
		<li>
<strong>RVM</strong> – for customers who elect a combined payment amount each fortnight. The combined amount of pension and loan cannot exceed the amount the customer elects.

No loan payments can be paid if the indicator is 'Y' (Yes). Where the <strong>Ceased Loan Indicator</strong> has been set to 'Y', the <strong>Reject/Cease Reason</strong> field will also be recorded to indicate the reason loan payments are not payable</li>
		</ul>
<p>The <strong>Ceased Loan Indicator</strong> does not identify the status of a person’s participation in the scheme, only the status of the payable loan component. The person is considered to be a current Scheme participant until the loan is settled in full (i.e. until the Current Balance becomes zero).</p>

<p>The <strong>Ceased Loan Indicator</strong> only needs to be coded in a the Scheme application if the&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
loan is being rejected for a manual rejection reason, or</li>
		<li>
indicator has been previously set to 'Y' and needs to be changed to 'N' to enable the Scheme to be re-granted or restored</li>
		</ul>
<p>If an auto-rejection reason applies, the indicator is set to 'Y' automatically.</p>

<p>For more information about the rejection, cancellation and restoration of the Scheme loans see <a href="../older-australians/065-19060321-01.html">Home Equity Access Scheme cancellation and rejections</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>

<p>Prior to granting the Scheme loan, a verbal offer of loan must be made and an interview conducted with the applicant and partner, if any. The intent of the interview is to discuss the loan available to the applicant once the actual Maximum Loan Amount (MLA) and rate has been determined. The applicant must verbally agree to proceed with the loan. The interview also serves as a control to address the risk of vulnerability or elder abuse, fraud and capacity issues in a way that incorporates and is aligned with best practice for lenders of loans.</p>

<p>The interview provides an opportunity for the Decision Maker (DM) to complete all of the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
inform the applicant of the decision and provide the details of the loan offer</li>
		<li>
ensure the applicant has an understanding of the Home Equity Access Scheme terms and conditions, including the requirements to maintain eligibility criteria and comply with ongoing notification obligations</li>
		<li>
provide information about the customers withdrawal rights and review/appeal rights</li>
		<li>
as far as possible, identify if the customer and/or partner does not understand, or have capacity to understand, the loan</li>
		<li>
identify if there are signs the customer will not be able to comply with the terms/conditions</li>
		<li>
as far as possible, identify indicators of financial elder abuse or fraud</li>
		<li>
reiterate the benefits of seeking independent legal or financial advice before entering into the Scheme</li>
		<li>
answer any questions the applicant may have about the Scheme</li>
		<li>
seek agreement from the applicant and partner (if any) to proceed on the loan offer</li>
		</ul>
<p>The interview should be conducted as close to the date of grant as possible. Typically the application is finalised on the same day the interview is conducted, providing the applicant has agreed to proceed with the loan.</p>

<p><strong>Interview details</strong></p>

<p>The Scheme pre-grant interview must include discussion of the following information.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Details of the loan offer, including&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the value of the loan security used in the assessment</li>
			<li>
nominated amount (if applicable)</li>
			<li>
Maximum Loan Amount (MLA) available</li>
			<li>
fortnightly loan payment rate and/or advance payment amount</li>
			<li>
fortnightly pension rate (including if zero)</li>
			<li>
start date for the loan as of the next fortnight<br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> an offer to backdate the start date should not be made unless the customer specifically requests it</li>
			<li>
projected loan balance information</li>		</ul>
		<li>
The applicable interest rate and method of compounding interest, noting interest continues to accrue (compounding fortnightly) until the Scheme debt is repaid in full by the customer or their estate. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> the Scheme interest rate is set by the Minister for the Department of Social Services and is published on the Federal Register of Legislation</li>
		<li>
Taxation status of the loan component (i.e. non-taxable)</li>
		<li>
Costs involved in registering, changing or withdrawing a charge or caveat on the titles of secured real estate. Withdrawal of the caveat/charge occurs at the point of settlement of the loan</li>
		<li>
Liability of the customer, or their estate, for all components of the Scheme loan including principal loan payments, costs and interest</li>
		<li>
The No Negative Equity Guarantee (NNEG) may apply at settle time. If the NNEG does apply, it guarantees that should a Scheme debt be greater than the value of the property (market value) at the conclusion of the loan, no customer, partner or estate will be required to repay more than the property’s current market value. Exceptions apply for example if a person extends an existing loan, or takes out another loan on the security property after being granted the Scheme, or they misrepresent their circumstances, or they commit fraud. For further details see <a target="_blank" href="../older-australians/065-08020050-01.html">Settlement of Home Equity Access Scheme loans</a></li>
		<li>
Procedures for recovery of the loan. See <a href="../older-australians/065-08020040-01.html">Repayment of Home Equity Access Scheme loans</a> and <a href="../older-australians/065-08020050-01.html">Settlement of Home Equity Access Scheme loan amounts</a> for supporting information</li>
		<li>
Requirement to&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
comply with the Home Equity Access Scheme terms and conditions as agreed in the signing of the loan application</li>
			<li>
maintain eligibility for the Scheme, including pension qualification, for as long as the customer wishes to continue receiving loan payments. Loss of eligibility results in the cessation of fortnightly loan payments</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Notification obligations. See <a href="../older-australians/065-08020060-01.html">Home Equity Access Scheme reviews</a> for details</li>
		<li>
Right to request an explanation or review of decision. See Request for an explanation, quality check or review</li>
		<li>
The customer’s right to vary their loan arrangements in writing at any time, including stopping or starting their loan payments</li>
		<li>
A written request signed by the customer and, if a member of a couple (MoC), their partner is required to change any of the following&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Fortnightly loan payment rate</li>
			<li>
Maximum Loan Amount (MLA)</li>
			<li>
Nominated Amount</li>
			<li>
Stopping or starting loan payments</li>
			<li>
Changes to the loan security</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Benefit of seeking independent legal or financial advice and talking to any beneficiaries of the estate before entering into the Scheme</li>
		<li>
Once granted&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
a grant letter will be sent confirming the details of the loan and the customer’s obligations</li>
			<li>
a loan statement is sent at least once per annum. Where both MoC participate in the Scheme, each person receives their own statement</li>		</ul>
		<li>
How to make repayments, noting they can be made at any time</li>
		</ul>
<p>Obtain verbal agreement from the customer to the loan offer and information discussed before proceeding to grant the loan. If the customer decides not to proceed with the loan, they can choose to withdraw the application. See <a href="../older-australians/065-08020010-01.html">Assessing Home Equity Access Scheme applications</a> for information on voluntary withdrawal of the Scheme applications.</p>

<p>If there is any doubt regarding the customer’s verbal consent or understanding of the terms and conditions, consider what further action (if any) may be required before granting the loan. This may include speaking with the customer’s partner or correspondence nominee, seeking policy advice, or giving consideration to whether elder abuse may be a factor. For guidance on the assessment of elder abuse see <a href="../older-australians/065-08020010-01.html">Assessing Home Equity Access Scheme applications</a>.</p>
