a regular working pattern. For example&#58;</li>

the business closes each year for a set time</li>
			<li>
meat workers and seasonal workers </li>		</ul>
		<li>
them losing their job </li>
		<li>
an illness or injury</li>

<p>Suggested questions to ask the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
'What are your plans about getting more work?'</li>
		<li>
'Is this a temporary shutdown period for your workplace?'</li>
		<li>
'Will your overall income for the year be similar to what is currently being used in your assessment?'</li>
		<li>
'Are you confident that you will find work fairly easily?'</li>
		</ul>
<p>Staff must make sure the customer <a href="../separated-parents/277-07040030-03.html#bp03_tbl_The_estimate_pr_Step06">understands the impact of annualising</a> if they choose to estimate their income when the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
is not working due to a regular earning pattern, or</li>
		<li>
is confident they will find work quickly</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where the customer is not working, or has lost income due to work injury&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
It may mean future job prospects are unclear and they cannot meet current child support assessment</li>
		<li>
An estimate in most cases is the best option</li>
		</ul>
<p>Staff must&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
explain how the estimate process works, and how it may affect them. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-07040030-01.html#bp01_L3TT_The_estimate_pr">Table 2</a></li>
		<li>
explore all options with the customer, e.g. Agreement, COA, PSI</li>

<p><strong>Question&#58;</strong> What do you mean if my income drops you will not backdate my estimate?</p>
		<ul>		<li>
This question is usually in response to Rights and Obligations. Staff can include an explanation  while discussing the Rights and Obligations to help the customer understand</li>
		<li>
If the customer insists on a reference that supports the decision, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-07040030-04.html">the Child Support Guide 2.5.1&#58; Income estimates for a year of income</a></li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Response&#58;</strong> 'When you estimate your income you are taking responsibility for the income we use in your assessment. This means that you need to keep us informed of any changes to your income when they happen. If you do not tell us when your income drops, in most cases, we can’t give effect to your estimate from an earlier date.</p>

<p>There are very clear incentives in the scheme that encourage and support customers to contact us as soon as possible when their circumstances change. This is because the child support scheme must strike a balance between giving you the opportunity to have your assessment based on your capacity to pay and to minimise the potential for the children to be unfavourably affected.</p>

<p>Estimates are very good examples of this.</p>

<p>If paying parent&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If your income goes down and there is a delay in advising us, it would not be practical to then expect the other party to have a reduction in child support or to pay money back because the money would have already been spent on the children’s needs. To require the parent to then pay that money back would potentially place the children in a position of undue hardship.'</li>
		</ul>
<p>If receiving parent&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If your income goes down and there is a delay in advising us, it would not be fair to other party to have an unexpected increase in child support for a previous period.</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Question&#58;</strong> If my income increases, will you backdate my estimate?</p>

<p><strong>Response&#58;</strong> </p>

<p>If paying parent&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
 'If your income increases, it is equally important to tell us straight away to avoid owing additional child support because we will calculate your assessment from the date your income increased. When your income goes up there is arguably a greater need to advise us to ensure that your children receive the right amount of child support and avoid any additional child support to be paid at a later date.'</li>

<p><strong>Question&#58;</strong> Why does Child Support use my gross income and not my net income?</p>

Your taxable income is the amount that you will be paying tax on after you have deducted any allowable deductions; put simply, it is your gross income minus any allowable deductions.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58;</strong> Can I over-estimate my income?</p>

<p><strong>Response&#58;</strong> 'I understand why you want to over-estimate your income just to cover yourself, however it is important to understand that at the end of the financial year when we reconcile your estimate, we will not replace your estimate with the lower amount of your actual ATI. This means that if you have paid more child support than you otherwise would have needed to throughout the year, you will not be entitled to any refund.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58;</strong> Can I estimate my income for time off over Christmas (or) between contracts (or) between seasons?</p>

'Is this time off without pay something that happens to you every year or part of your regular earning pattern?' </li>
			<ul>			<li>
<strong>Yes</strong> - 'As your pattern of earning hasn’t actually changed, it is unlikely that your income this year will be different from prior years.

Just like you factor in other bills such as mortgage, rent, electricity and so on you will need to factor in your child support obligations during the time that you are not working.'  </li>
			<li>
 <strong>No</strong> - 'When you estimate your income we need to factor in any income and deductions between today’s date and the end of the financial year.

<p><strong>Response&#58;</strong> 'In the letter we send to you, we will include details about your income such as your employer’s name, deduction amounts and details of income from other sources. It is important that you check this information and call us if there are any discrepancies. The letter will also include your year to date income amount.</p>

<p>We will also send you a new assessment notice including how much child support you will now have to pay or receive.

<p>The letter will also advise the other parent of their right to object to our decision to accept your estimate if they think the amount is not accurate or that we have made an error, so please hold on to all of your paperwork.'</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58;</strong> What is adjusted taxable income?</p>

<p><strong>Response&#58;</strong> 'Your <a href="../separated-parents/277-07040030-04.html">Adjusted Taxable Income (ATI)</a> is used to calculate your assessments. It is the total of your&#58;</p>

		<ul>		<li>
<strong>reportable fringe benefits</strong> total for that year of income</li>
		<li>

		<li>

		<li>
the total of <strong>the tax free pensions or benefits</strong> received in that year of income</li>
		<li>
<strong>reportable superannuation contributions</strong></li>
		</ul>
<p>At the end of the financial year, your estimated income should match your tax return plus any other income that is included for child support purposes, i.e. your adjusted taxable income. What this means is that the amount you have estimated today should add up to your actual adjusted taxable income for the whole year minus the year to date amount that you have provided. Based on your information, we are expecting the adjusted taxable income to come in at $XXX. Does that sound right?'</p>

<p><strong>Response for subsequent estimates</strong></p>

<p><strong>Question&#58;</strong> Why are tax free pensions and benefits included for Child Support purposes?</p>
		<ul>		<li>
There are 3 examples of possible answers</li>
		<li>
Choose the most appropriate to suit the customer</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Response&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
'With the reforms made to the Child Support Scheme in July 2008, a broader range of incomes, for both parents of the child/ren of the case, was included to work out the child support payments. Some tax free pensions or benefits are now included. </li>
		<li>
Child support payments are calculated using an adjusted taxable income which is your taxable income + some other income components. In July 2008, a new child support scheme was introduced and the types of income amounts used were expanded to include some tax free pensions or benefits.</li>
		<li>
Over time, the types of income used to work out child support payments were expanded to include Reportable Fringe Benefits, Target Foreign Income, Property and other investment losses, some tax free pensions or benefits and more recently Reportable Superannuation Contributions.'</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Detailed explanation&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
'Including these income payments in the calculation of adjusted taxable income recognises that, although many parents who receive these payments may not be able to work at all, some have a capacity to contribute to the costs of their children, and these resources should therefore be included in their available income.</li>
		<li>
It is only included in a person’s adjusted taxable income to the extent that it is exempt from tax and is not a payment by way of bereavement payment, pharmaceutical allowance, rent assistance, language, literacy and numeracy supplement or remote area allowance. This mirrors the extent to which these payments are treated as income in the family assistance law.'</li>		</ul>

<p><strong>Question&#58;</strong> Can you explain what RFBT is?</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58;</strong> Can you explain a Rental property loss?</p>

<p><strong>Response&#58;</strong> 'Whilst the ATO allows taxpayers to legitimately reduce their taxable income by claiming their rental property losses as a tax deduction, for child support purposes we add this income back on to a parent’s taxable income. In order to calculate your rental property losses, you need to know the total gross income you receive from the rental property less any expenses you have relating to the rental property such as interest, repairs, agent fees etc. You may need to speak with an accountant for assistance in calculating this.'</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58;</strong> What happens if I overstate my Rental Loss? </p>

<p><strong>Response&#58;</strong> This response is only for customers where their taxable income is greater than or equal to zero&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
'It is important that we get this figure right as it may result in you paying too little or too much child support.  While rental losses are a legitimate way of reducing your taxable income, rental losses do not reduce your income for child support purposes (i.e. they are added back in). This means that even if your taxable income is reduced by an overstated rental loss amount, your income for child support will be unaffected as the rental loss amount will be added back in full.'</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Question&#58;</strong> 'Can you explain how adjusted taxable income is calculated where there is a rental loss and my taxable income is zero? </p>

<p><strong>Response&#58;</strong> This response is only for customers where their taxable income is zero but their losses exceed all other income&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
'For child support purposes, rental losses are added back to your taxable income. As the (year to date) or (estimated taxable income) you have provided is zero and you have also advised that you expect to have a rental loss during the estimated period, we will add the amount of the rental loss back to the zero income. This means your (year to date or estimate) for child support purposes is $(amount of the rental loss).'</li>		</ul>
