<p>The CDP job seeker's circumstances should be considered when determining if they are required to re-engage with their provider.</p>

<p>When a CDP job seeker has a provider appointment scheduled in the Online Diary within the next 2 working days, the re-engagement code 'RNX No re-engagement - has appointment in the next 2 days' is automatically recorded by the system.</p>

<p>Re-engagement is required when all other circumstances allow re-engagement and the CDP job seeker is able to attend an appointment within the next 28 calendar days.</p>

<p>Re-engagement is not required if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the failure is rejected as invalid prior to contacting the CDP job seeker</li>
		<li>
an Online Diary HTTP socket error occurs when the appointment is booked</li>
		<li>
an appointment cannot be arranged within 28 calendar days due to circumstances outside the CDP job seeker's control or</li>
		<li>
the CDP job seeker&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
has transferred to another payment that does not have mutual obligation requirements</li>
			<li>
is deemed to have self re-engaged</li>
			<li>
does not have a current provider as they have recently moved address</li>
			<li>
has transferred to another type of provider (that is, jobactive or Disability Employment Services (DES))</li>
			<li>
is yet to attend their first (initial) appointment with their CDP provider. These CDP job seekers will be issued with a new appointment notice by the provider</li>
			<li>
cannot be re-engaged for the failure as there is another outstanding compliance action on their record, including an outstanding NAR</li>
			<li>
has just been re-engaged to the same organisation for another failure. When multiple failures are investigated the CDP job seeker should only be re-engaged for the first failure investigated. For all other failures investigated on the same day, record 'No re-engagement already reconnected same provider'</li>

<p>When a Non-Attendance Report (NAR) has been submitted the CDP provider is responsible for re-engagement. Services Australia will not schedule a re-engagement appointment with the provider when investigating a non-attendance failure or reconnection failure that has been generated by a Provider Appointment Report (PAR). Service Officers are required to support re-engagement by reinforcing the importance of attending the appointment the CDP job seeker's provider has scheduled.</p>

<p>For all other failures, when Services Australia has made the decision that re-engagement is not required, this must be recorded in the <strong>Participation Compliance</strong> workflow.</p>

<p>On the <strong>Re-engagement</strong> screen in the Participation Compliance workflow&#58;</p>

		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the failure is rejected, the workflow may automatically update the above fields on the <strong>Re-engagement</strong> screen.</p>

<p>When a 'no re-engagement' reason is recorded for a failure, the system will automatically update the re-engagement requirements for all previous failures in the same failure sequence.</p>

<p>If the compliance action cannot be completed in the workflow, the 'no re-engagement' reason should be recorded.</p>

<p>The <a href="../job-seekers/001-10090020-05.html">Resources</a> page contains more information.</p>

<p>If the CDP job seeker's payment is suspended 'DNA participation appt or activity' it should be restored on the Benefit Action (<strong>BA</strong>) screen after completing the compliance action.</p>

Does the CDP job seeker need to be re-engaged? <strong>Yes</strong></li>
		<li>
Select the Online Diary button</li>

<p>When the Online Diary is accessed the following will be presented&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Available appointments in the next 2 business days (with no option to search for or book appointments more than 2 days in the future), or</li>

If no appointments are available in the next 2 days, available appointments in the next 28 days will display (if these are available), or</li>

<p>In circumstances when it would be appropriate to book an appointment outside of 2 days but the CDP job seeker does not have the capacity to attend any appointment available in the Online Diary, they are exempt from the reconnection requirement. A 'no re-engagement' outcome must be recorded on the <strong>Re-engagement</strong> screen. This may occur, for example, when a CDP job seeker is working and cannot attend the appointments available in the next 2 days, and no further appointments are displayed in the Online Diary. If suitable appointments are available outside of 2 working days, the next available suitable appointment should be booked.</p>

<p>If this is not possible, the next available suitable appointment should be booked.</p>

<p>If the CDP job seeker is serving a reconnection penalty period and they have an acceptable reason for their reconnection requirement to be rescheduled then the penalty period can be ended however the CDP job seeker will still be required to re-engage if their reasonable excuse does not prevent them from doing so.</p>

<p>If the <strong>Reschedule participation appointment</strong> workflow is not available and the reconnection failure period needs to be ended immediately to allow payment to be issued to the CDP job seeker then it will be necessary to end the outstanding re-engagement requirement and reconnection failure period via the <strong>Participation Compliance</strong> workflow (if available). See <a href="../job-seekers/001-10090020-05.html">Resources</a> for manual action if workflow is not available.</p>

<p>For further information, see <a href="../job-seekers/001-10090050-01.html">Finalising re-engagement requirements</a>.</p>
