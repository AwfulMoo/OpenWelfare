<p>In all other cases, if a customer has indicated their overseas travel meets the initial criteria for an approved reason, the case must be referred to Centrelink International Services (CIS) to assess entitlement and code the departure, as only designated staff within CIS have the delegation to complete the assessment.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>If an ABSTUDY student or Australian Apprentice leaves Australia temporarily, payment may continue if they are absent for an approved reason only and for a specific negotiated period&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
for a temporary absence of any length (but unlikely to be more than a few weeks) to attend a training camp with Australian Defence Force Reserves</li>
		<li>
for a specific negotiated period (not more than 6 weeks)&#58;</li>

<p>Customers will be activity test exempt while absent for these reasons. The allowable absence reasons are subject to very specific guidelines.</p>

<p>ABSTUDY is only portable overseas if travelling for an approved reason as listed above. It is not portable for general portability such as a holiday etc.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> ABSTUDY may also continue outside Australia for the duration of approved overseas study or work. Further information is below.</p>

<p>Before making a decision about whether ABSTUDY can be paid for overseas study or work, determine if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
students continue to satisfy the ABSTUDY student qualification criteria</li>
		<li>
Australian Apprentices continue to have a current Commonwealth Registration Number</li>
		<li>
the overseas study (including work placement) or work will contribute to, and be credited towards, a full-time course or apprenticeship in Australia</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> do <strong>not</strong> refer these cases to CIS.</p>

<p>The customer must&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
advise their date of departure from Australia, and return date (if known), and</li>
		<li>
provide written advice from their Australian educational institution or State Training Authority confirming proof of the reason for their absence</li>
		</ul>
<p>Generally, a customer who is <strong>studying externally</strong> (for example, by correspondence or online) will not need to attend a campus overseas to complete units of their approved course. However, external students can access extended portability under overseas study provisions if they can demonstrate their primary reason for going overseas is to undertake studies that form part of the course. This could be a residential component at an overseas institution or an overseas work placement provided it is part of the Australian course.</p>

<p>A student or Australian Apprentice granted portability for overseas study or work can continue to receive ABSTUDY for the duration of the approved absence. The approved period may include additional travel time to allow them to prepare for the study/work and/or to finalise their affairs and return to Australia.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Portability_period">Portability period</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A customer's portability period starts on the day they leave Australia. For portability purposes, a customer is not considered to be inside Australia for any part of the day they departed Australia regardless of the time of departure. If the customer is <a target="_blank" href="../initial-contact-general/106-23053114-03.html">travelling outside Australia on a cruise</a>, the date of departure is the date the ship leaves the last Australian port.</p>

<p>The day a customer returns to Australia is not included as part of their absence as they are considered to be inside Australia on that day (regardless of the time of return) and therefore no longer affected by portability. If they leave and return on the same day, for example airline crew, this is not considered a departure from Australia for portability purposes.</p>

<p><strong>Customer advises change of departure or return date</strong></p>

<p>If a customer travelling for an approved reason advises they are departing on a specific date, and they then depart Australia <strong>more than 3 days before or more than 3 days after</strong> the advised date, any specific negotiated period of portability approved for the original date of departure will cease to apply. The customer's approved reason for travel outside Australia may no longer be valid. Payments will stop when the customer's actual date of departure is confirmed by the Immigration Datalink.</p>

<p>Customers must advise of any change in their departure details prior to travel if they wish to be paid during the absence. Service Officers can assess if the approved reason still applies and record the new departure date and reason again.</p>

<p>The <strong>return rule</strong> for ABSTUDY means where a customer has been granted an approved overseas study absence, a brief return to Australia (up to 6 weeks) within the approved study period does not interrupt the portability period for the course of study overseas. No new decision is required in such cases.</p>

<p>However, if a student or Australian Apprentice studying or working overseas decides to extend the length of their overseas course (for example, wants to continue studying overseas for an extra semester) the customer must apply to have their payment continue and provide new supporting evidence.</p>

<p>For approved reasons other than overseas study, customers who are unable to return to Australia by the end of the specific negotiated period must contact CIS or their payment will stop. If more time overseas is required, this can be discussed and any approved absence possibly extended up to the maximum portability period. If they are still required overseas at the end of the maximum portability period, there is <a href="../australians-overseas/061-01050000-01.html">discretion to extend the period of portability</a> under certain circumstances.</p>

<p>Any change to the length of an absence for an approved reason must be referred to Centrelink International Services (CIS) for further assessment and coding.</p>

<p>The Department of Home Affairs will generally advise Services Australia when a customer leaves or returns to Australia. The system assesses portability of the payment, regardless of whether the customer notified or not. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> Department of Home Affairs datalink activities should not be cancelled.</p>

<p>Services Australia uses the date of departure or arrival provided by the Department of Home Affairs. If adversely affected, the customer can provide evidence of alternative dates. The agency must consider applying the alternative dates, if it is reasonable and results in a beneficial outcome for the customer.</p>

<p>In many cases, customers do <strong>not</strong> have to advise the agency they are leaving Australia temporarily or have returned from a temporary absence.</p>

<p>However, there are particular situations where customers must advise of a departure prior to leaving Australia or contact when they have returned to Australia.</p>

<p><img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> In most cases, customers can notify of their departure from Australia via the <a href="../self-service/133-04150030-01.html">Travelling outside of Australia service</a> within their Centrelink online account. If a customer's circumstances are more complex, the system will prompt them to contact the agency.</p>
