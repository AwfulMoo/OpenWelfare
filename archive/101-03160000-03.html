<p>There can be various reasons why a customer is no longer eligible for ParentsNext at the time of their scheduled appointment including the cancellation of their Parenting Payment (PP). ParentsNext Service Officers do not need to investigate or resolve the cancellation of payment, unless the cancellation is for the reason of Failed to Report (FRP).</p>

<p>This failure results in a ParentsNext appointment being correctly booked for a compulsory ParentsNext participant however, the record incorrectly displays as ineligible when the appointment falls due.

Customers do not need to look for work as part of the ParentsNext program</li>

Customers need to participate in ParentsNext as a condition of receiving Parenting Payment</li>

Any Parenting Payment customer with a child under 6 years of age can volunteer to participate in the program</li>

Requirements to report to Centrelink and how to do this online</li>

<p>Tell the customer the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Today we will be talking about the ParentsNext program</li>
		<li>
Depending on your circumstances, some parents and carers need to participate in the ParentsNext program as a compulsory participant. However, any Parenting Payment customer with a child under 6 years of age can volunteer into the program and receive the same benefits as a compulsory participant</li>
		<li>
You do not have to look for work as part of the ParentsNext program. It is a program to help you prepare for getting a job when your youngest child goes to school - or sooner if that is what you want. Your ParentsNext provider will help you to think about your future and what you hope to achieve</li>
		<li>
A ParentsNext brochure was included with your appointment letter. If you didn't read it, that's ok, you can go back and look at it any time, but I'll summarise the information for you</li>
		<li>
ParentsNext is for parents and carers who&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
have a youngest child who is at least 9 months and under 6 years of age, </li>
			<li>
haven't declared paid work to Centrelink in the last 6 months, and </li>
			<li>
have been getting Parenting Payment for the last 6 months </li>		</ul>
		<li>
ParentsNext supports parents and carers in lots of different ways. Some examples of support available are&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
help finding a training course or work experience</li>
			<li>
putting you in touch with other parents and carers</li>
			<li>
connecting you with local services such as counselling, financial advice, health, housing and domestic and family violence support</li>
			<li>
Although you do not need to look for work your provider will help with work readiness skills – like writing resumes and job interview practice</li>			</ul>			</ul>

<p>A customer's selection into ParentsNext is determined by the information on their record at the time of the eligibility assessment.
