Family Tax Benefit (FTB) customers who are under 18 can claim by telephone or a service centre. They need to have a discussion either over the phone or in person before applying to make sure consideration has been taken regarding the impacts/risks or an advance payment</li>

Weekly payment customers can apply via telephone or at a service centre but cannot use self service channels</li>
		<li>
Independent customers under 18 years of age are considered 'at risk' customers and must have a face-to-face interview when applying for an advance (except if rural and/or remote).

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Customers <strong>must</strong> be advised of how often they can be paid an advance, so they have a chance to change the amount before any advance being finalised.</p>

<p>Non-pension customers can receive one advance payment in any 12 month period regardless of the amount granted. <strong>Exception</strong>&#58; Parenting Payment Single (PPS) customers who apply for an advance payment within 28 days of becoming single may receive an advance payment regardless of when they last received an advance payment. They must meet all other qualification requirements.</p>

<p>A customer who receives an advance payment of any amount between $250 and $500 will not be eligible for another standard advance payment for a full 12 months. The customer must be advised of this before the advance is finalised so they have the option to increase the amount taken, if they wish. However, the customer may be eligible for another type of advance, for example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Family Tax Benefit Advance</li>
		<li>
Special Employment Advance</li>
		<li>
Mobility Allowance Advance</li>
		<li>
Pharmaceutical Allowance Advance</li>

<p>Customers who transitioned to Jobseeker Payment (JSP) will have any advances granted in the previous 12 months included when determining their eligibility to an advance. This means, if the customer was granted an advance before 20 March 2020, they will not be eligible for a new advance payment for 12 months from the date of that advance payment.</p>

<p>For non-pension customers, the <strong>minimum</strong> advance payment payable is <strong>$250</strong>, this is the minimum amount set by legislation. If a customer applies for less than $250 or they are not entitled to receive more than $250, the application for the advance payment will be rejected.</p>

<p>The <strong>maximum</strong> advance payment payable is the <strong>smaller</strong> of&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the amount requested by the customer (up to <strong>$500</strong>), or</li>
		<li>
the percentage of the customer's annual rate of payment worked out below (up to $500). <strong>Note&#58;</strong> for customers of Age Pension age receiving a non-pension payment that attracts the Pension Supplement, the rate of payment used to determine their advance payment amount includes the full Pension Supplement and Clean Energy Supplement (CES) unless the minimum Pension Supplement and CES is taken as a quarterly payment</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Parenting Payment Single (PPS) customers - 6% of their annual payment rate</li>
			<li>
Widow Allowance (WA) customers - 6% of their fortnightly payment rate x 26</li>
			<li>
JobSeeker Payment (JSP), YA, PP partnered, ABSTUDY and Austudy customers - 7% of their fortnightly payment rate x 26</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>The fortnightly payment rate used in calculating advance payment entitlement is 14 x the daily rate paid to the customer on their last Entitlement Period End Date (EPED) before they applied for the advance payment.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the amount the person was paid on their last payday was nil (this can include having a benefit status of CZR - current at zero rate), the customer will not qualify for the advance payment</li>
		<li>
If the amount of their payment is reduced because of income, the amount they may be eligible for will be less than $500</li>
		</ul>
<p>If this occurs, the customer may decide to withdraw their application and reapply after they receive their next payment, which will be paid at a higher daily rate. The fortnightly rate amount includes any Rent Assistance (RA), Pharmaceutical Allowance (PhA) and CES payable and the application of income and parental means tests.</p>

<p>Before an amount is determined, the agency must also make sure the customer is able to meet the repayments without being placed in financial hardship. See Amount of advance payment based on affordability, below.</p>

<p>An advance payment can only be granted if the customer can afford to repay the advance without being placed in financial hardship. For this reason, the agency will only offer an amount the customer can afford, determined by the amount the customer states they can afford to repay each fortnight.</p>

<p>For example, if a customer states they have $30 left over each fortnight they will only be offered an amount equal to 13 times this amount even though they may have otherwise been eligible for a higher amount.</p>

<p>If a reduced or suspended repayment arrangement is in place for an existing advance (for example, FTB), this should be reviewed before any new advance is assessed. If the repayments on the existing advance cannot be returned to the standard rate without causing financial hardship, then a further advance should not be granted.</p>
