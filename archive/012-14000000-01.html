<p>This document outlines the MI schemes.</p>

<h2 id="Government intent">Government intent</h2>


<p>The Medical Indemnity Act 2002 (the Act) was introduced to strengthen the availability of medical services in Australia. The legislation provides a financial assistance package which helps keep MI insurance premiums at an affordable level by providing financial support to Medical Indemnity Insurers (MII) and Medical Defence Organisations (MDO).</p>

<p>Participating MIIs and MDOs can request a payment under the following 6 MI schemes, which are administered by Services Australia&#58;</p>		<ul>		<li>

High Cost Claim Indemnity Scheme (HCCS)</li>		<li>

Allied Health High Cost Claim Indemnity Scheme (AHHCCS)</li>		<li>

Run-Off Cover Indemnity Scheme (ROCS)</li>		<li>

Incurred But Not Reported Indemnity Scheme (IBNR)</li>		<li>

Exceptional Claims Indemnity Scheme (ECS)</li>		<li>

Allied Health Exceptional Claims Indemnity Scheme (AHECS)</li>		</ul>

<p>More information is available on Services Australia website. See the <a>Resources</a> page for links to these websites.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_HCCS01">HCCS</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>HCCS is set out in legislation that commenced on 1 January 2003 to remedy the upward pressure on MI premiums by reducing the large cost of claims on MIIs and MDOs. The HCCS is funded by the government, which pays 50% of out of pocket costs by MIIs and MDOs that are greater than the applicable HCCS threshold amount, up to the limit of a medical practitioner’s or Allied Health professional’s indemnity cover. Funding is provided by the Department of Health and Aged Care via a sweeping account arrangement.</p>

<p>In order for a claim to be eligible under the HCCS, it must reach a threshold that depends on the date the insurer was first notified of the claim. The 4 thresholds are&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
$2 million for claims notified between 1 January 2003 and 21 October 2003</li>
		<li>
$500,000 for claims notified between 22 October 2003 and 31 December 2003</li>
		<li>
$300,000 for claims notified between 1 January 2004 and 30 June 2018</li>
		<li>
$500,000 for claims notified on or after 1 July 2018</li>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_ROCS">ROCS</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>ROCS is set out in legislation that commenced on 1 July 2004 to remove the need for medical practitioners to fund their own run-off cover when they have left the private medical workforce. It also provides a guarantee that the cost of MI claims covered by the scheme will be funded. Under ROCS, the government covers the full cost of eligible claims (100%). In addition, the MIIs and MDOs can claim a handling fee (5%) of the amount being claimed. ROCS is directly funded through contributions collected under ROCS Support Payments, which is a payment by MIIs based on a proportion of each medical practitioner’s insurance premium collected annually through a contribution year. Prior to ROCS, medical practitioners needed to purchase death, disablement, and retirement run-off cover from MDOs when the medical practitioner stopped practising.</p>

<p>IBNR assists eligible an MDO by funding medical insurance payouts in specified circumstances and covers claims for incidents that took place before 30 June 2002. Under IBNR, the government covers the full costs of eligible claims (100%) from MDOs that do not have adequate reserves to cover their liabilities. In addition, MDOs can claim a handling fee (5%) of the amount being claimed. Funding is provided by the Department of Health and Aged Care via a sweeping account arrangement.</p>

<p>ECS is designed to protect medical practitioners against personal liability for eligible claims that exceed the level of their insurance cover. Funding is provided by the Department of Health and Aged Care via a sweeping account arrangement.</p>

<p>The ECS covers incidents that are notified on or after 1 January 2003. A claim can be for a single incident or for a series of related incidents.</p>

<p>To determine whether the medical practitioner’s contract limit equals or exceeds the relevant threshold, the relevant threshold is, if the MIIs was first notified of the claim, or of facts that might give rise to the claim. The thresholds are&#58; </p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>In Australia, it is a mandatory requirement for registered healthcare practitioners to hold the appropriate medical indemnity insurance for healthcare practice in Australia.</p>

<p>Medical indemnity insurance plays a vital role within the Australian health system by working to protect both healthcare practitioners and patients in the event of an adverse incident arising from medical care. While Australia’s health system is generally very safe, things occasionally go wrong and patients may sometimes be harmed in the process of receiving medical care.</p>

<p>MDO were originally set up by doctors over 100 years ago to deal with legal and ethical aspects of medical practice, such as negligence. They were established as friendly societies and mutual funds, which were owned by their members and provided indemnity to doctors on a discretionary basis. </p>

<p>The role of MDOs has grown and changed over the past century. They are now large organisations, with a high degree of experience in medical and legal issues.</p>

<p>Since July 2003, medical indemnity must be provided via an insurance contract. Medical Indemnity Insurers (MIIs) are required to meet the same prudential standards as general insurance companies and are regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (APRA). This provides a high level of security for consumers and doctors.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The payment schedule for MI is legislated in the Act.</p>

<p>For eligible MI applications submitted under HCCS, ROCS and IBNR, the payment requirements are legislated under section 37 of the Act. The Act states that payments must be made to the insurer before the end of the month immediately following the month in which the application was received.</p>

<p>The only exception is where a request for additional information has been sent to the MII or MDO under section 38 of the Act. The delegate must give the person/MII/MDO at least a minimum of 28 days to respond to the request for information. In this case, the payment must be made before the end of the month that immediately follows the month in which the requested information is provided and the claim meets the eligibility criteria.</p>

<p>For claims submitted under the ECS, payment requirements are legislated under Section 37B of the Act. See the <a href="../health-professionals/012-14000000-04.html">References</a> page for a link.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>If an insurer would like to dispute the delegate’s decision in relation to an application for payment under the medical indemnity claim scheme, Services Australia will take all necessary steps to resolve the dispute informally with the relevant Medical Defence Organisation (MDO) or Medical Indemnity Insurer (MII).</p>

<p>If a satisfactory resolution cannot be reached through an informal process, the applicant may elect to request a review of decision. The request will be in writing and should set out the details of the dispute. </p>

<p>It is recommend that the person selected to undertake the review is at the EL2 or above at the SES level and is provided all the documentation supplied with the application to allow the person to undertake a full assessment of the matter. The delegate who made the original decision should not undertake the review. However, if the Medical Indemnity Insurer (MII) or Medical Defence Organisation (MDO) provides new information, the delegate can reassess the decision. However, if the original decision does not change, the matter should be provided to the relevant SES band 1 or above for the review. The internal review is an administrative service that Services Australia provides to MDOs and MIIs. It is not set out in the Medical Indemnity Act 2002 or in other legislation. Services Australia will acknowledge receipt of the request for review within 28 days of the request being received.</p>
