<p>Any new or existing Centrepay, RDS or any other Centrelink deductions or withholdings for participants will continue to be paid as per normal processing. All Centrelink deductions and withholdings will reduce the CDC participant's restricted portion of funds initially. If the total deductions/withholdings exceed the restricted percentage for that payment, then the unrestricted funds (cash component) will then be reduced.</p>

<p>Example&#58; If a participant has 90% of their payment going out as deductions or withholdings (for example, Centrepay, Rent Deduction Scheme, Debt Withholdings and advance recoveries), this will be drawn from their restricted portion (80%), and the remaining 10% will be drawn from their unrestricted (cash) portion of funds. In this case, no funds will be paid to the restricted (CDC) account.</p>

<p>There is no change to Centrepay recoveries or processes for Centrepay funds returned by Third Party Organisations. These funds do not need to be compulsorily paid onto the participant's CDC if recovered or returned.</p>

<p>Customers are triggered onto the CDC when their permanent home address (or term address if a full-time student) is in a CDC location. Some participants may advise they were only in the area temporarily or they moved before the CDC location determination date.</p>

		<li>
update the address as <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-03010010-01.html">per normal processes</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>The CDC Processing Team will assess whether the participant can be exited from the CDC, taking into account address history and ties to the area, and apply correct exit coding to the record (see <a href="../payment-delivery/103-03150030-01.html">Ending Cashless Debit Card (CDC) participation</a>).</p>

<p>In circumstances where there is doubt over when the change of address occurred or if the new address details are correct, then the participant may be asked to provide additional evidence.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> updating or deleting home address details for the purposes of circumventing the CDC will not automatically exit a participant. Address updates done incorrectly in an effort to avoid the CDC may result in placing the participant at risk of overpayment for additional payments such as Rent Assistance or Remote Area Allowance. Service Officers must not update addresses for the purposes of exiting a CDC participant without an initial discussion with the CDC Processing Team.</p>

<p>Participants may request an explanation or apply for a formal review of the decision to be placed onto the CDC. Under social security law, the following Services Australia elements of the CDC are reviewable&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The decision to be exited from the CDC</li>
		<li>
The agency's application of the CDC</li>
		<li>
Payment limit requests</li>
		<li>
Wellbeing determinations</li>
		</ul>
<p>If a participant wants to request an explanation or apply for a formal review of the decision, the usual <a href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/109-03000000-01.html">review and appeal</a> process applies. When recording a request for an explanation or an application for a formal review, use region code '<strong>CDT</strong>' and under the <strong>Payment type the decision has been made against</strong> tab, enter '<strong>IQN</strong>' (Income Quarantining). This will correctly refer request for an explanation to the CDC Processing Team, who are the Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) for the CDC. See <a href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/109-02000000-01.html">Request for an explanation or application for a formal review</a>.</p>

<p>If the participant is disputing that, their usual place of residence was not in a CDC area, staff should discuss this with the CDC Processing Team. It may be more appropriate to correct an error before a formal review is considered.</p>

<p>Customers who volunteer to transition from IM to the CDC in the NT cannot request a formal review.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a participant does not agree with a decision to be placed on the CDC made by the FRC, a State or Territory Child Protection Authority, or a Supporting People at Risk approved referring authority, the referring authority is responsible for reviewing the decision to exit the participant from the CDC program (Cape York or NT participants only).</p>

<p>The card looks and operates like a normal bank card, except that it cannot be used to buy alcohol, gamble or withdraw cash.</p>

<p>The card can be used at most merchants with EFTPOS facilities nationwide, except merchants where the main business is the sale of alcohol or gambling services.</p>

<p>Merchants in CDC areas that are mixed businesses selling alcohol products or gambling services, in addition to other products or services, may be eligible to accept the card if they can demonstrate they can prevent the sale of excluded items. Merchants can contact the relevant card issuer for further information.</p>

<p>If a participant contacts to advise they are unable to make a purchase online or at a merchant that accepts visa and EFTPOS facilities, Service Officers should&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Ensure the participant is using the card correctly if at a merchant (correct PIN, available funds)</li>
		<li>
Check the card issuer's website to ensure they are not listed as a blocked merchant</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the merchant is not listed as blocked and the participant has made several attempts to use their card and it appears to be card issuer related not merchant related, a referral can be made to the CDC Processing Team for follow up with DSS and the card issuer.</p>

<p>If the request is urgent (participant is currently at a merchant) the Service Officer can call the CDC Processing Team directly or warm transfer the participant to the CDC Processing team. </p>

<p>The CDC Processing Team can approve Housing and Other Expense Limit increases for expenses such as housing, utilities, education, and medical services that cannot be paid via the CDC. These limit increases will enable the participant to pay these expenses directly from their CDC account. See <a href="../payment-delivery/103-20021909-01.html">Housing and Other Expense Limits for Cashless Debit Card (CDC) customers</a>.</p>

<p>Any new or existing Centrepay or Rent Deduction Scheme expenses will be made from the participant's restricted amount initially. The unrestricted (cash) portion will only be reduced if the total deductions and withholdings exceed the restricted percentage for that payment.</p>

<p>If an instalment of a restrictable payment is payable to a CDC participant or voluntary participant, the percentage differs depending on their location&#58;</p>

<p><strong>CDC locations of Ceduna, East Kimberley, Goldfields and Bundaberg and Hervey Bay</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
80% of the gross amount of the restrictable payment is restricted (the restricted portion) and placed on the CDC</li>
		<li>
20% of the gross amount of the payment is unrestricted (the unrestricted portion) and delivered to the participant's normal bank account</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Cape York</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
60%, 75% or 90% of the gross amount of the restrictable payment is restricted (the restricted portion) and placed on the CDC</li>
		<li>
the remaining 40%, 25% or 10% of the gross amount of the payment is unrestricted (the unrestricted portion) and delivered to the participant's normal bank account</li>
		<li>
The percentage is determined by the FRC</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Northern Territory</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
50% of the gross amount of the restrictable payment is restricted (the restricted portion) and placed on the CDC</li>
		<li>
50% of the gross amount of the payment is unrestricted (the unrestricted portion) and delivered to the participant's normal bank account</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58; </strong>this percentage will be subject to the participant's previous IM measure. If a participant had a higher quarantined percentage, this percentage is applied to the CDC when the participant transitions.</p>

<p>100% of any eligible lump sums and arrears payments (including advance payments) will also be restricted and sent to the participant's CDC.</p>

<p>Crisis Payments, Hardship Advances and Urgent Payments, as well as the Australian Government Disaster Relief Payment (AGDRP) are not restrictable payments, and are paid to the participant's regular bank account by default (unless otherwise requested by the participant).</p>

<p>The restricted and unrestricted portions for instalment (regular) payments is calculated after the income and assets tests are applied for that fortnight.</p>

<p>Any regular withholdings or deductions, including Centrepay, Rent Deduction Scheme, child support, Advance Payment repayments, penalties and tax deductions will continue to be paid as normal, and will initially reduce the restricted portion.</p>

<p>The unrestricted portion (cash component) will only be reduced if the total of all Centrelink deductions exceeds the restricted percentage in the fortnight.</p>
