		<ul>		<li>
entered aged care prior to 1 January 2017</li>
		<li>

<p><strong>Question&#58; What if the home is sold within the 2 year exemption period?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Answer&#58;</strong> Notification must be within 14 days if the home is sold within the 2 year period, as the proceeds will be assessed under extended deeming. Customer is entitled to have their former principal home exempt from the income and assets test for up to 2 years if it was vacated due to customer’s care needs. If the home is sold during the 2 year exemption period, the proceeds of sale are immediately assessed as an asset and are subject to deeming.</p>

<p>The customer is assessed as a non-homeowner and the non-homeowner income and assets test will apply.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; What happens after the 2 year exemption period?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Answer&#58;</strong> The home will become an asset. A Module R - Real estate details (Mod R) will need to be completed.</p>

<p>The assessment should be based on the customer’s estimate of the value of the former home (and any other real estate item) until a valuation is obtained. Unless the delegate considers it warranted a valuation should only be obtained where total assets (including the customer’s estimate of real estate value) are within $20,000 of the allowable assets limit.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> overpayments should only be raised if a customer has deliberately misrepresented the details of the asset.</p>

<p>For more information about assessment of customers who vacated their home due to illness, see <a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-02090000-01.html">Vacation of home to enter care situation (INH) reviews</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; How does the accommodation charge exemption affect rental income?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Answer&#58;</strong> The rental income from the former home that would usually be assessed under Services Australia’s rules is exempt from the pension and benefit income tests and the means tested or income tested daily fee while the resident has a liability to pay an accommodation charge <strong>and</strong> entered aged care prior to 1 January 2017.</p>

<p>Customers do not need to establish that the rental income is used to pay the accommodation charge for the exemption to apply.</p>

<p>For the purpose of assessing a customer’s eligibility for the exemption of rental income, a home is the former home, if the resident left that home to enter a care situation.</p>

<p>This exemption also applies to the resident’s partner.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Why exempt the home under the accommodation charge exemption rule when my partner is still in the home?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Answer&#58;</strong> If the partner is still living in the principal home the customer is assessed as a homeowner and the home is exempt. The accommodation charge exemption rule benefits the couple if the partner decides to rent out a room. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> rental income does not have to be used to help pay the accommodation charge.</p>

<p>This rental income is exempt from the income test if the customer entered aged care prior to 1 January 2017, for both partners until the customer no longer meets the criteria for the exemption (for example, they no longer have to pay the accommodation charge).</p>

<p>6</p></td>
<td>

<p><strong>Question&#58; How does the accommodation bond periodic instalments or the Refundable Accommodation Deposit (RAD) in periodic instalments exemption affect rental income?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Answer&#58;</strong> The rental income from the former home that would usually be assessed under Services Australia’s rules is exempt from the pension and benefit income tests if the customer entered aged care prior to 1 January 2017, while the resident qualifies for an accommodation bond periodic instalments exemption.</p>

<p>Where a customer who entered aged care prior to 1 January 2017 is eligible for the accommodation bond periodic instalments exemption, the former home will also be eligible for the exemption of the rental income received from that home. Customers do not need to establish that the rental income is used to pay the accommodation bond periodic instalments for the exemption to apply.</p>

<p>For the purpose of assessing a customer’s eligibility for the exemption of rental income, a home is the former home, if the resident left that home to enter a care situation prior to 1 January 2017.</p>

<p>This exemption also applies to the resident’s partner.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; How does the rental income exemption apply to care recipients who entered permanent Residential Aged Care prior to 1 January 2016?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Answer&#58;</strong> Care recipients who entered permanent Residential Aged Care prior to 1 January 2016 and meet the following conditions&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
are renting their former principal home, and</li>
		<li>
paying their accommodation costs by either periodic payment or a combination of periodic and lump sum payment</li>
		</ul>
<p>will have all of the rental income from their former principal home excluded from the Aged Care Means Test Assessment.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the periodic payment includes the daily accommodation payment (DAP), daily accommodation contribution (DAC), or a periodic payment of a bond for residents who entered care before 1 July 2014.</p>

<p><strong>Partnered customers and determining rental income exemption</strong></p>

<p>Zane and Joy are partners and in receipt of Age Pension. On 5 December 2016, Zane entered permanent aged care. Zane is paying the accommodation fees periodically. Joy continues to reside in their home. Joy enters permanent aged care on 21 January 2017 and the former home commences to be rented. The rental income is net $26,000 pa.</p>

<p>Is Zane’s share of the rent exempt and Joy’s ($13,000) assessable?</p>

<p>Is Joy’s share of the income split and $6,500 affects Zane and $6,500 affects Joy?</p>

<p>Or is the $26,000 exempt income for both?</p>

<p>Exempt for both because Zane entered permanent aged care accommodation prior to 1 January 2017. This is because section 8(8) (zn) of the SSA 1991 states while a person is accruing a liability to pay an accommodation charge -any rent from the person’s principal home that the person, or the person’s partner, earns, derives or receives from another person.</p>

<p>The rental income and the asset value of the home will be exempt for both until Zane dies or loses his grandfathered status.</p>
