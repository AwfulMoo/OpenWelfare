<p>When an income managed customer applies for an advance payment, the following message will display.</p>

<p>This customer's payment is subject to Income Management (IM).Customers must be advised that any Advance payment is 100% income managed (except for Special Employment Advance which is not subject to IM). This means the total amount of the Advance will be paid to their Income Management account and not their nominated bank account. Payment of expenses or transfers to BasicsCard can be made once the Advance payment has been credited to the customer's Income Management account.</p>

<p>For income managed customers granted an Advance payment, this will result in a reduction of their fortnightly income managed funds due to the compulsory Advance repayments. This may cause an over allocation of funds resulting in undelivered expenses.</p>

<p>If the customer wishes to continue - If Work Item 'I064Q1-More than 100% of the Income Management fund is allocated' is generated as a result of this activity, please refer the customer to an IM trained staff member or the Income Management line on 1800 132 594. If the customer wishes to withdraw the application, reject the claim 'Claim Withdrawn'.</p>

<p>For further assistance regarding Income Management please refer to the Welfare Quarantining Programme Management Team Homepage.</p>

<p>Advance repayments reduce the amount of funds credited into a customer's Income Management account, Service Officers are to check there are sufficient funds available to meet ongoing regular expenses.</p>

<p>Go to the <a target="_blank" href="../payment-delivery/103-01050040-03.html#bp03000000_Process">Expense Management Summary screen</a> and view the percentage of the fortnightly unallocated funds available. If more than 100% is allocated, regular expenses will need to be reviewed and updated. For further information see <a target="_blank" href="../payment-delivery/103-01040010-01.html">Determining a person's priority needs for Income Management</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when running the Advance Payments service for <strong>Income Managed</strong> customers, check the advance payment on the Payment Summary (<strong>PS</strong>) screen <strong>before</strong> finalising the activity. The Advance is identified as being income managed by the $0.00 amount in the $Net payment column.</p>

<p>Funds will be credited with the nightly payment strip and available in the Income Management account the next day. This means customers who are granted an advance on a Friday can access these funds on the weekend using self service options to transfer to their BasicsCard. For further information see, <a href="../payment-delivery/103-01040070-01.html">Coding Income Management expenses</a> and <img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> <a href="../payment-delivery/103-01230180-01.html">Transfer income managed funds to BasicsCard online</a>.</p>

<p>Following the results of the affordability test and the comparison with the actual payment rate, the amount that can be paid may be reduced by&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the amount of any Social Security Entitlement advance payments granted during the 13 fortnights immediately before the new application was lodged even if that advance has already been paid in full, <strong>as well as</strong></li>
		<li>
the amount of any previous Social Security Entitlement advance payments granted within the 6 to 12 months before the new application was lodged that have not been repaid</li>
		</ul>
<p>The result is then rounded to the nearest cent (for example, 0.5c and above is rounded up).</p>

<p>The <strong>minimum</strong> advance payment that a pensioner can receive is set at 1 week of the Advance Payment Qualifying Amount (APQA).</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the maximum amount displayed on the customer's record is the result of the calculations explained above. If the maximum amount displayed is less than the minimum amount, the advance payment application will be rejected.</p>

<p>Both the maximum and minimum amounts will increase in line with the pension rate increases.</p>

<p>The workflow will also&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Prompt the Service Officer to advise the customer they are entitled or not entitled to an advance payment</li>
		<li>
Indicate the available payment options (for instance, a one-off payment or via instalments), and when the advance payment/s will be paid into the customer's bank account. The first payment is usually within 2 working days</li>
		<li>
Write the online <strong>DOC</strong></li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>If the pensioner is paid via group payment</strong></p>

<p>Regular payments (and any immediate payments) can only be issued to the institution nominated on Entitlement Period End Day (EPED) B. Care <strong>must</strong> be taken to ensure when reissuing a payment, or granting an Advance Payment or urgent payment for customers who are on a group payment arrangement, as a payment issued on any other EPED will fail to deliver. See Reissuing a rejected payment. See <a href="../payment-delivery/103-04010130-01.html">Group payment delivery</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Payment by instalment</strong></p>

<p>If the customer chooses to have the advance payment paid by instalments&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The repayments will be calculated on the full amount of the advance and not just the instalment that is being paid first</li>
		<li>
When coding the date for the second instalment, for pension customers, the date coded needs to be 2 working days prior to the date the customer requires the funds. The payment is issued as per normal payment delivery timeframes. See <a href="../payment-delivery/103-04030020-01.html">Payment Delivery Strip Times</a></li>
		<li>
The second instalment must be paid within 6 months of the original grant</li>
		<li>
A future activity will be created on the <strong>FAL</strong> screen for the issuing of the second instalment. This activity must not be cancelled as it is required to ensure the payment is issued</li>
		</ul>
<p>If nominee arrangements are in place, annotate the <strong>DOC</strong> as follows&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
if a correspondence nominee has applied on behalf of the customer, indicate that the applicant was the nominee, or</li>
		<li>
if the customer has applied, record details of contact or attempted contacts made with the nominee</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; when running the Advance Payments workflow for <strong>Income Managed</strong> customers, check the advance payment on the Payment Summary (<strong>PS</strong>) screen <strong>before</strong> finalising the activity. The Advance is identified as being income managed by the $0.00 amount in the $Net payment column.</p>

<p>Funds will be credited with the nightly payment strip and available in the Income Management account the next day. This means customers who are granted an advance on a Friday can access these funds on the weekend using self service options to transfer to their BasicsCard.
