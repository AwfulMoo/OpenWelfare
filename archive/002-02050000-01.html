		<div class="block">

<p>From 11 June 2020 the farm assets test threshold is $5.5 million unless the customer qualifies under <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-04120000-01.html">Asset Hardship rules</a>. The definition of a farm and non-farm asset did not change.</p>

<p>This asset test is the same whether it applies to a single person of a member of a couple. That is, the couple is subject to a combined asset test of $5.5 million, not $5.5 million for each person in the relationship. The asset test is the total of all their farm and non-farm assets. Assess farm assets must separately for aggregation purposes before adding to the non-farm assets.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when applying the net farm assets test, farm assets are <strong>not</strong> the same as Primary Production assets under social security law. Apportion liabilities to determine how much of the liability relates to a farm asset. It is up to the decision maker to determine whether a liability is related to a farm asset.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>From 5 April 2017, the definition of farm assets is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>any</strong> asset that is used or held wholly or mainly for the purpose of a farm enterprise. This includes water entitlement rights and shares. The exception is cash, bank deposits and farm management deposits</li>

		<div class="block">

<p>A loan made by a person to a trust or private company may be treated as a farm asset rather than a financial asset in carefully prescribed circumstances, where all of the following apply&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The loan was used for the purchase of farm and/or farm business assets owned by the trustee of the trust or company. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> the appropriate <a href="../rural-and-remote-australians/002-02050000-01.html#bp01_L2GT_Definition_of_f">definition of farm assets</a> depending on claim submission date, must be considered in making this determination</li>
		<li>
The underlying assets of the entity are illiquid in nature (that is, the liquid assets held by the entity are not sufficient to repay the loan)</li>
		<li>
The beneficiary loan value does not exceed the original cost of the asset</li>
		</ul>
<p>This differs from the treatment of these loans for other Centrelink payments, and aims to avoid inequity between customers based on business structure.</p>

<p>In accordance with the FHA guidelines, loans from a business entity to a person must be proportioned, depending on what the loan funds are being used to purchase. </p>

		<ul>		<li>
it is used for the purchase of a right or interest in&#58;</li>

		</ul>
<p>If the loan does not meet the above criteria, class the loan as a personal financial asset of the customer.</p>

<p>The Acts Interpretation Act 1901 provides the definition of ‘person’. Specifically, section 2C provides references to persons&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
In any Act, expressions used to denote persons generally (such as ‘person’, ‘party’, ‘someone’, ‘anyone’, ‘no-one’, ‘one’, ‘another’ and ‘whoever’), include a body politic or corporate as well as an individual</li>
		<li>
Express references in an Act to companies, corporations or bodies corporate do not imply that expressions in that Act, of the kind mentioned in subsection (1), do not include companies, corporations or bodies corporate</li>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Superannuation">Superannuation</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>As with other income support payments, superannuation is not assessable for FHA customers while in the accumulation phase. The fund will become an assessable asset once a person reaches pension age or begins to receive a pension or annuity from the fund. </p>

<p>Self-Managed Superannuation Fund (SMSF) for FHA customers may also include ownership of farm assets such as the farm property or livestock. Code farm assets separately from non-farm assets to ensure they can be aggregated. This is done before being added to non-farm assets under the assets test.</p>

<p>This is different to assessments of superannuation under social security law where the contents of a superannuation fund are always assessed as financial assets.</p>

<p>Income from a superannuation fund is non-farm income, for the purposes of FHA.</p>

<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Water_assets"></a>
<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Water_assets">Water assets</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The value of water assets should be included in the assessment of net farm assets where there is an open and well-established tradable water market. Currently the only established tradable water market is in the Murray Darling Basin. While other markets across Australia are emerging, they are not mature enough for consistent trading and regular reporting on water trading prices.</p>

<p>State authorities regulate water assets. There are different rules in each state and different terminology is used. The <a href="../rural-and-remote-australians/002-02050000-05.html#bp05_L3TT_Links_to_resour">Resources</a> page has a link to the national terminology.</p>

<p>Most water assets can be held and traded separately from land. Assets can be traded in a regulated water system quite freely on the open market, because of control over the flow of water. In an unregulated system, trade may be limited due to geographical location needs of potential buyers. These factors will affect the value of the asset. Some water assets are bound to land and can only be traded with the land. These are assessed differently. See the <a href="../rural-and-remote-australians/002-02050000-03.html">Process</a> page.</p>

<p>A formal valuation is not required. As with other assets, a customer's reasonable estimate of the market value will suffice for assessment. Submit evidence of all water assets held by the customer or their partner with a claim for FHA. This includes any water licences, water certificates, water entitlements or water allocations owned by the customer or their partner. The evidence must provide proof of ownership and proof that supports their estimate of the asset value.</p>

<p>If there is any charge or encumbrance over the asset, reduce the value of the asset by the value of the encumbrance to obtain the net market value.</p>

<p>If a water asset is sold, the income received from the sale of the asset is treated as the sale of an asset under social security law. Assess the value as a financial asset under the asset test as a non-farm asset. If a water asset is gifted, normal gifting provisions apply. If a water asset is leased, it is no longer held wholly or mainly for the purposes of the farm enterprise. It becomes assessable under the assets test as a non-farm asset test. Assess the income stream received as non-farm income.</p>

<p>Another part of the shareholder approval was the Share Trading Platform to cease operation on 30 June 2018 meaning MG shares can only be transferred between a buyer and seller via an off market transfer.</p>
