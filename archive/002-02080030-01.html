<p>This document explains how a clock is used to count the number of days a customer has been paid Farm Household Allowance (FHA) and how many remaining days of FHA entitlement of the maximum cumulative period of 4 years (1,460 days).  </p>
<div class="twisty">
	
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Cumulative_enti01"></a>
<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Cumulative_enti01">Cumulative entitlement</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The Australian Government announced changes to increase the cumulative period that individuals can receive FHA. From 1 August 2018, eligible farmers and their partners can access up to 4 years (1,460 days) of payment. This is designed to give farm families time to get back on their feet and the opportunity to take steps to address their long-term financial security.</p>

<p>FHA is only payable for a maximum of 4 cumulative years (1,460 days). The 4 year eligibility period does not need to be continuous&#58; if FHA payments stop, the count of days towards their 4 years of help will pause. This means that the 1,460 days of payment may be delivered over an extended period.</p>

<p>If a customer receives FHA as both a farmer and a partner of a farmer, they are not entitled to more than 1,460 days payment in total. The cumulative total includes days on payment as a farmer, and days on payment as a partner.</p>

<p>The system will automatically cancel FHA payments when the clock calculates that the customer has reached the maximum number of days on payment.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> 1,460 days is not always equal to 4 years, it is set to cater for leap years.</p>

<p>The system will calculate a customer’s cumulative period of entitlement using a clock.</p>

<p>All allowances payable with FHA will be counted towards the clock, <strong>except</strong> bereavement payments.</p>

<p>The clock only counts days a customer has actually received a payment associated with FHA and updates at the end of each payment period, the count does not include payments scheduled for future delivery. Days serving a waiting period <strong>do not</strong> count towards the allowable 1,460 days on payment.</p>

<p>The system will start and stop the clock as a customer comes on and off FHA payments&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
days for which a payment is received will add a day to the clock</li>
		<li>
days for which a nil rate of payment is received will not count against the clock, <strong>except </strong>if a debt is raised because of fraud, where a customer has not acted in good faith or where payments have been made for periods over the 1,460 days of entitlement</li>

<p>If a customer received Interim FHA payments for any period from 1 July 2014, the days for which they received Interim FHA payments must be counted against the clock. This includes periods where the partner may have received the payment of FHA on behalf of the customer.</p>

<p>As with other change of circumstances, business income reconciliation for FHA may result in an adjustment to a customer’s clock.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If a top-up is calculated and paid, days may need to be removed from the customer's remaining entitlement calculation</li>
		<li>

<p><strong>Undetermined</strong> debt shells will not have any impact on the clock. Once a customer’s clock reaches 1,460 days on payment, FHA will be cancelled whether or not there is any undetermined debt activity on the record. </p>

<p>For <strong>determined debts raised where a notice is given that it must be repaid </strong>resulting  in the customer not being entitled to any FHA payment for the period, the customer is deemed not to have received FHA for days of zero entitlement.</p>

<p><strong>Partial rate debts&#58;</strong> If the rate of FHA is reduced during the period of the debt (but not $0) the clock will not be adjusted. Only the days where there was zero entitlement are added back to the clock.</p>

<p><strong>Waived debts,</strong> do not re-credit the clock. </p>

<p>If a zero entitlement debt is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
fully waived, manually reverse the auto clock adjustment that occurs when the debt is determined, prior to waiving. Add the days back as days the customer has been on FHA </li>
		<li>
partially waived, manually reverse the period that is waived. Do not add the days back to the available clock days. There is no change for a waived partial rate debt as the clock is not adjusted when the debt is raised to waive.</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Exception&#58;</strong> if a debt has resulted from payments being issued for a period outside the 1,460 days of entitlement, a manual clock adjustment is not needed, as there was never any entitlement to the period to need an adjustment.</p>

<p>If a debt is <strong>determined</strong> for a period inside the 1,460 days of entitlement after the customer's FHA payments have been cancelled due to receiving 1,460 days of payment, the clock will need to be adjusted and FHA restored via the change process. If the debt is determined more than 13 weeks after the FHA cancellation date, a new claim may be needed.</p>
