<p>This document outlines the bonus payments making up the Household Stimulus Package (HSP) announced on 3 February 2009 by the Australian Government to support eligible families, students and farmers. These bonus payments are in addition to the Economic Security Strategy (ESS) payments and comprise a number of different bonus payments. These payments are no longer available, this page has been kept for information purposes only.</p>

<p>The majority of the HSP payments were paid automatically in 2009 to eligible Family Tax Benefit and income support payment recipients. Payments have been made after the 2009 period to some recipients who have had an assessment reassessment completed for the financial year 2008-09 (for example, a FTB lump sum claim completed). The automatic payments of HSP ceased from 3 September 2016.</p>

<p>HSP assessments may be triggered by the FTB reconciliation process or completion of a FTB lump sum claim that has been pending income. In this instance a manual follow up (MFU) will be created for specialist staff to check entitlement to the payment.</p>

<p>Recipients may still be eligible for HSP payments in strictly limited and rare circumstances. In these cases, a manual payment may be made by specialist staff only.</p>

<p>The circumstances a recipient could be entitled are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they lodged a claim in the required two year period for the 2008-09 financial year,</li>
		<li>
have not received the HSP payment previously (that is, for that particular child/ren), and</li>
		<li>
they were otherwise entitled to a FTB payment at the relevant dates in 2009.</li>
		</ul>
<p>HSP assessments are processed by the Families Ongoing Entitlement Team and enquiries can be emailed to the team. Service Officers are not permitted to take payment action themselves. The <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-03060000-05.html">Resources</a> page contains a link to contact details for Families Ongoing Entitlement team.</p>
