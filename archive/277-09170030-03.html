<p>If a payer objects to a decision to accept an application for assessment on grounds other than disputed parentage they may apply for Child Support to suspend payments pending the objection decision.

<p>Within 2 business days of receiving the objection intray, make 1 outbound contact attempt to the applicant on all available numbers. Send a pre-call SMS to help contact the customer. </p>

<p>If the 1st contact attempt in unsuccessful, make 2 additional attempts on all numbers, within 2 business days of receiving the objection intray at different times of the day, before issuing letters. </p>

<p>If the customer has multiple cases, they must lodge a separate objection for each case upon which they are objecting to a decision.</p>

<p>Family Assistance will need to confirm that Child Support has conducted an identity check for the non-mutual customer and locate the mutual customer in ISIS (Centrelink customer data base) before they can take the call.</p>

<p>If a non-mutual customer contacts Family Assistance to lodge a review to a care decision that affects them, Family Assistance are unable to confirm the customer's identity. In this situation, Family Assistance must conference call Child Support. Child Support will&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
conduct an identity check for the non-mutual customer</li>

confirm the Identity Confirmation has been successfully conducted with Family Assistance</li>

<p>When this has occurred, Family Assistance will proceed with the review for the non-mutual customer.</p>

<p>If the customer is a non-mutual customer, Child Support must record some basic information about the objection in Cuba. See <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-30010440-01.html">Objections Cuba Process Help</a>.</p>

they cannot request an Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) review of a withdrawn objection as no decision has been made</li>

the other party may lodge their own objection. If the other parent has already lodged their own objection and does not want to withdraw, the objection will continue</li>
		<li>
there is a cooling off period of 48 hours before finalising the application as 'withdrawn' in Cuba</li>
		<li>
the onus is on the applicant to contact the Objections Service Officer within the 48 hour cooling off period if they decide to change their decision about withdrawing their objection</li>
		<li>
they can object at any time, however if the applicant objects outside the 28 day timeframe (90 days for customers in reciprocating jurisdictions) they will need to request an extension of time for objection to proceed</li>
		<li>
if the objection is about a care percentage decision (including date of event of a care change), the applicant can object at any time, however, if the respondent objects outside the 28 day timeframe (90 days for customers in reciprocating jurisdictions) any change to the care percentage will only apply to the assessment from the date the objection was lodged, unless there were special circumstances that impacted on the respondent's ability to lodge an objection earlier </li>
		<li>
they will received a copy of the application (response or objection etc) and documents </li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer refuses to withdraw the objection, tell the customer their application cannot be accepted because it is not properly made.</p>

<p>The timeframes for determining if an objection has been received in time should be based on where the applicant lives, not the postal address. Where the applicant lives will not always match a person’s Residency as recorded in Cuba Residency window.</p>

<p>Where the Objections Officer forms the view that a contrary decision will be made, the likely outcome of the objection should not be discussed with the customer at any stage of the process and the option of a withdrawal should not be proactively offered to the applicant as this may result in an unfair assessment being left unchanged.</p>

<p>Create a notepad in the Objections Maintenance window and paste in the document created by the <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/elements/macros/ObjectionsFirstContact.html">Objection First Contact</a> macro with the subject line 'Applicant First Contact'.

<p></p>

<p><strong>Invalid objections</strong></p>
