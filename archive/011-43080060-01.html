A person cannot be a member of more than 1 registered family, except where the person is a dependant child and more than 1 family shares the right to make decisions concerning the daily care and control of the child</li>
		<li>
If a child is enrolled on <strong>3</strong> Medicare cards, any enquiries must be referred to MPS Assessing as dependant children can only be registered on 2 family Safety Net registrations</li>
		</ul>
<p>Families who reach and exceed the Safety Net threshold during a calendar year are entitled, once confirmed, to increased Medicare benefits for any out-of-hospital services rendered during the remainder of that calendar year.</p>

<p>A family's eligibility commences from the date of the family's registration. This means that a family will not be paid any additional benefits under the Safety Nets, even if the threshold has been reached prior to the date of registration. For example, if the Safety Net family reach a threshold in May but did not register as a family until July they will not be paid additional benefits until July.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> for families who have a newborn and have <strong>not</strong> previously registered as an MSN family, the registration date will be the newborn’s date of birth.</p>

<p>As with the Medicare Safety Net, when a family reaches or is reaching the appropriate threshold they will be notified by letter and asked to confirm their family composition.</p>

<p>If a person submits a Family Safety Net Confirmation form and the form has a 'received date' marked by a Service Centre, this date <strong>must </strong>be used as the confirmation date. If the form does not have a received date Service Officers must use the date of lodgement in PaNDA.</p>

<p>Service Officers can only register a family for a previous year in circumstances where the registration form was received by Medicare in that previous year, but not processed until the next year.</p>

<p>In this situation, Service Officers can register a family for the previous year by selecting the relevant Safety Net year from the drop down list in Consumer Directory Maintenance System (CDMS). See <a href="../your-health/011-43080060-03.html">Process</a> page table Register a new Safety Net family.</p>

<p>Active card members suppressed on the Medicare enrolment will not be able to be registered on a Safety Net family, unless they were registered for Safety Net prior to being suppressed.</p>

<p>Eligibility for a family under the Medicare Safety Net is defined as any active card member&#58;</p>

families covered by the Medicare Safety Net include same-sex couples and their dependants</li>

<p>Families need to register as a Medicare Safety Net family, even if they are all on the same Medicare card.</p>

<p>Medicare Safety Net family members are allocated a <strong>member</strong> type at the time of registration to identify their relationship within the family.</p>

<p>A valid family must be comprised of at least 2 members as follows, either&#58;</p>

<p>Service Officers <strong>must not</strong> remove a child from the original family Safety Net registration unless instructed by the remaining adult on the original family registration.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> where an individual has transferred from 1 Medicare card to another, and is part of a registered MSN family, the Service Officer must check the Medicare Safety Net and record comments in CDMS. See <a href="../your-health/011-44150020-01.html">Copy or transfer a person or child to another Medicare card</a> for more information. For example, where a child transfers to their own card at 15 years of age, the Service Officer must confirm whether or not they wish to remain on the family Safety Net registration.</p>

<p>When amending a family Safety Net registration Service Officers should ask if the family member would like to check that their EFT and contact details are up to date in the Consumer Directory Maintenance System (CDMS).</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> there is no automatic system review of student dependants, other than the removal of persons 25 years of age or older as at 1 January each year. The system determines a dependant's age from the date the family registration is processed. <a href="../your-health/011-44150020-01.html">Copy or transfer a person or child to another Medicare card</a> contains further information.</p>

<p><strong>Confirming Medicare Safety Net online</strong></p>

<p><img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" />The registered family contact (FC) or spouse/partner (SP) can confirm their Medicare Safety Net family for the previous and/or current calendar year online by either using their&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Medicare online account through myGov, or</li>
		<li>
Express Plus Medicare mobile app</li>
		</ul>
<p>Customers who do not have a Medicare online account will need to create a myGov online account and link Medicare service to it. See <a href="../self-service/133-02010020-01.html">How customers create a myGov account and link services</a>.</p>

<p>The ‘<strong>Confirm your family</strong>’ service is available on the ‘Medicare Safety Net’ screen for the previous and/or current calendar year for customers who&#58;</p>

have a Medicare online account</li>

whose family has reached 70% of the Medicare Safety Net threshold</li>

are registered as the family contact (FC) or spouse/partner (SP)</li>
		<li>
haven’t confirmed their family for the relevant calendar year</li>

<p>Customers who do not meet the above criteria will not be able to use the service. They can confirm their family by using existing channels.</p>

<p>The ‘<strong>Confirm your family</strong>’ service advises customers to contact us if&#58;</p>

the customer needs to make changes to their family registration</li>

<p><strong>Medicare Safety Net confirmation over the phone, at a service centre or in writing</strong></p>

<p>On receipt of the completed confirmation form, or confirmation request from an eligible family member, Service Officers must update the family registration on the <strong>Confirmation Details</strong> tab of the Consumer Directory Maintenance System (CDMS) <strong>Amend Medicare Safety Net Details</strong> screen to indicate the family has been confirmed. Service Officers must also update the contact details as part of confirming the Medicare Safety Net.</p>

<p>If a person submits a Family Safety Net Confirmation form and the form has a 'received date' marked by a Service Centre, this date <strong>must </strong>be used as the confirmation date. If the form does not have a received date Service Officers must use the date of lodgement in PaNDA.</p>

<p>If a family has been confirmed for the calendar year the <strong>Confirmation details</strong> tab of the CDMS <strong>Inquire/Amend Medicare Safety Net Details</strong> page will show&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a status of ‘Confirmed’</li>
		<li>
the Confirmation channel and confirmation date</li>
		<li>
the name of the family member that requested the confirmation</li>

<p>Section 10AE(1) of the Health Insurance Act 1973 states that a person confirming the family composition must be a member of the registered Medicare Safety Net family.</p>

<p>Departmental policy states that any individual who is part of the registered Safety Net family and aged 14 years of age or older can confirm the family composition.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> once a Medicare Safety Net Family has been confirmed, Service Officers <strong>cannot remove</strong> any members from the registration until the following calendar year. New family members (including newborns) can be <strong>added</strong> to a Medicare Safety Net Family after the family has been confirmed, it is recommended that all changes (adding or removing members) are processed before a safety net is confirmed.</p>
