<p>This document outlines the reconciliation of a customer's FTB and CCB payments when they are no longer partnered to a person who was their partner at any time during the relevant financial year.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> all CCB/Child Care Rebate (CCR) references relate to financial years prior to 2018/2019.</p>

<p>For correct assessment of FTB and CCB entitlement, actual adjusted taxable income (AATI) details are required for the customer and their partner(s). If a person is not required to lodge an income tax return for the relevant financial year, an estimate of their AATI is used to work out FTB and CCB entitlement.</p>

<p>Separate rules apply for Single Income Family Supplement (SIFS) which is assessed using taxable income. SIFS will only be paid for a partnered period to eligible persons if partner income is known (reasonable estimate was provided and accepted by Services Australia if not required to lodge, or taxable income details were transferred from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO)). A 'Return Not Necessary' advice reported by the ATO will not result in a SIFS assessment unless income details for the financial year have been recorded. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> for the 2017-18 and later financial years, customers must meet the SIFS grandfathering provisions for payment of SIFS.</p>

<p>A partner's income is included in the family's combined actual adjusted taxable income (AATI) only for the period they were partnered to that person.

<p>If the partner received an income support payment during the time they were partnered to the customer, the customer is entitled to the maximum FTB Part A (unless both customer and partner were within an employment income nil rate period) and CCB rates for that period.</p>

<p>If a customer had a partner at <strong>any time in the relevant financial year</strong>, reconciliation processing depends on when they were separated from that person.</p>

<p>The partner is treated as an ex-partner for reconciliation purposes. If only the ex-partner actual income details are still needed for reconciliation&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Partial reconciliation</strong> is the process where any customer and/or ex-partner estimates provided throughout the relevant financial year are used to complete the reconciliation calculation for any partnered periods. The period the customer was not partnered will be reconciled using the customer's actual income. Partial reconciliation can occur from 1 July of the lodgement year. The customer will not incur a debt for the ex-partner period due to AATI, but this does not prevent debts occurring during this period from maintenance income or qualification. FTB Part A supplement (if entitled) and Part B supplement will be included in the reconciliation result. <a href="../families/007-11060000-01.html">Debt offsetting may occur</a>. For 2006-2007 and following years, the customer's annual Child Care Rebate (CCR) entitlement is calculated when partial reconciliation of CCB occurs</li>
		<li>
<strong>Interim reconciliation</strong> can occur from 1 July of the extended lodgement year if the customer's actual income has been received and adequate income for the ex-partner has not been received by 30 June of the lodgement year. During interim reconciliation, a calculation using only the most recent estimate (MRE) of the ex-partner and adequate income for the customer is completed. This result is then compared to the partial reconciliation result. Under the ex-partner rules, the income which produces the most favourable result is used in the interim reconciliation, that is, the result using estimates provided throughout the relevant financial year is compared to the result using the most recent estimate (MRE) for ex-partner together with adequate income for the customer. FTB Part A supplement (if entitled) and Part B supplement will be included in the reconciliation result. <a href="../families/007-11060000-01.html">Debt offsetting may occur</a></li>
		<li>
<strong>Final reconciliation</strong> will only occur when the ex-partner lodges a tax return or Services Australia is advised that the ex-partner is not required to lodge. In this case the partner's adequate income is used to calculate a reconciliation result. This result is again compared to the one applied at interim or partial reconciliation and the most favourable result applied. The customer will not receive a non-lodger debt if the ex-partner does not lodge their tax return or does not advise they are not required to lodge</li>

<p>The partner is treated as a previous partner for reconciliation purposes. If only the previous partner's actual income details are still needed, <strong>interim reconciliation</strong> will occur immediately after 1 July of the extended lodgement year using adequate income (that is, actual adjusted taxable income (AATI)) for the customer and the most recent estimate for the relevant financial year for the previous partner. FTB Part A supplement (if entitled) and Part B supplement will be included in the reconciliation result. Final reconciliation may occur later if the previous partner's income details are updated, and the customer may incur a debt due to the previous partner's AATI.

<p>From the 2012-2013 financial year onwards, if the customer separates from their relevant year partner after the end of the lodgement year, reconciliation cannot occur until the previous partner's actual income is obtained.</p>

<p>The non-lodger process will apply&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If a customer separates from their partner <strong>before the non-lodger debt is raised</strong> (September of the extended lodgement year), the non-lodger debt will be immediately written off if the previous partner has not confirmed their income</li>
		<li>
If advice of a separation is received <strong>after the non-lodger debt has been raised</strong>, a temporary write-off of recovery of the non-lodger debt will occur, and any repayments made since the separation will be refunded to the customer</li>
		<li>
If the customer <strong>re-partners with the previous partner</strong>, the write off will cease and recovery of the non-lodger debt will resume</li>
		</ul>
<p>Reconciliation can occur after actual income of both parties becomes available, however, supplements and top-ups will not be payable, due to the late income lodgement. The customer may incur a reconciliation debt due to the previous partner's income.</p>

<p>For the 2011-2012 and earlier financial years, if the separation was advised&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
before non-lodger debt processing, <strong>interim reconciliation</strong> will occur based on the customer's adequate income and the most recent estimate for the previous partner</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Final reconciliation may occur later if income details are updated, and the customer may incur a debt due to the previous partner's AATI</li>		</ul>
		<li>
after a non-lodger debt has been raised, the non-lodger debt will be cancelled and <strong>interim reconciliation</strong> will occur, based on the customer's adequate income and the most recent estimate for the previous partner</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Final reconciliation may occur later if income details are updated, and the customer may incur a debt due to the previous partner's AATI. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> for 2000-2001 there was no extended lodgement year. Customers and/or ex-partners were required to lodge before the lodgement year ended on 30 June 2002.</li>
