<p>Social security law does not prevent a job seeker committing a mutual obligation failure for not meeting a requirement scheduled on a weekend.</p>

<p>Five mutual obligation failures within 6 active months generally indicate persistent non-compliance. After 5 demerits, job seekers enter the financial penalty zone if both a Capability Interview and Capability Assessment have found that the job seeker is capable of meeting their requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; Job seekers who fail to attend a job interview, fail to act on a job opportunity or act in a manner such that an offer of employment would not be offered to them may enter the financial penalty zone more quickly, recognising the seriousness of these types of mutual obligation failures.</p>

<p>For further information to assist job seekers who contact Services Australia to arrange a Capability Assessment, see <a href="../job-seekers/001-18030203-01.html">Capability Assessments</a>.</p>

<p>A Non-Compliance Report (NCR) is created in the Employment Services System (ESS) when an 'invalid' result is recorded for a compulsory requirement and a job seeker is in the financial penalty zone. Payment is immediately suspended and contact with the provider is required.</p>

<p>When the job seeker contacts the provider, their reasons for committing the mutual obligation failure are considered.</p>

<p>If the provider&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>

Payment restarts when the provider notifies that conditions to lift the payment suspension have been met. No action is required by Services Australia</li>
		<li>
<strong>Does not accept the job seeker had a valid reason&#58;</strong> The provider records the reason that was not accepted in ESS. The NCR is updated and submitted to Services Australia. The provider advises the job seeker that they may need to discuss non-compliance with Services Australia when they report. After the provider notifies conditions for lifting the payment suspension have been met, the job seeker can either accept the financial penalty when reporting (certain failures) or will need to talk with Services Australia before reporting can be finalised</li>		</ul>

These failures include a first or second failure in the financial penalty zone for non-attendance at provider appointments, third party appointments, job interviews or activities.</p>

<p>Job seekers always have to talk to Services Australia about failures that relate to misconduct or where the penalty would result in payment cancellation. They can choose to talk to Services Australia about any failure if they have evidence or information they would like considered before a financial penalty is applied.</p>

<p>The compliance investigation focuses on determining if a financial penalty will be applied for a mutual obligation failure.</p>

<p>The compliance investigation also needs to incorporate the appropriate messages to build a clear understanding of the expectations of job seekers, and consequences of non-compliant behaviour. Ensuring the job seeker fully understands their requirements and the consequences of not meeting them, gives them the best chance of complying and avoiding further penalties in the future.</p>

<p>The PST-skilled Service Officer must ensure all of the evidence required to make a good decision is identified and appropriately considered by&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
providing a clear explanation of the mutual obligation failure that is under investigation, the specific matters that need to be considered to reach a decision and the potential outcomes of the decision</li>
		<li>
identifying the facts relevant to the non-compliance event and conducting an investigation focused on the relevant facts</li>
		<li>
giving the job seeker the opportunity to respond to any adverse claims that have been made against them and to disclose any further information they would like considered</li>
		<li>
making contact with the provider or relevant third party to assist in establishing the facts, where evidence provided by the job seeker contradicts the reported non-compliance event</li>
		<li>
consultation with a specialist officer or Indigenous Cultural Consultant. This may be appropriate to establish the impact of job seeker circumstances on capacity to comply. See <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-12080010-01.html">Accessing a PST-skilled social worker</a> for information on when consultation with a PST-skilled social worker may be required or appropriate</li>

<p>All compliance investigations relating to mutual obligation failures must be recorded using the <strong>Compliance Investigation</strong> workflow. This workflow is accessed by selecting the active failure from the <strong>Participation Compliance</strong> workflow.</p>

<p>On entering the workflow, contact with the job seeker is automatically recorded and key information relevant to the compliance information presents.</p>

<p>Talking points that relate to the reason the failure was submitted should be discussed with the job seeker. PST-skilled Services Officers are expected to use these points to ensure that that the job seeker has a clear understanding of the non-compliance event being discussed and the potential consequences if a penalty is applied.</p>

<p>The PST-skilled Service Officer must read the privacy statement to the job seeker before commencing the investigation and ensure any concerns are addressed before proceeding.</p>

<p>The starting point for the investigation is the reported non-compliance event. The <strong>Compliance Investigation</strong> workflow displays information recorded by the provider on the Non-Compliance Report, including the compulsory requirement, the reason the job seeker provided for non-compliance and why this was not considered valid.</p>

<p>During the compliance investigation, the PST-skilled Service Officer must record&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
any relevant facts identified relating to the mutual obligation failure that were not already considered by the provider</li>
		<li>
the reasons provided by the job seeker for not complying with a compulsory requirement</li>
		<li>
any evidence collected that supports the facts</li>
		<li>
a decision to either apply, or not apply a financial penalty</li>
		<li>
the rationale for the decision</li>		</ul>

<p>Where a mutual obligation failure has been committed, consideration must be given to the job seeker's reasons for committing this failure.</p>

<p>A concise summary of any additional information provided by the job seeker relevant to the non-compliance event and any evidence they would be willing to provide to support the validity of their statements must be recorded.</p>

<p>The main excuse for the failure must be identified. Drop down menus are used to select the appropriate category and reason. It is essential that the PST-skilled Service officer clearly identifies the main excuse; this is because the <strong>Compliance Investigation</strong> workflow is intuitive and adjusts options available to the decision maker based on the main reason that is recorded.</p>

<p>Sufficient evidence must be collected to establish the facts on which a decision will be based.</p>

<p>Where a decision relates to misconduct, the investigation must focus on whether an incident of misconduct occurred. A financial penalty would not apply where the job seeker's actions were reasonable or not within their control.</p>

<p>For all other non-compliance events, the investigation must focus on whether the job seeker has reasonable excuse for the non-compliance event, and whether prior contact occurred. Matters that did not significantly and directly impact at the time of non-compliance cannot be considered when assessing reasonable excuse. Generally, matters that are within the job seeker's control would not be considered reasonable excuse. For further information, see <a href="../job-seekers/001-10040070-01.html">Assessing reasonable excuse for non-compliance with Mutual Obligation Requirements</a>.</p>

<p>It is important that the reason for the decision is discussed with the job seeker in a manner which consistently reinforces expectations that they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
take personal responsibility for meeting compulsory requirements and engaging with their provider</li>
		<li>
talk to their provider about any circumstances impacting ability to comply with requirements</li>
		<li>
actively participate with the compulsory requirements in their Job/Participation Plan</li>
		<li>
contact prior to a requirement or appointment scheduled start time if unable to attend</li>

<p>Talking points displayed in the <strong>Participation Compliance</strong> workflow should be used to ensure consistent messages are provided.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; Where the decision and/or appeal rights are unable to be verbally advised, the PST-skilled Service Officers should finalise the decision in the workflow. Finalising the decision will issue a letter to the job seeker advising of the adverse decision and appeal rights.</p>
