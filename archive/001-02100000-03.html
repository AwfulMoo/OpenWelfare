<p>If the job seeker was receiving a higher rate of JSP, YA or SpB, they may have an ongoing entitlement to a partial rate of income support payment in addition to NEIS/Self Employment Allowance.

<p>If a JSP, YA or SpB job seeker attends a service centre to claim an income support payment due to NEIS/Self Employment Allowance suspension, the Service Officer will need to contact the provider to confirm the job seeker's NEIS Assistance/Small Business Coaching suspension reason. If the suspension is due to a medical condition, and it is confirmed that NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance is suspended and all other eligibility rules are met, Service Officers can grant an income support payment for the period of the NEIS Assistance/Small Business Coaching suspension.</p>

<p>If the suspension is due to other reasons, such as not complying with NEIS Assistance/Small Business Coaching requirements, Service Officers should reject the claim because the job seeker is receiving a precluding payment and refer the job seeker back to their NEIS/Self-Employment provider.</p>

<p>Service Officers should document any discussions with NEIS/Self-Employment providers and scan any documentation provided by the job seeker, which confirms suspension of participation in NEIS Assistance/Small Business Coaching.</p>

<p>Parenting Payment Partnered (PPP) job seekers must change from income support payment to NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance and are not entitled to any partial rate payment from Services Australia. NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance, being paid at the 'single, 22 or over, with no children' rate of JobSeeker Payment (JSP), will always be more than the job seeker's former rate of PPP. The NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance direct deduction amount applied will always reduce the PPP rate to nil.</p>

<p>Therefore, job seekers in receipt of PPP will be auto-cancelled upon commencement in NEIS Assistance/Small Business Coaching.</p>

<p>PPP job seekers whose income support payment has been cancelled due to transfer to NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance may be eligible for an extended concession card entitlement. These job seekers are required to lodge a claim for the LIC in order to receive the LIC.</p>

<p>Parenting Payment Single (PPS) job seekers can continue to receive their income support payment or elect to receive NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance and a partial rate of their income support payment.</p>

<p>When a PPS job seeker with mutual obligation requirements commences NEIS Assistance/Small Business Coaching, it will auto-display on the Activity and Exemption Summary (<strong>AEX</strong>) screen and the Other Government Payments (<strong>OGP</strong>) screen with the code '<strong>EIS</strong>', and will include the start date and the expected end date.</p>

<p>When a PPS job seeker with no mutual obligation requirements commences the NEIS Assistance/Small Business Coaching, it will auto-display on the <strong>OGP</strong> screen with the code '<strong>EIS</strong>' and will include the start date and the expected end date.</p>

<p>When a PPS job seeker with mutual obligation requirements elects to receive NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance, it will be recorded on the <strong>OGP</strong> screen. An activity, sent by the Department of Education, Skills and Employment (DESE), will auto code the <strong>OGP</strong> screen with the commencement date, amount and payment frequency of NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance. No coding is required by Service Officers.</p>

<p>The job seeker's income support payment will be reduced by the amount of NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance that they receive (direct deduction, dollar for dollar).</p>

<p>Alternatively, PPS job seekers can continue to receive their Services Australia ISP, rather than NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance from DESE. NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance will not be recorded on the <strong>OGP</strong> screen and no coding is required by Service Officers.</p>

<p>If a PPS job seeker attends a Centrelink Service Centre to claim an income support payment due to NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance suspension, the Service Officer will need to contact the NEIS/Self-Employment Assistance provider to confirm the job seeker's NEIS Assistance/Small Business Coaching suspension reason. If the suspension is due to a medical condition, and it is confirmed that NEIS /Self-Employment Allowance is suspended and all other eligibility rules are met, Service Officers can grant an income support payment for the period of the NEIS Assistance/Small Business Coaching participation suspension.</p>

<p>If the suspension is due to other reasons, such as not complying with NEIS Assistance/Small Business Coaching program requirements, Service Officers should reject the claim because the job seeker is receiving a precluding payment and refer the job seeker back to their NEIS/Self-Employment Assistance provider.</p>

<p>Service Officer should document any discussions with NEIS/Self-Employment Assistance providers and scan any documentation provided by the job seeker, which confirms suspension of participation in NEIS Assistance/Small Business Coaching.</p>

<p>JSP, YA and SpB job seekers have their payment auto-cancelled '<strong>CPP</strong>' (Customer on Precluding Payment) upon commencement in NEIS Assistance/Small Business coaching, on the basis that they are now receiving NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance instead. However, some of these job seekers may be entitled to a higher rate of income support than that paid under NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance.</p>

		<li>
JSP and SpB job seekers who are assessed as either 'Illness Separated', 'Respite Care Couple', or 'Partner in gaol'</li>
		</ul>
<p>These job seekers, if they have no affecting income, should be eligible to continue to receive a partial rate of their income support payment on top of their NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance after the dollar for dollar reduction has been applied.</p>

<p>The partial rate must be calculated manually, taking into account any income being received by the job seeker (including any business income associated with the new business being started under NEIS Assistance/Small Business Coaching). The partial rate is then set as a manual rate override. Any changes in income, which affect rate, must be manually calculated and set during this partial rate period until the NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance ceases.</p>

<p>If these job seekers also receive employment income, they may be eligible for Working Credit.</p>

<p>If this action was instigated internally by Services Australia (e.g. by actioning a list of NEIS Assistance/Small Business Coaching commencements who may still be eligible for a partial rate), rather than by the job seeker contacting us, Service Officers must make contact with the job seeker to explain what has happened. Otherwise, they may receive conflicting automatic letters from the agency about the cancellation and then restoration of their payment, which may cause confusion.</p>

<p>The job seeker must also be asked to provide information about any ongoing income and assets, and other circumstances that will factor into a manual rate calculation.</p>

<p>If the contact by phone is not successful, a manual request to contact letter (Q164) should be issued to the job seeker. Regardless of the outcome (contact or no contact, restoration or no restoration), a <strong>DOC</strong> must be created on the record to explain action taken and decisions made on eligibility.</p>

<p>Manual coding is only be undertaken by a Service Support Officer with the appropriate system resource to code manual rate.</p>

<p>After manually calculating the rate of JSP, YA or SpB payable after application of the income test (including a dollar for dollar direct deduction equivalent to the NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance rate), set a manual rate on the Rate Component Override (<strong>RCO</strong>) screen from the date of payment restoration.</p>

<p>To code a manual rate, see <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-12020010-01.html">NSS system coding for manual rate of payment</a>.</p>

<p>Does the manual rate coded on the <strong>RCO</strong> screen commence from the NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance start date as recorded on the <strong>OGP</strong> screen?</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>, finalise the activity via Assessment Results (<strong>AR</strong>)</li>
		<li>
<strong>No</strong>, on the <strong>RCO</strong> screen code the start date and end dates for the rate. The rate will be the difference between the rate at which NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance is paid, and the rate of payment the job seeker was in receipt of immediately prior to changing to NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance will usually run for a maximum period of 39 weeks. Service Officers will need to confirm the start and end dates.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Press [<strong>Enter</strong>]</li>
		<li>
Go the <strong>AEX</strong> screen and code the activity type as '<strong>NES</strong>', with the same dates as the dates on the <strong>RCO</strong> screen</li>
		<li>
Finalise the activity via <strong>AR</strong></li>
		</ul>
<p>Participants are entitled to have their manual rate reassessed in line with the March/September CPI increases. In these cases, create <a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-06090030-01.html">Manual Review</a> for the end of relevant month to reassess the manual rate.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a manual rate override is set, any earnings declared by the job seeker will not be auto-applied. Any changes to rate will need to be manually calculated and set on the <strong>RCO</strong> screen each time.</p>

<p>Where a NEIS Assistance/Small Business Coaching participant receives NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance from their provider, it is paid for the first 39 of the 52 weeks of NEIS Assistance/Small Business Coaching only. After this time, they can re-test their eligibility for income support payment (if they were cancelled), or have their rate of payment reassessed with no direct deductions due to NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance.</p>

<p>These participants will receive a letter from their NEIS/Self-Employment Assistance provider with details of their final payment of NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance. The letter will tell them to contact Centrelink to determine eligibility to any ongoing payments, including reclaiming income support if they were cancelled. The letter advises the participants to show Centrelink this letter as evidence of the cessation of NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance. Check that the NEIS Assistance/Small Business Coaching participant has uploaded this letter to their record.</p>

<p>These job seekers remain ineligible for provider participation until they complete NEIS Assistance/Small Business Coaching and are exited by their NEIS/Self-Employment Assistance provider.

<p>NEIS Assistance/Small Business Coaching participants still receiving a partial rate of a Pensions System or Parenting System payment, i.e. AGE, PPS, PPP, DSP or CP will have their NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance automatically zeroed from the correct date. This is triggered by an electronic advice received from the Department of Education, Skills and Employment system.</p>

<p>NEIS Assistance/Small Business Coaching participants claiming a Pension, Parenting or JobSeeker System payment will need to have their NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance <strong>manually zeroed by staff</strong> on the <strong>OGP</strong> screen. Otherwise, their claim will reject '<strong>CPP</strong>' (Customer on Precluding Payment).</p>

<p>The letter from the NEIS/Self-Employment Assistance provider is the only evidence required for staff to manually zero off NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance from the date NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance ceased. Ensure that the letter has been provided by the job seeker and scanned to their record. If necessary, e.g. job seeker has lost their letter, contact the NEIS/Self-Employment Assistance provider to get confirmation of the NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance cessation end date.</p>

<p>On the <strong>OGP</strong> screen, zero the NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance income (which displays on the <strong>OGP</strong> screen with the code '<strong>EIS</strong>') with a date of effect of the last date paid NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance plus 1.</p>

<p><strong>Manual Rate on RCO screen</strong></p>

<p>If a JSP, YAL or SpB job seeker was receiving a partial rate of payment via a manual rate override during NEIS Assistance/Small Business Coaching participation, staff must <strong>end the manual rate override</strong> from the date payment is being granted or reassessed.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> there are <strong>no special backdating provisions</strong> applying to job seekers claiming or requesting reassessments following NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance cessation.</p>

<p>NEIS Assistance/Small Business Coaching participants whose rate was reduced by NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance, will have this automatically zeroed on the <strong>OGP</strong> screen at 39 weeks. Service Officers will not have to manually zero NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance for these customers to restore payment back to full rate.</p>
