<p>Customers wanting to start a small business or who already run a micro-business can access Small Business Training. This accredited training course helps job seekers gain a nationally recognised qualification and is appropriate to starting and/or running a small business. Depending on the type of proposed new business, or existing micro business, the Self-Employment Assistance provider will refer the job seeker to either a&#58;</p>

		<li>
New Business Ventures Skill Set (BSBSS00103)</li>
		<li>
Small Business Management Skill Set (BSBSS00104)</li>
		</ul>
<p>During the training, job seekers will develop a Business Plan, which will need to be approved by their Self-Employment Assistance provider.</p>

<p>When a JobSeeker Payment (JSP), Youth Allowance (job seeker) (YA), Parenting Payment Single (PPS - not PNX) or Special Benefit (SpB) job seeker with mutual obligation requirements commences Small Business Training, the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR) send an advice to notify Services Australia. The activity will auto-display on the Activity and Exemption Summary (<strong>AEX</strong>) screen in Process Direct with the activity type code '<strong>Small Business Training</strong>'.</p>

<p>To view an approved activity in Process Direct&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Key '<strong>AEX</strong>' in the <strong>Super Key</strong>, select <strong>Enter</strong></li>
		<li>
The Activity and Exemption Summary (<strong>AEX</strong>) will display activity type '<strong>Small Business Training</strong>' with start and end dates as per DEWR's advice</li>
		</ul>
<p>For Disability Support Payment (DSP) customers with participation requirements and participating in Small Business Training, the <strong>AEX</strong> screen will not display the '<strong>Small Business Training</strong>' activity. Service Officers will need to access the <strong>Participation Summary</strong> page in Process Direct, then select the <strong>Activity type/Non-applied exemptions</strong> tab to view this activity. In addition, Service Officers can negotiate the DSP Participation Plan and include 'Small Business Training/Coaching' as required. For details on negotiating DSP Participation Plan, see <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03090060-01.html">Disability Support Pension (DSP) Participation Plan</a>.</p>

<p>Job seekers will be able to attend the Small Business Training activity, prior to the Small Business Coaching commencement date, and record their attendance as part of their points based activity (PBA). Job seekers undertaking Small Business Training may be eligible for EdEP. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-08050000-01.html">Education Entry Payment (EdEP)</a> for information on eligibility and coding requirements.</p>

<p>Participation in Small Business Training fully satisfies the customer's requirements and the customer will continue to receive their income support payment for the duration of their Small Business Training. The customer remains provider managed and their employment services provider should negotiate a Job Plan with the customer and include the Small Business Training activity.</p>

<p>DEWR send an advice to notify Services Australia when a job seeker in receipt of JobSeeker Payment (JSP), Youth Allowance (YA) and Special Benefit (SpB) (under JSP conditions) has commenced in Small Business Coaching under Self-Employment Assistance. The <strong>Small Business Coaching</strong> activity will auto-display on the Activity and Exemption Summary (<strong>AEX</strong>) screen. If the customer is also receiving the 'Self-Employment Allowance', the details will display on the Other Government Payments (<strong>OGP</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>JSP and SpB job seekers who are undertaking Small Business Coaching and eligible for a partial rate of income support payment, will be deemed as fully meeting their mutual obligation requirements. As such, Small Business Coaching participants (apart from those with DES or PNX providers) are managed by Services Australia and will be exited from their Workforce Australia Service provider's caseload, as they will not be required to attend any provider appointments. Service Officers must negotiate a new Job Plan with the Small Business Coaching participant.</p>

<p>When the Small Business Coaching activity notification is received from DEWR, the job seeker's income support payable rate (including add-ons) will be reduced by the amount of Self-Employment Allowance received (direct deduction, dollar-for-dollar). Self-Employment Allowance is paid at the 'single, 22 or over, with no children' rate of JobSeeker Payment (JSP) which will often be more than the job seeker's rate of income support, and will usually reduce the income support rate to nil.</p>

<p>If the job seeker is receiving a higher rate of JSP or SpB, they may have an ongoing entitlement to a partial rate of income support payment in addition to Self-Employment Allowance.</p>

<p>Where a customer's rate is reduced to <strong>nil</strong> due to combination of the Self-Employment Allowance and earnings, their income support payment status may display as '<strong>current at nil rate (CUR/CZR)</strong>'. Income support payment will auto cancelled after 6 consecutive fortnights of <strong>nil</strong> rate.</p>

<p>Services Australia's system will automatically code the <strong>OGP</strong> screen with the event start date, amount and payment frequency of Self-Employment Allowance as per advice received from DEWR. No coding is required by Service Officers.</p>

<p>Prior to 3 December 2022, some JSP or SpB customers in receipt of Self-Employment Allowance who were eligible for higher rates were coded with a manual top-up rate of income support. For information about continuing to pay manual rate of JSP or SpB as well as Self-Employment Allowance, see the <a href="../job-seekers/001-02100000-05.html">Resources</a> page.</p>

<p>JSP, YA and SpB job seekers who receive Self-Employment Allowance from DEWR and that results in cancellation of income support payment from Services Australia, may be eligible for a Low Income Health Care Card (LIC). These job seekers are required to lodge a claim for the LIC in order to receive the LIC.</p>

<p>When a JSP, YA or SpB job seeker is suspended from Small Business Coaching, an advice will be sent from DEWR and the Small Business Coaching end date will be auto-extended by 13 weeks on the <strong>AEX</strong> screen where the income support status is still current.</p>

<p>If a JSP, YA or SpB job seeker attends a service centre to claim or enquires about an income support payment due to Self Employment Allowance suspension, the Service Officer will need to contact the provider to confirm the job seeker's Small Business Coaching suspension reason. If the suspension is due to a medical condition, and it is confirmed that Self-Employment Allowance is suspended and all other eligibility rules are met, Service Officers can grant or reassess the rate of the income support payment for the period of the Small Business Coaching suspension.</p>

<p>If the suspension is due to other reasons, such as not complying with Small Business Coaching requirements, Service Officers should reject the claim because the job seeker is receiving a precluding payment and refer the job seeker back to their Self-Employment provider.</p>

<p>Service Officers should document any discussions with Self-Employment providers and scan any documentation provided by the job seeker, which confirms suspension of participation in Small Business Coaching.</p>

<p>For information about Small Business Coaching participants claiming income support payments after their Self-Employment Allowance ceases, see <a href="../job-seekers/001-02100000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Processing_clai01_Step">Table 9</a>.</p>

<p>When a Parenting Payment Partnered (PPP) job seeker commences Small Business Coaching, the activity will not display on the Activities and Exemptions (<strong>AEX</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>PPP job seekers who change from income support payment to Self-Employment Allowance may also be entitled to a partial rate payment from Services Australia. Self-Employment Allowance is paid at the 'single, 22 or over, with no children' rate of JobSeeker Payment (JSP). PPP is reduced by the amount of Self-Employment Allowance received (direct deduction, dollar-for-dollar), which will often be more than the job seeker's former rate of PPP, and will usually reduce the PPP rate to nil.</p>

<p>Therefore, most job seekers in receipt of PPP will be auto-cancelled upon receipt of Self-Employment Allowance.</p>

<p>An activity sent by DEWR, will auto code the <strong>OGP</strong> screen with the event start date, amount and payment frequency of Self-Employment Allowance. No coding is required by Service Officers.</p>

<p>PPP job seekers whose income support payment has been cancelled due to transfer to Self-Employment Allowance may be eligible for an extended concession card entitlement. These job seekers are required to lodge a claim for the LIC in order to receive the LIC.</p>

<p>If a PPS job seeker attends a Centrelink Service Centre to claim an income support payment due to Self-Employment Allowance suspension, the Service Officer will need to contact the Self-Employment Assistance provider to confirm the job seeker's Small Business Coaching suspension reason. If the suspension is due to a medical condition, and it is confirmed that Self-Employment Allowance is suspended and all other eligibility rules are met, Service Officers can grant an income support payment for the period of the Small Business Coaching participation suspension.</p>

<p>If the suspension is due to other reasons, such as not complying with Small Business Coaching program requirements, Service Officers should reject the claim because the job seeker is receiving a precluding payment and refer the job seeker back to their Self-Employment Assistance provider.</p>

<p>Service Officer should document any discussions with Self-Employment Assistance providers and scan any documentation provided by the job seeker, which confirms suspension of participation in Small Business Coaching.</p>

The letter advises the participants to show Centrelink this letter as evidence of the cessation of Self-Employment Allowance. Check that the Small Business Coaching participant has uploaded this letter to their record.</p>

<p>Small Business Coaching participants still receiving a partial rate of a payment will have their Self-Employment Allowance automatically zeroed from the 'Allowance End Date +1' as advised by DEWR.</p>

<p>Service Officers should check the <strong>OGP</strong> screen to ensure Self-Employment Allowance has been <strong>zeroed</strong>. Otherwise, their claim will reject '<strong>CPP</strong> - Customer on Precluding Payment' or '<strong>SEA</strong> - Self Employment Allowance'.</p>

<p>The letter from the Self-Employment Assistance provider is the only evidence required for staff to manually zero off Self-Employment Allowance from the date Self-Employment Allowance ceased. Ensure that the letter has been provided by the job seeker and scanned to their record. If necessary, e.g. job seeker has lost their letter, contact the Self-Employment Assistance provider to get confirmation of the Self-Employment Allowance cessation end date.</p>

<p>If needed, zero the Self-Employment Allowance on the <strong>OGP</strong> screen with a date of effect of the last date paid Self-Employment Allowance plus 1.</p>

<p><strong>Manual Rate on RCO screen</strong></p>

<p>If a JSP, YAL or SpB job seeker was receiving a partial rate of payment via a manual rate override during Small Business Coaching participation, staff must <strong>end the manual rate override</strong> from the date payment is being granted or reassessed.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> there are <strong>no special backdating provisions</strong> applying to job seekers claiming or requesting reassessments following Self-Employment Allowance cessation.</p>

<p>Small Business Coaching participants whose rate was reduced by NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance, will have this automatically zeroed on the <strong>OGP</strong> screen at 39 weeks. Service Officers will not have to manually zero Self-Employment Allowance for these customers to restore payment back to full rate.</p>

<p>To code or end a manual rate, see <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-12020010-03.html">NSS system coding for manual rate of payment</a>.</p>
