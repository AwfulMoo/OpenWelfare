<p>The partner is treated as an ex-partner for reconciliation purposes.</p>

<p>Partial FTB/CCB reconciliation can occur from 1 July of the lodgement year as soon as the customer (and current partner) have met their lodgement obligations&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
For the ex-partner period, estimates as provided during the relevant year are used for the customer and the ex-partner</li>
		<li>
For other periods, adequate income (for example, Actual adjusted taxable income (AATI) is used for the customer (and current partner if applicable)</li>
		<li>
All non AATI circumstances are assessed for the ex-partner period, including actual maintenance income for relevant periods. A debt may be calculated due to maintenance income and/or circumstance changes during the ex-partner period</li>
		<li>
FTB Part A supplement (If entitled) and Part B supplement will be included in the reconciliation result</li>
		<li>
Single Income Family Supplement (SIFS) is assessed using taxable income and will only be paid for a partnered period to eligible persons if partner income is known (reasonable estimate or taxable income details from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO)). A notification only to the ATO that a tax return is not necessary will not cause SIFS to reconcile. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> for the 2017-18 and later financial years, customers must meet the SIFS grandfathering provisions for payment of SIFS</li>
		<li>
Entitlement to the <a href="../families/007-11010060-01.html">FTB Part B quarantine period</a> is assessed if the lower income earner returned to work in the relevant year. For 2008-2009 onwards, Part B is subject to the primary income earner limit and the secondary earner income test</li>
		<li>
If the customer received less than their legislative FTB rate due to an FTB payment choice, any extra entitlement up to the legislative rate will be included</li>
		<li>
For 2006-2007 and following years, the customer's annual Child Care Rebate (CCR) entitlement will be calculated when partial reconciliation of CCB occurs</li>
		<li>
<a href="../families/007-11060000-03.html">Debt offsetting</a> may apply</li>
		</ul>

<p>The partner is treated as an ex-partner for reconciliation purposes.</p>

<p>Interim reconciliation will occur immediately after 1 July of the extended lodgement year if only actual adjusted taxable income (AATI) for the ex-partner is still required for final reconciliation to occur&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
FAO system calculates the customer's FTB/CCB entitlement using the most recent adequate income details, for example, actual income for the customer, most recent estimate for the ex-partner. Single Income Family Supplement (SIFS) is assessed using taxable income and will only be paid for a partnered period to eligible persons if partner income is known (reasonable estimate or taxable income details from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO)). <strong>Note&#58;</strong> for the 2017-18 and later financial years, customers must meet the SIFS grandfathering provisions for payment of SIFS</li>
		<li>
FAO system compares the above amount with the partial reconciliation result and applies the more favourable income. This is known as the ex-partner income comparison process. A top-up can be paid if the latest result is more favourable. <a href="../families/007-11060000-01.html">Family assistance debt offsetting</a> may apply</li>
		<li>
A re-reconciliation will occur if adequate income details change after interim reconciliation has occurred. When this happens, the ex-partner income comparison is conducted again and the FAO system again applies the more favourable income. Before 8 December 2008, there were some problems with this process; see <a href="../families/007-11010090-03.html#bp03_tbl_Debts_and_other_8">Item 8 in the Debts and other circumstances</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>See the <a href="../families/007-11010090-05.html">Resources</a> page for an example.</p>

<p>If the ex-partner's income falls into another interim reconciliation category, that is, 300 day income support and no FTB Part B paid, Child Disability Allowance (CDA)/Double Orphan Pension (DOP) saved rate, or low income review, interim reconciliation may occur at any time. For the 2014-15 or earlier financial years, <a href="../families/007-11010000-01.html">forced reconciliation</a> occurred in the November of the lodgement year.</p>

<p>This processing applies for the 2002-2003 financial year onwards only for FTB/CCB reconciliation and FTB lump sum claims.</p>

<p>The partner is treated as a previous partner for reconciliation purposes.</p>

<p>FTB/CCB reconciliation will occur using the previous partner's adjusted taxable income (ATI) if known. Single Income Family Supplement (SIFS) is assessed using taxable income and will only be paid for a partnered period to eligible persons if partner income is known (reasonable estimate or taxable income details from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO)). <strong>Note&#58;</strong> for the 2017-18 and later financial years, customers must meet the SIFS grandfathering provisions for payment of SIFS.</p>

<p>A non-lodgement exemption is only to be coded if the customer advises the previous partner is not required to lodge a tax return for the relevant year. See <a href="../families/007-11010080-01.html">Recording not required to lodge advice and previous year income</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Interim reconciliation</strong> occurs after the end of the lodgement year (from 1 July of the extended lodgement year) if only previous partner actual adjusted taxable income (AATI) is required, using the Most Recent Estimate (MRE) for the previous partner for the relevant year. <a href="../families/007-11060000-03.html">Debt offsetting</a> may apply.</p>

<p>The customer is <strong>not</strong> included in the non-lodger process if only the previous partner's actual adjusted taxable income (AATI) is required.</p>

<p>If an FTB lump sum claim for the 2012-2013 or later financial years is pending (awaiting partner income) when the separation is notified, and a Financial Year Estimate (FYE) has not been provided, the claim will remain pending until actual income is received or a not effective claim determination has been made because income has not been confirmed within the allowed time.</p>

<p>If the customer contacts on or after 1 July of the extended lodgement year to advise of a separation that occurred before the end of the lodgement year, and FTB reconciliation has not occurred and only the previous partner's AATI is required, process a '<strong>REA</strong>'ssessment activity on the Benefit Action (<strong>BA</strong>) screen, using 1 July of the relevant financial year as the date of effect (DOE) to trigger reconciliation.</p>

<p>Final reconciliation will occur if the previous partner's AATI is later received. An FTB top-up can be paid if either&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the first reconciliation results in a new decision and re-reconciliation occurs within 52 weeks of the customer being notified of that decision, or</li>
		<li>
the first reconciliation does not result in a new decision and re-reconciliation occurs by 30 June of the extended lodgement year</li>
		</ul>
<p>A debt may apply due to the previous partner's AATI.</p>

<p><strong>Australian Taxation Office (ATO) FTB lump sum claims</strong>&#58; if the customer claimed FTB as a lump sum through the ATO before 1 July 2009 for any part of the relevant financial year, the separation must also be coded on the ATO Non-lodger Partner Exemption (<strong>ATONLPE</strong>) screen.

a customer separates from their partner before the non-lodger debt is raised (September of the extended lodgement year), the non-lodger debt will be immediately written off if the previous partner has not confirmed their income</li>
		<li>
advice of a separation is received after the non-lodger debt has been raised, a temporary write-off of recovery of the non-lodger debt will occur, and any repayments made since the separation will be refunded to the customer</li>
		<li>
the customer re-partners with the previous partner, the write off will cease and recovery of the non-lodger debt will resume</li>
		</ul>
<p>Reconciliation can occur after actual income of both parties becomes available, however, supplements and top-ups will not be payable.</p>

<p>If an FTB lump sum claim for the 2012-2013 and later financial years is pending (awaiting partner income) when the separation is notified, it will remain pending until actual income is received or a not effective claim determination has been made because income has not been confirmed within the allowed time.</p>

<p>For the <strong>2011-2012</strong> and earlier financial years, the partner is treated as a previous partner for reconciliation purposes. FTB/CCB reconciliation will occur using the previous partner's actual adjusted taxable income (AATI) if known.</p>

<p>A non-lodgement exemption is only to be coded if the customer advises the previous partner is not required to lodge a tax return for the relevant year. See <a href="../families/007-11010080-01.html">Recording not required to lodge advice and previous year income</a>.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the separation is advised before a non-lodger debt is raised, interim reconciliation will occur if only the ex-partner's AATI is needed</li>
		<li>
If the separation occurs or is advised after a non-lodger debt is raised, the debt is cancelled and interim reconciliation will occur if only the ex-partner's AATI is needed</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Interim reconciliation</strong> uses the Most Recent Estimate (MRE) for the previous partner for the relevant year. <a href="../families/007-11060000-03.html">Debt offsetting</a> may apply.</p>

<p>If the customer contacts and reconciliation has not occurred and only the previous partner's AATI is required, process a '<strong>REA</strong>'ssessment activity on the Benefit Action (<strong>BA</strong>) screen to trigger reconciliation.</p>

<p><strong>Final reconciliation</strong> will occur if the previous partner's AATI is later received. An FTB top-up can be paid if either&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the first reconciliation results in a new decision and re-reconciliation occurs within 52 weeks of the customer being notified of that decision</li>
		<li>
the first reconciliation does not result in a new decision and re-reconciliation occurs by 30 June of the extended lodgement year</li>
		</ul>
<p>A debt may apply due to the previous partner's AATI.</p>

<p><strong>ATO FTB lump sum claims</strong>&#58; if the customer claimed FTB as a lump sum through the ATO before 1 July 2009 for any part of the relevant financial year, the separation must also be coded on the ATO Non-lodger Partner Exemption (<strong>ATONLPE</strong>) screen.

<p>The partner is treated as an ex-partner for reconciliation purposes.</p>

<p>Clause 3A, Schedule 3 of the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999 limits the effect of ex-partner income at reconciliation to either a top-up or nil adjustment. This means that ex-partner income cannot cause a debt for any period the customer was with their ex-partner in the financial year that the separation occurred. See the <a href="../families/007-11010090-04.html">References</a> page.</p>

<p>When family assistance reconciliation first occurred in 2001, the system solution used to apply Clause 3A was to suppress any debts that occurred in an ex-partner period. Although this ensured that ex-partner income could not cause a reconciliation debt, it also meant that other non-income related debts were suppressed (for example debts caused by circumstance changes, maintenance income). There have been a number of changes to the way the system treats ex-partner periods since family assistance reconciliation first commenced.</p>

<p>In the September and December 2005 releases (for FTB) and June 2006 (for CCB), a new process was introduced for 2002-2003 onwards so that only income related debts were prevented in ex-partner periods. The new process was known as the ex-partner period income comparison. See <a href="../families/007-11010090-03.html#bp03_tbl_Debts_and_other_8">Item 8 in the Debts and other circumstances</a> table. Unfortunately, there were some flaws in this process and in some circumstances it was still possible for a customer to incur an income related debt in an ex-partner period. Changes to correct this process were implemented in the December 2008 release.</p>

<p>The following is a summary of the system changes that have occurred for customers who were separated at 30 June of relevant year (ex-partner)&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
September and December 2005 system releases&#58; ex-partner income comparison process introduced for FTB customers for 2002-2003 onwards</li>
		<li>
16 June 2007 system release&#58; partial reconciliation introduced and timing of interim reconciliation was changed for FTB customers</li>
		<li>
10 September 2007 system release&#58; partial reconciliation introduced and timing of interim reconciliation was changed for CCB reduced fees customers (to align with FTB)</li>
		<li>
8 December 2008 system release&#58; changes introduced to correct the ex-partner income comparison process for FTB and CCB</li>
		</ul>
<p>Re-reconciliation may result in a debt or reduced top-up due to loss of qualification or maintenance income.</p>

<p>Before 8 December 2008 system release, re-reconciliation may have also resulted in a debt due to new income details, but this was not correct processing. See <a href="../families/007-11010090-03.html#bp03_tbl_Debts_and_other_8">Item 8 in the Debts and other circumstances</a> table.</p>

<p>These rules apply to customers who were partnered to a person during the relevant financial year but separated from that person after the lodgement year.</p>

<p>Amendments have been made to family assistance law that came into effect on 1 January 2006. The amendments ensure that a non-lodger debt that was raised after the end of the lodgement year should be set aside after separation <strong>if only the tax return of the </strong>previous partner<strong> is outstanding</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Setting aside non-lodger debt - customer separates during extended lodgement year</strong></p>

<p>If the customer remains separated from the previous partner when the non-lodger debt is calculated, it will be finalised no debt, and interim reconciliation will occur based on the previous partner's most recent estimate.</p>

<p>If the customer subsequently reconciles with the previous partner, the non-lodger debt will be re-raised if adequate income is still unavailable for the previous partner.</p>

<p>For 2000-2001 there was no extended lodgement year. If a customer separated in 2002-2003 or later, the separated after extended lodgement year process applies. See <a href="../families/007-11010090-03.html#bp03_tbl_FTBCCB_recipie_6">Item 6 in the Reconciliation of FTB/CCB for partnered customers</a> table.</p>

<p><strong>Writing off non-lodger debt - customer separates after extended lodgement year</strong></p>

<p>If the previous partner has not lodged their tax return by the time of separation, recovery of the non-lodger debt is temporarily written off.</p>

<p>The write off and refund applies from later of&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the date of separation</li>
		<li>
the date adequate income becomes available for the customer if it is not available at the time of separation</li>
		</ul>
<p>This process impacts FTB reconciliation for 2000-2001 and later years. (For 2000-2001 there was no extended lodgement year. If the customer separated in 2002-2003 or later, customers are treated the same as customers who separate after the extended lodgement year).</p>

<p>A refund is to be paid to the customer equal to the amount of the non-lodger debt that has been repaid since the <strong>later</strong> of&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the date of separation</li>
		<li>
the date actual income became available for the customer</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the debt has been fully repaid prior to the separation, write-off will not occur.</p>

<p>The write-off and refund of repayments should occur automatically when the separation is coded or actual income becomes available for the customer (whichever occurs later). The debt will now show as 'pending recovery action'.</p>

<p>If reconciliation does not occur automatically, complete an FTB refresh activity on the Benefit Action (<strong>BA</strong>) screen using the date of effect as 1 July of the relevant financial year to trigger re-reconciliation.</p>

<p>For reconciliation to take place when the customer or partner has died during the relevant financial year, the actual adjusted taxable income (AATI) of the late customer or partner needs to be annualised to apply the annual income tests for FTB and CCB for the period they were partnered.</p>

<p>The ex-partner period income comparison is performed whenever an interim or final reconciliation result is calculated for customers who separated from their partner during the relevant financial year.</p>

<p>This comparison is designed to ensure that the customer does not incur an income related overpayment in an ex-partner period.</p>

<p><strong>First e</strong>x-partner<strong> period income comparison</strong></p>

<p>The FAO system compares the customer's entitlement using income estimates provided during the relevant year with their entitlement using adequate income. For FTB lump sum claims, the system compares the customer's entitlement using the grant income with their entitlement using new (non-grant) income.</p>

<p>The income used is that which results in the most favourable outcome for the customer. This is then known as the favourable income.</p>

<p>The FAO Calculation Period Income Summary (<strong>FICS</strong>) screen displays the income used as a result of the ex-partner period income comparison process and includes a description of the income that was used. For example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Ex-partner Comparison&#58; Favourable (Adequate)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Subsequent ex-partner period income comparisons</strong></p>

<p>Another comparison will occur every time there is a re-reconciliation.</p>

<p>From 8 December 2008, the FAO system compares the customer's entitlement using the new adequate income with their entitlement using the income deemed most favourable in the previous reconciliation, and again uses the more favourable income.</p>

<p><strong>System limitation prior to 8 December 2008</strong></p>

<p>The system was only able to compare Estimates As Provided with the latest Adequate Income. This meant that in some circumstances the customer was disadvantaged. This occurred most commonly where the customer's and/or ex-partner's Adequate Income has changed.</p>

<p>See the <a href="../families/007-11010090-05.html">Resources</a> page for an example.</p>

<p>A clean-up of cases where the customer was disadvantaged due to this system limitation was conducted in early 2009. Cases identified before the clean-up were <a href="../families/007-11010000-01.html">manually adjusted</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Ex-partner period income comparison overrides</strong></p>

<p>In some cases it will be necessary to override the income deemed most favourable in an ex-partner period, for example, where a customer has been disadvantaged due to the system limitation described above.</p>

<p>This is done using the FTB Ex-Partner Period Override (<strong>FEXPO</strong>) and CCB Ex-Partner Period Override (<strong>KEXPO</strong>) screens. Access to update these screens is limited to selected network and National Support Office staff, but all staff will be able to view the screens.</p>

<p>If an override has been coded, this will be displayed on the <strong>FICS</strong> screen as Override.</p>

<p>If income details or an ex-partner period change after an override has been coded, the record will be selected for <a href="../families/007-11080000-01.html">manual intervention</a> so that the override income can be updated if required.</p>
