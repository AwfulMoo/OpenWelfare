<p>The Income Assessment Mode indicates where the income used in the CCB reconciliation calculation came from.</p>

<p>The FAO Calculation Period Income Summary (<strong>FICS</strong>) screen displays the income assessment mode used for each income component. See <a href="../families/007-11070020-01.html">CCB reconciliation and lump sum claim calculation screens</a>.</p>

<p>A different income mode may be used for the customer, current partner and ex-partner. Actual income of a deceased customer or partner is converted to an annualised actual income amount.</p>

<p>Income modes apply at the income component level according to the following hierarchy&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Actual Income (AIN)</strong>. Actual adjusted taxable income details which override estimated taxable income, <a href="../families/007-07080020-01.html">reportable fringe benefits</a> (including any exempt reportable fringe benefits) and net rental property losses. A different income mode applies to other income components</li>
		<li>
<strong>Financial Year Estimate (FYE)</strong>. The estimate of income component recorded on the FAO Income for Previous Year (<strong>FIPY</strong>) screen that was provided in the current financial year but applies to the relevant financial year. For non-taxable pension/benefit, this mode is used only where the estimate is higher than the actual amount known to be paid</li>
		<li>
<strong>Most Recent Estimate (MRE)</strong>. The latest estimate recorded for the income component up to the end of that financial year on ongoing income screens (that is, FAO Taxable Income screen). For non-taxable pension/benefit, '<strong>MRE</strong>' is the mode used only where the estimate is higher than the actual amount known to be paid</li>
		<li>
<strong>Centrelink Actual (CAI)</strong>. The actual amount of non-taxable pension/benefit paid to the customer from Tax Cluster details, where this amount is higher than the estimate recorded on the <strong>FIPY</strong> screen or ongoing income screens</li>
		<li>
<strong>Estimates as Provided (EAP)</strong>. During partial reconciliation for the ex-partner period only, EAP is used for the customer and the ex-partner. Each estimate is applied from the date of event recorded for the estimate. Adequate income is used for other periods (for example, customer actual income). EAP may also be used in an interim or final reconciliation, where it is the more favourable income in the ex-partner income comparison. See <a href="../families/007-11010090-01.html">Previous partners and Family Tax Benefit (FTB) and Child Care Benefit (CCB) reconciliation</a></li>
		<li>
<strong>Ex-Partner No Estimate (XNE)</strong> is used where there is no estimate recorded for the ex-partner. CCB is limited to the zero rate for the ex-partner period</li>		</ul>

<p>Manual adjustments which are applied to the reconciliation result by Manual Intervention Team (MIV) will be displayed. Where the CCB reconciliation result has been manually adjusted, the adjusted CCB entitlement amount will be higher if the adjustment was positive or lower if the adjustment was negative.</p>

<p>When reconciliation of Child Care Benefit (CCB) for approved care (CCF) occurs and the result is a negative amount (that is, the customer was overpaid), in some circumstances a CCF Special Adjustment is applied in the CCB and in the CCR calculation.</p>

<p>From the 2013-14 financial year, CCF Special Adjustments no longer occur for periods where the customer or their partner were in receipt of an income support payment.</p>

<p>For 2000-01 to 2012-13 financial years, these amounts are displayed as a CCF special adjustment, but in June 2016 the Department waived these amounts under Section 97(1) of the Family Assistance (Administration) Act 1999.</p>

<p>For 2000-01 and 2001-02 financial years, for weeks where the customer was partnered during the relevant income year but was not partnered to that person as at 30 June, that is they had an ex-partner. From 2002-03 and onwards changes in the reconciliation process means overpayments for ex-partner periods no longer occur.

<p>A child needs to meet the immunisation requirements as at the Date of Receipt (DOR) of the lump sum claim for CCB purposes. There is no requirement to check immunisation status for the periods of attendance.</p>

<p><strong>For both instalment and lump sum customers</strong></p>

<p>A child's immunisation status is obtained from the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) once the child's record is linked. Customers are not required to provide further documentary evidence of a child's immunisation status.</p>

<p><strong>2015-16 CCB immunisation reconciliation impacts</strong></p>

<p>The â€˜No Jab, No Payâ€™ measure resulted in a greater than anticipated demand for vaccinations, putting pressure on state and territories processing these records. To ensure that customers who had made efforts to meet the immunisation requirements were not financially disadvantaged, CCB customers who had a transition immunisation grace period with an end date on or between 18 March 2016 and 30 April 2016 were paid conditional Child Care entitlements until <strong>30 April 2016</strong>.</p>

<p>If the CCB child continued to <strong>not</strong> meet the immunisation requirements when reconciliation occurred for the 2015-16 year, a debt was raised for any conditional payments of CCB or CCR that were made between 18 March and 30 April 2016..</p>

For this to occur all of the following must occur&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
The customer has been assessed for part or all of the prior financial year/s as a reduced fee (instalment) customer</li>
			<li>
The customer lodges and is granted a CCF reduced fees claim in the current financial for an â€˜additionalâ€™ child, <strong>and</strong></li>
			<li>
Services Australia has attendance recorded for the â€˜additionalâ€™ child for the past financial year/s for the periods the customer was in receipt of CCF as reduced fees. In this circumstance the system recognises the periods in the previous financial years as â€˜instalmentâ€™ periods and may pay arrears for the â€˜additionalâ€™ child for those periods. If the customer has provided verbal confirmation they wish to claim as a lump sum for the most recent financial year, the arrears for that year are payable. The arrears for any year prior to the last financial year are <strong>not</strong> payable. The relevant Act reference to not pay the arrears is Section 49J of the Family Assistance (Administration) Act</li>		</ul>
		<li>
And cannot be corrected by updating details on the customer's record, the result must be manually adjusted on the FAO Reconciliation Manual Adjustment (<strong>FRMA</strong>) screen. For any CCR adjustments the Childcare Rebate Manual Adjustment (<strong>CRMA</strong>) screen is updated</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>To have the reconciliation result manually adjusted on the FRMA/CRMA screen</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
First ensure the reconciliation result has been <a href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/109-03000000-01.html">internally reviewed</a> as appropriate and/or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT)</li>
		<li>
Use <strong>Fast Note</strong> - select <strong>Auto text</strong> &gt; <strong>Families</strong> &gt; <strong>Reconciliation</strong> &gt; <strong>ACTDOC Manual Correction on FRMA</strong> include all the following details&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Customer Reference Number (CRN)</li>
			<li>
customer name</li>
			<li>
partner name</li>
			<li>
relevant income year</li>
			<li>
service reason (CCF/FTB)</li>
			<li>
the date and activity number (AMR) of the reconciliation result that needs to be changed</li>
			<li>
the full reason why the reconciliation result needs to be adjusted (including relevant sections of the Act)</li>
			<li>
date of <strong>DOC</strong> completed by review officer/Legal Services Officer</li>
			<li>
full manual calculations for the new entitlement (period by period)</li>
			<li>
new total adjustment amount</li>
			<li>
the contact details of the requesting officer</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>The MIV team will check the activity result, making any required updates and contact the original Service Officer via MS Teams or email requesting the activity be finalised.</p>

<p>If the customer/partner circumstances are not correctly reflected on the system, the activity will not be actioned and referred back for correction. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the adjustment is due to the â€˜additional childâ€™ issue above the calculations are not required and it should be noted arrears are outside allowable timeframe and the above Act reference quoted/documented.</p>

<p>In all cases, <strong>DOC</strong> the customer's record.</p>
