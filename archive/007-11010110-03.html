<div class="showcont">


<p><strong>Potential non-lodgers</strong></p>

<p>Potential non-lodger debts are calculated in early July following the end of the lodgement year. The potential non-lodger status will remain in place until the outstanding lodger confirms their income allowing for reconciliation or until a non-lodger debt is raised, whichever comes first.</p>

<p>A Newborn Upfront Payment (NBU) qualification debt will be raised in July when the potential non-lodger debt is calculated if a customer had been paid NBU during the non-lodger financial year.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a customer is identified as a potential non-lodger in July, and a special circumstances income lodgement extension is granted before the non-lodger debt raising in late October, the non-lodger debt will not be raised until the special circumstances extension period has lapsed, which will extend the period of time the status is 'potential non-lodger'.</p>

<p><strong>Potential non-lodgers after previously been reconciled</strong></p>

<p>If the FAO Reconciliation &amp; Claim Summary (<strong>FRCS</strong>) screen for the relevant financial year displays the most recent calculation as 'potential non-lodger' and the previous reconciliation result was a debt, the reconciliation debt may show as over-recovered on the Debt List (<strong>OPDL</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>If an FTB reconciliation debt has been over-recovered due to the customer being identified as a potential non-lodger, see <a href="../families/007-11010110-03.html#bp03_tbl_Checking_for_re_Step08">Step 8 in the Checking for receipt of actual income details and actions table</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Non-lodger debt</strong></p>

<p>A non-lodger debt is automatically raised for all FTB (including Newborn Supplement (NBS) or Stillborn Baby Payment (SBP)) paid for the relevant financial year if actual income details are not received by the last Monday of October following the end of the lodgement year.</p>

<p>The raising of FTB non-lodger debts for the 2019-20 financial year was deferred until 19 January 2022. This was due to the agency’s pause on debt raising for customers impacted by COVID-19 lockdowns.</p>

<p>Recovery action will start 28 days from the date the account payable letter is sent, unless an extension is applied due to the agency’s pause on debt recovery for customers impacted by COVID-19 lockdowns or natural disasters.</p>

<p><strong>Sunset Clause</strong></p>

<p>FTB instalments will immediately cancel under the Sunset Clause if the non-lodger debt is the third or subsequent non-lodger assessment.</p>

<p><strong>Prohibition</strong></p>

<p><a href="../families/007-11010120-01.html">Prohibition of FTB Instalment Payments (PIP)</a> may apply if the customer or their partner has an outstanding non-lodger debt status. </p>

<p>A 75 day grace period starts on the date the relevant non-lodger debt is raised, before <a href="../families/007-11010120-01.html">PIP commences</a>.</p>

<p>PIP applies until all relevant non-lodger debts are resolved or repaid.</p>

<p><strong>Income received</strong></p>

<p>If actual income details are later received, reconciliation will occur and the reconciliation result will replace the non-lodger debt.</p>

<p><strong>Late lodgers</strong></p>

<p>If tax returns are required and are lodged after the end of the allowable period, the late lodger process applies. See <a href="../families/007-11010110-03.html#bp03_tbl_Checking_for_re_Step04">Step 4 in Checking for receipt of actual income details and actions</a> table.</p>

<p>Ensure they are aware of their obligations to check their circumstances with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and the consequences of an incorrect assessment.</p>

<p>Services Australia may use payroll information from the ATO to work out if customers and/or partners may be required to lodge a tax return. This only occurs if the employer reports to the ATO through Single Touch Payroll (STP).</p>

<p>The customer and/or partner will need to lodge a tax return or seek an ATO exemption from lodgement, if payroll information shows income&#58;</p>

		</ul>
<p>Any attempt to advise non-lodgement of a tax return using the 'Advise non-lodgement of tax return' service, will result in a 'not accepted' outcome. The receipt page will provide the reason/s for this decision and direct the customer to lodge a tax return or seek an ATO exemption from lodgement. Customers are advised not to attempt another update as the advice on non-lodgement will likely remain as 'not accepted'.</p>

<p>If further advice is needed about whether they are required to lodge a tax return, the customer should be advised to visit the ATO website for more information.</p>

if a negative result is calculated between the legislative entitlement based on estimates and the actual entitlement, the amount deferred during the MCFF/PIP period (if eligible) will be offset or reduce the negative result and may result in a negative, positive or nil reconciliation outcome</li>
