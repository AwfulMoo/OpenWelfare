<p>A residency decision should be made within 56 days. However, the timeframe will be dependent on whether additional contact with the customers is necessary including sending the questionnaire, if required. Manage the customer’s expectations in line with <a href="../separated-parents/277-01100000-01.html">Customer Management Approach (CMA) for Child Support</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Make a residency decision</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Review and consider the information already provided in the referral or other communication </li>
		<li>
If there is <strong>not</strong> sufficient information to make a decision, further contact may be required</li>
		</ul>
<p>There must be enough information to consider the tests to determine Australian residency and date of effect of the residency decision. The <a href="../separated-parents/277-08310020-04.html">References</a> page contains a link to the Child Support Guide 1.6.1 Australian Residence – Parent or Non-parent Carer.</p>

<p>If the residency decision being considered is for a payee&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
in an Australian assessment who is now residing in New Zealand, <a href="../separated-parents/277-08310020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Gather_and_revi_Step02">go to Step 2</a></li>
		<li>
on a new registration transmitted to Child Support by a Central Authority, <a href="../separated-parents/277-08310020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Gather_and_revi_Step03">go to Step 3</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>If the eligibility of a ‘child’ is being considered in relation to residency, <a href="../separated-parents/277-08310020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Gather_and_revi_Step04">go to Step 4</a>.</p>

<p>Review the information gathered and recorded in the Residency Referral window. Consider if any of the circumstances listed below exist&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they are a new customer</li>
		<li>
no successful contact has been made with the customer for whom the residency decision is being considered</li>
		<li>
incomplete information has been gathered for the customer</li>
		<li>
it has been more than 6 months since the last contact has occurred, and/or</li>
		<li>
conflicting evidence has been received. For example, Department of Home Affairs check indicates the customer is no longer in France, when advice has not been received to the contrary</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Do any of the circumstances exist?</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>, contact the customer. Send an MX1-1 Request for customer to contact, including, where there is no response, that a decision will be made based on the information held </li>
		<li>
<strong>No</strong>, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-08310020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Apply_tests_to_Step01">Step 1 in the Apply tests to determine residency</a> table</li>		</ul>

<p>The country in which the payee is habitually resident in has jurisdiction. For more detailed information the <a href="../separated-parents/277-08310020-04.html#bp04_L2LL_Policy">References</a> page contains links to the Child Support Guide&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
1.5.2&#58; International agreements and conventions and </li>
		<li>
1.6.4&#58; Habitual Residency under the Australia-New Zealand agreement</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Advice received</strong></p>

<p>Where Child Support has been advised by the payer, the payee or the Central Authority (in this case NZ) that the payee is residing in New Zealand (NZ) written confirmation must be requested.</p>

<p>If either customer verbally advises the payee is resident of NZ they must be given the opportunity to provide the advice in writing.</p>

<p><strong>Has the payee made contact?</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>, confirm the payee habitually a resident of NZ. Once verbal and/or written confirmation has been received to advise the payee is residing in NZ, send a request to NZIR to confirm if the payee is habitually resident of NZ. This is done via the <strong>New Zealand daily exchange spreadsheet</strong> located on G Drive. The residency decision is applied from the date the first written notification was received from the payer, payee or NZIR. <a href="../separated-parents/277-08310020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Gather_and_revi_Step05">Go to Step 5</a></li>
		<li>
<strong>No</strong>, contact the payee. All attempts must be made to contact the payee to ask where they believe they are habitually resident of. If the payee is likely to be habitually resident of New Zealand request written confirmation, if not already received. Advise them of their option to apply through New Zealand Inland Revenue (NZIR). The <a href="../separated-parents/277-08310020-05.html#bp05_L2GT_External_websit">Resources</a> page contains a link to NZIR</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer advises they have already applied through NZIR consider Article 7 of the Australia-New Zealand Agreement and whether this will result in an earlier terminating event, usually the day before the NZ assessment commenced. The <a href="../separated-parents/277-08310020-05.html#bp05_L2LL_International_A">References</a> page contains a link to Australia-New Zealand Agreement.</p>

<p><strong>Conflicting evidence</strong></p>

<p>If there is conflicting evidence to suggest the payee is not habitually resident of NZ, conduct further investigation.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when processing an article 5 or 7 end, review the formula modifications on all associated Australian assessments to make sure the assessments reflect the NZ cases appropriately.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>Written notification is received from NZ on 01 April 2011 that the payee is habitually resident of NZ. Department of Home Affairs however shows that although the customer went to NZ on 01 March 2011 they returned to Australia on 20 March 2011. From this information it does not appear that the customer is habitually resident of NZ.</p>

<p>In some circumstances it may be necessary to request further information from NZIR. If the customer’s habitual residency is unclear escalate to a Service Support Officer (SSO) for further assistance. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-09140000-01.html">Technical support in Child Support</a>.</p>

<p>See <a href="../separated-parents/277-08310020-03.html#bp03_tbl_01_Step01">Step 1 in the Contact customer</a> table.</p>

<p>Where an application has been transmitted to Child Support via a Central Authority contact with the payee may not be possible or the Central Authority itself may be the payee. In these instances, residency status of the applicant will be assumed to be that of the transmitting authority unless there is conflicting evidence.</p>

<p>When making a decision regarding the customer’s residency, consider the information provided&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
in the original transmittal</li>
		<li>
by the respondent during the pre-registration</li>
		<li>
about the residency of the applicant</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Is there any conflicting information/evidence about the customer’s residency?</strong></p>

<strong>Yes</strong>, a detailed residency decision may be required. Escalate to an SSO to discuss. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-08310020-03.html#bp03_tbl_01_Step01">Step 1 in the Contact customer</a> table</li>
		<li>

<p>Child Support is required to confirm eligibility of a child in relation to residency in the following instances&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the payee’s residency is outside Australia either at the point of registration or if it changes during the life of the case</li>
		<li>
the child is not in the same country as the parents for example, the child is at boarding school in NZ and the parents are both in Australia, or</li>
		<li>
one of the parents is disputing the child’s eligibility</li>
		</ul>
<p>The <a href="../separated-parents/277-08310020-04.html">References</a> page contains a link to the Child Support Guide and relevant legislation.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
To confirm the child is eligible under the Assessment Act, the child must meet the eligibility tests under section 24 of the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989. They must also meet the residence requirements for a child support assessment. Conditions and requirements are outlined in the Child Support Guide 2.1.2&#58; Eligible child</li>
		<li>
Residence requirements for a child do not apply if the payee is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction. For more information, see the Child Support Guide 1.6.3&#58; Resident of reciprocating jurisdiction</li>
		</ul>
<p>Is the child automatically eligible?</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>, process the residency decision on Cuba. See <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-30010770-01.html">Residency Cuba Process Help</a>.</li>
		<li>
<strong>No</strong>, the child must meet 1 of the following 3 eligibility tests to be eligible&#58;</li>

<p><strong>Australian citizenship can be acquired automatically by birth or by adoption</strong></p>

<p>A person born in Australia before 20 August 1986 is an Australian citizen</p>

<p>A person born in Australia on or after 20 August 1986 is an Australian citizen only if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the person's parent was an Australian citizen or a permanent resident when the person was born, or</li>
		<li>
the person was ordinarily resident in Australia from the day they were born until they were 10 years old</li>
		</ul>
<p>A child who is adopted by 1 or more Australian citizens is an Australian citizen if the child is present in Australia as a permanent resident at the time they are adopted under the law of an Australian state or territory.</p>

<p><strong>Australian citizenship by application</strong></p>

<p>A person who is not an Australian citizen may acquire Australian citizenship by application to the Minister for Immigration.</p>

<p><strong>Losing Australian citizenship</strong></p>

<p>A person ceases to be an Australian citizen if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the person renounces their Australian citizenship</li>
		<li>
where citizenship was acquired by application, the person's citizenship is revoked by the Minister for Immigration, or</li>
		<li>
the person served in the armed forces of a country at war with Australian Government</li>
		</ul>
<p>If at the time the person ceases to be an Australian citizen, that person is also a responsible parent of a child under 18, the Minister may revoke the child's Australian citizenship.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>To determine if a child is a citizen of Australia</strong>&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
contact the parent who the child is living with to request details</li>
		<li>
contact the other customer</li>
			<ul>			<li>
if no conflicting information, a decision can be made</li>
			<li>
if conflicting information, give both customers the opportunity to provide evidence and make a decision based on the evidence provided</li>		</ul>
		<li>
conduct a search for the child using the Department of Home Affairs Movements Reconstruction database (MR)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if Department of Home Affairs shows an arrival record, request a PAX card to confirm the details provided by the customers. If Department of Home Affairs shows a departure record prior to 1 July 2017, request a PAX card to confirm the details provided by the customers. Some children have dual citizenship, if this includes citizenship of Australia this satisfies the eligibility of the child.</p>

<p><strong>Is the test satisfied?</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>

<p>To make a decision about whether the child is ordinarily resident in Australia, use the previously gathered information, particularly the ordinary concepts test. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-08310020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Apply_tests_to_Step02">Step 2 in the Apply tests to determine residency</a> table.</p>

<p>To determine where the child is ordinarily resident, determine where the child lives day to day.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>Payee and child are in Thailand for 3 months, normally live in Australia and go to school in Australia, the child may not be physically present in Australia.</p>

<p>If the child is not physically present in Australia or there is any conflicting information, contact the other customer to ask if the child is ordinarily resident of Australia. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-01010000-01.html">Contact with Child Support customers</a>. If they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>agree</strong>, the test is satisfied. An Australian residency decision can be made for the child, <a href="../separated-parents/277-08310020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Gather_and_revi_Step09">go to Step 9</a></li>
		<li>

<p>Contact the customer to obtain the necessary information to make a residency decision. Send an MX1-1 Request for customer to contact, advising a decision will be made based on the information held if there is no response.  </p>

<p>Depending on the reasons for contact (see <a href="../separated-parents/277-08310020-03.html#bp03_L3TT_">Gather and review information Table 1</a>) ask the customer appropriate questions to gather information. </p>

<p>For assistance with the types of questions that may be required, see the Customer advice received by phone section in <a href="../separated-parents/277-08310010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Gathering_relev_Step02">Residency Referrals for Child Support customers - Domestic Service Officer</a>. </p>

<p>Further questions (not listed at step 2) may be required to obtain the information needed, because this information is required when applying the tests to determine Australian residency.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; where it is identified conflicting evidence has emerged, advise the customer that Child Support is following up. Give the customer an opportunity to provide recent information. <br>Send an MX1-1 Request for customer to contact, advising that if there is no response, a decision will be made based on the information held.</p>

<p>If the <strong>payee</strong> contacts by phone, confirm disbursement details. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-08310020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Record_decision_Step03">Step 3 in the Record decision and notify both customers</a> table,</p>

<p>If the <strong>payer</strong> contacts by phone&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
discuss the importance of a correct assessment and updating incomes where new information is available, <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
negotiate payment of overdue child support </li>
		</ul>
<p>Information gathered about the customer’s residency must be documented for <strong>payer</strong> and <strong>payee</strong> in the Communication window. </p>

<p>If the customer advises they are a resident of a non-reciprocating jurisdiction, contact with the other customer <strong>must</strong> be made, <a href="../separated-parents/277-08310020-03.html#bp03_tbl_01_Step03">go to Step 3</a>.</p>

<p>Contact with the other customer is <strong>not </strong>required where the customer advises they are a resident of Australia or a reciprocating jurisdiction and there is no contrary information. </p>

<p>If the customer has&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>resided</strong> in Australia, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-08310020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Apply_tests_to_Step01">Step 1 in the Apply tests to determine residency</a> table</li>

<p>Contact with the other customer is required where the residency decision will result in a terminating event. For example, if the other customer is a resident of Germany and the customer's action in leaving Australia will result in a residency decision being made (other than Australia), this will be a terminating event, <a href="../separated-parents/277-08310020-03.html#bp03_tbl_01_Step03">go to Step 3</a>.</p>

<p>Before documenting any search result in the Collection Window and notifying the Service Officer, the Residency Team Leader must be satisfied the search has identified the correct person. The information gathered must only be either the contact information for the customer or information which may assist in making the decision.</p>

<p>If contact details for the customer have been located, the Service Officer must refer to <a href="../separated-parents/277-01050000-01.html">Customer location (Tracing)<strong></a> </strong>and verify the customer's details prior to updating these in Cuba.</p>

<p>Where the customer <strong>cannot</strong> be contacted, Child Support must be satisfied of where the customer is resident using a combination of other sources to gather additional evidence. Possible combinations include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Advice received from a Central Authority that customer is resident in their jurisdiction. In this instance, in the absence of any contrary information, Child Support will be satisfied that they are a resident of that jurisdiction</li>
		<li>
Verbal advice from other customer, see the 'Advice received from third party' step in <a href="../separated-parents/277-08310010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Gathering_relev_Step06">Residency referrals for Child Support customers - Domestic Service Officer</a></li>

		<li>
Search results from Electronic White Pages (EWP)</li>
		<li>
Search results from Social Media (Facebook and LinkedIn)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Reliability of the evidence must be considered and assessed including where the evidence has come from and the age of the evidence. This should form part of the information used to decide what weight a piece of evidence should have. Also appropriate follow up on leads is required to support future decisions. A lead includes information obtained via Google, EWP or Social Media.</p>

<p>Prior to utilising information located via Social Media, Service Officers must verify its authenticity. The information gathered may not be used as the sole evidence for a decision, however may be utilised to corroborate information provided via other sources.</p>

<p>Use the information and evidence provided to determine if the customer is a resident of Australia. If the customer is a resident of Australia under any of these tests, then the customer is deemed a resident of Australia. No further tests need to be considered.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58; </strong>Child Support uses the same tests as the ATO<strong> but </strong>is not bound by ATO private rulings for individual taxpayers. This means that a customer may be referred to as a non-resident by the ATO but not by Child Support. Child Support is required to make a decision using the facts and evidence it has gathered to determine if a customer is a resident of Australia for Child Support legislation.</p>

<div class="showcont">


<p>The first test is to determine if the customer is resident of Australia under the ordinary concepts test. If the customer is deemed to be a resident of Australia under this test no further tests are required.</p>

<p>If a person has always lived in Australia and continues to live in Australia they will be resident of Australia under ordinary concepts.</p>

<p>Examples of Australian residency under this test are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
A person who usually resides in Australia but is overseas on holidays continues to be an Australian resident during their absence</li>
		<li>
A migrant who comes to Australia intending to reside here permanently is a resident from arrival</li>
		</ul>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; non-resident entering Australia, where a person who was not previously a resident of Australia enters Australia, Child Support will consider whether the person has become a resident of Australia according to the ordinary meaning of resident or the statutory 183 day test. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-08310020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Apply_tests_to_Step06">Step 6.</a></p>

<p><strong>Does the customer satisfy the ordinary concepts test?</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>, a residency decision can be made, <a href="../separated-parents/277-08310020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Apply_tests_to_Step09">go to Step 9</a></li>
		<li>
<strong>No</strong>, up to 3 secondary tests must be completed to determine if the customer is a resident of Australia. <a href="../separated-parents/277-08310020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Apply_tests_to_Step03">Go to Step 3</a></li>		</ul>

<p>To satisfy this test the customer or their spouse must be a current Commonwealth Government employee.</p>

<p>For example, Delphi is a resident of Australia because of working for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. This is despite having been posted to Thailand for a period of 3 years. This is because Delphi is a current Commonwealth Government employee.</p>

<p>There are 2 steps to this test&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
determine the customer’s domicile, and/or</li>
		<li>
determine the customer’s permanent place of abode</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Domicile</strong></p>

<p>A person’s domicile is acquired at birth (domicile of origin at birth). This is the domicile of their parents.</p>

<p>A customer will have adopted a new domicile if they can demonstrate an intention to make their home indefinitely in another country either by choice or operation of law. For example, the customer has obtained a migration visa with the intention to remain in that country.</p>

<p>For more detailed information, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-08310020-04.html">References</a>  for a link to The Child Support Guide 1.6.1&#58; Australian residence parent or non-parent carer - search for the Domicile section.</p>

<p>If the customer’s domicile is outside Australia, the domicile test is <strong>not</strong> satisfied, <a href="../separated-parents/277-08310020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Apply_tests_to_Step07">go to Step 7</a>.</p>

<p>If the customer’s domicile is Australia, their permanent place of abode must be considered, see <strong>Permanent place of abode</strong> below.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> domicile can be difficult to determine without information from the customer. </p>

<p>If&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
contact with the customer has not been possible </li>
		<li>
there is a possibility that the customer’s domicile is Australia, and</li>
		<li>
there is insufficient information available to consider making a decision on domicile</li>
		</ul>
<p>consideration of permanent place of abode should be applied.</p>

<p><strong>Permanent place of abode</strong></p>

<p>A permanent place of abode <strong>does not</strong> have to be ‘everlasting’ or ‘forever’. A customer who intends to return to live in Australia in the foreseeable future can still set up a ‘permanent place of abode’ elsewhere.</p>

<p>To determine the customer’s permanent place of abode, consider the following factors&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
what is the intended and actual length of the customer’s stay in the overseas country</li>
		<li>
does the customer intend to return to Australia at some definite point in time or to travel to another country</li>
		<li>
has the customer established a home outside Australia</li>
		<li>
has the customer abandoned their residence or place of abode in Australia</li>
		<li>
what is the duration and continuity of the customer’s presence in the overseas country, and</li>
		<li>
what is the durability of the customer’s association with a particular place in Australia</li>
		</ul>
<p>The weight to be given to each factor will vary with individual circumstances of each case and no single factor is conclusive.</p>

<p>If attempts to contact the customer have been unsuccessful, there is insufficient information to determine a permanent place of abode and the customer’s domicile is Australia, <a href="../separated-parents/277-08310020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Apply_tests_to_Step05">go to Step 5</a>. </p>

<p>SSO support <strong>must</strong> be sought where a default decision is being considered.</p>

<p>If customer left Australia on or after 1 July 2017 no departure card information will be available.</p>

<p>Where customer contact is unsuccessful and there is no other information available other than the customer’s date of departure, use the dot points below, to make a default decision regarding a customer’s residency.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Length of time customer has been outside Australia&#58; 6 months to less than 2 years</li>

<p>If the customer left Australia before 1 July 2017 use the information contained on a customer’s PAX card obtained via a Department of Home Affairs search. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-04370020-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Overseas_travel">External searches guide</a> - Specialised searches Level 2. Apply the points below to make a decision regarding a customer’s residency. </p>

<p>Use the following bullets as the default residency decision where customer contact is unsuccessful.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Length of intended stay&#58; 6 months to 2 years</strong></li>
			<ul>			<li>
<strong>Reason for departure</strong> = Any</li>

			<li>
<strong>Default position</strong> = Not Australian resident</li>
			<li>
<strong>Default date of effect</strong> = Day of departure</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>A customer left Australia on 1 February 2010. The customer’s PAX card stated their departure was temporary and they would be going for 10 months. The purpose being 'business'. The customer has only been out of Australia for 7 of the 10 months at the time the residency decision is being made. Using the points above and the information on the customer’s PAX card, the default position is that the customer is resident of Australia. The date of effect is the day before the customer left Australia, that is 31 January 2010.</p>

<p><strong>By using the information above, is the customer deemed to be a resident of Australia?</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>, <a href="../separated-parents/277-08310020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Apply_tests_to_Step09">go to Step 9</a></li>
		<li>
<strong>No</strong>, consideration must be given to where the customer <strong>is</strong> a resident. Due to the limited information available in cases where the default position is being used, an ‘unknown’ residency decision may result, <a href="../separated-parents/277-08310020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Apply_tests_to_Step07">go to Step 7</a></li>		</ul>

<p>It is necessary to determine where a customer is a resident if the decision is they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
are <strong>no longer</strong> a resident of Australia, or</li>
		<li>
have never been resident in Australia</li>
		</ul>
<p>Child Support must consider if the customer is a resident of&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a reciprocating jurisdiction or </li>
		<li>
of a non-reciprocating jurisdiction</li>
		<li>
a jurisdiction other than Australia if they usually live there on an ongoing basis. This is referred to as being ‘habitually a resident’ in the overseas country</li>
		</ul>
<p>Using the information gathered, to determine what country the customer is a resident of, the following factors must be considered&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The customer’s intention or purpose of presence in the reciprocating jurisdiction and any other country</li>
		<li>
The customer’s family and business/employment ties in the reciprocating jurisdiction and any other country</li>
		<li>
The location of the customer’s assets and the arrangements they have made to maintain them</li>
		<li>
The customer’s social and living arrangements in the reciprocating jurisdiction</li>
		<li>
The period the customer has been physically present in the reciprocating jurisdiction</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; where a customer’s permanent place of abode in a specific country has been established, this is where they are habitually a resident.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
when the customer considered that their residency changed</li>

the date the customer arrived in the new country of residence (where the customer has multiple movements, consideration may need to be given to more than just the last movement date), and/or</li>

if a customer was only moving to the new country temporarily but then stayed, was there a specific change in circumstances (such as a new employment contract, a change of relationship status or accommodation arrangements) that could indicate a date their intention and residency changed</li>

<p>The weight to be given to each factor will vary with individual circumstances of each case and no single factor is conclusive.</p>

<p>Use the <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/elements/macros/ResidencyDecision.html">Residency Decision</a> macro to record the reasons for the date of effect used as part of the decision.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when making a residency decision at pre-registration and only 1 case is involved, the date of effect of the residency decision must be the same date as the Start Date of Liability (SDOL). If there are multiple cases, all the relevant factors will need to be considered in determining the appropriate date of effect. If a default position has been applied as part of <a href="../separated-parents/277-08310020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Apply_tests_to_Step05">Step 5</a> the default date of effect as per the bullet points should be applied.</p>

<p>When the date of effect of a residency decision pre dates the SDOL or an existing residency decision, a correcting errors submission may be required. For more information, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-09030000-01.html">Correcting errors on Child Support cases</a>.</p>

<p>If the case has previously been transmitted to an Overseas Authority (excluding New Zealand) for collection and the determination is that the payer is now a resident of Australia, a withdrawal must be sent to the Overseas Authority. An <strong>International Stakeholder Follow Up</strong> intray must be created and routed to the Central Authority team none pool to be actioned.
