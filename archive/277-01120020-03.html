<UL>
<LI><A href="../separated-parents/277-04370000-01.html">External Searches Guide </A>– search by the State the customer died in</LI>
<LI>funeral notice from a newspaper – citing the customer's name, date of birth, date of death or other identifying detail</LI>
<LI>confirmation from the public trustee, coroner's office, hospital or police</LI>
<LI>death certificate from the Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages (BDM), and</LI>
<LI>confirmation from the Department of Foreign Affairs (if the person died overseas)</LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> due to the cost involved in obtaining a death certificate from BDM, this request should only be pursued if no other proof can be obtained. BDM take a minimum of 6 weeks (12 weeks where there is a Coroner’s enquiry) to produce a death certificate.</P>
<P>Proof of death should generally be in writing. If unable to obtain written evidence, or unable to obtain any proof of death but believe the customer is deceased, escalate the query, via a Service Support Officer, to a site Program Support Manager to assist in the decision making process. See <A href="../separated-parents/277-09140000-01.html">Technical support in Child Support</A>.</P>
<P>In the event an Indigenous customer passed away in a remote location, the community manager or elder may be able to assist. Contact the local Indigenous Relations Officer who will draw on their networks to progress the matter.</P>
<P>Centrelink notification alone is not sufficient to process a customer’s death. Additional proof must be obtained.</P>
