<P>Service Officers can run Assisted Customer Claim (ACC) with the customer to collect and record the claim information. ACC is similar to the online claim workflow and contains the same questions to ask the customer.</P>
<P>Start ACC with the customer. Encourage them to complete the rest at home in their own time. <IMG title="A self service option is available" alt="A self service option is available for customers" src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png"> By submitting the claim online, they can monitor the progress of their claim through their Centrelink online account or Express Plus Centrelink mobile app.</P>
<P>If the customer requests the Service Officer continue ACC, complete ACC and tell the customer of any documents they need to provide or action they need to take to submit their claim. The customer will need to:</P>
<UL>

<UL>
<LI>access the draft claim through their Centrelink online account or Express Plus Centrelink mobile app to upload their documents and submit the claim, or</LI>
<LI>accept the verbal declaration read by a Service Officer</LI></UL>
<P>By ticking the Declaration box on the <STRONG>Review your claim</STRONG> page, the Service Officer confirms that they have read the declaration script and the customer accepts it. </P>
<P>Once a verbal declaration is completed and the ACC submitted, a <STRONG>DOC</STRONG> confirming that the customer accepts the verbal declaration displays in:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Process Direct notes </LI>
<LI>Customer First Super Case</LI>
<LI>the Customer Claim Summary</LI></UL>
<P>If a customer is unable or declines to make a verbal declaration, the Service Officer must:</P>
<UL>
<LI>invite the customer to log on to their online services, accept the declaration and submit their claim, or</LI>
<LI>provide the customer with a Customer Declaration Form (CDF). The claim must not be submitted without the CDF being completed and signed</LI></UL>

<H2 id=_Toc344898764>Backdating LIC claims for medical service or treatment</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>Claims may only be backdated for a medical service or treatment if the customer remained eligible for the entire period between the date of medical service or treatment and the date of claim. For LIC, this means:</P>
<UL>
<LI>verifying that the income in the 8 weeks ending on the date of medical service or treatment was below the allowable income limit applicable to the customer, and</LI>
<LI>the claimant must verify that relevant income remained below the LIC threshold for the entire past period ending on the date the claim was lodged</LI></UL>
<P>Service Officers may backdate LIC claims to the date of a medical service or treatment rendered to the claimant or an eligible dependant up to 40 weeks before the Date of Receipt (DOR) of claim. If the claim is to be backdated more than 40 weeks, record all relevant information on a <STRONG>DOC</STRONG> and refer to the Level 2 Policy Help Desk to consider and record a manual override.</P>
<P>See <A href="../additional-products-and-services/101-18042300-01.html">Processing Low Income Health Care Card (LIC) claims</A> for more information about backdating a LIC claim.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>The claim start date can only be backdated if the customer has lodged a paper or online claim.</P>
<P>If the start date is backdated, customers may be able to claim reimbursement for past period expenses, for example Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme (PBS) medication purchases. Advise the customer to obtain a receipt for the prescription/medical treatment. They can take the receipt/s and their concession card to Medicare to request a refund of medical expenses.</P>
<P>The <A href="../additional-products-and-services/101-06040010-05.html">Resources</A> page has a link to Getting a refund when you don't have your cards on the Services Australia Website.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<H2 id=_Toc344898764>Backdating the LIC start date</H2>
<DIV class=collapsible_container>
<DIV class=block>
<P>The claim date of receipt (DOR) may need to be adjusted when:</P>
<UL>
<LI>indexing the LIC new claim and the DOR is more than 3 months in the past, to prevent the system error <STRONG>E244ZZ - Cannot backdate DOR of a LIC NCL for more than 10 months in the past</STRONG></LI>
<LI>processing an existing LIC NCL activity that was registered with a DOR more than 5 months in the past, to prevent the system error <STRONG>E051LI LIC NCL cannot be completed for this date of commencement</STRONG></LI></UL>
<P>See <A href="../additional-products-and-services/101-18042300-01.html">Processing Low Income Health Care Card (LIC) claims</A> for information about adjusting the claim DOR to backdate a LIC claim.</P>
<P>The default start date will be derived by the system from the DOR. This date will automatically populate the <STRONG>Start Date:</STRONG> field.</P>
<P>The date may need to be corrected if claim processing was delayed, if medical treatment was required, and/or implementation of a review officer decision. Update the date on the LIC Start Date (<STRONG>LSD</STRONG>) screen if the correct start date is up to 40 weeks prior to the DOR.</P>
<P>Recording a start date more than 40 weeks before the DOR will need to be referred to the Level 2 Policy Help Desk - Concessions for implementation of a manual override. The start date <STRONG>cannot</STRONG> be a future date.</P>
<P>Current YA, Austudy or ABSTUDY customers are issued a Health Care Card (HCC) automatically, and will not be eligible for a LIC.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
