<p>The datalink with the Department of Home Affairs is activated through the Immigration Enquiry (<strong>RSIMME</strong>) screen. Information available from the Department of Home Affairs from 1 September 1994 to date will be recorded on the residence screens automatically and a Channel code of '<strong>IMM</strong>' will be used to indicate the information has come directly from the immigration datalink.</p>

<p>The Department of Home Affairs provided information cannot be overwritten by customer provided data except by authorised Service Officers in Centrelink International Services (CIS). As well as a number of screens which record residence information for assessment by the system, there are several screens to assist staff to determine various aspects of residence such as time spent inside Australia.</p>

<p>There may be multiple pages on some screens depending on the number of times a person travels outside Australia or the number of changes to visas and/or citizenship since arrival or since 1 September 1994. The limitation are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Movement information is only held for customers from 1 September 1994 and Australian citizenship information is generally only available since 2001</li>
		<li>
Information about residence prior to 1994 may need to be provided by the customer. In some circumstances they may need to provide a passport number to help verify the Department of Home Affairs information</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Data link unsuccessful</strong></p>

<p>The customer or child may still have an immigration record. It could be that&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer or child's name on their immigration record is not a perfect match with any names recorded on their Customer Personal Details Summary (<strong>CPDS</strong>) screen, or</li>
		<li>
multiple matching immigration records have been found</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer or child is expected to have an immigration record but no matching record has been automatically found, a Manual Follow-up (MFU) activity will be created for staff in CIS</p>

<p>If actioning a new claim, the <strong>RSIMME</strong> screen will be presented if appropriate. Alternatively, manual requests can be made outside a new claim activity or during a reassessment by selecting the <strong>RSIMME</strong> screen. To activate the datalink, the following is required&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The <strong>Country of Birth&#58;</strong> field. This is mandatory</li>
		<li>
The <strong>Lived or travelled outside Australia since 1 Sept 1994&#58;</strong> field. This is mandatory but unknown (U) is an available option. This option must be used where it is not known if the customer has travelled outside Australia since 1 September 1994</li>
		<li>
Travel documents should be recorded on this screen. Recording these details is necessary if the customer has provided an Australian passport as proof of their Australian citizenship, otherwise they are not mandatory</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Travel document type should be either '<strong>AP</strong>' (Australian passport), '<strong>OP</strong>' (Overseas Passport) or '<strong>DI</strong>' (Document of Identity)</li>
			<li>
Record the registration or serial number of the document in the <strong>Document Number&#58;</strong> field</li>
			<li>
Code the <strong>Country of Issue&#58;</strong> field</li>		</ul>
		<li>
The <strong>Customer Immigration link status&#58;</strong> field will show if the datalink for the customer is <strong>ACTIVE</strong> or <strong>INACTIVE</strong>. This field cannot be manually updated</li>
		<li>
Keying '<strong>Y</strong>' in the <strong>Request Immigration data (Y/N)?&#58;</strong> field will initiate a search of the immigration database using the datalink. Even if the datalink is active, this field can be used to immediately obtain current details which otherwise may not be received for several days</li>
		</ul>
<p>The <strong>RSIMME</strong> screen is also used to record residence details for a dependent child when the child has their own person (PER) record. To use the datalink, the same actions as outlined above are required.</p>

<p>If a child does not have their own PER record go to the Child Selection (<strong>CHS</strong>) screen in the customer's record to which the child is linked. '<strong>S</strong>'elect the relevant child, enter '<strong>CHIMME</strong>' in the <strong>Nxt&#58;</strong> field and proceed as you would on the '<strong>RSIMME</strong>' screen.</p>

<p>The <strong>RSLEG</strong> screen is used to record a customer's legal residence status, country of citizenship, assurance of support indicator, New Zealand residence status and visa details (if not an Australian citizen).</p>

<p>When the immigration datalink is successful, the customer's visa details since 1 September 1994 will be automatically recorded on this screen.</p>

<p>The <strong>New Zealand residence</strong> status will also be automatically assessed and recorded for all except transitional cases.</p>

<p>Citizenship will generally need to be manually recorded.</p>

<p>If the immigration datalink is not successful, necessary details will need to be manually recorded on this screen.</p>

<p>The system uses the information from the <strong>RSLEG</strong> screen and cross-references it with the Country of Residence (<strong>CRES</strong>) screen, movement information from the Customer Advised Travel Details (<strong>RSCD</strong>) and/or Immigration Advised Movements (<strong>RSIM</strong>) screen to determine a customer's entitlement to Australian payments.</p>

<p>Details of a child's legal residence status are recorded on the Child Legal Residence Details (<strong>CHRSLEG</strong>) screen, which is accessed through the Child Selection (<strong>CHS</strong>) screen on the linked customer's record. Coding <strong>CHRSLEG</strong> is not mandatory.</p>

<p>The <strong>CRES</strong> screen is used to record the country where the customer is living and has lived on a long-term basis. The country of residence coded on this screen does not necessarily have to be the country where the customer has been a legal resident. It should also include countries where the customer has or had the intention to live on a long term basis. If a short period (less than 12 months) is recorded, Service Officers should consider the possibility that the customer may have been in that country for a holiday, in which case it should not be recorded.</p>

<p>A child's country of residence information is recorded on the Child Country of Residence (<strong>CHCRES</strong>) screen, which is accessed through the Child Selection (<strong>CHS</strong>) screen on a linked customer's record. Coding <strong>CHCRES</strong> is not mandatory.</p>
