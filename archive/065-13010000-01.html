<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Home_Care_Packa">Home Care Packages program</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The Home Care Packages program provides support to help care recipients to stay independent and in their own home for as long as possible. Help can be provided through access to a range of ongoing personal services, support services and clinical care to help them with their day to day activities. </p>

<p>Home care packages provides a co-ordinated package of services tailored to meet the care recipient’s complex care needs. </p>

<p>To access government-funded home care services, My Aged Care conducts an assessment. After the assessment, My Aged Care completes the National Screening and Assessment Form (NSAF). The NSAF provides approval for a care recipient’s eligibility to government-funded home care services and the level of care the care recipient is eligible for.</p>

<p>There are 4 levels of home care packages with different funding amounts&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Home Care Level 1 - supports care recipients with <strong>basic</strong> care needs</li>
		<li>
Home Care Level 2 - supports care recipients with <strong>low</strong> level care needs</li>
		<li>
Home Care Level 3 - supports care recipients with <strong>intermediate</strong> care needs</li>
		<li>
Home Care Level 4 - supports care recipients with <strong>high</strong> care needs</li>
		</ul>
<p>The below supplements also apply to eligible home care recipients&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<a href="../older-australians/065-13040020-01.html">Dementia and Cognition Supplement</a> - helps home care services with the costs of caring for care recipients who have moderate to severe cognitive impairment</li>
		<li>
<a href="../older-australians/065-13040060-01.html">Veterans’ Supplement</a> - helps home care services with the costs of caring for veterans with a service-related mental health condition</li>
		<li>
<a href="../older-australians/065-13040040-01.html">Oxygen and Enteral Feeding Supplement</a> - helps home care services with the costs of enteral feeding</li>
		<li>
<a href="../older-australians/065-13040070-01.html">Viability Supplement</a> - helps home care services with the cost of providing services in rural and remote areas</li>
		<li>
<a href="../older-australians/065-05030000-01.html">Aged care financial hardship assistance - overview</a> - aged care recipients can apply for this supplement if they are in financial hardship</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> where a home care recipient is eligible for both the <a href="../older-australians/065-13040060-01.html">Veterans’ Supplement</a> and the <a href="../older-australians/065-13040020-01.html">Dementia and Cognition Supplement</a>, the aged care service will only receive the <a href="../older-australians/065-13040060-01.html">Veterans’ Supplement</a> for the care recipient.</p>

<p>The costs for home care services will vary for each care recipient. Aged care means assessments determine the care recipient’s ability to contribute towards government-funded home care services. See <a href="../older-australians/065-09000000-01.html">Aged Care means assessment</a> for further information.</p>

<p>The below home care packages reforms have been implemented&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The 2021 Improved Payment Arrangements for home care - changes to how home care subsidies and supplements are paid to providers</li>
		<li>
The 2019 Basic Daily Fee (BDF) Charges - the reduction of BDF and the introduction of 4 BDF levels</li>
		<li>
The 2017 Increasing Choice in Home Care reforms - increased choice and flexibility for home care recipients</li>
		<li>
The 2014 Care Fee changes - the introduction of income testing for home care packages</li>
		<li>
The 2013 Home Care Packages program - replacing the Community Packaged Care Programs which included&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Community Aged Care Packages (CACP)</li>
			<li>
Extended Aged Care at Home (EACH) packages, and </li>
			<li>
Extended Aged Care at Home Dementia (EACH-D) packages</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>These changes have helped to ensure home care packages continue to meet care recipients’ needs.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p><strong>Phase 1&#58; 1 February 2021 </strong></p>

<p>Advance payments ceased, Services Australia now pays home care subsidies and supplements monthly in arrears. </p>

<p>Services Australia no longer pays advances as the agency pays the full subsidy and supplements when the monthly claims are submitted. This does not affect care recipients' subsidy entitlements.</p>

<p>Services Australia pays the full amount of entitlement, regardless of services provided in respect of the claim month. Providers hold unspent amounts on behalf of their care recipients. There has been no change to how they manage unspent amounts. For more information and the process, see <a href="../older-australians/065-13010010-01.html">Unspent home care amounts</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Phase 2&#58; 1 September 2021 </strong></p>

<p>Home care services must submit a dollar figure for each care recipient as part of their claim at the end of the month. </p>

<p>Home care are paid actual expenses, up to the limit of the claim entitlement for the month, plus any amount not claimed from previous months. </p>

<p>Unclaimed Commonwealth unspent amounts will accrue in a home care account and be available to the provider in future months.</p>

<p>From 1 September 2021, home care services have a 6-month window to opt-in to return any Commonwealth portion of unspent amounts. These amounts are recovered from the next claim/s. If the home care service did not choose to opt-in, the amount must be returned when the care recipient departs the service.</p>

<p>Home care services must report the Commonwealth portion of unspent amounts that they currently hold for care recipients who were in care as at the end of the month preceding the claim month. While it is optional for services to report initially, services must report at least once in either the September 2021, October 2021 or the November 2021 claim. It is mandatory from the December 2021 claim month onwards. These amounts must be reported for each care recipient up until the service opts to return the unspent amounts, or until the care recipient departs. </p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The Strengthening Aged Care - more places, lower fees, better access measure resulted in a reduction of the Basic Daily Fee (BDF). From 1 July 2019, there are 4 levels of BDF aligning to the 4 levels of home care packages. Prior to 1 July 2019, there was only 1 BDF equal to 17.5% of the single Basic Aged Pension. This was regardless of the care recipient’s home care package level. </p>

<p>The changes apply to all existing pre-1 July 2019 and new home care recipients paying a BDF.

<p><strong>On 1 August 2013</strong> the arrangements for obtaining approved provider status were simplified for home care. There is now a single approval to be a provider of <strong>home care</strong>. This enables an approved provider to deliver services at any of the 4 home care packages levels.</p>

<p><strong>From 27 February 2017</strong> under Increasing Choice in Home Care, home care packages are allocated via the Department of Health and Aged Care’s national priority system. The Aged Care Approvals Round (ACAR) ceased. Previously, home care providers applied for government-subsided home care places through the ACAR.

<p>The care fees arrangements changed on 1 July 2014. The changes are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Basic Daily Fee (BDF) - care recipients can be asked by their home care service to pay the BDF</li>
		<li>
Income-tested fee - care recipients who have the financial capacity to pay are asked to contribute towards the cost of their care. This extra amount is known as an ‘income-tested care fee’ and is in addition to the BDF</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p>The amount a care recipient’s home care service may ask them to pay will vary with the care recipients’ financial circumstances. There are annual and lifetime caps that apply to the income-tested fee for care recipients who commenced receiving a home care package after 1 July 2014.</p>

<p>Care recipients who entered care on or after 1 July 2014 may need to complete and lodge an <a target="_blank" href="../older-australians/065-09000000-01.html#bp01_L2GT_Aged_Care_Calcu">Aged Care – Calculation of your cost of care form</a>. </p>

<p>For care recipients who were receiving a home care package before 1 July 2014, the 1 July 2014 care fee arrangements do not apply to them. These home care recipients will keep paying the fees they are already paying under the pre-1 July 2014 arrangement.</p>

These recipients receive the higher Level 4 basic subsidy and <a target="_blank" href="../older-australians/065-13040020-01.html">Dementia and Cognition Supplement</a> rate to ensure they are not disadvantaged by the commencement of the Home Care Packages program.
