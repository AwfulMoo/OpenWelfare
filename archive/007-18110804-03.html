<p>Where a service has cancelled attendance data for a child, the Department of Education views this as an admission from the service that care was never provided. In this circumstance, any debts generated post reconciliation by Services Australia against the customer’s account must be recovered from the service (except for amounts paid directly to the customer, for example tops up of Child Care Benefit (CCB)/ Child Care Rebate (CCR), CCR Direct to Customer (DTC).</p>

<p>CCMS team have investigated and found the recipient has a debt raised for CCB/CCR due to cancelled attendance and the child never attended care.</p>

<p>In these cases, the customer cannot follow up with the service. Action for the Services Australia CCMS Support team is as follows&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
code #CFMI for every affected year with the below notes&#58;<br> “Cancelled/Amended data to be corrected by Department of Education”</li>
		<li>
provide the advice to the Department of Education via an email (as per current protocol)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Include the following information&#58;</p>

<p>Please be advised that a debt has been raised against a family due to cancelled attendance data for care that never occurred. In the referral, provide the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Customer/Child Name and CRNs</li>
		<li>
CCB and/or CCR debt amount raised against the customer’s account that should be a service debt</li>
		<li>
Amounts raised against the customer that is he customer’s debt i.e. CCR DTC</li>
		<li>
Explanation of why the debt has been raised</li>
		<li>

		<li>
Week ending period the debt relates to</li>
		<li>
Code CFMI for the applicable years as the Department of Education will attempt to once information has been confirmed code the adjustments to offset the debts. Please add notes on the CFMI screen of the following&#58;<br>“Cancelled/Amended data to be corrected by Department of Education”</li>
		</ul>
<p>Wait for the Department of Education’s response BEFORE coding any adjustments in the customer record via CRMA/FRMA as debt adjustments are not required in all circumstances. The Department of Education’s adjustment (CPOFRS see Item 2) may ripple over correctly in the started activity therefore no adjustments required.</p>

<p>Place a <strong>DOC</strong> on the customers record to advise information is being followed up by the Department of Education. Await further advice from Education.</p>

<p>The Department of Education will export the attendance data to determine the funds that were paid to the service for the cancelled attendance data.

check if there are any payments pending to the service. If yes, change the status of the payments to ‘Ready for Release’ to prevent them from being processed</li>

check if there are any attendances pending (submitted or processing). If yes, check if these are likely to generate a payment to the service.

<p>Families can become aware of a service using their CRN details to claim benefits if a debt is raised for care that was never provided. Debts are generally raised in this circumstance when a customer’s eligibility is backdated to ‘ineligible’.
