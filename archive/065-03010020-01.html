<p>91 days before reaching Age Pension age, if the customer is&#58;</p>

		<li>
not subscribed to online letters or Electronic Messaging, they will be sent a letter and a Transfer to Age Pension (SA383) form by mail, with the option to complete the transfer online rather than return the form</li>

<p>If the Transfer to Age Pension has <strong>not</strong> been completed online/returned 28 days before reaching Age Pension age and the customer is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>

		<li>
not subscribed to online letters through myGov Inbox but to Electronic Messaging, they will be sent a reminder SMS or email depending on their preferred communication method</li>
		<li>
not subscribed to either myGov Inbox or Electronic Messaging, they will be sent a reminder letter by mail</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer has not completed the online task/returned the SA383 form upon reaching Age Pension age, their (and their partner's) payment will be suspended, or cancelled.</p>

<p>If the customer reaches Age Pension age and their current payment suspends or cancels, the Transfer to Age Pension task will remain available on the Centrelink online account landing page for up to 13 weeks after the suspension or cancellation date.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> payment (including the partner's) should only be restored once the customer has submitted the online transfer, via the Assisted Customer Claim (ACC) workflow, or lodged a SA383 including required documentation.</p>

<p>Some online transfers will not require Service Officer intervention and will automatically complete once submitted by the customer. Auto completion may occur where the transfer is straightforward, for example, there are no updates required, no documentation to be provided, and no adverse impacts on the entitlements of the customer (or their partner).</p>

Explain the benefits of using the transfer online, including&#58;</p>

early warnings if claimants may not be eligible, for example, not residentially qualified</li>

less information to provide, as information from Centrelink records will be pre-populated into the online transfer</li>
		<li>
for Carer Payment and Disability Support Pension customers, detailed messaging will populate within the online transfer process. This outlines the customer's circumstances including the advantages and disadvantages of transferring from their respective payment. This enables them to make an informed decision about whether to transfer to Age Pension or remain on their current payment</li>
		<li>
the ability to monitor the progress of a transfer through Centrelink online account or the Express Plus Centrelink mobile app</li>
		</ul>
<p>If customers decline or are unable to use the online transfer offer, the Assisted Customer Claim (ACC) can be run with the customer. This includes Widow Allowance (WA) and Partner Allowance (PA) customers as their payments will cease on 1 January 2022.</p>

<p>If a correspondence nominee enquires about transferring to Age Pension on behalf of a customer, Service Officers can run the ACC workflow. ACC allows for the Verbal Declaration or signed CDF to be made/provided by the customer or their correspondence nominee.</p>

<p>A declaration is required prior to submitting the transfer. When a Service Officer reads the Verbal Declaration to the customer (or correspondence nominee), they must tick the Declaration box on the <strong>Review your claim</strong> page. This confirms that the Service Officer has read the declaration script and the customer (or correspondence nominee) accepts it. Once the Verbal Declaration is accepted and ACC submitted a <strong>DOC</strong> containing this information displays in&#58;</p>

Process Direct notes</li>

Customer First super case</li>
		<li>

		</ul>
<p>If the customer cannot make a verbal declaration, the Service Officer must&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
invite the customer to log into their online services, accept the customer declaration and submit their transfer, or</li>
		<li>
request a signed Customer Declaration Form (CDF). The <a href="../older-australians/065-03010020-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Customer_Declar">Resources</a> page has a link to the CDF.</li>
		</ul>
<p>Service Officers must not submit the transfer without the customer accepting the Verbal Declaration or completing and signing a CDF. Advise the customer of any outstanding documents, or action required to submit the transfer.</p>
