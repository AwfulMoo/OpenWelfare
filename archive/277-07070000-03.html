<p>A customer may contact Child Support verbally, electronically or otherwise in writing to make an estimate election. Customers may also discuss their situation without identifying that they wish to lodge an estimate. In these situations provide all options to customers including estimates, where appropriate. Indications that an estimate may be appropriate could include the customer discussing&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the loss of a job or contract</li>
		<li>
a significant reduction in hours or overtime</li>
		<li>
difficulties meeting their payments, or</li>
		<li>
that they have recently started receiving Centrelink payments</li>
		</ul>
<p>It is essential to explore the customer's circumstances, now and in the future, to establish if an estimate is the best option for them.</p>

<p>If the parent is not already on the telephone, contact them to discuss the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the definition of an estimate, <a href="../separated-parents/277-07070000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Steps_for_estim_Step02">go to Step 2</a> for more information</li>

<p>An estimate is an election for the child support assessment to be calculated based on a parent's estimate of their future taxable income and other component amounts (i.e. their adjusted taxable income).</p>

<p>An estimate takes effect from&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the day the estimate election is received by us, or</li>
		<li>
the day the child support period starts, if the parent makes the estimate before the start of the child support period</li>
		</ul>
<p>The parent can choose to have the estimate end&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
15 months after the start date of the child support period, or</li>
		<li>
12 months from the date of the election, if the remainder of the child support period is 12 months or greater</li>
		</ul>

<p>An estimate election can be provided verbally, in writing (fax or post), by email or via CSAOnline. It is preferred that an estimate is lodged over the phone as this provides an opportunity to provide information to the customer. As an estimate will generally take effect from the date it is lodged it is important that parents are made aware of their different lodgement options.</p>

<p>When an estimate is accepted from a parent it is the parent's responsibility to keep their estimate up to date. Parents must advise Child Support within 14 days of any event that will affect the accuracy of their estimate. Penalties may apply if a parent underestimates their income.</p>

<p>Events that affect the accuracy of an estimate could include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a redundancy, superannuation or eligible termination payment</li>
		<li>
a change in earnings due to overtime or reduced hours</li>
		<li>
a change in employment</li>
		<li>
the commencement or cessation of Parental Leave Payments (effective 1 January 2011)</li>
		<li>
receipt of a bonus, or</li>
		<li>
a change in net rental property loss or reportable fringe benefits</li>
		</ul>
<p>In the case of an increase in income if a parent complies with their obligations and advises Child Support of a change within 14 days of the event, the estimate will be updated from the date they advise us. Otherwise, the estimate will be updated from the date of the event. This must be made clear to the parent because it helps to encourage compliance with their notification requirements. In the case of a decrease in income, effect to the change will be given from the date of notification.</p>

<p>An estimate can also be updated every 2 months whether or not there has been an event that causes the original estimate to become inaccurate.</p>

<p>Parents need to consider if it is likely that their income will vary in the remainder of the estimate period. An estimate must be updated to take into account any increase in income. For further information see the estimate review and reconciliation documents. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-07080000-01.html">Child Support estimates review (pre 1 July 2010)</a> and <a href="../separated-parents/277-07090000-01.html">Child Support estimates – Reconcile (pre 1 July 2011)</a>.</p>

<p>An estimate will be valid if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a child support assessment is active, that is Stage 2 case</li>
		<li>
there is no income amount order in force on the day of the election or for any part of the remainder of the child support period for any children of the assessment. For example&#58; if an agreement or order sets a periodic amount for 1 child but a younger child is assessed under the formula the parents would be unable to estimate their income for use in the formula for the younger child</li>
		<li>
the first election (the annualised amount) in a child support period is for 85% or less of the person's taxable income and other component amounts, that is their adjusted taxable income) for the last relevant year of income, or if their taxable income for the last relevant year has been amended by the ATO, 85% or less of the amended taxable income for the last relevant year (regardless of whether or not that amended income is used in a child support assessment). See <a target="_blank" href="https&#58;//guides.dss.gov.au/child-support-guide/2/4/4">the Child Support Guide&#58; 2.4.4 Child support income</a></li>
		<li>
a subsequent estimate in a child support period&#58;</li>
			<ol>			<li>
is not lodged within 2 months of the last estimate being lodged, refer to Less than 2 months below for further information, and</li>
			<li>
the amount is greater or less than the amount of the first election in the period</li>
			</ol>			</ul>
<p>A parent with multiple cases may lodge an estimate of income for the case/s where an income amount order is not in force.</p>

<p>If a parent is prevented from lodging an estimate because there is an Income Amount Order in force, a Change of Assessment application may be appropriate. Alternatively, there may be an unemployment clause in an agreement or Court Order that could be invoked. These options should be explored with the customer.</p>

<p><strong>Taxable Income</strong>&#58; To establish if an election is 85% or less of a person's adjusted taxable income the current child support assessment must be based on&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a taxable income as assessed by the ATO (or an overseas authority where the parent is resident in a reciprocating jurisdiction), or</li>
		<li>
an income tax declaration (ITD) provided by the parent</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the assessment is not based on a taxable income or an ITD, offer the parent the option to provide an ITD. Ensure that the parent understands the ITD is a declaration of their taxable income for a <strong>previous </strong>financial year where as their estimate election is an estimate of their <strong>future</strong> adjusted taxable income.</p>

<p><strong>Less than 2 months</strong>&#58; If a customer wishes to update an estimate in the child support period and it has been less than 2 months since the last estimate was lodged, their estimate can be reviewed. For further information see <a href="../separated-parents/277-07080000-01.html">Child Support estimates review (pre 1 July 2010)</a>.</p>

<p>If it has been less than 2 months since the last estimate was lodged and the current estimate has been reviewed, encourage the customer to lodge a new estimate after the 2 month period has expired. This is important because if the estimate is reconciled, only the <strong>last</strong> estimate in the period may be reconciled (although earlier estimates can be reviewed). This may mean that income fluctuations over the estimate period are not captured through the reconciliation process.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if minimum annual rate (MAR) applied at any time during the estimate period, the estimate cannot be reconciled, only reviewed.</p>

<p>If the estimate is not the first estimate election in the child support period check the earlier estimate(s) for accuracy. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-07080000-01.html">Child Support estimates review (pre 1 July 2010)</a>.</p>

<p>In most circumstances the review of any current estimates can be completed before accepting a new estimate.</p>

<p>If the estimate cannot be reviewed because the parent does not have all relevant information gain a commitment from the parent to contact Child Support within a reasonable timeframe to supply this information. If the existing estimates in the child support period have not been reviewed, create an Estimate Review Required intray on the customer and lock them until it is completed.</p>

<p>Amounts can be calculated by entering weekly, fortnightly, 4 weekly, monthly or one off payments (this will be pro-rated across the whole period).</p>

<p>The date ranges for the YTD and estimate calculator will only allow the user to enter income received between the ‘from’ and ‘to’ date of each period. Any dates other than for a one off payment, must be the date the customer began earning the income within the YTD or Estimate period. For example, if a customer only worked for 6 weeks within the estimate period, the start and end date of employment must be recorded.</p>

<p>Each income type automatically updates the correct corresponding field in the income details, for example&#58;</p>

<p><strong>Net rental income</strong>, <strong>Net financial investment income</strong>, <strong>Targeted foreign income</strong>, <strong>Reportable Fringe benefits</strong> and <strong>Reportable superannuation</strong> fields cannot be entered from the Income Calculator. The customer must provide an amount for the estimate period or an annual amount.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
When taking an estimate from a parent who is overseas in a reciprocating jurisdiction, the parent must include their overseas income in the estimate. As it is difficult for Child Support to verify this information, documentary evidence will generally be required of the estimated income before accepting the estimate. This could include information from an employer or an overseas authority verifying the parent's income. This should be discussed with the parent while taking the estimate election</li>
		<li>
If the parent is using overseas income as all or part of the estimate, use the same exchange rate that was used in the calculation of the last relevant year income</li>
		<li>
Section 162A of the <strong>Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989</strong>, allows a parent who is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction to notify Child Support of an event within 60 days of that event occurring. This means that where a domestic parent has 14 days, a parent who is resident in a reciprocating jurisdiction has 60 days</li>		</ul>

<p>If a parent wishes to lodge an estimate of income and their taxable income for the last relevant year has been amended by the ATO, the estimated amount must be compared to the amended income (regardless of whether or not that amended income is used in a child support assessment) to determine whether the estimate is not more than 85% of their ATI for the last relevant year (sub-section 56(2)(d)).</p>

<p>There may be situations that require a new estimate to be processed with a start date in the past. An example of this would be if there is a document on Cuba that clearly shows a customer advised Child Support their income had changed and requested to lodge an estimate but the Service Officer did not act on the request. Cuba will allow an estimate election to be recorded with a retrospective start date. For more detailed information, see <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-30010330-01.html">Estimates Cuba Process Help</a> (pre 1 July 2010 provisions).</p>

<p>Once an estimate with a retrospective start date is loaded, forward the <strong>Pending Estimated Income </strong>intray to the Technical Support Team for approval. The approval of a retrospective estimate election must be conducted by a Service Support Officer (SSO). Do not route this estimate to a Service Officer 4 (SO4).</p>

<p>When determining other component amounts for estimates with an effective start date prior to 1 July 2009, do not include reportable superannuation contributions and/or net financial investment loss. Only include net rental property loss, reportable fringe benefits, tax-free pensions or benefits and target foreign income (where applicable).</p>

<p>An estimate will sometimes need to be re-keyed into Cuba because a simple keying error has occurred.

In these circumstances the SO3 will re-key the estimate from the original notification date. This does not need to be sent to a SO5 for approval as a retrospective estimate.</p>

<p>If there is reason to doubt the accuracy of an estimate or the parent is overseas in a reciprocating jurisdiction, contact the parent to request further evidence. If the parent cannot be contacted or if the parent is overseas, request additional evidence in writing. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-01010000-01.html">Contact with Child Support customers</a>.</p>

<p>Whilst it is not a legal requirement for parents to provide documentary evidence of their claims the Service Officer must be satisfied that the customer's actual income will not be higher than their estimated income.</p>

<p>Documentary evidence includes&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
an employment termination certificate</li>
		<li>
payslips</li>
		<li>
a statement of benefit from Centrelink (if this information is not available on the <strong>Benefits</strong> window in Cuba), or</li>
		<li>
a provisional profit and loss statement</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; customers should not be encouraged to obtain such a statement from their accountant without being warned that&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the accountant is likely to charge for this service</li>
		<li>
Child Support will not contribute towards that cost</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the parent refuses to provide evidence, decide if the actual income is likely to be the same as or lower than the estimated income. To assist information can be requested from third parties such as an employer. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-04210000-01.html">Child Support's information gathering powers</a>.</p>

<p>When taking an estimate from a parent who is not in Australia seek documentary evidence to support the parent's claims. The decision to accept an estimate of this type without evidence must be made by a Service Support Officer (SSO).</p>

<p>If satisfied that a parent is underestimating, (that is their actual income is higher than their estimate of income) the election must be refused. For example, there is no apparent change in income and no reason is provided for lodging the estimate.</p>

<p>Cuba will not accept an invalid estimate. When an estimate is being recorded, Cuba will perform an initial validity check. If an estimate does not meet certain validity criteria at this point, Cuba will not allow the estimate data to be loaded.</p>

<p>The reasons an estimate will be deemed invalid at this initial validity check are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>No Taxable Incm</strong> - There is no relevant year taxable income for this child support period</li>
		<li>
<strong>Review Exst Est</strong> - There is an existing estimate for this child support period that started less than 2 months ago</li>
		<li>
<strong>Income Amt Ordr</strong> - There is an income amount order for part or all of this child support period. Applies prior to 01/01/2008</li>
		<li>
<strong>Not Stage 2</strong> - Cannot select child support period as it is associated with a Stage 1 case. Only select Stage 2 cases</li>
		<li>
<strong>CSP &lt; Notf Date</strong> - The child support period end date is before the notification date, and</li>
		<li>
<strong>IAO ( Date )</strong> - An income amount order is in place and an estimate can only be lodged after the date displayed</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where an estimate is deemed invalid customers do not have objection rights.</p>

<p>An estimate may still be deemed invalid after it has been entered in Cuba if it fails further validity checks. For example, if the estimated income is not less than 85% of the current adjusted taxable income that the assessment is based on, Cuba will allow all the information to be entered but will advise that the estimate is invalid when attempting to save the estimate.</p>

<p>However Cuba will not recognise if the 85% validity requirement was not met where the taxable income for the last relevant year has been amended by the ATO and not used in the assessment. This is because it is a manual calculation performed outside of Cuba.  </p>

<p>Manual intervention is required to finalise these invalid estimates. If the 85% rule is not met the estimate is pended and then deleted. A notepad is to be added to the deleted estimate identifying that the estimate did not meet the 85% validity rule, cannot be accepted and has been deleted. The ME1-1 letter will need to be issued to the customer manually.</p>
