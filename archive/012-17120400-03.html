<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Assessing Officers can also refine the list of applications using the filters (example&#58; Insurer, application type, scheme etc.) above the list of current applications.</p>

<p>When a claim is submitted in the MIOC system, the system will auto-generate an application number which is Services Australia’s unique claim reference number.</p>

<p>A refund application submitted via MIOC will display under the heading ‘ARN’ in the format ARN[Application number]-[Insurer identifier number and letter]-[Scheme identifier letter]-[Insurer refund identifier number]R. For example, ARN6000-1U-H-1R, where <strong>R</strong> indicates a <strong>Refund Application</strong>. The Insurer identifier number is the number of the payment application relevant to the claim, i.e. 1 for first application, 2 for second application, and so on. The Scheme Identifier letter represents the scheme that the claim is being made under&#58;</p>

<p><strong>H</strong> for HCCS</p>

<p><strong>R</strong> for ROCS</p>

<p>As with MI payment applications, the supporting invoices provided with the refund application must reconcile with the amount requested in the refund application. The type of refund identified when reviewing the refund determines how the requested refund amount is reconciled.</p>

<p>The EL1 checks the entire claim including the refund application, the recovery amount, HP Records Manager, the debt recovery worksheet, the file note and the recommendation. If the EL1 agrees with the AO recommendation, the file is then handed over to the EL2 delegate for approval.</p>

<p>If any errors are identified at this point the claim is then handed back to the first AO. Once the first AO has amended any errors, the claim undergoes QC again before progressing to the EL2 delegate for approval.</p>

<p>Once completed, the EL1 will progress the claim to the EL2 (the delegate), Director of the Medical Indemnity team for approval. If the Director agrees with the AO recommendation they will sign the debt recovery worksheet on the file. The application is then ready for recovery of the amount as outlined in the pay run process.</p>

<p>If the delegate does not agree with the recommendation, the delegate will discuss with the EL1 for resolution of the refund application.</p>

<p>Once the AO has assessed the refund application, a second Quality Assurance (QA) check is required from another AO.</p>

<p>The second AO is required to conduct&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
an assessment of the withdrawal</li>
		<li>
a final proofread of the final note and letter to insurer to ensure formatting, spelling, grammar and financials are correct. Refer to the Services Australia Writing Style Guide on the <a href="../health-professionals/012-17120400-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Services_Austra01">Resources</a> page.</li>
		</ul>
<p>If during the QA the second AO finds errors or issues in relation to the withdrawal these need to be discussed with the first AO and if necessary the EL1 Assistant Director. Once agreement has been reached all relevant documentation must be amended as required.</p>

<p>Once the second AO is sure that the withdrawal has been assessed correctly and the documentation is correct&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
update Claims on Hand</li>
		<li>
place the file in the EL1's cupboard for EL1 Assistant Director to conduct a final Quality Check (QC) before the claim is handed to the delegate for their consideration</li>
		</ul>
<p>The EL1 checks the entire claim including the withdrawal advice received from the insurer, HP Records Manager, the file note and the recommendation and withdrawal letter. If the EL1 agrees with the AO recommendation, the file is then handed over to the EL2 delegate for approval.</p>

<p>If any errors are identified at this point the claim is then handed back to the first AO. Once the first AO has amended any errors, the claim undergoes the QC again before progressing to the EL2 delegate for approval.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58; </strong>if a different Team Leader reviews the claim, they can cross out the typed name, handwrite their name and sign the file note if they support the AO recommendation.</p>

<p>Once completed, the EL1 will progress the claim to the EL2 (the delegate), Director of the Medical Indemnity team for approval. If the Director agrees with the AO recommendation they will sign the withdrawal letter.</p>

<p>If the delegate does not agree with the recommendation, the delegate will discuss with the EL1 for resolution of the refund application.</p>
