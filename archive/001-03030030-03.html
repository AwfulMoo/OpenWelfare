<p>Investigate the record. There may be more than one reason for a suspension or cancellation.</p>

<p><strong>Suspension or cancellation reason APA</strong></p>

<p>For suspension or cancellation reasons <strong>APA</strong> (Did not attend compulsory participation appointment or activity), payment can only be restored by appropriately trained staff. See <a href="../job-seekers/001-10080020-01.html">Restoring payment where a payment suspension (participation) has been imposed for Community Development Program (CDP) participants</a>.</p>

<p><strong>All other suspensions</strong></p>

<p>Service Officers must determine if the payment can be restored on initial contact.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
View the suspension or cancellation code on the Service Reason Summary (<strong>SRS</strong>) screen or the Allowance/Benefit History (<strong>ABH</strong>) screen</li>
		<li>
If payment is CAN-FRP, check if payment was suspended for any reason immediately prior</li>
		<li>
To check if payment is restorable, see <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-10010180-01.html">Cancellation, suspension and rejection reason codes for Newstart System (NSS)</a></li>
		<li>
If payment is suspended due to a participation failure, hand off to the Participation Solutions Team (PST)</li>
		<li>
If payment is suspended 'YBS' incorrectly, see <a href="../job-seekers/001-17030800-01.html">Youth Bonus Wage Subsidy (YBWS) 26 Week Suspension Period</a></li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> rejected claims can never be restored. If the customer contacts about having their rejected claim reassessed, see Table 2 of <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07060060-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Requesting_reje">Request to reassess a rejected claim</a>.</p>

<p>Suspension or cancellation for more than 13 weeks since reason or notice was sent generally cannot be restored. The customer must test their eligibility and reclaim payment. Advise the customer of claiming procedures. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-01010000-01.html">Contact in relation to an intended claim (CLK)</a>.</p>

<p>There are some exceptions, if customer was cancelled for these reasons&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>CDR</strong> (Customer failed to re-engage), and customer disputes this, investigate the cancellation. If the cancellation is incorrect or the Service Officer is unsure, the Service Officer must refer the record to the Participation Solutions Team (PST) for action. The <a href="../job-seekers/001-03030030-05.html">Resources</a> page contains a link to contact details. Procedure ends here</li>
		<li>
<strong>WUK</strong> (whereabouts unknown). The customer would not have received advice of the decision to suspend or cancel, if they were not at their known address and/or advice of the decision was returned to Services Australia. This means that the date of effect of the restoration is the date of the suspension or cancellation</li>
		</ul>
<p>Each customer's circumstances must be looked at individually to determine if they are entitled to receive arrears upon restoration. Service Officers must be satisfied the customer did not receive advice of the decision to suspend or cancel, and they retained qualification and payability during the period.</p>

<p>If the decision is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
to restore payment with arrears, <a href="../job-seekers/001-03030030-03.html#bp03_tbl_Possible_reason_Step05">go to Step 5</a></li>

<p>Determine if the payment can be restored on initial contact.</p>

<p>Check the customer's Document List (<strong>DL</strong>) screen for the <strong>DOC</strong> regarding the cancellation or suspension.</p>

<p>Any customer requesting restoration up to 13 weeks since the date of effect of cancellation should be advised to provide reasons. The Service Officer determines&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
whether the reason/s are acceptable</li>
		<li>
if payment can be restored</li>
		</ul>
<p>It is generally not possible to restore the payments unless the cancellation was in error and/or it can be determined that the customer has continued to meet mutual obligation requirements since last paid.</p>

<p><strong>Mutual obligation requirements</strong></p>

<p>Determine if the customer has continued to meet mutual obligation requirements during the cancellation period. The customer should be asked how they have supported themselves since last paid an income support payment, for example, have they worked? Have they used liquid assets? If it cannot be determined that the customer has continued qualification for the period the payment should not be restored.</p>

<p>Check the <strong>Participation Compliance summary</strong> screen in Process Direct&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Go to the Participation Compliance Hub (<strong>BIPCW</strong>) screen</li>
		<li>
Select <strong>Compliance workflow</strong> from the <strong>Completed/provider compliance actions</strong></li>
		</ul>
<p>If compliance action or a 'held serious failure/s' is displayed this is a strong indicator that the customer did not retain qualification during the period.</p>
