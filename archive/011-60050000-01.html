<p>This document outlines the CTG PBS Co-payment which commenced on 1 July 2010 to improve access to affordable PBS medicines for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living with, or at risk of, chronic disease. From 1 July 2021, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people can be registered for the program by any PBS prescriber or Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Practitioner no matter where they live within Australia, and regardless of their chronic disease status. </p>

<p>From 1 July 2021, patients not already registered for the program can be registered at any medical practice. All PBS prescribers, Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra) Aboriginal Health Practitioners (registered as a Medicare provider), and their HPOS nominated delegates can check a patient’s CTG status, and register them. </p>

<p>Patients who are already registered do not need to be registered again. </p>

<p>Eligibility assessment for CTG PBS Co-payment only needs to be undertaken once. As soon as the patient is registered for the program, they can access the benefits of the program, regardless of which prescriber they see, or which pharmacy they attend to fill prescriptions.</p>

<p>A patient is eligible if they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
self-identify as an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander Australian</li>
		<li>
will have setbacks in preventing or managing their condition if they do not take the medicine, and</li>
		<li>
are unlikely to keep up their treatment without help with the cost</li>
		</ul>
<p>A patient’s registration for the CTG PBS Co-payment program will be stored on their Medicare record in the Consumer Directory Maintenance System (CDMS). Services Australia staff have access to view a patient’s status, and register a patient for the program, on behalf of a PBS prescriber or Aboriginal Health Practitioner where they cannot access HPOS. Services Australia staff cannot register patients for their HPOS nominated delegates.</p>

<p><strong>When staff should check a patient’s CTG status, and register them on behalf of the PBS prescriber or Ahpra registered Aboriginal Health Practitioner (registered as a Medicare provider).</strong></p>

<p>There are some scenarios where staff will need to check a patient’s CTG status, or register them for CTG on behalf of the prescriber. These scenarios include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Where a prescriber or Ahpra registered Aboriginal Health Practitioner registered with Medicare as a provider needs to issue a prescription to a patient who is in consultation with them, and they do not have internet access</li>
		<li>
Where a prescriber or Ahpra registered Aboriginal Health Practitioner registered with Medicare as a provider&#58; </li>
			<ul>			<li>
needs to issue a prescription to a patient who is in consultation with them</li>
			<li>
does not have their Provider Digital Access (PRODA) and HPOS accounts fully enabled, and</li>
			<li>
there is no HPOS delegate who can action this for them</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Where a prescriber or Ahpra registered Aboriginal Health Practitioner registered with Medicare as a provider needs to issue a prescription to a patient who is in consultation with them, but is having system issues and cannot see the CTG tile in HPOS</li>
		<li>
Where a prescriber or Ahpra registered Aboriginal Health Practitioner registered with Medicare as a provider needs to issue a prescription to a patient who is in consultation with them and Services Australia is experiencing a system outage preventing external access to PRODA or HPOS </li>
		</ul>

<p>All other scenarios where there is no immediate urgency to issue a prescription to a patient, including checking a patient’s CTG registration status, should be escalated according to the table on the <a href="../your-health/011-60050000-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Handle_calls_re">Resources<strong></a> </strong>page.</p>

<p>Prescribers wishing to register patients for the program will need to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Ensure that their PRODA and HPOS accounts are active in order to search and view their patient’s CTG status and register them if necessary</li>
		<li>
Create a PRODA and HPOS account if they do not already have one, so that they can manage their patients CTG registrations online</li>
		<li>
Create and link their authorised delegates in HPOS that they want to have view and register access to the patient CTG tile</li>

Endorse eligible prescriptions (only PBS General Schedule items are included) with the <strong>CTG</strong> annotation to assist pharmacists with dispensing. See Prescriber annotation of CTG prescriptions below</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> prescribers do not need to retain written evidence of a patient’s consent to register for the program. Patient consent is captured when the prescriber completes the digital declaration when reviewing or registering the patient through the CTG PBS Co-payment Register tile within HPOS. Staff registering someone over the phone can obtain verbal confirmation of a patient’s consent and eligibility for the program, from the prescriber. The <a href="../your-health/011-60050000-03.html">Process</a> page outlines the registration steps.</p>

Although the CTG annotation is no longer required form 1 July 2021, prescribers are encouraged to continue to endorse prescriptions. This will assist the pharmacist to identify those patients that may be registered for the program. See ‘Handle calls relating to the CTG PBS Co-payment Program’ on the <a href="../your-health/011-60050000-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Handle_calls_re">Resources</a> page. </p>

<p>If the claim is submitted successfully, the pharmacist is reimbursed the cost of the medicine supplied, inclusive of the Co-payment relief amount applicable.</p>

<p>If the prescription is a CTG under co-payment prescription (those prescriptions where a PBS subsidy is not applicable), the pharmacist is reimbursed both for the standard PBS medicine and for the proportion of the normal PBS Co-payment that has not been paid by the patient.</p>

<p>Services Australia make the payments to pharmacies as per the normal payment process (not retrospectively). Services Australia calculate these amounts automatically.</p>

<p>Community pharmacists will be reimbursed for the proportion of the normal PBS Co-payment that has not been paid by the patient.</p>

<p>The following groups can dispense CTG PBS prescriptions&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
All approved community pharmacies</li>
		<li>
Suppliers approved under section 92 of the National Health Act 1953</li>
		<li>
Private Hospitals approved under section 94 of the National Health Act 1953 </li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if Services Australia receive an enquiry from a hospital pharmacy (including section 94 approved public hospitals) about whether they can dispense a CTG annotated PBS script, they should be advised they are not able to dispense PBS scripts as CTG. The patient will have to pay their usual non-CTG patient co-payment amount. Alternately, the hospital pharmacy can advise the patient to take their CTG annotated PBS script to a community pharmacy who are able to dispense as CTG.</p>

<p>Pharmacy software prints <strong>U</strong> for some CTG prescriptions as part of the serial number. This occurs when prescriptions that would normally have been an <strong>under co-payment</strong> supply (priced below the general Co-payment) is now priced at the concessional co-payment for CTG patients. This results in serial numbers like UG (number) such as UG1.</p>
