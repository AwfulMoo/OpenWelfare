<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> job seekers may be employed as casual or part-time under YBWS. These job seekers may not be paid enough employment income to reduce their income support payment to nil. For further information, <a href="../job-seekers/001-17030800-03.html#bp03_tbl_Youth_Bonus_Wag_Step12">go to  Step 12</a>.</p>

<p>How to identify if a job seeker is employed under the YBWS initiative&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
information will display on the <strong>Participation Summary</strong> screen in Process Direct, under the Subsidy heading and will include the job seeker's start date with the initiative</li>
		<li>
YBWS information may be displayed on the <strong>Participation Summary</strong> screen even though the customer may not be suspended (SUS) or cancelled (CAN), that is, they could be reporting income within a 6 fortnight nil rate period or reporting income that is below the income test limit</li>
		<li>
the YBWS information will display as 'no current information' where the job seeker is not a current YBWS participant. This could be because they have had payment restored within the 26 week suspension period or where their income support payment is cancelled at the end of the 26 week suspension period</li>
		<li>
previous periods in YBWS will be included under the History heading</li>
		</ul>
<p>Has the job seeker contacted Services Australia within the 26 week suspension period?</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>, and&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the job seeker advises they have not commenced employment under the YBWS incentive <strong>and</strong> is incorrectly coded as YBS suspend, <a href="../job-seekers/001-17030800-03.html#bp03_tbl_Youth_Bonus_Wag_Step03">go to Step 3</a></li>

<p>If there has been no contact from the job seeker and the YBWS 26 week suspension period has ended, the job seeker's payment will auto-change from suspended to cancelled with the reason '<strong>YBE</strong>'. A cancellation advice letter will be issued to the job seeker.</p>

<p>Once this has happened, their income support payment cannot be restored and the job seeker will have to lodge a new claim, if they wish to claim an income support payment.</p>

<p>The customer can apply for a formal review of the cancellation decision. For more details about reviews and appeals, see <a href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/109-02000000-01.html">Request for an explanation, quality check or review (CLK)</a>.</p>

<p>Service Officers must use the <strong>Verify Employment Separation</strong> guided procedure to record that the job seeker has ceased YBWS employment.</p>

		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> ensure all evidence is attached to the customer's record.</p>

<p>If the customer<strong> does not</strong> have evidence to verify ceasing employment, the preferred option is to tell the customer to complete the online '<strong>Advise End of Employment service</strong>'.</p>

<p>Where the job seeker's employment has ceased due to no fault of their own, their income support payment can be restored.</p>

<p>If the reason for ceasing employment was the job seeker's fault, their income support payment will be cancelled. An unemployment failure should be generated if payment is reclaimed within 6 weeks of voluntarily leaving work or being dismissed due to misconduct.</p>

<p>Service Officers will need to make a determination to restore or cancel a jobseekers payment based on the following reasons&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Shortage of work</li>
		<li>
Unsuitability for the type of work</li>
		<li>
Unsatisfactory work performance</li>
		<li>
Misconduct as an employee</li>
		<li>

		<li>
Redundancy</li>
		<li>
End of season or contract</li>

<p>Where the reason for ceasing employment is the fault of the job seeker and, the reason for ceasing employment has been confirmed by evidence on the Employment Separation Certificate (SU001), or from other evidence provided, the payment is <strong>not</strong> to be restored.</p>

<p>An unemployment failure should be generated if payment is reclaimed within 6 weeks of voluntarily leaving work or being dismissed due to misconduct.</p>

<p><strong>Cancelling the income support payment</strong></p>

<p>Cancel the payment from the date the job seeker ceased employment using the '<strong>Verify Employment Separation</strong>' guided procedure to correctly cancel the job seeker's payment.</p>

<p>The evidence provided by the job seeker or their employer must include information on any leave or redundancy payments received by the job seeker on termination from the employer. These payments are to be assessed and recorded on the <strong>Maintain</strong> screen in the guided procedure and applied under the existing <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-05020020-01.html">Income Maintenance Period (IMP)</a> rules.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the <strong>Verify Employment Separation</strong> guided procedure may display the IMP leave types in a different order on the <strong>Review</strong> screen compared to the Income Maintenance Period Summary (<strong>IMPS</strong>) screen. The overall IMP calculated start and end period in the guided procedure will be calculated correctly and display as per the <strong>IMPS</strong> screen calculation for the start and end date of the applied IMP.</p>

<p>Finish the <strong>Verify Employment Separation</strong> guided procedure and include comments within the <strong>Notes</strong> tab of the <strong>Cease Employment - Change of Circumstance</strong> activity advising the reason for cancellation.</p>

<p>The job seeker's payment will auto-change from suspended to cancelled with the reason '<strong>YBS</strong>'. A cancellation advice will be issued to the job seeker.</p>

<p>Once this has occurred their income support payment cannot be restored and the job seeker will have to lodge a new claim if they wish to claim an income support payment.</p>

<p><strong>Advising the job seeker</strong></p>

<p>Advise the job seeker their income support payment has been cancelled, if the job seeker is not present make one genuine contact attempt. If the job seeker still requires an income support payment they must lodge a new claim.</p>

<p>The job seeker must be advised that an unemployment preclusion period may apply, if an unemployment failure has been committed due to voluntary unemployment or dismissal due to misconduct.</p>

<p>If the contact attempt is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>successful or the job seeker is present</strong>, record discussion information within the <strong>Notes</strong> tab of the <strong>Cease Employment - Change of Circumstance</strong> activity</li>
		<li>
<strong>unsuccessful</strong>, record this information within the <strong>Notes</strong> tab of the <strong>Cease Employment - Change of Circumstance</strong> activity</li>
		</ul>
<p>The customer can apply for a formal review of the cancellation decision. For more details about reviews and appeals, see <a href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/109-02000000-01.html">Request for an explanation, or application for a formal review</a>.</p>

<p>If the reason for ceasing employment is accepted and payment can be restored, action the restoration via the <strong>Verify Employment Separation</strong> guided procedure.

the reason for restoration, and</li>
			<li>
the date the customer first contacted</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>Any leave or redundancy payments received by the customer on termination from the employer are to be assessed, and recorded on the <strong>Maintain</strong> screen in the guided procedure and applied under the existing <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-05020020-01.html">Income Maintenance Period (IMP)</a> rules.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the '<strong>Verify Employment Separation</strong>' guided procedure may display the IMP leave types in a different order on the <strong>Review</strong> screen compared to the Income Maintenance Period Summary (<strong>IMPS</strong>) screen. The overall IMP calculated start and end period in the guided procedure will be calculated correctly and display as per the <strong>IMPS</strong> screen calculation for the start and end date of the applied IMP.</p>

<p>If the <strong>Cease Employment - Change of Circumstance</strong> activity has not been completed upon finalisation of the guided procedure, manually change the status on the Change of Circumstances activity to '<strong>Completed</strong>'.</p>

<p>Any Centrepay deductions the job seeker had in place prior to commencing the 26 week suspension period and concession card entitlements will recommence.</p>

<p><strong>Continuity dates</strong> - Existing continuous period on payment rules will apply to restorations. For example, if a customer is restored after being suspended for more than 13 weeks, continuity dates will be auto-reset as the date payment recommenced.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the payment does not restore when expected after completing the guided procedure, the record will need to be checked to determine what is preventing the restoration from completing. Any incorrect information will need to be updated before the payment can be restored.</p>

<p>Some possible (but not limited to) reasons could include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
End date the job seeker's full-time work on the Customer Employment Status Update (<strong>EAES</strong>) screen, or</li>
		<li>
Key a 'zero' income against the last employer that the job seeker had, or</li>
		<li>
Ensure that there are no outstanding previous reporting periods that have not been completed, or</li>
		<li>
End date the 'other income' on the Other Income Summary (<strong>OINS</strong>) screen, see <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010010-01.html">Recording and correcting employment income details</a></li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> customers who turn 22 during the YBS suspension period may not be able to be restored using the <strong>Verify Employment Separation</strong> guided procedure. Refer to scenarios in <a href="../job-seekers/001-17030800-05.html">Resources</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Once a customer is restored from a YBWS suspension period, the 26 week YBWS period ends. If they then return to work they must advise, and normal Return to Work (RTW) provisions are applied. The customer's payment will not re-suspend YBS unless their employment services provider sends through a new second notification.
