<p>An exemption can be extended provided that the customer's circumstances about the exemption remain current. Service Officers must confirm that the customer is still eligible for the exemption. If not, consider whether another exemption type is more appropriate for their circumstances.</p>

<p>Compulsory ParentsNext participants are eligible for an exemption from participation requirements for up to 16 weeks from the date of their partner's or immediate family member's death. The bereavement exemption must be coded to make sure the customer is able to be exempt for up to 16 weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> this exemption differs from the bereavement mutual obligation exemption that is limited to 14 weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Death of a partner</strong></p>
<p>If the Miscellaneous Update Details (<strong>NMIS</strong>) screen is coded in relation to the partner's death, a mutual obligation exemption will be automatically granted for a maximum of 14 weeks or if the customer is pregnant, to the end of the pregnancy (whichever is longer) where evidence is provided. A manual bereavement exemption must still be coded to make sure the customer can access the maximum 16 weeks available.</p>
<p>If the customer is pregnant and still a compulsory ParentsNext participant when the expected date of birth is reached, the system will automatically apply a ParentsNext temporary period of confinement (PTC) exemption until the child is 9 months of age.</p>
