<p>If the customer or their partner's payments have been suspended or cancelled due to non-lodgement of the transfer, payments can be restored without loss of payment if the transfer to Age Pension is submitted with required documents within 13 weeks of the date last paid.</p>

<p>If the customer (or their partner) is over Age Pension age, superannuation products <strong>must</strong> be provided before their payments can be restored. If they advise they do not have any superannuation investments, their payment can be restored. This response should be fully documented.</p>

Carer Payment (XWP) is suspended or cancelled and will not be restored - for example, the customer's only or last payment level Carer Allowance has been suspended or cancelled and will not be restored from date of suspension - see <a href="../carers/009-19081557-01.html">Transfer from Wife Pension (WP) to Carer Payment (CP)</a></li>

		<ul>		<li>
If customer contact is successful&#58; advise the advantages and disadvantages of transferring. Confirm their decision to transfer to Age Pension and <strong>DOC</strong> the record</li>
		<li>
If customer contact is unsuccessful&#58; <strong>DOC</strong> the record with details of that attempts and process the transfer</li>
		</ul>
<p>The customer would be disadvantaged by transferring to Age Pension in the following scenarios, however, they may still prefer to access the advantages of Age Pension.</p>

<p><strong>Carer Supplement</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
This disadvantage applies to all customers receiving Carer Payment (CP). If transferred to Age Pension, they would no longer be eligible for an <a href="../carers/009-07010000-01.html">annual Carer Supplement</a> in respect of CP. If they receive Carer Allowance (CA) they will continue to get an annual Carer Supplement in respect of CA.</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Bereavement assistance</strong></p>

<p>This disadvantage applies to all CP recipients if they are caring for someone who is not their partner and they transfer to Age Pension&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Customer will no longer eligible for a <a href="../bereavement/099-04000000-01.html">CP Lump Sum Bereavement Payment</a>. This may be payable if the care receiver is a child, is single, or is partnered and the care receiver's partner (who is not the carer) is not getting an income support payment.</li>
		<li>
If the customer gets CP (XWP), they may be eligible for a Lump Sum Bereavement Payment (as above) if they only get one payment level Carer Allowance and the care receiver dies.</li>
		<li>
If the customer is only caring for their partner, they may still be eligible for a Lump Sum Bereavement Payment if they transfer to Age Pension</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Delaying the transfer</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the customer still elects to transfer, they may prefer to delay it until their first Entitlement Period Start Date (EPSD) after 1 July if Carer Supplement is due to be paid. This includes when they are in a 14 week bereavement period or in a 14 week continuation period after the care receiver has been admitted to an institution. There is no need to delay it if CP will stop before 1 July for any reason e.g. due to respite or the maximum portability period.</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Transferring from Disability Support Pension (DSP)</strong></p>

<p>Customers in receipt of <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03170000-01.html">Incentive Allowance (IA)</a> will lose eligibility to IA if they transfer to Age Pension, see the Pensions Rate Calculation (<strong>PRC</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>Customers in receipt of IA who indicate they wish to transfer to Age Pension must be contacted to advise that&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
IA will cancel, and</li>
		<li>
they may be eligible for <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-08080010-01.html">Rent Assistance (RA)</a> if they are renting, and</li>
		<li>
if single, paying rent and sharing accommodation, they may wish to consider remaining on DSP and claim RA instead of continuing to receive IA as RA may be a higher amount, see <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-18092640-01.html">Sharer Status field on the Accommodation Details (<strong>AC</strong>) screen</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>Customers whose partner is paid CP under the <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04024000-01.html">NZ agreement</a> should be contacted as CP will cease if the DSP customer is transferred to Age Pension. The agreement country code is on the partner's <strong>ARD</strong> screen.</p>

<p>Check if the customer wishes to stay on DSP and not transfer to Age Pension at this time. See the <a href="../older-australians/065-03030010-05.html">Resources</a> page for information about Age Pension versus current payment.</p>

<p>If customer wants to change their decision about transferring to Age Pension, continue with applicable checks ensuring that change of decision is recorded in finalisation <strong>DOC</strong> along with any other relevant details.</p>

<p><strong>Home Property Extended Curtilage</strong></p>

<p>If the customer's record indicates their home property is on more than 2 hectares they will have been asked home property questions.</p>

<p>If not previously recorded on the Real Estate Business Details (<strong>REBS</strong>) screen and the customer's home property exceeds 2 hectares - issue Module R, as the question set will not be included in their online transfer or ACC.</p>

If customer is eligible for the Extended Curtilage concession, apply updates to <strong>REBS</strong> including <strong>Curtilage Type</strong> field from the later <strong>Date of Event of APA</strong> or <strong>DOR</strong></li>
		<li>
Due to a system limitation, if the <strong>Date of Event</strong> is more than 30 days in the future the <strong>REBS</strong> coding cannot be applied. In this instance, the TTA activity must be <strong>Held</strong> until a date within 30 days of Age Pension age</li>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; Widow Allowance (WA) and Partner Allowance (PA) will cease on 1 January 2022. Customers will need to transfer to Age Pension to continue receiving payment after this date.</p>

<p>If the customer's decision to transfer to Age Pension would disadvantage them make 2 genuine attempts to contact the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Customer contact is successful&#58; advise the advantages and disadvantages of transferring. Confirm their decision to transfer to Age Pension and <strong>DOC</strong> the record</li>
		<li>
Customer contact is unsuccessful&#58; <strong>DOC </strong>the record with details of that attempts and process the transfer</li>
		</ul>
<p>The customer would be disadvantaged by transferring to Age Pension in the following scenarios, however, they may still prefer to access the advantages of Age Pension.</p>

<p><strong>Transferring from Carer Payment (CP)</strong></p>

<p>Contact the customer where possible, if their choice would disadvantage them to confirm they wish to transfer from Carer Payment to Age Pension. They would be disadvantaged by transferring to Age Pension in the following scenarios. However, they may still prefer to access the advantages of Age Pension.</p>

<p>Carer Supplement</p>
		<ul>		<li>
This disadvantage applies to all CP recipients. On Age Pension they will no longer be eligible for an <a href="../carers/009-07010000-01.html">annual Carer Supplement in respect of CP</a>. They will continue to get an annual Carer Supplement in respect of CA if they get CA</li>
		</ul>
<p>Bereavement assistance</p>
		<ul>		<li>
This disadvantage applies to all CP recipients if they are caring for someone who is not their partner&#58;</li>
		<li>
They will not be eligible for a <a href="../bereavement/099-04000000-01.html">CP Lump Sum Bereavement Payment</a> if they transfer. This may be payable if the care receiver is a child, is single, or is partnered and the care receiver's partner (who is not the carer) is not getting an income support payment</li>
		<li>
If the customer gets CP (XWP), they may be eligible for a Lump Sum Bereavement Payment (as above) if they only get one payment level Carer Allowance and the care receiver dies</li>
		<li>
If the customer is only caring for their partner, they may still be eligible for a Lump Sum Bereavement Payment if they transfer to Age Pension</li>
		</ul>
<p>Delaying the transfer</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the customer still elects to transfer, the customer may prefer to delay it until entitlement period start date (EPSD) of first entitlement period (EP) after 1 July if Carer Supplement is due to be paid. This includes when they are in a 14 week bereavement period or in a 14 week continuation period after the care receiver has been admitted to an institution. There is no need to delay it if CP will stop before 1 July for any reason e.g. due to respite or the maximum portability period.</li>

<p><strong>Transferring from Disability Support Pension (DSP)</strong></p>

<p>Customers in receipt of <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03170000-01.html">Incentive Allowance (IA)</a> will lose eligibility to IA if they transfer to Age Pension, see the Pensions Rate Calculation (<strong>PRC</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>Customers in receipt of IA who indicate they wish to transfer to Age Pension must be contacted to advise that&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
IA will cancel, and</li>
		<li>
they may be eligible for <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-08080010-01.html">Rent Assistance (RA)</a> if they are renting, and</li>
		<li>
if single, paying rent and sharing accommodation, they may wish to consider remaining on DSP and claim RA instead of continuing to receive IA as RA may be a higher amount, see <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-18092640-01.html">Sharer Status field on the Accommodation Details (AC) screen</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>Customers whose partner is paid CP under the <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-04024000-01.html">NZ agreement</a> should be contacted as CP will cease if the DSP customer is transferred to Age Pension. The agreement country code is on the partner's <strong>ARD</strong> screen.</p>

<p>Check if the customer wishes to stay on DSP and not transfer to Age Pension at this time. See the <a href="../older-australians/065-03030010-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Age_Pension_ver">Resources</a> page for information about Age Pension versus current payment.</p>

<p><strong>Superannuation</strong></p>

<p>For customers of Age Pension age, superannuation products must be provided and details of any changes to income and assets advised.</p>

<p>For example, details of approved deposit fund, deferred annuity or superannuation fund may need to be provided.</p>

<p>Superannuation is assessable at Age Pension age whether the customer transfers to Age Pension or not.</p>

<p>This includes customers who are blind, and&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
have a partner who is not blind, or</li>
		<li>
they or their partner receive Rent Assistance (RA)</li>
		</ul>
<p>If their <strong>partner</strong> is over Age pension age and is not already on an income support payment, details of the partner's superannuation will also be required.</p>

<p><strong>Home Property Extended Curtilage</strong></p>

<p>If the customer's record indicates their home property is on more than 2 hectares they will have been asked home property questions.</p>

<p>If not previously recorded on REBS and the customer's home property exceeds 2 hectares - issue <a target="_blank" class="extwebsitelink" href="https&#58;//www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/forms/mod-r">Module R</a>, as the question set will not be included in their online transfer or ACC.</p>

<p>For customers transferring from DSP who were previously in receipt of Incentive Allowance (IA), check at finalisation that the IA has cancelled.

<p><strong>Transferring from working age payments - existing problem</strong></p>

<p>Customers who have transferred to Age Pension from working age payments are not always paid their final payment due in the entitlement period in which Age Pension starts.

<p><strong>Concession Cards</strong></p>

<p>If the customer retains entitlement to the Pensioner Concession Card, a new card is not issued unless the customer requests one. An <strong>exception</strong> to this is when a transferring from mainstream pension to Blind Pension a new card will be issued as it will be slightly different.</p>

<p><strong>Transferring from Carer Payment (CP)</strong></p>

<p>Contact the customer where possible if their choice would disadvantage them to confirm they wish to transfer from Carer Payment to Age Pension. They would be disadvantaged by transferring to Age Pension in the following scenarios. However, they may still prefer to access the advantages of Age Pension.</p>

<p>Carer Supplement</p>
		<ul>		<li>
This disadvantage applies to all CP recipients. On Age Pension they will no longer be eligible for an <a href="../carers/009-07010000-01.html">annual Carer Supplement in respect of CP</a>. They will continue to get an annual Carer Supplement in respect of CA if they get CA</li>
		</ul>
<p>Bereavement assistance</p>
		<ul>		<li>
This disadvantage applies to all CP recipients if they are caring for someone who is not their partner</li>
		<li>
They will not be eligible for a <a href="../bereavement/099-04000000-01.html">CP Lump Sum Bereavement Payment</a> if they transfer. This may be payable if the care receiver is a child, is single, or is partnered and the care receiver's partner (who is not the carer) is not getting an income support payment</li>
		<li>
If the customer gets CP (XWP), they may be eligible for a Lump Sum Bereavement Payment (as above) if they only get one payment level Carer Allowance and the care receiver dies</li>
		<li>
If the customer is only caring for their partner, they may still be eligible for a Lump Sum Bereavement Payment if they transfer to Age Pension</li>
		</ul>
<p>Delaying the transfer</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the customer still elects to transfer, the customer may prefer to delay it until entitlement period start date (EPSD) of first entitlement period (EP) after 1 July if Carer Supplement is due to be paid. This includes when they are in a 14 week bereavement period or in a 14 week continuation period after the care receiver has been admitted to an institution. There is no need to delay it if CP will stop before 1 July for any reason e.g. due to respite or the maximum portability period</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Transferring from Disability Support Pension (DSP)</strong></p>

<p>Customers in receipt of <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03170000-01.html">Incentive Allowance (IA)</a> will lose eligibility to IA if they transfer to Age Pension, see the Pensions Rate Calculation (<strong>PRC</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>Customers in receipt of IA who indicate they wish to transfer to Age Pension must be contacted to advise that&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
IA will cancel, and</li>
		<li>
they may be eligible for <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-08080010-01.html">Rent Assistance (RA)</a> if they are renting, and</li>
		<li>

		</ul>
<p>Customers whose partner is paid CP under the NZ agreement should be contacted as CP will cease if the DSP customer is transferred to Age Pension. The agreement country code is on the partner's <strong>ARD</strong> screen.</p>

<p>If the current payment needs to be restored, complete this in a separate activity before processing the transfer to Age Pension. See <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-10040000-01.html">Restoration of payments</a>.</p>

<p>In those cases&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>

		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> staff who encounter urgent transfers to Age Pension where customer is experiencing hardship or has been cancelled, and who do not have appropriate Transfer to Age Pension skill tags, should refer to the <a href="#_top">Background</a> page.</p>

<p><strong>If DSP is suspended due to returning to work</strong></p>

<p>The customer can still transfer to Age Pension. However, as DSP can be suspended for up to 2 years they will need to be contacted to check that all details on their record are still current and a reporting regime considered for employment income.</p>

<p>The script is to be used for customers who wish to transfer to Age Pension as well as customers who wish to stay on their current income support payment.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the SA383 form has not matured from the Future Activity List (<strong>FAL</strong>) screen using the 'actual' DOR, the system will default the DOR to the date form was originally issued. This field cannot be changed within the PEN/AAP activity.</p>

<p>The script automatically defaults the date of commencement (effect date) to the customer's Age Pension age date unless pension age has already been reached. In these cases the date of commencement (effect date) defaults to 'today's' date. SOs need to establish the most appropriate 'transfer date' based on the customer's individual circumstances and manually adjust the date of commencement (effect date).</p>

<p>The script will complete background checks to ensure the customer is not disadvantaged by transferring.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if it is a transfer within the Pension system (from DSP, CAR, PPS) and more than 14 days before the customer reaches Age Pension age, the script cannot be run, so the PEN/AAP Transfer to Age activity must be HELD until a date within 14 days of Age Pension age.</p>

<p>In order to hold the AAP activity&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
manually select the activity, go to Assessment Results (<strong>AR</strong>) screen, do not finalise activity, exit activity and return to the Activity List (<strong>AL</strong>) screen</li>
		<li>
AAP activity status will now display as 'started', HOLD activity to a date within 14 days of Age Pension age</li>
		</ul>
<p>JobSeeker Payment (JSP) will be cancelled when the customer reaches Age Pension age. If entitled to Age Pension, Special Benefit is no longer legally payable.</p>

<p><strong>Transferring from Disability Support Pension (DSP) - Incentive Allowance</strong></p>

<p>For customers transferring from DSP who were previously in receipt of Incentive Allowance (IA), check at finalisation that the IA has cancelled.

The Resources page contains a link to mySupport for a webform to escalate the issue.</p>

<p><strong>Transferring from working age payments - existing problem</strong></p>

<p>Customers who have transferred to Age Pension from working age payments are not always paid their final payment due in the entitlement period in which Age Pension starts. Often the payment is cancelled for not lodging (CAN-DNL) but in many cases there was no requirement to lodge in that fortnight.</p>

<p>To ensure the correct entitlement is received, check the customer's record after the first payment of Age Pension. <a target="_blank" href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-06090030-03.html">A manual review can be set up</a> as a reminder.</p>

<p>If the payment cannot be issued it should be reported to the ICT Service Desk.</p>

<p><strong>Concession Cards</strong></p>

<p>If the customer retains entitlement to the Pensioner Concession Card, a new card is not issued unless the customer requests one. An <strong>exception</strong> to this is when a transferring from mainstream pension to Blind Pension a new card will be issued as it will be slightly different.</p>

<p>Any new card issued after the transfer is processed will show the primary payment at time of issue. This includes cards sent annually one month before the current card expires.</p>

<p><strong>Centrepay deductions</strong></p>

<p><a href="../payment-delivery/103-09030000-01.html">Centrepay deductions</a> may only transfer to Age Pension if the customer is transferring from a payment within the PEN system. If they do not automatically transfer as part of the new claim process, discuss with the customer whether they would like the existing Centrepay deductions set up when the transfer is completed.

<strong>Note&#58;</strong> if transfer is within the Pension system (from DSP, CAR, PPS) and more than 14 days before the customer reaches Age Pension age, the Benefit Action (<strong>BA</strong>) screen cannot be coded, so the PEN/AAP activity must be HELD until a date within 14 days of Age Pension age. In order to hold the AAP activity, manually select the activity, go to Assessment Results (<strong>AR</strong>) screen, do not finalise activity, exit activity and return to the Activity List (<strong>AL</strong>) screen.

Current WA customers who will not have 10 years qualifying Australian residence for Age Pension on 1 January 2022, will require a residency exemption to be coded on the Additional Residence Details (<strong>ARD</strong>) screen as part of their claim/transfer to allow transfer to Age Pension on that date.

			<ul>			<li>
Go to the <strong>ARD</strong> screen<br>- Insert Date of Event as 01/01/2022. (Do not add an earlier date. It will assess the claim incorrectly)<br>- <strong>Residence Test Exemption code</strong> - 'WA'</li>
			<li>
Go to the Pensions Assessment (<strong>PNA</strong>) screen and change the Assessment Date to 01/01/2022</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> JobSeeker Payment will be cancelled when the customer reaches Age Pension age. If eligible for Age Pension, Special Benefit is no longer legally payable.</p>

<p>If a <a target="_blank" href="../people-with-disability/008-03040030-01.html">blindness assessment</a> was undertaken but the customer did not meet the criteria for permanent blindness, issue Q134 letter to advise the reasons for the decision and their review and appeal rights.</p>

<p>Customers in receipt of Age Pension (Blind) (Benefit Status <strong>AGB/CUR</strong>) can <a href="../people-with-disability/008-01030100-01.html">choose to receive their Centrelink letters in an alternative format</a>.</p>

<p>If the customer is deceased, a manual letter (Q999) must be issued to the deceased customer's estate. See <a href="../older-australians/065-03030010-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Letter_text">Resources</a> page for example text to use.</p>

<p><strong>Transferring from Disability Support Pension DSP) - Incentive Allowance</strong></p>

<p>For customers transferring from DSP who were previously in receipt of Incentive Allowance (IA), check at finalisation that the IA has cancelled. If IA remains current, escalate to Information Communication Technology (ICT) to ensure the customer does not incur a debt. The <a href="../older-australians/065-03030010-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Intranet_links">Resources</a> page contains a link to mySupport for a webform to escalate the issue.</p>

<p><strong>Transferring from working age payments - existing problem</strong></p>

<p>Customers who have transferred to Age Pension from working age payments are not always paid their final payment due in the entitlement period in which Age Pension starts. Often the payment is cancelled for not lodging (CAN-DNL) but in many cases there was no requirement to lodge in that fortnight.</p>

<p>To ensure the correct entitlement is received, check the customer's record after the first payment of Age Pension. <a target="_blank" href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-06090030-03.html">A manual review can be set up</a> as a reminder.</p>

<p>If the payment cannot be issued it should be reported to the ICT Service Desk.</p>

<p><strong>Concession Cards</strong></p>

<p>If the customer retains entitlement to the Pensioner Concession Card, a new card is not issued unless the customer requests one. An <strong>exception</strong> to this is when a transferring from mainstream pension to Blind Pension a new card will be issued as it will be slightly different.</p>

<p>Any new card issued after the transfer is processed will show the primary payment at time of issue. This includes cards sent annually one month before the current card expires.</p>

<p><strong>Centrepay deductions</strong></p>

<p><a href="../payment-delivery/103-09030000-01.html">Centrepay deductions</a> may only transfer to Age Pension if the customer is transferring from a payment within the PEN system. If they do not automatically transfer as part of the new claim process, discuss with the customer whether they would like the existing Centrepay deductions set up when the transfer is completed. If so, manually code once the transfer is finalised.</p>
