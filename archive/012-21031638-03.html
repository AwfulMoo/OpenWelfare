it relates to an incident or series of related incidents that occurred in connection with the practice of that person of an allied health profession</li>

<p>A certificate of qualifying claim is a contingent promise to reimburse the person for costs directly resulting from a claim. The certificate is used as a verification tool which states that a claim is a qualifying claim for the purpose of the AHECS.</p>

<p>Services Australia has 21 days from receiving an application to decide whether to issue a certificate. If Services Australia decide to issue a certificate, it must give the applicant a copy of the certificate within 28 days of making its decision. However, if (for any reason) a certificate is not issued, it will not affect the validity of the decision.</p>

<p>If further information is required for the claim, Services Australia has 21 days in which to issue a certificate from the date the requested information is received.</p>

<p>When a certificate is issued and comes into force, the certificate remains in force until it is revoked. The certificate must&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
identify the practitioner</li>
		<li>
identify the claim</li>
		<li>
identify the contract of insurance</li>
		<li>
specify the relevant threshold</li>
		</ul>
<p>The certificate may also contain other material.</p>

<p>If Services Australia refuses to issue a qualifying claim certificate, an application may be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) for review of the decision.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Application for a certificate</strong></p>

<p>An application for the issue of a certificate in relation to a claim may be made by the person against whom the claim is or was made, or by a person acting on that person's behalf.</p>

<p>The application must be&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
made in writing using a form approved by Services Australia</li>
		<li>
accompanied by the documents and other information required by the form approved by Services Australia</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p><strong>Revoking a certificate</strong></p>

<p>Services Australia may revoke a certificate if it is satisfied the practitioner is no longer eligible for the AHECS.</p>

<p>In considering whether a health professional still qualifies for a certificate, Services Australia may regard other matters that have occurred since the decision to issue the certificate.</p>

<div class="showcont">


<p>AHECS applications can only be made after a qualifying claim certificate is issued, as this ensures that the person making the application qualifies for payment.</p>

<p><strong>Submitting applications</strong></p>

<p>The AHECS application form is required together with documented evidence, for example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a statement of claim</li>
		<li>
copies of any itemised invoices for external legal costs or amounts that have been paid</li>
		<li>
judgment or settlement documents, court orders, deed of release or withdrawal documentation</li>
		<li>
copy of all pleadings filed in court</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p><strong>Timeframe in which an application is to be determined</strong></p>

<p>The timeframe in which an application is to be decided by Services Australia is governed by sections 34ZZO and 37B of the Act. Services Australia has 21 days after an application is received to decide and process a claim.</p>

<p>If Services Australia requests further information under section 38 of the Act in relation to an application for AHECS, Services Australia has 21 days from the date the requested information is received to accept or decline the application.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Notifying Services Australia of incorrect or incomplete information</strong></p>

<p>If a certificate is in force and the claimant becomes aware that the information provided on the application is no longer correct or complete, the applicant must notify Services Australia about what information is no longer correct or complete, under section 34ZZP of the Act.</p>

<p>Notification must be in writing and be given to Services Australia within 28 days after the claimant becomes aware the information is no longer correct or complete. Failure to notify is 30 penalty units under section 46 of the Act.</p>

<p>Services Australia may decide that an AHECS indemnity claim is payable in relation to a liability of the practitioner if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a current claim for compensation or damages is, or was, made against the practitioner by another person </li>
		<li>
a qualifying allied health claim certificate is in force in relation to the current claim</li>
		<li>
the liability is a qualifying allied health liability of the practitioner in relation to the current claim under section 34ZZS of the Act</li>
		<li>
the claim liability exceeds the contract of insurance limit, even if the relevant threshold is less than that limit</li>
		<li>
the claim equals or exceeds the relevant threshold identified in the certificate</li>
		<li>
a person has applied for the AHECS in accordance with section 37A of the Act</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p><strong>How AHECS payments are made</strong></p>

<p>The AHECS payment is made to the applicant who applies. This might be different to the person who applied for the certificate.</p>

<p>The person must forward the payment on to whomever an outstanding liability is owed, to discharge the health professional’s liability.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> any unpaid liabilities must be paid by the person or practitioner prior to settling any other liabilities.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>What is covered in the AHECS payment</strong></p>

<p>AHECS payments may include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
damages amounts to the plaintiff</li>
		<li>
legal (defence) costs</li>
		<li>
costs incurred by the insurer in managing an incident to which they are notified, which may or may not go on to become a claim</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p><strong>Amount payable</strong></p>

<p>The amount payable for claims is the excess liability amount above the contract limit.</p>

<p>Only liabilities that exceed the practitioner's contract limit will be covered under the AHECS, even if the relevant threshold is less than that limit.</p>

<p>A termination date has not been set for the AHECS. The Minister may, by regulations, set a future termination date.</p>
