<p>Customers should keep their own record of the hours worked and employment income paid so that their payment is not delayed while waiting for this information from the employer. Customers can keep a record of their hours worked and employment income paid using the <strong>Add and Save</strong> function available online and via the Express Plus Centrelink mobile app.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> family assistance and income support reporting obligations are different. Income support customers must report actual income paid, not just an estimate. Service Officers must discuss income reporting requirements at every opportunity and ensure actual income and income estimates are both updated when required. If either member of a couple is receiving family assistance, their estimate <strong>must</strong> include income support payments received, Paid Parental Leave, employment income and any other components of Adjusted Taxable Income (received or expected) for the financial year for both members of the couple.</p>

<p>Most customers receiving an income support payment with mutual obligation requirements such as JSP or YA as a job seeker, will no longer qualify for payment if they commence <a href="../job-seekers/001-03010010-01.html">full-time ongoing work</a>. These job seekers will be able to <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07020000-01.html">deplete their Working Credits</a> before their payment is cancelled. The customer will not be entitled to an <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010160-01.html">employment income nil rate period</a>.</p>

<p>However, certain job seekers in receipt of JSP or YA who meet sufficient work requirements, where their income is not above the allowance income test cut off limit for the relevant payment, may continue on payment.</p>

<p>The most common examples of full-time workers who might still qualify for JSP without further mutual obligation requirements are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a JSP customer with a pensioner partner, because the income test for these couples results in a cut-out point for JSP which is considerably higher than applies to individuals in couples where both receive a social security benefit such as JSP</li>
		<li>
long-term single JSP customers aged 60 or more who receive Rent Assistance (RA) (the cut-out point for such cases can also exceed full-time minimum wages)</li>
		<li>
JSP single principal carers in full-time work, because the income test for these customers allows them to continue to be entitled to part rate of JSP after all Working Credits have been exhausted</li>

<p>Job seekers who are principal carers, or assessed as having a partial capacity to work, or who are mature age 55+ are able to satisfy their mutual obligation requirements by undertaking sufficient work of 15 hours per week.</p>

<p>Job seekers assessed as having a partial capacity to work will have their work capacity reviewed by an Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) if they work more than 60 hours per fortnight over a period of 3 consecutive fortnights.</p>

<p>Job seekers aged 55 to 59 <strong>who are within the first 12 months of receipt of their current income support payment</strong> (including suspension periods of up to 3 months), have a <strong>minimum requirement</strong> of 15 hours per fortnight of paid work or self-employment, as part of their combination of approved voluntary work and paid work.</p>

<p>After receiving their current income support payment for a 12 month period or upon turning 60 years old, these job seekers may fully satisfy their requirements by undertaking 30 hours or more per fortnight of any combination of approved unpaid voluntary work and paid work/self-employment, including solely through approved unpaid voluntary work.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> job seekers aged 55 years or over must remain connected with a Workforce Australia provider and must attend any notified appointments.</p>

<p>If aged 60+ a job seeker may choose to undertake voluntary work or a combination of voluntary work and paid work or self-employment of at least 30 hours per fortnight with employment income, or net business income, at the <a href="../job-seekers/001-02010100-01.html">national minimum wage</a> or above.</p>
