<p>Where a customer or carer unexpectedly and temporarily provides 100% care of a child, the Registrar may recognise that the person has 100% care. This is the case even though they are not expected to continue to have that level of care. </p>

<p>In these situations, the Registrar will&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
determine the care over a short care period related to the unexpected circumstance, and </li>
		<li>
make a <strong>one-off block of 100% care</strong> determination</li>
		</ul>
<p>The Registrar will not review the care again once a one-off block of 100% care determination is made. However, when the care arrangements return to the usual pattern or a new pattern is established, either carer may request a new care percentage determination.</p>

<p>The period of unexpected care will generally be at least 4 weeks in length in order for the Registrar to make such a determination. However shorter periods can be considered, especially where there is a possibility the period may be extended. For more information, <a href="../separated-parents/277-03040030-04.html#bp04_L2GT_Policy">References</a> has a link to the Child Support Guide 2.2.2 Care Determination and Changes in Care. </p>

<p>To record a one-off block of 100% care determination in Cuba&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
add a new care record</li>
		<li>
select the care type 'Actual' and care percentage of 100% to the person who has unexpectedly gained 100% care</li>

ensure the '<strong>Block of 100% Care</strong>' indicator is selected. For more information see <a href="../separated-parents/277-30010060-03.html#bp03000000_Process">Care Cuba Process Help</a> - Add a new care record</li>		</ul>

<p>A written care arrangement is a court order, parenting plan or written agreement that outlines a pattern of care for a child and may include a percentage of care. For more information, <a href="../separated-parents/277-03040030-04.html#bp04_L2GT_Policy">References</a> has a link to the Child Support Guide 2.2.1 Basics of care&#58; Agreements and orders regarding care.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a customer/s advises that they have a written care arrangement but do not provide a copy of the arrangement. Make a decision (to reject or accept). Calculate the care percentage based on the care that is actually occurring, <a href="../separated-parents/277-03040030-03.html#bp03_tbl_Calculate_and_d_Step05">go to Step 5</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Interpretation and implementation guidance </strong></p>

<p>If required, seek help from a Service Support Officer (SSO), see <a href="../separated-parents/277-09140000-01.html">Technical support in Child Support</a>.</p>

<p><strong>International customers</strong></p>

<p>International customers may submit a court order concerning care that was made outside Australia. Only treat and document the court order as a care arrangement if it is registered under section 70G of the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth), see <a href="../separated-parents/277-01030000-01.html">Documenting Child Support information</a>. </p>

<p>Only use information within the court order to determine a care percentage if the parents are complying with the order. Request a copy of the care arrangement documents, scan and record this in the Care window notepad, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-01070000-01.html">Correspondence received in Child Support</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Written care arrangement is being complied with</strong></p>

<p>If the customers are complying with the provisions of the written care arrangement, make a care determination and record the care type as court order, parenting plan or written agreement in Cuba, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-03040030-03.html#bp03_tbl_Check_and_proce_Step01">Step 1 in Table 2</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Written care arrangement is not being complied with</strong></p>

<p>If the customers are not complying with the provisions of the written care arrangement and&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
both customers agree to an alternate actual care situation - make an 'Actual' care determination in Cuba and record the details of the care arrangement in a Care window notepad, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-03040030-03.html#bp03_tbl_Check_and_proce_Step01">Step 1 in Table 2</a>, or</li>

<p>Consider the following, if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a care change is loaded <strong>in error</strong> or the customer incorrectly advises that a change has occurred, for example customer incorrectly pended care via CSAonline or the change is for a future date, <strong>delete</strong> the pended care record.<br>To ensure care data transfers to Centrelink correctly the care record that is to be applied must be accepted prior to deleting pended care records. Document the reason for deleting the record To delete a care record, follow the process in <a href="../separated-parents/277-30010060-03.html#bp03110000_Process">Care Cuba Process Help</a> </li>
		<li>
a change in care is <strong>incorrectly loaded</strong> as a new change in care, instead of an objection to a previous care decision, <strong>delete</strong> the pended care record</li>
		<li>
a customer indicates they no longer wish to pursue a change in care, but believes a change did occur, a decision <strong>must</strong> still be made. A customer cannot elect to withdraw notification of a change in care as it is a notification, not an application. Where the notifying customer withdraws their participation in the process, make a decision based on the information available. If insufficient evidence is available it would be appropriate to <strong>reject</strong> the change, not to <strong> delete </strong>it</li>
		</ul>
<p>Whenever a decision is being made to <strong>reject, refuse</strong> or <strong>accept</strong> a care change notification, letters are issued and customers have the right to object</p>

<p><strong>Objection rights</strong></p>

<p>When Child Support or Centrelink have made a care decision, an objection to that decision may be lodged by phone or in writing.

		<li>
Restart/add a new registration to a reverse case, or</li>
		<li>
Restart/add a new registration to an existing assessment </li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p>Create or restart a case or add a new registration if the customer indicated they want the child to be assessed. They may have advised during the change of care notification or subsequently. </p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Check all</strong> notepads associated with the care change and recently added to the case.</p>

<p>If a customer has asked to reapply for an assessment, the assessment will restart from the date they answered the question. </p>

<p></p>

<p>As the child support assessment will be active until eligibility is run following the acceptance of the care change, the child support assessment can be restarted by the owning officer without the need for a referral to New Customers.</p>

<p>Follow the <a href="../separated-parents/277-03020010-01.html">process for creating a reverse</a> case with the following exceptions&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
Assessment will begin on the day the application was made</li>
		<li>
Customers must be contacted to identify what collection method</li>
		<li>
Child Support periods will not be aligned</li>
		<li>
Formula departures. Most formula departures, for example change of assessment, agreement, court order, will not survive a terminating event. The only exceptions are a non-periodic payments clause in an agreement that does not affect the annual rate, and lump sum crediting provisions in a binding agreement. These will not apply again until the payee named in the agreement again becomes an eligible carer</li>
		<li>
Estimates. If there was an estimate of income in place for either customer before the terminating event, contact the estimating customer to discuss their income. If the estimate&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
was in place prior to the terminating event and the case is restarted within the same financial year and the customer does not revoke the estimate, the estimate will be used as that customer’s income in the restarted assessment</li>
			<li>
election was made during a period when the case had ended, after the change in care occurred, ask the customer if they would like to lodge a new estimate election</li>			</ul>			</ul>

Determine appropriate referral options, see <a target="_blank" href="../utils/CustomerReferralGuidelines/Customer-Referral-Guidelines.html">Customer referral guidelines for Child Support staff</a>, for the customer including&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a referral to an external service provider</li>
		<li>
a referral to another section within Child Support</li>
		<li>
a transfer to Centrelink</li>
		<li>
a referral to the Complaints process</li>
		<li>
lodgement of an objection on a care decision or application for a Centrelink review</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer contacts Child Support about the change in care letters they received advising the care percentage on their assessment is not in line with the care decision. This may indicate a keying error has occurred. Seek technical support about whether an error has occurred that needs correcting, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-09030000-01.html">Correcting errors on Child Support cases</a>.</p>

<p>If a customer wants to pursue an objection or apply for a review of the care decision, they can do so by notifying Child Support or by notifying Centrelink where 1 or more carers receive family assistance. This applies to all customers including non-mutual customers.</p>

<p>Objections to care decisions may be lodged either verbally or in writing.</p>

<p>Check whether the decision was made by <a href="../separated-parents/277-03040030-03.html#bp03_tbl_Review_informat_Step04">Child Support</a>, <a href="../separated-parents/277-03040030-03.html#bp03_tbl_Review_informat_Step05">Centrelink</a> or the Integrated Care Team.</p>

<p>Transfer customers requesting an objection or review of a decision made by Integrated Care to the Integrated Care Team. The Integrated Care Team will discuss the decision with the customer to decide which program to lodge their objection or review with.</p>

additional information on the same date of the original decision that will change the outcome.

<p>Any Child Support customer (mutual or non-mutual) impacted by a Centrelink care decision can&#58;</p>

lodge an objection</li>

initiate a Centrelink review, or</li>

<p>Tell the customer the program who made the care decision is generally best placed to review it. </p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>A non-mutual customer may not understand the relationship between Child Support and Centrelink. Explain this so they can understand why they can speak with Centrelink about care. A non-mutual customer can seek a review with Centrelink.</p>

<p>If the customer asks why the care percentages recorded in the Centrelink decision and Centrelink assessment are different, transfer the customer to Centrelink to determine why this has occurred. It may be a keying error.</p>
