<p>Mutual obligation requirements are referred to as Activity Test and Participation Requirements under social security law. This means that these terms are used in different places in similar ways.</p>

<p>People receiving income support payments with mutual obligation requirements must show they are actively looking for work and participating in a range of activities that will help them into employment, unless Services Australia has granted the job seeker a temporary exemption from these requirements.</p>

<p>Job seekers on the following income support payments have mutual obligation requirements&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
JobSeeker Payment (JSP)</li>
		<li>
Youth Allowance (YA) (job seeker)</li>
		<li>
Parenting Payment (PP) for a single customer (when their youngest child turns 6)</li>

<p>Mutual obligation requirements include a range of requirements a job seeker can be compelled to fulfil under social security law in return for ongoing income support. These include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
attending Employment Services Provider appointments</li>
		<li>
attending Services Australia appointments</li>
		<li>
undertaking job search or meeting a monthly points target</li>
		<li>
acting on referrals to jobs</li>
		<li>
undertaking an Annual Activity Requirement, and</li>
		<li>
participating in an activity that fully meets their mutual obligation requirements</li>
		</ul>
<p>A job seeker's mutual obligation requirements are generally determined by&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
their age</li>
		<li>
their assessed work capacity, and</li>
		<li>
whether they have primary responsibility for the care of a child</li>
		</ul>
<p>Job seekers have either full-time or part-time mutual obligation requirements.</p>

<p>Job seekers with <strong>full-time</strong> mutual obligation requirements should be&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
looking for work on a full-time basis, and</li>
		<li>
actively addressing any circumstances that may affect their capacity to undertake paid work</li>
		</ul>
<p>The following job seekers have <strong>part-time</strong> mutual obligation requirements&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Principal carer parents, once the youngest child in their care turns six years of age</li>
		<li>
Job seekers with a partial capacity to work (PCW) of 15 to 29 hours per week</li>
		<li>
Mature age job seekers, 55 years and over</li>
		</ul>
<p>The extent and combination of activities that the job seeker is to undertake will vary depending on the job seeker's cohort. In general, the <strong>Job Plan</strong> should have a requirement for the job seeker to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
attend appointments with Services Australia or their Employment Services Provider</li>
		<li>
undertake an approved activity that fully meets their requirements</li>
		<li>
act on referrals to jobs and attend job interviews offered by employers</li>
		<li>
undertake job search or meet a monthly points target</li>
		<li>
undertake activities to meet their <a href="../job-seekers/001-09070200-01.html">Annual Activity Requirement</a>. This includes Work for the Dole (WFD) or another approved activity for six months each year while they receive an income support payment. In most cases, WFD is the principal activity used to satisfy the Annual Activity Requirement</li>
		</ul>
<p>With the exception of Special Benefit (SpB) job seekers paid under the SpB Activity Test, Centrelink managed job seekers fully meet requirements by participating in approved activities and do not have job search requirements.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
the level of job search activity, or</li>
		<li>
points based activity targets</li>
		</ul>
<p>Employment Services Providers must&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
specify the number of job searches or points based activity targets a job seeker is required to undertake per month, and</li>
		<li>
include this in the job seeker's Job Plan</li>
		</ul>
<p>A Job Plan cannot contain both job search and points based targets.</p>

<p>The number of job searches for job seekers, including principal carer parents and those with a partial capacity to work (PCW) of15 to 29 hours per week, is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
for Stream A and Stream B job seekers - a maximum of 20 job searches per month</li>
		<li>
for Stream C job seekers - job search depends on capacity</li>
		<li>
for job seekers aged 60 years and over (regardless of Stream) - job search depends on capacity</li>
		</ul>
<p>Job seekers cannot be required to undertake more than 20 job search per month.</p>

<p>There are some circumstances where the number of job searches may be reduced by the provider. Service Officers have no authority to reduce the number of job searches specified in the Job Plan unless specifically requested by the provider.</p>

<p>Job seekers must continue job search during their Annual Activity Requirement period, but this may be reduced if the job seeker is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
undertaking paid work, or</li>
		<li>
participating in Skills for Education and Employment, Adult Migrant English Program or another accredited course</li>
		</ul>
<p>Providers will work with job seekers to decide the activities they use to meet the points based target.</p>

<p>Any job seeker whose income support payment is reduced to nil because of employment income (their own or partner's) does not have mutual obligation requirements during the nil rate period.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>From 7 December 2020, all job seekers granted a participation payment in an NESM region have a PBAS target in their job plan. Existing job seekers in the NESM regions can choose to join the trial. Job seekers wanting to join must speak to their provider.</p>

<p>Job seekers participating in the PBAS trial must accumulate a points target each month. This is instead of reporting a set number of job searches each month. A job seeker's points target is based on their personal circumstances, and displays in their dashboard.</p>

<p>Job seekers can accumulate points by completing a variety of job search-related activities, and recording them in their jobactive account&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
applying for a job</li>
		<li>
updating their career profile</li>
		<li>
going for a job interview</li>
		<li>
accepting a job offer, or</li>
		<li>
doing paid work</li>
		</ul>
<p>The points value for each activity is displayed in the job seeker's dashboard. Job seekers can choose which activities they will undertake to meet their target. This gives job seekers greater flexibility in meeting their requirements.</p>

<p>If a job seeker exceeds the number of points they need, they can carry over that excess into the next reporting period (up to 50 per cent of their target). This will reduce the number of points they must get next month.</p>

<p>PBAS replaces the job search requirement in a job plan. All other mutual obligation requirements remain unchanged, for example attendance at appointments, activities, etc. Certain other activities may reduce the number of points required.</p>

<p>It is the provider's responsibility to set the monthly points target and to manage any disputes with the job seeker about&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
whether the target is appropriate</li>
		<li>
whether the job seeker has a valid reason for not meeting a monthly points target</li>
		</ul>
<p>Advise the job seeker to discuss matter with their provider if they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
disagree with their points target, or</li>
		<li>
dispute the number of points accumulated</li>

<p>The following activities are mandatory for all participants&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
attendance at court on a weekly, fortnightly or monthly basis</li>
		<li>
regular attendance at counselling sessions organised by the Department of Health and the Probation and Parole Service (P and PS)</li>
