<p><strong>From 1 October 2022</strong></p>

<p>Education Tax Refund (ETR) payments are no longer payable to customers. The ETR Payments determination is no longer in force and therefore assessments and reassessments are not supported by legislation. This means debts should not be raised and payments should not be made to customers.</p>

<p></p>

<p class="info-box warning">To be completed by Families Program Management team only</p>

<p>Occasionally a Manual Follow-Up (MFU) will be created on customer records. These <strong>must not be completed</strong> by Service Officers. These MFUs are monitored and actioned by the Families Program Management team, to ensure payment is not issued to the customer. They will have the key words FTBETR or ISPETP.</p>

<p>If a Service Officer incorrectly processes these MFUs they will receive staff feedback.</p>

<p><strong>Prior to 1 October 2022</strong></p>

<p>The ETR statutory payment was paid automatically to eligible parents/guardians receiving Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A or students receiving an income support payment.</p>

<p>A person was eligible for the ETR Statutory payment if they were receiving one of the following payments on <strong>8 May 2012</strong>&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>FTB Part A</strong> for school aged children in the following age groups</li>

<p>Individuals receiving a qualifying payment on 8 May 2012 were paid during the period 20-29 June 2012. This included customers whose FTB Part A legislative rate was greater than nil.</p>

<p>Claimants who had one of the above qualifying payments granted retrospectively for a period that included 8 May 2012 were paid the ETR Statutory payment (if eligible) when their claim was granted.</p>

<p>Eligible customers were paid an ETR Statutory payment of&#58;</p>

<p>ETR payments are non-taxable and are not assessed as income for family assistance and income support entitlement.</p>

<p>ETR Statutory payments were subject to income management.</p>

<p>Payments were made into the same bank account the customer's regular payments. If they had a payment nominee, the payment was paid into the payment nominee's account.</p>
