<P>The job seeker must provide verification of their educational qualification. This may include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>a Year 12 or an equivalent level of education (Certificate III or higher) qualification certificate issued by a Senior Secondary Board of Studies or an 'equivalent qualification' such as:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>an Australian Qualification Framework Certificate III</LI>
<LI>a higher qualification issued by a Registered Training Organisation or higher educational institution</LI>
<LI>a Certificate III or IV of General Education for Adults</LI>
<LI>the International Baccalaureate, or</LI>
<LI>other higher education pre-entry course</LI></UL>
<LI>letter from the school or institution</LI>
<LI>other evidence (for example, Details on the job seekers record which indicate they have completed Year 12 or an equivalent level of education (Certificate III or higher) qualification</LI>
<LI>where no other evidence is available, a statutory declaration detailing the name of the course, date completed, institution and contact details</LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> a statement of attainment is generally not accepted as sufficient evidence. A statement of attainment does not confirm the job seeker successfully completed a course, it only confirms that they have completed certain units from part of that course.</P>
<P>Completion of Year 12 or an equivalent level of education (Certificate III or higher) qualification may not require the job seeker to have sat Year 12 or an equivalent level of education (Certificate III or higher) qualification exams. A Victorian Certificate of Education, for example, can be awarded where the student has submitted School-based Assessments for satisfactory completion of units but have not been assessed for levels of achievement in the study and have not sat examinations. The job seeker still needs to provide proof of the completion of Year 12 or an equivalent level of education (Certificate III or higher) qualification (that is, VCE certificate).</P>
<P>If verification is not available or unable to be obtained, then a determination can be made based on the weight of evidence as to whether it appears the job seeker has attained the required level of educational qualifications. An example of other evidence is where the Service Officer can see the job seeker has undertaken this level of study as information has been recorded previously on one of the following screens:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Education Course History (<STRONG>EDCH</STRONG>) screen</LI>
<LI>Education Course Details (<STRONG>EDC</STRONG>) screen</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Short Course Details</STRONG> screen</LI></UL>
