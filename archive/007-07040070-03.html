<P>First check that a change of care assessment is appropriate.</P>
<P>Where a change of care has occurred, yet care details (such as start date) have not been provided within the claim, an outbound call attempt should be made to the gaining carer to obtain missing care information.</P>
<P>Where the other carer does not have a current record and/or documentation provided does not include the other carer’s current contact details, request their name, address and telephone number from the notifying carer. <STRONG>Do not</STRONG> provide any details to the notifying carer.</P>
<P>If unsuccessful, issue a Q777 - Request for documents to be provided by the customer and FA012 - Details of the customer's child's care arrangements to the claimant requesting care information. Where the customer does not respond, see <A href="../families/007-07030140-01.html">Not effective claims or withdrawal of claim for Family Tax Benefit or Stillborn Baby Payment</A>.

<P>If a customer wants to apply for a formal review of the care decision affecting their income support payment, a separate formal review should be registered.</P>
<P>Customers may continue to receive payments for a child who is out of their care temporarily for a short period. See <A href="../ongoing-contact/102-05050020-01.html">Child leaves customer's care/ custody</A>.</P>

<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> when determining if a change of care has occurred (including where all parties agree to the change of care), consider whether further information is needed to determine if the change is a change of care or delegated care.

<P>It is <STRONG>mandatory</STRONG> to attempt to contact the losing carer by phone initially, in most cases. <STRONG>Exceptions</STRONG> to this are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>If a change of care has occurred as a result of a <STRONG>child being removed from their parents care by a state welfare authority</STRONG> there may be sensitivities involved and staff should exercise their judgement on a case by case basis to determine whether it is appropriate to make contact. Evidence for change of care supplied by the gaining carer can be used to confirm the change of care. However, the delegate must be satisfied based on the available evidence that a change of care has occurred</LI>
<LI>If a change of care has occurred as a result of a <STRONG>family and domestic violence</STRONG> situation and there is concern that the customer or children will be placed at risk if the losing carer is contacted, evidence for change of care supplied by the gaining carer can be used to confirm the change of care. However, the delegate must be satisfied based on the available evidence that a change of care has occurred. The <A href="../families/007-07040070-05.html">Resources</A> page has an example</LI>
<LI>If a change of care has occurred because of the <STRONG>death of the losing carer</STRONG>, evidence supplied by the gaining carer can be used to confirm the change of care. However, the delegate must be satisfied based on the available evidence a change of care has occurred. <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> if the death has been confirmed, complete updates on the deceased customer’s record before running the <STRONG>Notification of Death</STRONG> guided procedure. See <A href="../families/007-04050000-01.html" target=_blank>Death of a family assistance or Paid Parental Leave scheme customer</A></LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> where FDV concerns are identified, the FDV RIR model must be followed and consideration be given to the involvement of a <STRONG>social worker</STRONG> where a child may be at risk of harm or where a customer's circumstances indicate vulnerability or risk to the customer's safety: See <A href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-12010000-01.html">Social work service referral</A>. </P>
