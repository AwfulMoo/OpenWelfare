<p>Some customers who are considering claiming DSP may not be eligible. They may need to be encouraged to claim JobSeeker Payment (JSP).</p>

<p>Customers claiming JSP may indicate they have an injury or illness that limits their work capacity. This may be permanent or temporary. These customers are assessed through the Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) process. The ESAt can be upgraded to a Job Capacity Assessment (JCA) if the medical evidence shows they are likely to be eligible for DSP. They can be invited to claim DSP once the upgraded JCA is submitted.</p>

<p>To be eligible for DSP, unless manifestly eligible, a customer must first show through medical evidence that they have at least 1 condition that can be assessed as fully <strong>diagnosed</strong>, <strong>treated</strong> and <strong>stabilised</strong>.</p>

<p>For a condition to be assessed as fully <strong>diagnosed</strong> and <strong>treated</strong>, the following are considered&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
if the condition was examined by an appropriately qualified medical practitioner</li>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>To be eligible for DSP, unless manifestly eligible, a customer’s permanent, fully diagnosed, treated and stabilised condition must be assigned an impairment rating of at least 20 points on the Impairment Tables.</p>

<p>There are 15 function-based Impairment Tables. They focus on assessing the impact of impairment on normal functions as they relate to work performance and with a rating assigned consistent with the identified level of impact.</p>

<p>The permanent, fully diagnosed, treated and stabilised condition is assessed against the relevant Impairment Table to determine the functional impact, with a rating assigned accordingly. For example, a permanent, fully diagnosed, treated and stabilised mental health condition would be assessed under Table 5 - Mental Health Function.</p>

<p>In all Tables, each level of functional impact has a corresponding points rating. This generic scale is as follows&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
no functional impact - 0 points</li>
		<li>
mild functional impact - 5 points</li>
		<li>
moderate functional impact - 10 points</li>
		<li>
severe functional impact - 20 points</li>
		<li>
extreme functional impact - 30 points</li>
		</ul>
<p>These conditions cannot be rated using the Impairment Tables&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
temporary conditions</li>
		<li>
permanent conditions that are not fully diagnosed, treated and stabilised</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where an assessment of impairment is required for a permanent, fully diagnosed, treated and stabilised condition, the customer will be referred for a Job Capacity Assessment</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The determination of impairment ratings and CITW are separate assessments based on different criteria. They are <strong>of equal importance</strong> when assessing eligibility for DSP.</p>

<p>The assessment of CITW is part of the process to determine if the customer is medically eligible for DSP.</p>

<p>A customer has a CITW if their impairment alone prevents them from undertaking <strong>both</strong> of the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
any work for 15 or more hours per week for at least the relevant minimum wage for at least 2 years</li>
		<li>
educational, pre-vocational, vocational, or work related training (including on-the-job training) is unlikely to enable them to do any work for 15 or more hours per week for at least the relevant minimum wage, within 2 years independently of a program of support</li>
		</ul>
<p>A customer claiming DSP after 3 September 2011 who is not manifestly eligible or does not have a severe impairment must <strong>also</strong> show they have actively participated in a <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03090010-01.html">Program of Support (POS)</a>.</p>

<p>While customers no longer need to provide specific forms completed by their treating health professional(s) detailing the impact of their medical condition(s), they must supply <strong>current evidence</strong> with their claim. If they do not provide evidence their claim may be rejected.</p>

<p>The Disability Support Pension Medical Evidence Checklist for treating health professionals (SA478) form helps treating health professionals provide relevant medical evidence to support the customer's claim for DSP or medical review. The form provides relevant information about medical eligibility and the assessment process.</p>

<p>The report can be used to assess eligibility for DSP if the customer then claims. In these cases, an extra JCA is not needed as part of the DSP claim process if the JCA report is still a current and valid assessment of the customer's work capacity.
