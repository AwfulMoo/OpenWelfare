<p>This document outlines the procedure for suitably skilled Service Officers to determine a job seeker's or ParentsNext participant's eligibility for an exemption from compulsory mutual obligation or participation requirements based on a temporary incapacity for work.</p>

<p></p>
<div class="twisty">
	
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Key_principles"></a>
<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Key_principles">Key principles</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Job seekers or ParentsNext participants (customers) claiming or receiving a participation payment may request a temporary incapacity exemption from mutual obligation or participation requirements by submitting a valid medical certificate to Services Australia.</p>

<p>Service Officers are required to assess all certificates lodged to determine if a temporary incapacity exemption can be granted. Each exemption application must be assessed based on the circumstances. The following must be considered in making a decision&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Where the certificate is valid and the medical practitioner states the customer is temporarily unable to work at least 8 hours per week due to a temporary condition or temporary exacerbation of a permanent condition then, generally, this evidence should be accepted and an exemption granted</li>
		<li>
Staff should not unreasonably refuse a temporary incapacity exemption request, taking into account the evidence and expert opinion of the treating medical practitioner</li>
		<li>
An exemption should not be refused just because a customer's condition is permanent, where all available current evidence shows that the customer is clearly temporarily incapacitated for all work</li>
		<li>
Where the agency has allowed customers to access periods of exemption by accepting previous certificates, staff must carefully consider and weigh up any decision not to grant further periods of exemption. This may require consultation with senior staff</li>
		<li>
Every new medical certificate lodged must be individually assessed to determine if a temporary incapacity exemption can be granted, including where the new certificate contains very similar information to one previously lodged</li>
		<li>
A separate decision must be made for each new medical certificate lodged, including where periods of incapacity overlap, or if a new certificate is lodged shortly after an exemption was not granted for a previous certificate</li>
		<li>
Each suitably skilled Service Officer is responsible for the decision to grant or deny a customer's request for exemption, even where a previous decision has already been made for an earlier certificate</li>
		<li>
Customers must be contacted by phone to explain the assessment outcome, if it is completed without the customer present. See <a href="../job-seekers/001-09120010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Medical_certifi_Step07">Process</a> page</li>
		<li>
Where a customer continues to seek incapacity exemptions for extended periods (for example, 18 months continuously), whether for the same or different condition, an Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) referral must be considered to allow an assessment by the agency's health and allied health professional assessors</li>
		<li>
Customers with an ongoing reduced work capacity due to the impacts of a permanent condition, may benefit from an ESAt referral, where they have some capacity for work, or the incapacity is unlikely to be temporary. This will assess if they have a partial capacity to work with reduced mutual obligation requirements, and connection to suitable employment services. This may avoid the need for the customer to lodge repeated medical certificates for the same condition(s)</li>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Certificates are only valid when completed and signed by a registered medical practitioner and include, at least, the following information&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
diagnosis (name or description of condition)</li>
		<li>
prognosis (how long the symptoms are expected to affect the capacity to work). This may be a specified timeframe, or '<strong>Uncertain</strong>'</li>
		<li>
the period the customer is incapacitated for work</li>
		<li>
whether the customer is incapacitated for all work of at least 8 hours per week</li>
		</ul>
<p>Customers and medical practitioners should be encouraged to use the current version of the Centrelink Medical Certificate (SU415) form or the online SU683 form. The medical practitioner's signature is not required if an online SU683 certificate has been lodged. A previous version of the Centrelink Medical Certificate or a non-Centrelink medical certificate is also valid if it contains the required information noted above.</p>

<p>The medical practitioner is not required to provide opinion about a customer's capacity to participate in a suitable activity, but may choose to include this information when completing a medical certificate.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> invalid certificates should not be used to grant a temporary incapacity exemption, and the customer must be advised of the decision reason and outcome.</p>

<p>Certificates lodged at a service centre must be processed as a walk-in on the same day to ensure the customer is aware of the outcome and any changes made to their mutual obligation or participation requirements.

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The maximum temporary exemption period for a single certificate is the lesser of&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the period of incapacity for work stated by the medical practitioner on the certificate, or</li>
		<li>
13 weeks from the start of the incapacity period on the certificate, or</li>
		<li>
12 months for customers who are undergoing or recovering from intensive medical treatment for a serious illness</li>
		</ul>
<p>An exemption can be granted for up to a maximum of 13 weeks if the certificate clearly shows the customer is temporarily incapacitated for all work of at least 8 hours per week because of a medical condition. This generally means the incapacity for work is expected to resolve within the next 2 years. This assessment should take into account all relevant factors, including the period of incapacity for work, the prognosis period (for example, if symptoms will clearly affect the customer's work capacity for less than 24 months), and whether the condition is temporary or permanent.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
For example, an exemption can be granted if the certificate shows the customer's symptoms and incapacity for work are expected to last less than 13 weeks, including where the condition is permanent. For more information, see <a href="../job-seekers/001-09120010-01.html#bp01_L2GT_">Assessing permanent conditions and prognosis</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>An exemption may be granted for longer than 13 weeks (based on a single medical certificate) for customers who are undergoing or recovering from intensive medical treatment for a serious illness. Customers who meet the serious illness exemption eligibility criteria may be granted an initial exemption period of up to 12 months if covered by a medical certificate. A serious illness exemption can be extended up to a further 6 months based on a further medical certificate. See <a href="../job-seekers/001-09120080-01.html">Exempting a job seeker from mutual obligation requirements for serious illness</a> for further information.</p>

<p>For each new medical certificate lodged, a further period of exemption must be assessed and a decision reached on whether to grant or deny any further exemption period. Customers can apply for a further temporary incapacity exemption if they are still temporarily incapacitated for all work and suitable activities at the end of their current exemption.</p>

<p>To assess a further period of exemption for a customer lodging a <strong>subsequent</strong> medical certificate, see <a href="../job-seekers/001-09121000-01.html">Expiry and renewal of medical certificates for payments with mutual obligation requirements</a>.</p>

<p>Lodgement of a certificate does not always mean an exemption should be granted. Reasons for not granting an exemption include where&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the certificate is invalid because there insufficient information to assess if an exemption can be granted</li>
		<li>
the customer is clearly able to work at least 8 hours per week</li>
		<li>
the customer's incapacity for all work is clearly not temporary (expected to last for more than 2 years) - for example, the condition is permanent, and symptoms are expected to significantly affect the customer's capacity for work for more than 24 months</li>
		<li>
the temporary incapacity for work is the result of drug or alcohol dependency or misuse, or</li>
		<li>
the customer clearly has capacity to participate in a suitable activity, such as job search with an employment services provider</li>
		</ul>
<p>A decision not to grant an exemption must be based on current evidence. The certificate from the medical practitioner is generally the primary evidence for the decision.</p>

<p>If an exemption is not granted and the customer subsequently submits a new certificate&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a separate decision must be made to grant/not grant a temporary incapacity exemption for the new certificate, with the decision outcome clearly documented on the customer record</li>
		<li>
the new certificate may also be considered along with other available evidence if the customer asks for a temporary incapacity exemption decision to be explained, or requests a formal review of the decision</li>

		<div class="block">

<p>Customers who are temporarily unable to work may still be able to undertake a suitable activity to help them prepare for a job, such as activities to develop job search skills. In this case, the customer may not be eligible for a temporary incapacity exemption. A decision not to grant an exemption for this reason must always be supported by current medical evidence from the medical practitioner, which clearly shows the customer can undertake a suitable activity, such as participation in job search activities.</p>

<p>Medical practitioners may provide information about a customer's <strong>capacity to participate in a suitable activity</strong>, in response to the question 'In order to prepare your patient for return to work or study, certain assistance may be offered. Identify any factors which may impact on participation.' This is not a compulsory question and service officers do not need to contact the medical practitioner to ask for, or clarify this information. If provided, this information may be relevant to assessing an exemption, where it clearly shows that the customer can undertake a suitable activity such as job search with an employment services provider.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Key_messages_fo">Assessing a request for a temporary incapacity exemption</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A valid medical certificate is the primary evidence used to assess if a temporary incapacity exemption can be granted. To make this assessment, Service Officers must consider relevant information on the certificate, including&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Diagnosis - the nature of the condition</li>
		<li>
Date of onset - when the condition started</li>
		<li>
Whether the condition is temporary or permanent (including an exacerbation of a permanent condition)</li>
		<li>
Prognosis - how long symptoms are expected to affect the customer's work capacity</li>
		<li>
Whether the customer can work at least 8 hours per week</li>
		<li>
The period of any incapacity for work</li>
		</ul>
<p>This information should generally be sufficient to assess if a temporary incapacity exemption can be granted.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1&#58;</strong> The certificate states that the customer's primary condition is severe influenza, which started a week ago; the condition is temporary; the incapacity is expected to last less than 3 months, and the customer can't work at least 8 hours per week. This information is sufficient to grant an exemption.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2&#58;</strong> The medical practitioner who completed the certificate states that the customer <strong>can</strong> work at least 8 hours per week. This information is sufficient to determine that an exemption can't be granted. However, the customer may also need an Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) referral to assess if they have a partial capacity to work or a temporary reduced work capacity.</p>

<p>The Centrelink Medical Certificate also requests information about the customer's capacity to <strong>study</strong>. This information is used to assess if a <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-07020130-01.html">Youth Allowance (YA) student or Australian Apprentice is incapacitated</a> for full-time study. It is not used to assess if a job seeker is temporarily incapacitated for all work.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Assessing_perma">Assessing permanent conditions and prognosis</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>It is important to consider the nature of the condition, including whether it is assessed as permanent or temporary. This factor should be weighed against other information on the certificate, including how long the condition is expected to significantly affect the customer's work capacity. A temporary incapacity exemption may be granted where a condition is assessed as 'permanent', but all the evidence shows that the resulting incapacity for all work is still expected to be temporary (less than 2 years). This assessment should take into account the medical practitioner's opinion about prognosis of the customer's primary condition, and how long they are expected to be unfit for work.</p>

<p><strong>Example&#58;</strong> The certificate states that a customer is unable to work due to depression. The date of onset was 12 months ago, and the condition is listed as permanent (likely to last more than 2 years). This is the first certificate lodged by the customer since they started receiving JobSeeker Payment, the symptoms are expected to affect their capacity to work for less than 12 months, and the period of incapacity on the medical certificate is 12 weeks. All of the medical evidence shows that this is a temporary exacerbation of a permanent condition, and the resulting incapacity for work is expected to be temporary. In this case, a temporary incapacity exemption can be granted.</p>

<p><strong>Example&#58;</strong> The certificate indicates a recent diagnosis of a condition considered to be permanent in nature but that treatment has recently commenced and is likely to improve the condition over time. The medical evidence indicates the customer has no capacity for work for the next 12 weeks. In this case, a temporary incapacity exemption can be granted.</p>

<p>Service Officers should not&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
reject an exemption request just because a condition is listed as 'permanent', without considering all other available medical evidence including the prognosis, and any recent history of exemptions for the same condition(s)</li>
		<li>
ask customers to go back their medical practitioner to change the assessment of a condition listed on a medical certificate (for example, from 'permanent' to 'exacerbation of a permanent condition'), where the certificate otherwise provides sufficient information to make an exemption decision</li>
		</ul>
<p>The prognosis of the primary condition is important when determining if a customer's incapacity for work is temporary. This information must always be considered alongside the other information on the certificate.</p>

<p><strong>Example&#58;</strong> The medical practitioner indicates a mental health condition is 'permanent', but the prognosis is 'uncertain' because it is difficult to predict how long the symptoms will persist. This should not be taken as an indication that the incapacity for work (arising from the condition) is permanent. A temporary incapacity exemption may be granted if the customer meets all criteria for a temporary incapacity exemption.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>In addition to a medical certificate, service officers may also need to take into account other available medical evidence. This includes circumstances where a customer's eligibility for an exemption is less clear, such as where&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer's primary medical conditions (with greatest impact on work capacity) are permanent</li>
		<li>
the customer has been, or is expected to be incapacitated for work for more than two years</li>
		<li>
other evidence shows that the customer may have some capacity for work</li>
		</ul>
<p>Other relevant evidence may include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer's history of certificate submission, including any cumulative, extended period of incapacity exemptions which may indicate their incapacity for work is no longer temporary</li>
		<li>
any current and valid assessment of the job seeker's work capacity in Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) or Job Capacity Assessment (JCA) reports. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> ESAts and JCAs are not relevant for ParentsNext participants</li>
		<li>
the customer's reported earnings from employment, particularly where they are currently working 8 hours per week or more in open employment for multiple consecutive entitlement periods</li>
		<li>
evidence the temporary incapacity may have been primarily caused by, or be attributable to, the customer's drug or alcohol dependency or misuse - this may indicate an exemption can't be granted</li>
		</ul>
<p>Although a current and valid ESAt or JCA may provide additional information to support an exemption decision including assessments of temporary reduced work capacity, customers applying for a temporary incapacity exemption always need to provide a valid medical certificate. A temporary incapacity exemption cannot be granted based solely on an ESAt or JCA report, without a valid medical certificate.</p>

<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_How_other_evide"></a>
<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_How_other_evide">How other evidence is considered</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>While the primary evidence is the medical certificate completed by the medical practitioner, other available information may also be used to consider if an exemption should be granted. This includes circumstances where the customer's incapacity for work may not be temporary, or they may have some capacity to work.</p>

<p>A decision not to grant a temporary incapacity exemption based on information other than the certificate must be based on clear evidence, and must be <strong>defensible</strong> (likely to be affirmed by an Authorised Review Officer or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal based on available evidence on the customer's record). Service Officers must not make their own judgements about a customer's capacity to work, outside available medical evidence.</p>

<p>Work capacity recommendations from an <strong>existing</strong> current and valid Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) or Job Capacity Assessment (JCA) report may be used to help determine if a temporary incapacity exemption can be granted. This information does not replace or 'override' the certificate as the primary, and usually most recent evidence for a temporary incapacity exemption decision. Relevant information that may be considered from an ESAt or JCA report includes&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Current recommendations for temporary (reduced) work capacity, which may be in bandwidths ranging between 0-7 and 23-29 hours per week. This information reflects the assessor's recommendations about <strong>temporary</strong> impacts of a customer's medical condition for a defined period, based on medical evidence available at the time of assessment. This information may be relevant to a medical certificate assessment if the temporary reduced work capacity period is still current. If the period has now expired, this does not prevent consideration of a new medical certificate based on a customer's current circumstances</li>
		<li>
Assessments of partial capacity to work, of less than 30 hours per week. This assessment <strong>only</strong> reflects the work capacity impacts of a customer's permanent medical conditions, over the next two years from the date of assessment. It does not take into account the impacts of any temporary conditions, or temporary exacerbations of a permanent condition. Service Officers assessing medical certificates must take care using this information, as it may be less relevant to determining if an exemption can be granted</li>
		</ul>
<p>An ESAt or JCA may remain current for up to two years, including for the purposes of referring a customer to recommended employment services. This doesn't necessarily mean that the assessment is valid, and relevant to a temporary incapacity exemption decision - this depends on the customer's individual medical circumstances. These assessments generally become less relevant with the passage of time.</p>

<p>For example, an ESAt completed at least 6 months ago based on older medical evidence is generally less likely to reflect a customer's medical circumstances than a certificate completed by the medical practitioner in the last few days. If that ESAt included a recommendation that the customer was expected to have a temporary reduced work capacity of 0-7 hours per week for 3 months from the date of assessment, this recommendation is only relevant for that period. The expiry of the temporary reduced work capacity period should not stop a new exemption application being assessed after that time, if the customer provides new current medical evidence about their work capacity.</p>

<p>When considering information in a current ESAt/JCA, consider any changes in the job seeker's medical condition(s). The ESAt/JCA may still be current (less than 2 years) but no longer valid due to a change, such as a temporary exacerbation of a permanent condition, deterioration of a medical condition or a change in treatment. Contact with the medical practitioner may assist Service Officers to reach a more informed and accurate decision.</p>

<p>Service Officers should take care using ESAt/JCA work capacity recommendations to reject a temporary incapacity exemption application - unless this information is still clearly relevant to the customer's current medical circumstances, and consistent with all other evidence on the record.</p>

<p><strong>Example&#58;</strong> The customer provides a certificate from a new treating medical practitioner which states they will be unable to do any work for 13 to 24 months because of their mental health conditions, which are listed as a temporary exacerbation of a permanent condition. They have already been continuously exempt for over two years based on certificates for the same conditions, with similar prognosis. An ESAt completed in the last 3 months assessed the conditions as 'permanent', with an ongoing partial capacity to work and reduced mutual obligation requirements. The service officer correctly decides that an exemption can't be granted in this case because evidence shows the customer's incapacity for work is clearly not temporary.</p>

<p>An ESAt is not required in deciding whether to grant or deny a temporary incapacity exemption. This decision should be based on the certificate, taking into account any other existing and relevant evidence including any previous temporary incapacity exemption history, and recommendations from a current and valid ESAt or JCA.</p>

<p>After the decision is made to grant or deny a customer's request for temporary incapacity exemption, consider if an <a href="../job-seekers/001-02330010-01.html">ESAt referral</a> is appropriate to assess the customer's work capacity. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> ESAts are not applicable for ParentsNext participants.</p>

<p>An ESAt request may be considered if the medical certificate and/or other available information indicates the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
is likely to have an ongoing partial capacity to work due to the impact of their permanent medical condition(s) - which may entitle them to other services including a Pensioner Concession Card (PCC), Youth Disability Supplement (YDS) and Pharmaceutical Allowance (PhA)</li>
		<li>
has a medical condition(s) that is medium or long term (up to 24 months) in nature, including episodic or chronic conditions (for example, schizophrenia, psychosis, depression and anxiety)</li>
		<li>
cannot be granted a temporary incapacity exemption (for example, because the customer can work at least 8 hours per week) but may have a temporary reduced work capacity of between 8 and 29 hours per week</li>
		<li>
has medical condition(s) that appear to be no longer of a temporary nature based on multiple medical certificates being lodged for the same condition</li>

customer is a compulsory ParentsNext participant</li>

		<li>
the customer's conditions are not expected to impact their work capacity for longer than 13 weeks</li>
		</ul>
<p>During a temporary incapacity exemption period, job seekers are still required to attend an ESAt appointment if it was booked before the exemption was granted. Carefully consider their ability to attend the appointment, particularly if they have been granted a <a href="../job-seekers/001-09120080-01.html">temporary incapacity for serious illness</a>.</p>
