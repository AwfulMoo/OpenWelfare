<p>If bank account details have been collected by a third party, for example a medical practice, it is the claimantâ€™s responsibility to verify the bank account details are recorded correctly. </p>

<p>The agency will undertake an EFT retrieval for payments made to an incorrect bank account, but the agency will not reimburse funds if the EFT retrieval is unsuccessful.</p>

<p><strong>Wrong patient, claimant or Medicare card</strong></p>

bank details have been recorded for the child</li>
		<li>
payment has gone to anyone other than the person identified as the correct claimant, for example the payment has been incorrectly paid to the other parent</li>

reprocessed with the correct claimant and,</li>

a debt raised for the person whose bank account details were recorded</li>

<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Rejected EFT payment and the Government Direct Entry Service (GDES) report</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) provides the agency with a GDES report identifying details of any Medicare EFT payment failures. These occur if a bank deposit is rejected by the financial institution (account closed or does not exist).</p>

<p>The internal process of the individual financial institution will determine the time that elapses between the agency depositing the funds and when&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the financial institution accepts and releases the funds to the claimant, or </li>
		<li>
rejects and returns the funds to the agency</li>
		</ul>
<p>Financial institutions do not always return benefits to the RBA that cannot be deposited into a bank account. In some cases the financial institutions retain these benefits in their internal suspense accounts. These funds will be identified by a trace request.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the agency deposits funds into a claimantâ€™s bank account according to the information on their records or as per the claimantâ€™s instructions. The claimantâ€™s financial institution will either accept or reject the deposit. If the financial institution rejects the deposit, it is the claimantâ€™s responsibility to make sure correct bank account details are provided and that the account can be used for electronic funds transfers.</p>

<p><strong>GDES report</strong></p>

<p>The GDES report is automatically run and will update the status of the payments listed on the report from <strong>PAID</strong> to <strong>REJECTED</strong> and apply the appropriate reason code within the Mainframe <strong>BRNA</strong> screen.</p>

<p>This then automatically updates the status of the banking details that relate to the payment in CDMS. For example, bank account closed. The bank details in CDMS are not end-dated, but the Status will be updated to reflect the rejection code on the GDES report.</p>

<p>If bank account details are updated in the system after the money is returned to the agency from the RBA, any claims that have <strong>rejected</strong> in the claiming details will need to be repaid by the Service Officer. See the <a href="../your-health/011-43120010-03.html">Process</a> page for more details.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> a claim that has redirect showing should <strong>not</strong> be changed to <strong>reject</strong> by a Service Officer or the claimant will receive the payment twice.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>When bank account details have been collected online, Service Officers must try to determine if it was fraudulent activity or claimant error.</p>

<p>Examples of claimant error can include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
incorrectly transposing bank account details</li>
		<li>
not updating their details after a change in family circumstances (separation)</li>
		<li>
their previous bank account has closed</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the claimant advises that the bank account details were updated without their knowledge, the dispute is to be referred to MPS Assessing to investigate further. Complete an EFT dispute form adding comments that the claimant is advising the account has been changed without their knowledge.</p>

<p>If MPS Assessing determine there is enough evidence to support the claimantâ€™s statement that the bank account had been updated without their knowledge&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
the agency will repay the claimant, and </li>
		<li>
refers the matter to Medicare Payments Integrity (MPI) section to review and refer to compliance for more investigation</li>
		</ul>
<p>If there is not enough evidence, the matter will be referred to the MPI section to review and refer to compliance for more investigation before any decision on repayment to the claimant is made.</p>

<h2 id="_Toc344898764">The health professional has an automated debt recovery in place</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>If a health professional has a debt recovery arrangement in place, they may notice that the amount shown on their EFT bulk bill statement is different to the amount actually deposited into their nominated bank account. For example, the health professionalâ€™s EFT bulk bill statement may show $100 as being paid by Medicare, but after 20% is taken by debt recovery only $80 will be deposited into the health professionalâ€™s nominated bank account.</p>

<p>The Commonwealth department or agency recovering the debt is responsible for notifying the health professional of their debt recovery arrangement, as well as providing all ongoing communication. For this reason, minimal enquiries are expected to be received by Service Officers.</p>

<p>Health professionals or a member of their staff may still contact the agency regarding the discrepancy between their EFT bulk bill statement and the actual amount deposited into their bank account. If this happens, a health professionalâ€™s debt recovery information can be viewed in the Provider Directory System (PDS) and Mainframe (CICS).</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a debt has been fully paid the debt instruction will no longer appear in the PDS but the debt recovery history and corresponding agencies will remain in Mainframe (CICS)</p>

<p>There will be no impact or changes to internal adjustments or recoveries processed as a result of the compliance debt recovery system. If a health professional who has had a payment garnished contacts the agency to advise the claim (from which a deduction was taken) was incorrect and they wish to instigate a voluntary recovery, ignore the fact there was a reduced benefit paid and recover the amount paid by Medicare (That is, the full Medicare benefit, as is current process).</p>

<p><strong>Do not</strong> discuss details of the debt recovery arrangement (for example how much is being recovered) with the health professional or their staff. Refer the health professional to the relevant department or agency that is recovering the debt.</p>

<p>Automated recovery arrangements are in place to recover debt/s on behalf of the following Commonwealth departments or agencies&#58;</p>

Australian Financial Securities Authority (AFSA)</li>
		<li>
Australian Taxation Office (ATO) </li>
