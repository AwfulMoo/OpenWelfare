		<ul>		<li>
Workforce Australia</li>
		<li>
Workforce Australia Online</li>
		<li>
Disability Employment Services</li>
		<li>
ParentsNext providers</li>
		</ul>
<p>These providers deliver employment services to job seekers. This means working with job seekers to help address barriers to employment (both vocational and non-vocational) to help them off welfare and into work. Job seekers will have the best chance of improving their employment prospects by engaging fully with their provider and the services designed to help them achieve the earliest possible entry or re-entry to the workforce.</p>

<p>ParentsNext providers work with parents of young children to ensure they receive the assistance they need to prepare for employment by the time their children reach school age. They encourage and help parents to think about the types of employment that they would like to obtain and to prepare for this through education and other activities tailored to their individual circumstances.</p>

<p>Providers have responsibility for negotiating Job/Participation Plans (job plans) that set out the job seeker's compulsory requirements in return for receiving a participation payment, and to assist their return to work. When setting requirements, the provider must ensure that&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the job seeker's personal circumstances and assessed capacity have been considered to ensure that the job seeker is capable of meeting the requirements in their job plan, and</li>
		<li>
compulsory requirements are consistent with relevant legislation and policies, and do not exceed prescribed maximum limits set out in social security law</li>

		<div class="block">

<p>Providers are responsible for ensuring job seekers are aware of what they need to do in return for receiving a participation payment, and understand the effect on their payment if they do not meet requirements.</p>

<p>Providers must ensure job seekers receive proper notification and reasonable notice of their requirements.</p>

<p>For a notification to be valid under Social Security Law, it must include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the date and time of the appointment, activity or requirement being notified</li>
		<li>
the location they must attend, and</li>
		<li>
a job seeker compliance warning explaining the consequences of not meeting the requirement</li>
		</ul>
<p>If, at the time an appointment is made, it is known that the job seeker will be required to enter into a Job/Participation Plan, this requirement must also be notified.</p>

<p>Providers are responsible for monitoring the job seeker's compliance with their compulsory requirements.</p>

<p>Where a job seeker does not comply with a compulsory requirement, the provider determines the appropriate action, based on the compliance system that applies to the job seeker.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Targeted_Compli">Targeted Compliance Framework</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Where providers become aware of non-compliance, they are required to attempt a minimum of one outbound contact on the day of a missed requirement to discuss the missed requirement. The Employment Services System electronically notifies Services Australia where a mutual obligation failure has occurred.</p>

<p>If the job seeker is in the&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
green or warning zone, the job seeker receives a notification telling them to contact the provider within two business days or their payment will be suspended</li>
		<li>
penalty zone, or the failure is a work refusal or unemployment failure, their payment is suspended immediately</li>
		</ul>
<p>When contact with the job seeker is established, the provider is responsible for notifying the job seeker of their reconnection requirements. They monitor the job seeker's compliance with these requirements and electronically notify Services Australia when the conditions for lifting the payment suspension have been met. If payment was suspended, the suspension is lifted when the reconnection requirement is met or the provider decides they no longer need to meet the requirement.</p>

<p>On contact with the job seeker, the provider talks with the job seeker about their reasons for not meeting requirements and decides if the job seeker had a valid reason. The outcome of this decision, and the zone the job seeker is in, will determine what further action the provider will take.</p>

<p>For job seekers in the warning zone, providers are responsible for managing demerits, including the accrual and removal of demerits&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
where the provider decides the job seeker has a valid reason for a mutual obligation failure, no  demerit is applied</li>
		<li>
where a valid reason has not been provided the provider confirms a demerit and ensures the job seeker understands the consequences of this</li>
		<li>
if the job seeker disputes a decision to apply a demerit, the provider is responsible for the discussion and removal of demerits if appropriate</li>
		</ul>
<p>A demerit will only become visible to the job seeker when it has been confirmed by the provider.</p>

<p>Providers undertake a Capability Interview when the job seeker accrues 3 demerits in the Employment Services System. Where a job seeker accrues 5 demerits in an active 6 months, the Employment Services System may trigger a Capability Assessment. Where a Capability Assessment is triggered, the provider notifies the job seeker of the requirement to contact Services Australia for a Capability Assessment.</p>

<p>For job seekers in the financial penalty zone, where a valid reason for non-compliance has been provided before the job seeker's reporting date, providers will record this to close the outstanding Non-Compliance Reports. This will also end the need for Services Australia to undertake a compliance investigation. In other words, before a Non-Compliance Report is generated for investigation by Services Australia, the provider must confirm that the job seeker does not have a valid excuse.</p>

<p>Providers are responsible for electronically notifying Services Australia that a mutual obligation failure (where a job seeker is in the financial penalty zone), work refusal failure or unemployment failure requires an assessment of reasonable excuse for the purpose of determining whether a penalty should be applied. They do this after discussing the event with the job seeker and establishing the job seeker did not have a valid reason and work was suitable (where suitability of work is applicable).</p>

<p>Where non-compliance occurs, Community Development Program (CDP) providers will consider whether or not to submit compliance action.</p>

<p>CDP providers&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
initiate and action Non-Attendance Reports (NAR), including booking reconnection appointments, notifying CDP job seekers of the reconnection requirement and sending an electronic transmission to lift payment suspensions resulting from a NAR. The provider advises the CDP job seeker where their participation payment will be stopped due to a missed appointment, and of the need to arrange reengagement so that the suspension can be lifted</li>
		<li>
speak to CDP job seekers to discuss non-attendance prior to submitting a Provider Appointment Report (PAR). A PAR can only be submitted on the day the provider makes contact with the CDP job seeker to discuss the non-attendance at the appointment</li>
		<li>
will provide Services Australia with all necessary information in relation to a non-compliance event where a decision is made to pursue compliance action via a PAR or Participation Report (PR)</li>
