<p><strong>Schooling A customers:</strong> for Schooling A students, the Group 1 SFA may have already been paid for the particular studies that they are not commencing. If this has occurred, delete the SFA off the Supplementary Education Payment (<strong>EPSP</strong>) screen prior to deleting the course off the relevant (<strong>EDC</strong>) screen page (as per Rejecting an ABSTUDY claim). To do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>place an '<strong>E</strong>' next to the non-commenced course on the Education Course History (<strong>EDCH</strong>) screen and press [<strong>Enter</strong>]</li>
<li>the system will navigate to the <strong>EPSP</strong> screen, and display the SFA that has been paid for the specific year. Delete this SFA by placing a '<strong>D</strong>' in the <strong>Action:</strong> field and press [<strong>Enter</strong>]</li>
<li>return to the <strong>EDCH</strong> screen and delete the <strong>EDC</strong> screen page showing details of the non-commenced course</li></ul>
<p><strong>Student Reviews:</strong> if this assessment is in relation to a review, and is on a customer who was ABSTUDY current for a course in the past, the record should not be rejected. The record will need to be cancelled. As the customer is not qualified for ABSTUDY Living Allowance or ABSTUDY PES in the previous study period, and they have not commenced the new study period, the record will need to be cancelled from the date they ceased study in the past. No entitlement exists for the new course.</p>
<p>To do this, navigate to the <strong>EDCH</strong> screen and delete the <strong>EDC</strong> screen page showing details of the non-commenced course.</p>
