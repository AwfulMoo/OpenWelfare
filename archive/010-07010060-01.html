<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Study_load_deta">Study load detail</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A student's study load determines whether they can qualify for a student payment. If they do not meet the study load requirements for each student payment, they cannot be paid as a student. Where a student has enrolled in an accelerated part time course, the education provider will determine the study load of the student.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Requirements">Requirements</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Generally, with some exceptions, students must be studying full time and must maintain 75% of a full time study load to receive Youth Allowance (YA), Austudy, ABSTUDY or Pensioner Education Supplement (PES). For students receiving one of these payments and undertaking tertiary and secondary non-school courses, a decrease in study load may mean they are no longer eligible for a student payment. Students enrolled in accelerated courses, may be undertaking 75% of a full time study load, however the education provider may still consider them part time. Where information is not available on the education provider's website or handbook, the student will be required to provide POE from the provider. It is therefore very important for staff to know how to assess these requirements and how to determine the study load that is being undertaken.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Enrolled_and_un">Enrolled and undertaking study</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Students must be undertaking the study they are enrolled in, for it to contribute towards the study load for their current course. This means that subjects or units students do not undertake because they have received recognition of prior learning for previous similar subjects or units, will not be included in the assessment of their current study load.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Crossinstituti">Cross-institutional study</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Generally, a student must be enrolled full time in a single course at one education institution to be eligible for a student payment. There are however limited circumstances where a student may be enrolled in 2 separate courses (and at 2 different education institutions) and still be eligible for a student payment. See <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-07010140-01.html">Effect on student payments of enrolment in more than one course or at more than one educational institution</a>.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Distance_educat">Distance education</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>If a student is enrolled in distance education (such as external or online studies) the assessment of study load is conducted the same as students who attend their education institute. The eligibility requirements for student payments are the same irrespective of whether a student is studying through distance education or on campus.</p>

<p>Distance education is very flexible and students are able to arrange their study patterns to suit their personal needs, with no academic penalty for not completing work. However, students receiving YA, Austudy, ABSTUDY or Pensioner Education Supplement (PES) need to comply with the <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-07000000-01.html">study load requirements</a> relevant to their payment.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Where a student is required to undertake a compulsory practical placement as part of their course, Youth Allowance, Austudy, ABSTUDY or Pensioner Education Supplement (PES) may continue to be paid in some circumstances.</p>

<p>If the placement is being completed within Australia, the student must maintain a 75% of a full-time study load to continue to receive Youth Allowance, Austudy or ABSTUDY. Advise the student to check with their education institution whether their placement attracts a credit weighting, and whether they are still enrolled full-time during the placement period.</p>

<p>A student who travels overseas to undertake a work placement will remain eligible for payment providing&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they are a continuing student immediately prior to departing Australia, and</li>
		<li>
their placement forms part of their full-time Australian course</li>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Due to COVID-19, some students were temporarily unable to study or reduced their study load below full-time. Impacts for students include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a sudden transition away from face-to-face learning to online learning</li>
		<li>
closure of student accommodation</li>
		<li>
cancellation of some units of study</li>
		<li>
delays in commencing practical placements</li>
		</ul>
<p>Some students will contact to advise a delay in their practical placement. These students may not know when their placement will begin or end. Service Officers&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
can use estimated dates provided by the customer in these circumstances</li>
		<li>
<strong>do not</strong> have to request documentation from an education provider to confirm placement dates. See below for other evidence requirements</li>
		<li>
<strong>should tell</strong> customers to update their course details when they know more specific details</li>
		<li>
are to escalate to level 2 if practical placement will be completed after the course has ceased. See the <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-07010060-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Intranet_links">Resources</a> page for details</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Study Requirements</strong></p>

<p>Students unable to study, or with a reduced study load, meet their study load requirements if they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
had an approved reason, and</li>
		<li>
remained enrolled in their course (this includes taking an approved leave of absence), and</li>
		<li>
returned, or intended to return to full-time studies or an approved concessional study load in the&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
next available study period, or</li>
			<li>
earliest possibility of full-time study</li>		</ul>
		<li>
cannot return to full time study as they are in the final study period of their course</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Approved reasons for reduction in study load</strong></p>

<p>Approved reasons include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the student moved from face-to-face to online study, and had a lack of available resources. For example internet access, PC/laptop or specialist equipment</li>
		<li>
the student dropped units of study because they failed or would have failed because of transitioning away from face-to-face learning</li>
		<li>
education provider cancelled subjects or units, or</li>
		<li>
rescheduling of compulsory practical placement</li>
		</ul>
<p>Do not update the Education Course Details (<strong>EDC</strong>) screen unless the student needs to extend their course and study end dates.</p>

<p>For a student with study circumstances impacted by COVID-19, record details in a DOC. Include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
why the customer is temporarily unable to study or reduced their study load</li>
		<li>
if the student has the intention to return to full time study or approved concessional study load&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
in the next available study period, or</li>
			<li>
the earliest possible instance full time study becomes available to them again</li>		</ul>
		<li>
if the student cannot return to full time study, as they are in the final study period of their course</li>
		</ul>
<p>A student does not have an approved reason if they decided to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
end their study, or</li>
		<li>
reduce their study load because their education provider waived a financial or academic penalty</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Evidence requirements</strong></p>

<p>Student's with a reduced study load due to COVID-19, need to provide evidence from their education provider. This evidence must state they have a reduced study load as a direct result of COVID-19.</p>

<p>Do not request evidence from an education provider if practical placement is delayed due to COVID-19 and the start or end date for placement is unknown.</p>

<p>Update the <strong>EDC</strong> screen with estimated dates provided by the student.</p>
