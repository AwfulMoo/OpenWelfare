This document outlines information about early intervention services for
children with disabilities.

Early intervention funding

The Australian Government provides early intervention funding through
the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). The Early Childhood
Early Intervention (ECEI) supports children under the age of 7 who have
a development delay or disability, and their families/carers.

The NDIS has engaged Early Childhood Partners around Australia to
deliver the ECEI approach.

Customers requiring Early Childhood Early Intervention support should
call the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA). The NDIA may tell
them to call a local NDIS early childhood partner.

Children under 7 do not need a diagnosis to get support from the NDIS.

Children aged 7 years and over need to have a permanent and significant
disability to get support.

The NDIS is a way for people to get disability support that takes an
individualised and life-long approach through community linkages and
individualised plans. This means rather than providing support based on
the number of places in a limited number of programs, the scheme will
provide funding so people can get the reasonable and necessary support
they need, based on their individual needs, goals and aspirations. These
supports may include linkages to existing services and supports within
the participant's community, and/or reasonable and necessary funded
supports.

The Resources page contains links to external websites for more
information about helping children with Autism and the Department of
Social Services NDIS program.
