This document outlines steps that Complex Assessment Officers must take
when a customer and their previous partner have agreed to transfer
responsibility for a HEAS debt. The agreement is stated in a Court
ruling or Order.

Conditions to be met

The following conditions must be met in full for the procedure here to
be applicable:

relationship

A completed Module S has been provided

The previous couple named in the Module S both have outstanding debts
under the HEAS

Property offered as security for the HEAS loan was co-owned prior to end
of the relationship

A Court of Law has formalised the legal separation or divorce
proceedings of persons named in the Module S

A Consent Order, Court-issued annulment document or some other judicial
ruling orders:

-   the transfer of full ownership of the HEAS security to one person
    (transferee), and
-   sets out the repayment responsibility of transferee for the HEAS
    debts of both persons

A copy of court documents showing the mutually binding judicial outcome
must be provided to the agency

Title on the property is registered solely in the transferee's name
