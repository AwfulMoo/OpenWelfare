This document outlines how to process participating public hospital
Authority approval applications. Participating public hospitals can
supply Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) prescriptions to discharge
patients and outpatients. Public hospital authority applications are to
be processed in the same way as standard authority applications.

On this Page:

Maximum items

Up to ten items are permitted on one prescription form. These items can
be unrestricted, restricted or authority drugs. The medical practitioner
is given an approval number for each authority item.

Prescription form numbers

A prescription form number can be used up to ten times.

Chemotherapy items

Items in the 5800-5999 range can only be selected by participating
public hospitals.

See Chemotherapy Pharmaceutical Access Program (historical records
only).

Medication item codes

Ensure the correct medication item code is selected. Items listed in the
Chemotherapy Pharmaceutical Access Program (CPAP) with the item range
5800 – 5999 are prefixed with CPAP.

Breaking medication packs

Medication packs can be broken to meet the patient's requirements as
prescriptions are usually dispensed by the hospital pharmacy.

Patient supply

Regardless of medication history, the patient is entitled to one month's
supply. If the patient has outstanding medication, you can still approve
one month's supply with appropriate notation in the authority comments.

If a patient is being discharged, the prescriber can request a standard
six months' supply.
