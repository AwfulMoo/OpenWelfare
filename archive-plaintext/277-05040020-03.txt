|                                   | -   Understandably this           |
|                                   |     conversation may be difficult |
|                                   |     for the customer and Service  |
|                                   |     Officer so they should use    |
|                                   |     their judgement               |
|                                   | -   The customer may prefer that  |
|                                   |     the conversation takes place  |
|                                   |     at another time or with       |
|                                   |     another person and the        |
|                                   |     Service Officer must comply   |

|                                   | -   A customer may react          |
|                                   |     emotionally, aggressively or  |
|                                   |     they may not react at all     |
|                                   | -   Think about how to            |
|                                   |     communicate in a manner that  |
|                                   |     is tactful, sensitive and     |
