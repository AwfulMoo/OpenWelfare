This document outlines an overview of Child Protection Income Management
(CPIM).

Purpose of CPIM

The aim of CPIM is to encourage responsible behaviour by parents to
enhance the wellbeing of their children.

Case workers from a State or Territory Child Protection Authority may
make a decision that Income Management will contribute to improved
outcomes for children at risk.

A customer may be referred to the agency for Income Management. This is
at the discretion of child protection authorities. The agency then
determine if the customer meets the eligibility requirements for Income
Management.

CPIM referrals

Before a referral for Income Management is made, the State or Territory
Child Protection Authority will request a Disclosure of Information
(DOI) from Services Australia. This will provide them with information
that will assist in determining if Income Management is suitable and
will be of benefit, given the customer's circumstances.

Once a Notice to Commence Income Management or enhanced Income
Management has been lodged by the relevant State or Territory Child
Protection Authority, Services Australia will determine if the customer
meets all other criteria required under CPIM. Services Australia will
contact the customer and inform them of their requirement to attend an
interview as they have been referred for Income Management.

CPIM is compulsory, however, the Child Protection Authority case worker
can revoke the notice at any time.

The partner of an income managed customer will not be automatically
income managed. However, the State or Territory Child Protection
Authority may refer both partners for Income Management where they
believe this is in the best interest of the child/ren concerned.

This measure applies especially to families receiving an income support
payment who are not meeting responsibilities for their children.

Northern Territory

Duration of CPIM

A CPIM notice can be for a period of 3, 6, 9 or 12 months. The notice
can be extended beyond a 12 month period if the Child Protection
Authority case worker believes this would benefit the customer.

The State or Territory Child Protection Authority can request Income
Management be ceased at any point in time by sending a Revocation of
Income Management or enhanced Income Management.

Percentage of payments income managed

The following payments are income managed under this measure:

-   70% of a customer's regular fortnightly Category I welfare payment
    (which includes Category H welfare payments)
-   100% of ABSTUDY (with Living Allowance or Pensioner Education
    Supplement (PES)) payments
-   100% of lump sum payments income managed

There are specific payments not income managed.

Hierarchy of Income Management measures

A customer could be eligible for more than one Income Management measure
at the same point in time. In these cases, a hierarchy is used to
determine under which measure the customer will be income managed. CPIM
is ranked second on the hierarchy of Income Management measures.

Note: selected State or Territory Child Protection Authority can refer a
customer to Services Australia to discuss Voluntary Income Management.

Child Protection and DVA payments

The Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) administers payments which are
'Category H' payments and therefore eligible for CPIM and Voluntary
Income Management (VIM).

The DVA Category H trigger payments are:

-   Service Pension
-   Income Support Supplement
-   Age Pension paid by DVA
-   Veteran Payment

DVA customers are subject to the same Income Management rules as
Services Australia's customers. The task of providing this service to
these customers is controlled by the Statement of Intent between DVA and
Services Australia.

It will be necessary to confirm that the customer receives one of the
DVA eligible payments and that they reside in an area where the relevant
measure is available. An Income Management Contact Officer (IMCO) will
handle all DVA cases.

The Resources page contains contact information for customers who are
receiving a DVA Category H payment and want to be income managed.
