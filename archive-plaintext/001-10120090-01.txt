This document outlines the process for changing the start and end dates
of serious failure periods, Unemployment Non-Payment Periods (UNPP),
non-attendance failure and reconnection failure penalty periods which
may be incurred by Community Development Program (CDP) participants.

Start date for serious failures, UNPPs, non-attendance failure and reconnection failure periods

The start date for a serious failure period or UNPP may be affected by:

-   the type of failure that has occurred and when it occurred in
    relation to any other failures
-   whether the failure occurred before or after grant of payment
-   when Services Australia became aware of the failure

The start date for a non-attendance failure penalty period may be
affected by:

-   the date the CDP participant is deemed to have received proper
    notification from their provider of the decision that their
    participation payment is not payable due to the appointment they
    missed

The start date for a reconnection failure penalty period will start from
the day the CDP participant failed to comply with their reconnection
requirement.

Manual adjustment of start and end dates

Start and end dates may need to be manually adjusted in some
circumstances, including where:

-   the CDP participant has commenced a serious failure or UNPP, then
    changes to a payment not subject to Job Seeker Compliance Framework
    arrangements (for example, a serious failure has occurred and a CDP
    participant transfers to ABSTUDY)
-   a UNPP occurred while the CDP participant was in receipt of payment
    and the more beneficial start date is date of unemployment rather
    than start of the next instalment period after the decision made to
    apply the UNPP
-   the penalty period for a non-attendance failure or reconnection
    failure requires adjustment due to a change in the outcome as a
    result of a review, including where new information indicates a
    change to the start date or end date of a penalty is required
-   the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) has specified that
    although the serious failure or UNPP has occurred, no penalty is to
    apply or a different penalty period applies

PST-skilled Service Officer action when adjusting start and end dates for a serious failure or UNPP

Participation Solutions Team (PST)-skilled Service Officers undertaking
compliance investigations are responsible for checking the start and end
dates automatically calculated by the Compliance Investigation workflow
as part of making a recommendation or decision to apply a serious
failure or UNPP.

As part of the process to change the start and end date of a non-payment
period, the PST-skilled Service Officer is required to:

-   review the CDP participant's circumstances to check they are still
    entitled to payment and to determine their correct rate, for
    example, income, assets and address changes
-   code any such changes in the CDP participant's circumstances
-   fully document the reason why the action has been undertaken
-   issue a letter to the CDP participant confirming the new start and
    end dates of the serious failure or UNPP, if applicable

PST-skilled Service Officer action when adjusting start and end dates for non-attendance failure or reconnection failure penalties

Service Officers undertaking compliance investigations are responsible
for checking the start and end dates automatically calculated by the
Compliance Investigation workflow as part of making a decision to apply
a non-attendance failure or reconnection failure penalty. If a change is
needed, the PST-skilled Service Officer must fully detail and clearly
explain the reasons for the change and any change that is made adheres
to the principles of a quality decision.
