This document outlines information for Youth Allowance (YA) (student)
customers eligible for a full-time study exemption when their partner
dies.

Interacting with customers who have a recently deceased partner

Offer the services of a social worker during the first contact with a
customer after the death of a partner. For more information, see Initial
contact after someone has died.

Eligibility for a Bereavement Payment

YA students may be eligible for Bereavement Payment if their partner
dies.

Note: YA students do not need to be considered independent to be
eligible for a bereavement payment.

If the customer and partner's records are not linked they may need to
show proof of the relationship. For more information, see Member of a
Couple (MoC) and Separated under one roof (SUOR) assessments.

The customer may be entitled to a Lump Sum Bereavement Payment (LBP) or
Partner Bereavement Payment (PBV). PBV can be assessed as either part of
a new claim or when an existing customer contacts.

Full-time study bereavement exemption

A YA student whose partner has died is eligible for a partner full-time
study exemption due to bereavement. The exemption period is 14 weeks
from when their partner died. If the customer is pregnant at the time of
their partners death, they will be exempt from the full-time study
requirements for the period of the pregnancy.

During the exemption period the student can:

-   cancel their enrolment
-   defer their study
-   take an approved leave of absence, or
-   reduce their study load to part time

The customer must have an intention to return to qualifying study:

-   in the study period that commences immediately after the last day of
    the exemption period, and
-   within 21 weeks from the day after the exemption period ends

Customers who do not intend to return to qualifying study will no longer
qualify for YA (student). Eligibility for alternative payments must be
explored.

Note: if the customer transfers to a JobSeeker Payment, the partner
full-time study exemption due to bereavement will continue for the
bereavement period.

Managing study details online during partner bereavement full-time study exemption period

If a YA customer has a bereavement full-time study exemption coded on
their record and uses the manage study details online service to update
their study details, the details will not be automatically applied to
their record. Service Officers may need to contact the customer by phone
to determine their future study intentions if they have advised
cessation of their course or a reduction in study load.

Independence after the death of a partner

YA customers usually need to be in a de facto relationship for 12 months
to be considered independent.

Note: in special circumstances, YA customers can be considered
independent where the de facto relationship lasts at least 6 months.

Customer independence does not impact the application of an exemption
from full-time study.

Complete a holistic assessment of a customer's circumstances after the
death of their partner.

For more information, see Assessing independence when a customer is/was
married or a member of a couple.
