This document outlines how to assess if a customer meets the residence
requirements to qualify for DSP and if they have served, or are exempt
from serving the qualifying residence period.

Residence criteria

To satisfy the residence criteria for DSP, a customer must meet all of
the following:

-   be an Australian resident,
-   generally must be in Australia at the time the claim is lodged, and
-   generally must remain an Australian resident throughout the period
    of payment

In addition, a customer must meet one of the following:

have been an Australian resident at the time when:

-   due to the impairment, their Continuing Inability to Work (CITW)
    occurred, or
-   their permanent blindness occurred

was an Australian resident at the time the Secretary was advised the
person is participating in the Supported Wage System (SWS)

has 10 years qualifying Australian residence

has a qualifying residence exemption, or

qualifies using an international social security agreement

Note: other qualification criteria for DSP also have to be met.

Australia has a number of international social security agreements that
cover DSP. Agreements may help a customer to receive DSP even if they:

-   are not an Australian resident and in Australia, and/or
-   do not meet the minimum Australian residence period to qualify but
    have lived or worked in an agreement country that covers DSP

If a claim is rejecting due to insufficient qualifying residence and the
customer lived on Norfolk Island before 1 July 2016, see Requesting and
coding additional residence data for Norfolk Island claims.

It may be necessary to code a former resident override to prevent the
system applying former resident rules if a customer:

-   lived on Norfolk Island immediately before arriving in Australia for
    residence, and
-   never lived in Australia previously

DSP customers must remain an Australian resident on an ongoing basis
unless they are exempt from the ongoing residence requirement.

International Services (CIS).
