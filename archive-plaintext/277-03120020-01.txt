This is a Family and Domestic Violence Interaction Point. If the
customer is with another person, on speaker phone, or already identified
with family and domestic violence concerns, continue with the current
business conversation. Otherwise, go to the Family and domestic violence
procedure to conduct the risk identification and referral process.

This document outlines the administrative tasks and processes undertaken
by Internal Decision Makers (IDM) and Contracted Decision Makers (CDM)
during a change of assessment (COA) application.

COA streamlined customer contact

The COA streamlined customer contact approach is for customers who
submit a complete COA application, reducing unnecessary contact and time
delays. However, it is expected that decision makers (DMs) will continue
to use their discretion should they determine additional contact is
required.

The streamlined approach does not apply to customers who fall in to the
categories below:

-   Culturally and linguistically diverse
-   Indigenous and Remote
-   Family and Domestic Violence
-   Personalised Services (PS)

Manage COA application

This involves Decision Makers (DMs) checking and examining the COA
application or cross-application, customer circumstances and supporting
documentation to determine whether it is appropriate to make a change to
the assessment.

The Resources page contains links to letters and other resources for
managing and processing a change of assessment (COA) application.
