This document outlines the roles and responsibilities of Employment
Services Providers, ParentsNext providers and Services Australia in
managing job seeker compliance with compulsory requirements.

Introduction

The primary aim of both Employment Services Providers, ParentsNext
providers (providers) and Services Australia in managing job seeker
compliance with compulsory requirements is to keep job seekers actively
engaged with employment services and their compulsory activities. Where
this is working effectively the need for compliance action is reduced.

More specifically, the Targeted Compliance Framework aims to:

-   increase the level of personal responsibility of job seekers by
    providing them with the information they need about obligations and
    the consequences of non-compliance. This ensures that job seekers
    are aware upfront of the consequences of non-compliance and helps to
    ensure they are making an informed choice if they do not comply. Job
    seekers will also have greater personal control/responsibility over
    attendance management through new online tools
-   reward compliance through a lighter touch (demerit system) for
    genuine job seekers who generally do the right thing
-   change behaviours and improve job seeker engagement by way of
    escalating financial penalties in the case of persistent
    non-compliance

Working together to manage compliance with compulsory requirements

The Department of Education, Skills and Employment has primary
responsibility for the legislation and policy that underpins the job
seeker compliance system.

The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet is responsible for the
Community Development Program (CDP), which provides employment services
to job seekers in remote Australia. The Department of Social Services is
responsible for Disability Employment Services (DES).

All providers and Services Australia are required to work together to
apply legislation and policy in a manner that keeps job seekers actively
engaged in employment services and activities designed to get them back
to work.

Providers and Services Australia have responsibility for encouraging job
seekers to participate to the full extent of their capability and
capacity, discouraging non-compliance and motivating behavioural change.

Joint responsibilities include:

-   developing personal responsibility in job seekers by setting clear
    expectations upfront about what job seekers are required to do in
    return for payment, and by ensuring that the consequences of
    non-compliance have been clearly explained and are understood
-   ensuring that job seekers/participants who are not genuine in
    looking for work and/or meeting compulsory requirements are
    appropriately held to account for their actions by applying
    legislation and policy in a firm but fair manner
-   ensuring that job seekers who have a good reason for not meeting
    their requirements, and who have made prior contact where required
    to do so to provide an acceptable reason, are not penalised
-   supporting job seekers who have become disengaged to reconnect with
    their requirements and their provider as quickly as possible

In addition, both providers and Services Australia have individual roles
and responsibilities, which should be delivered in a manner that
supports and complements each other.

Provider responsibilities in managing compliance using the Targeted Compliance Framework

Most job seekers receiving a participation payment are managed under the
Targeted Compliance Framework, including job seekers who receive
employment services from jobactive, Disability Employment Services (DES)
or ParentsNext providers.

Providers have responsibility for:

-   ensuring that the job seekers compulsory requirements are reasonable
    (achievable) based on their individual circumstances and assessed
    capacity
-   ensuring job seekers are aware of the tools to record attendance at
    requirements, and ensuring job seekers are recording their
    attendance where required or where a job seeker is unable to attend
-   ensuring job seekers know how to record a personal event in their
    calendar and advising them of their responsibilities for doing so to
    prevent the potential for conflicting obligations
-   monitoring compliance with compulsory requirements, recording mutual
    obligation failures and recording potential work refusal or
    unemployment failure
-   notifying reconnection requirements and recording when the job
    seeker complies, or is no longer required to comply with
    reconnection requirements
-   talking with job seekers about their reasons for failing to comply
    and taking action to ensure job seekers who have a valid reason are
    not penalised
-   conducting Capability Interviews where a job seeker accrues either 3
    demerit points in 6 months or is fast tracked to the equivalent
    point

Provider responsibilities in managing compliance using the Job Seeker Compliance Model

Job seekers in remote areas of Australia receive employment services
from Community Development Program (CDP) providers, and are managed
under the Job Seeker Compliance Model.

Providers have responsibility for:

-   negotiating individually tailored Job Plans/Participation Plans and
    ensuring job seekers receive proper notification of compulsory
    requirements
-   ensuring job seekers are aware of their obligations and the
    consequences of non-compliance, including advising payments may stop
    if they fail to comply with their requirements
-   considering whether or not compliance action is required
-   pursuing compliance action by submitting a Non-Attendance Report,
    Provider Appointment Report or a Participation Report to Services
    Australia
-   facilitating job seeker access to Compliance Activities for the
    purpose of waiving all or part of a serious failure penalty

Services Australia responsibilities

The Services Australia system automatically suspends participation
payments when various suspension reports are received from providers.
This includes Non-Compliance Reports, Non-Attendance Reports and
Participation Reports that include a disengagement flag, all of these
reports are accepted through the automatic validation processes.

For job seekers managed under the Targeted Compliance Framework,
Services Australia also have responsibility for:

-   conducting Capability Assessments
-   applying financial penalties where a mutual obligation failure has
    been committed without reasonable excuse while the job seeker is in
    the financial penalty zone
-   determining whether a work refusal failure or unemployment failure
    has been committed
-   cancelling payments following a third mutual obligation failure in
    the financial penalty zone, or following a work refusal failure or
    unemployment failure
-   determining payment start dates following a non-compliance
    preclusions period or unemployment preclusion period

For job seekers managed under the Job Seeker Compliance Model, Services
Australia have responsibility for:

investigating and decision making relating to:

-   connection failures
-   No-Show, No Pay failures
-   non-attendance failures
-   reconnection failures
-   serious failures, and
-   Unemployment Non-Payment Periods (UNPP)

conducting Comprehensive Compliance Assessments (CCA)

calculating and recovering payment penalties, and

determining the eligibility for waiver and hardship provisions for
serious failure periods or UNPPs

Services Australia is also responsible for the review and appeals
process for decisions made under Social Security Legislation for both
compliance systems.
