Reason for an End of Year (EOY) circumstance reviews

End of Year (EOY) processing is used to review and update the study and
living arrangement details for the next calendar year for customers
receiving certain student payments. EOY processing supports transition
of student payments from one study year to the next without the
requirement to submit a new claim form for each new year of study.

Identifying an End of Year (EOY) circumstance review

The EOY process affects ABSTUDY, ABSTUDY Pensioner Education Supplement
(PES), Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) and Pensioner Education
Supplement (PES) students.

As part of EOY processing, some Review activities and Manual Follow-ups
(MFU) may be created on a customer's record to support correct
processing of entitlements into the following year. The following MFUs
are created requiring a manual review of a student's ongoing
entitlement:

-   ABSTUDY Schooling A is current and the applicant is not qualified
    (Group Code 2)
-   the student is receiving Schooling A and will be turning 16 years of
    age in November or December (Group Code 18)
-   the student is receiving Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) as a
    Short Term Boarder or AIC Pensioner Education Supplement (PES)
    (Group Code 19)
-   the student is a boarder and requires update of record with the
    board provider's board charges for the following year (Group Codes 3
    and 5). This MFU matures on 1 February each year

The following Review activities are created which support ongoing
workload management and manual update of ABSTUDY student records if
required:

-   A Future Review activity for an ABSTUDY boarding student (Group
    Codes 3 and 5) to facilitate update of a record with the board
    provider's board charges for the following year (Note: this review
    matures as an MFU on 1 February of each year)
-   A Future Review activity to locate a student in EOY Group Code
    1,4,6,7,8,9,10 and 11) to facilitate any manual updates required for
    an individual or a group of customers

The Resources page contains a table listing the EOY customer groups.
