Purpose of Online Advices (OLAs)

Online Advices (OLAs) are issued manually to PP customers to advise
details of an assessment or to request information needed to assess a
customer's PP entitlement. They can also be used to request information
from third parties needed to assess the customer's entitlement.

Automatically issued PP letters

In most cases, a letter is automatically issued to the customer as a
result of daily processing on a customer's record.

Parenting Payment recipients will receive automatic letters advising
them about their mutual obligation requirements.

If an automatic letter is not generated and the customer must be advised
of the change, a Manual Follow-up (MFU) activity will be created to
prompt a Service Officer to issue a letter manually. Service Officer
must 's'elect the MFU activity to create a manual letter.

Creating and viewing online advices

OLAs can be issued where an automatic letter cannot be generated or is
unavailable or unsuitable and a letter must be manually issued instead.
OLAs can be issued at any time.

Service Officers must use guided procedures to produce commonly used PP
letters.

Letters created in the previous 28 days can be viewed and reissued from
the History Summary (HS) screen.

Older letters can be retrieved through the Advice History (AH) screen in
the Customer Archive Retrieval (CAR) system in the Centrelink system.
