This document outlines why a compensation claim is finalised and whether
it was automatic or manual.

Finalising a compensation claim

A compensation claim can be finalised:

-   automatically by the Compensation Management System (CMS) or
-   manually by the Compensation Recovery Team (CRT)

Staff outside the CRT can view a finalised claim, but they cannot delete
it.

Automatic finalisation

This will occur when processing:

-   a clearance using a certain code
-   a lump sum calculation and there is a nil charge
-   a repaid debt

Manual finalisation

Finalise the claim if:

-   the customer or their solicitor states no further claim for
    compensation can or will be made
-   the compensation payer advises no compensation will be paid and
    their file is closed
-   periodic compensation is ongoing and the customer or their partner
    are not receiving a Compensation Affected Payment (CAP)
-   reasonable action has been taken to get compensation but no claim is
    proceeding
