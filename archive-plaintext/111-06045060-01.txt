[Expand/Collapse all sections]Expand all

This procedure outlines how to view planned, future and past payment
details when the customer's payments are delivered using Customer First
SAP native technology - the term used globally for software designed
specifically for the platform on which it is running (SAP HANA).

System information

In all systems, Centrelink benefit entitlement calculations are
undertaken daily with payments generally delivered fortnightly. For
payments delivered via Customer First SAP native processes, payment
information is available in a different location to payments processed
and issued by legacy systems.

Viewing payments

In Customer First, SAP native payment information is available in 3
separate locations:

-   To view future payments, go to Workspace > Financial Customer Care >
    Open Item List. This will list payments that are queued ready to go
    out
-   To view past or returned payments, go to Workspace, search for
    Payment list and then select Payment List from the Financial
    Customer Care block. The payment amount can be selected to view more
    details
-   Planned Payments can be viewed from within a payment determined
    Social Service Plan (SSP). When reviewing or approving an SSP, the
    Planned Payments screen can be accessed to view the provisional or
    future payments that would be delivered to the customer once the SSP
    is approved
