This document outlines information about how to reinstate an IHI in the
HI Service.

Reinstate IHI requirement

The reinstate IHI process may be performed when a Service Officer
receives confirmation that a date of death has been applied to an IHI
incorrectly. Confirmation can be received by an:

-   individual with the affected record at Service Centres, information
    centre or mail
-   authorised healthcare provider

To reinstate an incorrectly deceased or retired IHI a Service Officer
must remove the date of death from the appropriate IHI.

Note: before processing a reinstate request, the Service Officer must
ensure that the requesting individual is authorised to make the request.

The reinstating of an IHI:

Does not cause a new IHI to be allocated to the record. The original IHI
is retained on the reinstated IHI.

Restores the IHI to its verification status prior to the incorrect
status being applied. For example, an IHI that was previously:

-   verified will be reinstated to a status of verified
-   unverified will be reinstated to a status of unverified
