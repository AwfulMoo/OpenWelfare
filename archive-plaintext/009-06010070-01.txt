This document outlines absences in care when there is more than one
carer for a care receiver who is a higher Adult Disability Assessment
Tool (ADAT) score (80+) adult. The rating is due to the level of care
that is required for the care receiver.

Coding the absence

Each carer is eligible for the full 63 days each of both hospitalisation
care and respite care absences. An absence is for a 24 hour period from
midnight to midnight.

If the care receiver is absent, that absence must be coded against each
carer's allocation of respite or hospitalisation care, on each carer's
record. The absence will either be a one-off absence or a regular
absence.

If only one of the carers is absent, the absence is only coded on the
record of the carer who is absent.

The Resources page contains links to the Services Australia website for
information for carers, and to the My Aged Care website for information
about Commonwealth Respite and Carelink Centres.
