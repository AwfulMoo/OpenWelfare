Fares Allowance (FAA)

ABSTUDY FAA is a payment designed to cover the costs incurred by
students and approved travellers for specified travel between their
permanent home and the place of study.

Mode of transport

The appropriate mode of transport for a journey qualifying for ABSTUDY
FAA is:

-   the most practicable and cost-effective mode of transport for the
    journey, and
-   reasonable in the circumstances

This is normally an economy class rail or bus service that travels the
most direct route from the travel terminal servicing the student's or
approved traveller's permanent home, to the travel terminal servicing
the study location. Additional costs for an indirect route or for
breaking the journey are not included in FAA.

Economy class rail or bus service not available

In circumstances where it is not reasonable or practical for the student
or approved traveller to travel by economy class rail or bus service,
FAA entitlement may be approved for the most cost-effective mode of
transport including:

-   rail fare with sleeping berth
-   economy air fare
-   motor vehicle allowance (where travel by motor vehicle is
    necessary), or
-   the actual cost of chartered transport

Approval of the cost of chartered transport

The cost of chartered transport, including taxis, hire cars, ferries or
helicopters, may be approved in respect of all or part of the journey
where any 1 of the following circumstances apply:

-   there is no public transport or regular air service available
-   the use of regular air service will result in an unreasonable number
    of missed days of school
-   the use of chartered transport for the student/s is cost-effective
-   the use of chartered transport is reasonable in view of the distance
    or terrain

Rate of FAA

The rate of FAA is determined by these provisions irrespective of the
actual mode of transport, or route, used or proposed by the student or
approved traveller.

An Australian Apprentice is not entitled to FAA for the Australian
Apprenticeship.
