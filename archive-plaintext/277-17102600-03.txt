income information at the time a child support assessment is being made,
or did not seek an amended tax assessment in a prompt way in certain
circumstances.

|                                   |     made it difficult for the     |
|                                   |     customer to contact Child     |

|                                   | compared to those of other child  |
|                                   | support customers. For example,   |
|                                   | extreme family breakdown may be   |
|                                   | considered unusual among the      |
|                                   | general Australian population.    |
|                                   | However, it would reasonably be   |
|                                   | considered commonplace for child  |
|                                   | support customers so would be     |
|                                   | unlikely to fit the definition of |

|                                   | circumstances more unusual (such  |
|                                   | as family violence).              |

|                                   | difficult to assess whether they  |

|                                   | their income information at the   |
|                                   | time the relevant assessment was  |
|                                   | made. For example:                |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   |     difficult for them to         |
|                                   |     understand and comply with    |
|                                   |     our requirements, including   |

|                                   | provided their income information |

|                                   | Generally a customer could be     |

|                                   | they have acted as soon as        |
|                                   | possible where their              |
|                                   | circumstances permit. If a        |
|                                   | person’s ability to do something  |
|                                   | is affected due to circumstances  |

|                                   | example, a natural disaster,      |
|                                   | unexpected actions of another     |
|                                   | person, etc.) and they then take  |

|                                   | usually be considered to have     |

|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | instance, may not be in another – |
|                                   | it depends on all of the          |
|                                   | particular circumstances of the   |
|                                   | case. However, where there are no |
|                                   | untoward circumstances affecting  |

|                                   | something, a reasonable period    |
|                                   | would generally be no more than   |
|                                   | 28 days.                          |

|                                   | Example: For incarcerated         |
|                                   | customers this would usually be a |
|                                   | reasonable period after the       |
|                                   | person was released from prison.  |
|                                   | Services Australia may also       |
|                                   | consider whether the customer has |
|                                   | acted within a reasonable period  |
|                                   | after they became aware that an   |
|                                   | assessment had been made or       |
|                                   | gained access to the relevant     |
|                                   | income records, and was able to   |
|                                   | provide their income information. |
|                                   | A person who has been             |
|                                   | incarcerated for several years    |
|                                   | may need more time if they need   |
|                                   | to gather information about       |
|                                   | multiple financial years. Confirm |
|                                   | the period of the customer’s      |
|                                   | incarceration and date of         |
|                                   | release, then consider how long   |
|                                   | it took before they provided the  |
|                                   | information, and whether there    |
|                                   | was a reasonable basis for any    |
|                                   | delay.                            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A customer may have prescribed    |
|                                   | circumstances that do not always  |
|                                   | prevent them from providing their |
|                                   | income information. For example,  |
|                                   | they may be affected by a serious |
|                                   | mental illness for life, which    |
|                                   | affects their ability to manage   |
|                                   | their affairs in a timely way,    |
|                                   | but they still manage to provide  |
|                                   | their income information when     |
|                                   | they are able to. In these        |
|                                   | situations, consider whether the  |
|                                   | customer provided their income    |
|                                   | information as soon as they were  |
|                                   | reasonably able to do so in the   |
|                                   | circumstances.                    |

|                                   | It is not enough for Services     |
|                                   | Australia to become aware of the  |
|                                   | customer’s income information     |
|                                   | from another source; the customer |
|                                   | must take action to provide their |
|                                   | income information to us. This    |
|                                   | may occur before or after         |
|                                   | Services Australia otherwise      |
|                                   | becomes aware of their income.    |
|                                   | For example if Services Australia |

|                                   | from Centrelink or the ATO while  |
|                                   | they are hospitalised, and the    |
|                                   | customer contacts shortly after   |
|                                   | their recovery to confirm their   |
|                                   | income (or they confirm their     |
|                                   | income information during a       |

|                                   | this is sufficient to satisfy     |

amended tax assessment can be retrospectively applied to their child
support assessment due to special circumstances.

| 1                                 | Consider whether the customer was |

|                                   | factor is that the circumstances  |
