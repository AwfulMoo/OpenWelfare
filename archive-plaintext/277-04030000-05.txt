|                                   | The Child Support (Registration   |
|                                   | and Collection) Act 1988 does not |
|                                   | have a regulation similar to      |
|                                   | section 23 of the Child Support   |
|                                   | (Assessment) Regulations 2018     |
|                                   | which states that an application  |
|                                   | for an assessment or agreement is |
|                                   | to be taken to have been made on  |

|                                   | is received.                      |

|                                   | However, the Child Support        |

|                                   | 1988 does state that a liability  |

|                                   | later than 60 days after the day  |
|                                   | on which the Registrar receives   |
|                                   | the application. See Section      |

|                                   | with the start dates of certain   |
|                                   | elections under section 23 of the |
|                                   | Child Support (Assessment)        |
|                                   | Regulations 2018 (that is,        |

|                                   | made that the start date for AFC  |
|                                   | forms would be the date they are  |

| 2                                 | Question: How does Child Support  |
|                                   | take into account a payment made  |
|                                   | to the payee or a third party     |
|                                   | during the arrears period         |
|                                   | (determined after the processing  |
|                                   | of the AFC)?                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: Payments made to the      |
|                                   | payee and/or third parties        |
|                                   | during, or specifically for, the  |
|                                   | private collect period should     |
|                                   | have been discussed in            |
|                                   | conversations held with the       |
|                                   | customers and taken into account  |
|                                   | in determining the amount of      |
|                                   | unpaid child support, that is     |
|                                   | Opt-in arrears.                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If payments for the period prior  |
|                                   | to the case being made collect    |
|                                   | are discovered after processing   |
|                                   | the application, the customers    |
|                                   | must be advised of their right to |
|                                   | object to the calculation of the  |
|                                   | Opt-in arrears amount. If         |
|                                   | appropriate, also advise the      |
|                                   | customer of the right to apply    |
|                                   | for an extension of time to       |
|                                   | object.                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Note: these payments are not      |
|                                   | considered NAPs as they were not  |
|                                   | made in a collect period. The     |
|                                   | customers' agreements about the   |
|                                   | payments are still important      |
|                                   | however. For example, if a payee  |
|                                   | applies for collection because    |
|                                   | the payer paid part of the        |
|                                   | monthly liability to a third      |
|                                   | party rather than in cash to the  |
|                                   | payee, the AFC may appear         |
|                                   | reasonable. However if the        |
|                                   | payments had been made in exactly |
|                                   | the same way for the previous 12  |
|                                   | months, this could indicate that  |
|                                   | they had agreed that child        |
|                                   | support should be paid this way   |
|                                   | despite the parent's current      |
|                                   | claims. These types of payment    |
|                                   | should not be recorded on the     |
|                                   | NAPs screen. They should be       |
|                                   | included in the calculation of    |
|                                   | opt in arrears.                   |

|                                   | or adjust opt-in arrears?         |
|                                   |                                   |

| 4                                 | Question: What happens with       |
|                                   | retrospective variations which    |
|                                   | cover opt-in arrears periods?     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: A retrospective variation |
|                                   | may increase or reduce the        |
|                                   | liability for the private collect |
|                                   | period. If the payee has          |
|                                   | previously requested that opt in  |
|                                   | arrears be collected, Cuba will   |
|                                   | auto-adjust the opt-in arrears    |
|                                   | amount if the Opt In was          |
|                                   | processed in Cuba. If the Opt In  |
|                                   | was processed in the previous     |
|                                   | mainframe system, an Opt In       |
|                                   | Arrears intray item will be       |
|                                   | generated advising that the Opt   |
|                                   | In arrears needs adjustment.      |

|                                   | payee lodged the AFC but a        |
|                                   | retrospective variation to the    |
|                                   | liability occurs, this could      |
|                                   | possibly result in unpaid amounts |

|                                   | period. If so, the payee may      |

Automated Message – Application for child support to be collected

When selected from the Services Australia Workspace, customers will be
played the automated message:

You’ve asked us commence collecting child support on your behalf. This
means you understand:

-   we can only disburse child support after it has been received
-   while child support is paid as soon possible, we cannot guarantee
    when you will receive payments as there may be factors which affect
    this
-   the other parent's due dates for payment can vary if we have made
    arrangements to receive payments more frequently, or with the help
    of an employer or third party
-   you will receive your child support payments into the bank account
    you have nominated. Electronic funds transfer is the fastest, most
    reliable and secure way to disburse these payments to you
