Direct debts

To create ‘Rule set’, ‘Cohort’ and ‘Campaign’, access the following
roles in PROD (apply through ESSentials):

-   ZC.C4.TREATMENT.PATH.OFFICER
-   ZC.C4.TREATMENT.PATH.VIEW

Access requirements for updating RDF tables

Access is requested via ISP, which will highlight a step-by-step process
of gaining access. Staff must state the specific table or cluster (first
3 characters of an online table) when requesting online table access.

Apply for access to the following mainframe resources via the ICT
security portal:

-   RDFENQ - RDF ENQUIRY
-   RDFTAB - RDF TABLE SCREEN
-   RDFNAT - RDF NATIONAL ACCESS FOR SELECTED APPLICATIONS

RDF table for DMN.EMG.Postcodes

To apply a write off, the EMG table requires a status change (such as a
debt becoming determined or a customer circumstance changing). Manual
bulk-write offs must be applied to remaining customers within identified
disaster areas where auto processes were blocked. For example, where
there is no change to a status of a debt (where a customer already has a
debt written off to an earlier date than the new disaster end date).

Note: postcode exclusions are often extended past the original end date.
Update the RDF table when this occurs.

RDF table for DMN.Debt.Recovery.Pause

When the Pause.Enabled field has the value of:

-   ‘Y’, the Situational Hardship debt pause functionality is ‘on’, with
    the corresponding automatic write off (AWO) functionality ‘OFF’ –
    DMNAWO is not invoked
-   ‘N’, the Situational Hardship debt pause functionality is ‘off’.
    DMIS invokes the corresponding automatic write off (AWO) processing
    – DMNAWO to undertake the debt pause write off

The banner message in MYO will change depending on the Pause.Enabled
choice.
