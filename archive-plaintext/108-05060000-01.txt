Definition of an income stream

An income stream:

-   is a regular series of payments
-   may be made for as long as the customer's (or their partner's) life
    or for a fixed term
-   may be purchased with a lump sum or made directly from accumulated
    superannuation contributions

Assessing the asset value of the income stream

There are four broad assessment categories for income streams.

Asset-test exempt (ATE)

The type of income stream and its commencement date are important in
determining asset test exemption.

Defined benefit income streams will be 100% asset test exempt regardless
of the commencement date.

Other income streams which meet the characteristics as set out in
section 9A, 9B or 9BA of the Social Security Act 1991 are asset test
exempt. If the income stream was purchased:

before 20 September 2004 it will continue to be 100% asset test exempt

from 20 September 2004 and before 20 September 2007 and it meets the
characteristics for assets test exemption, it will be 50% asset-test
exempt

on or after 20 September 2007, it is fully asset tested. Exceptions
apply:

-   some lifetime and life expectancy ATE income streams can retain a
    100% or 50% asset test exemption (whichever is applicable), and
    market-linked ATE income streams can retain their 50% asset test
    exemption
-   IF the original ATE income stream was purchased prior to 20
    September 2007, and is commuted and rolled over on or after 20
    September 2007 into new ATE income streams which meets certain
    conditions. The References page contains more information on
    eligibility criteria and conditions

Asset-tested (long term)

The term is

-   more than 5 years, or
-   less than 5 years only if the term is equal to or greater than the
    customer's life expectancy at the time of purchase

This category also includes lifetime income streams with a purchase date
prior to 1 July 2019.

Asset-tested (short term)

The term is 5 years or less. This income stream category is deemed under
the income test.

Asset-tested (lifetime)

This category includes lifetime income streams with a purchase date on
or after 1 July 2019.

Income stream types

The names and features of some income streams are similar. It is
important to identify the income stream correctly because they may be
assessed differently.

Types of income streams include:

Account-based income stream:

-   also known as Allocated pension or account-based pension
-   product type code AIS
-   codes ALA and ALP can no longer be used to add new products.
    Existing current products with that code can be updated

Market linked income stream

-   also known as Term Allocated Pension
-   product type code MLI
-   take care not to confuse it with an allocated pension, an account
    based income stream or a life expectancy income stream

Lifetime income stream

-   product type code LIS (purchased prior to 1 July 2019)
-   codes ANL, ARL, ARP, can no longer be used to add new products.
    Existing current products with those codes can be updated
-   take care not to confuse it with a defined benefit income stream or
    a life expectancy income stream

Life Expectancy income stream

-   product type code LIE
-   codes ANN, ARS, ART can no longer be used to add new products.
    Existing current products can be updated
-   take care not to confuse it with a term income stream or a
    market-linked income stream

Term income stream

-   product type code TIS
-   codes ANN, ARS, ART can no longer be used to add new products.
    Existing current products can be updated
-   take care not to confuse it with a life expectancy income stream
-   this is not a complying income stream and will be fully asset tested

Defined benefit income stream

-   product type code DEF
-   code OTD cannot be used to add or update existing products. The
    product must be cancelled and re-coded

Pooled lifetime income streams

-   product type code LPS (purchased using superannuation money)
-   product type code LPO (purchased using non superannuation money)
-   purchased on or after 1 July 2019

Income stream schedule

The income stream provider must provide details of the income stream on
a Details of Income Stream product (SA330) or a similar schedule.

If an income stream is from a Self Managed Superannuation Fund (SMSF) or
Small APRA Superannuation Fund (SAF):

-   the form should be completed by the trustee of the fund (generally
    the customer for an SMSF)
-   the trustee may receive assistance from their accountant or
    financial adviser, however, an income stream schedule completed by a
    financial advisor must not be accepted
-   some SMSFs may have a retail provider such as AMP, MLC, etc. as
    their administrator who may complete the form

Overseas income streams

Overseas income streams:

-   are not assessed under income stream rules
-   do not meet the definition of an income stream under section 9(1) of
    the Social Security Act
-   are assessed as foreign income and assets and recorded on the
    Foreign Income/ Asset Detail (FID) screen
