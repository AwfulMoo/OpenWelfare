This document assists National Business Gateway Income Management
processing staff with assessing and completing a deduction transition
from the Rent Deduction Scheme (RDS) to Income Management.

Identifying an RDS Rent Instruction

When a new RDS instruction is received from a Housing Authority (HA),
the amount is deducted from the customer's discretionary funds by
default, not their income managed funds.

When the HA commences a new rent deduction for an Income Managed
customer, a new Income Management Work Item will appear on the
customer’s record. Rent deductions submitted under a different service
reason are not included in this Work Item, but are provided to National
Business Gateway staff in a weekly report by the Deduction and
Confirmation Branch .

Debiting a customer's account

Identified deductions must be assessed by the National Business Gateway
staff and where possible, change the deduction to Income Management.

-   Where there is evidence the customer has indicated they want their
    RDS deduction to come from their discretionary funds and not paid
    from Income Management, the deduction will not be transitioned
-   Work Items generated for Northern Territory Housing should be
    cancelled, as these requests are managed using a separate process,
    specific to Northern Territory Housing
-   Customers income managed under the Child Protection or Vulnerable
    measures must be referred to the relevant Income Management Contact
    Officer for that area rather than transitioned

Unrestricted Cash Payments for hardship

If the customer's rent has been paid from their discretionary funds, and
they wish to convert the payment to their Income Management funds, and
the customer is in hardship as a result of having no or little
discretionary funds, then the customer may be offered an Unrestricted
Cash Payment.
