This document outlines how to determine if a customer is considered to
be a homeowner when their principal residence is owned by a private
trust or company. This document also helps determine if the house is an
exempt asset.

Determining home ownership

Where a customer occupies a house owned by a private trust or private
company, the decision on whether that customer is a homeowner or not
depends on whether it can be concluded that the person has a right or
interest in their accommodation which provides them with reasonable
security of tenure.

A Special Disability Trust (SDT) may own real estate that is the
principal beneficiary's home. It is not necessary to determine if the
principal beneficiary is a homeowner for a SDT. The assessing home and
curtilage is an exempt asset.

Relevant factors determining home ownership

A customer may be considered a homeowner even if they are not an
attributable stakeholder of the trust.

Factors that are relevant to the determination of the home ownership
status of the customer include:

-   the involvement of the customer in the company, for example,
    director, shareholder, contributor
-   the involvement of the customer in the trust, for example,
    appointor, trustee, beneficiary, contributor
-   the terms of the Constitution (or Memorandum and Articles of
    Association) or Trust deed in relation to the property, for example,
    are there any restrictions on the use or disposal of the property
-   the relationship of the customer to the company director(s), for
    example, the extent the customer can influence the director(s) to
    allow uninterrupted occupancy of the company property
-   the relationship of the customer to the trust appointors and
    trustees, for example, the extent the customer can influence that
    trust appointor to allow uninterrupted occupancy of the trust
    property
-   the period the house has been occupied by the customer as their home
-   whether the house was transferred to the trust or company by the
    customer or the customer provided the funds to the trust or company
    for the purchase of the home
-   the period of time the house was the customer's home before
    ownership was transferred to the trust or company
-   whether there is a written agreement setting out the basis on which
    the customer occupies the house as his/her home
-   the customer's intentions as to the period he/she intends to remain
    in the house

Exempt asset

A customer who owns shares in a company title property which gives the
customer a right to occupy a unit, is a homeowner. If the right to
occupy the unit is the only entitlement that the shares hold and the
unit is the customer's principal home, then the shares are an exempt
asset.

An adjustment to the assets of a private trust or private company is
only necessary where the customer is a full or part controller and the
private trust or private company owns the principal home of the
controller.

If the customer is not to be regarded as a controller, no adjustment to
the company or trust balance sheet is necessary as the principal home is
not to be considered as an exempt asset.
