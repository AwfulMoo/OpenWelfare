This document outlines how staff view and manage their work.

Using Work Optimiser

Work Optimiser enables staff to:

-   view and manage work assigned to them
-   view a daily summary of personal Workload Management (WLM) activity.
    This includes allocated, completed and held work items
-   create Relationship Profiles, and view Temporary Work Groups they
    belong to

For how to use PaNDA search and Document Upload, see Processing and
National Demand Allocation (PaNDA).

See also Work Optimiser for Team Leaders and Analysts.

Access to these functions depends on security roles assigned in
ESSentials.

The Resources page has WLM information and support, contact details, and
intranet links. It also has descriptions of buttons, icons found on the
Worklist screen.
