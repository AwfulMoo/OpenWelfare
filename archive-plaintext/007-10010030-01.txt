This document outlines the assessment codes for annual Single Income
Family Supplement (SIFS) standalone claims. SIFS is also paid
automatically to Family Tax Benefit (FTB) customers during FTB
reconciliation or lump claim assessment, as part of their FTB.

Processing SIFS claims

SIFS claims are processed as FTB lump sum claim (FTB LSC) activities,
but only SIFS entitlement is assessed within the activity.

SIFS entitlement is assessed against the customer's circumstances for
the assessment year (2012-13 onwards).

Specific codes are used when a decision is recorded on a customer's
record to assess their claim. A description of the code is used in
correspondence with customers when explaining why SIFS has not been paid
for all or part of the assessment year.

Reviews and appeals

Customers can request a review of the decision to reject SIFS or the
amount paid. SIFS is paid under family assistance law.

The Resources page contains a list of cancellation, not effective and
rejection codes for SIFS standalone claims.
