This document outlines the process for the selection or allocation of a
Workforce Australia provider for a job seeker.

Workforce Australia provider referrals

When a job seeker registration is completed, eligible job seekers will
be referred to Workforce Australia Online for individuals (unless
already connected to a Workforce Australia provider) to access the
assistance available through Workforce Australia. The Department of
Employment and Workplace Relations may determine that a provider is more
suitable for the job seeker and refer them onto the provider at
commencement. The job seeker will remain with online or provider:

-   for the duration of their unemployment
-   Workforce Australia Online deem a provider is more suitable
-   until the Workforce Australia provider no longer has a contract, or
-   they reach the maximum time they are allowed with Workforce
    Australia Online or one Workforce Australia provider

Job seekers referred to Workforce Australia Online will remain with the
online service until the Department of Employment and Workplace
Relations deem it appropriate to refer them to a Workforce Australia
provider.

This procedure covers the selection or allocation part of the referral
process.

The Workforce Australia referral process is not complete until the
initial appointment is booked with the provider or they have been
selected for online employment services.

In cases where a job seeker has not been referred to Workforce Australia
Online, referral to a provider must be done on the day the Participation
Interview is conducted and the provider appointment booked within 2
working days, unless the customer is exempt from the process. Where
there are no appointments within 2 workings days, an appointment must be
made as soon as possible within 14 days.

Job seekers participating in the online employment service are not
required to attend a RapidConnect appointment with a provider. Instead,
they will meet their RapidConnect obligation by agreeing to their Job
Plan online.

RapidConnect

Eligible job seekers will be identified as RapidConnect job seekers
during the Participation Interview. All customers claiming JobSeeker
Payment (JSP) or Youth Allowance (YA) (job seekers) will be subject to
RapidConnect conditions, unless they meet one of the exemption reasons.

It is mandatory for all Service Officers to run the Participation
Interview for any job seeker who is claiming JSP or YA (job seeker).

Currently, Parenting Payment (PP) customers with mutual obligation
requirements are not subject to RapidConnect payability conditions.
However, they are required to be referred to Workforce Australia and
have the initial appointment booked.

PP customers without mutual obligation requirements are not required to
be referred to Workforce Australia, but they can volunteer to do so.

Workforce Australia Employment Services Provider referrals and other programs

If a customer is potentially suitable for other programs, this will be
identified during the Participation Interview or subsequent interview
for job seekers who are eligible to be registered as Fully Eligible
Participants (FEPs) or Job Seeker Registration Only (JSRO) when the Job
Seeker Snapshot is conducted.

If the job seeker is eligible for, and assessed as suitable for,
Disability Employment Services (DES) or Australian Disability
Enterprises (ADE), referral to Workforce Australia is not required at
this time. All job seekers registering for employment services are
referred to a provider. Incapacitated job seekers, whose incapacity end
date is more than 6 weeks in the future, cannot be referred to Workforce
Australia.

Details of deferred referral can be viewed via the Participation Summary
screen.

Note: Job seekers identified as eligible for Workforce Australia -
Transition to Work (TtW) must not be referred to Workforce Australia
Provider Services. Where available, TtW referrals have priority over
Workforce Australia Provider Services. If TtW is available and offered
in the Online Diary, job seekers must be referred and should not be
referred to Workforce Australia Provider Services. However, job seekers
can insist on a referral to Workforce Australia Provider Services.

Voluntary referral to Workforce Australia

A Volunteer registration may be offered when a job seeker meets the
eligibility criteria for registration as a Volunteer.

For details, refer to Eligibility for Employment Services as a
volunteer.

Provider referral at the end of deferred referral or exemption period

If the customer has a deferred referral or is exempt, a letter is sent
asking the job seeker to contact the agency at the end of the deferred
referral or mutual obligation requirements exemption period, to arrange
referral to a provider. If the job seeker does not respond to the
letter, the system will attempt to book an appointment with Services
Australia to discuss a referral to a provider. A manual follow up
activity will be created on the customer's record if the system cannot
auto book an appointment. Service Officers should contact job seekers
with these manual follow-up activities to make the provider referral.

Allowable break and re-registration with Workforce Australia, including Workforce Australia Online for Individuals

The duration of the allowable break for job seekers is 13 weeks.

If a job seeker is re-registering, the time between the date of
inactivation and the date they contact to re-register can affect the
referral process:

-   If a job seeker re-registers within the allowable break, up to 13
    weeks, the initial registration date will be retained. They will be
    reconnected to the same provider that they were attending prior to
    the inactivation of the registration. Services Australia does not
    have to book an appointment with the provider and the job seeker
    will have continued access
-   For job seekers re-registering more than 13 weeks after the date of
    inactivation, a new registration date is recorded and the job seeker
    must go through the entire registration and referral process

Change of address and Workforce Australia

If a job seeker has moved to a new location and their provider services
in the new area, they will be allocated to the same provider in their
new area.

If the original provider does not service the new area, the job seeker
will be randomly allocated a new provider.

When a job seeker moves to a Department of Employment and Workplace
Relations designated remote area, they are referred to a Community
Development Program (CDP) provider.

If the job seeker has moved to a new area, but remains linked to their
previous provider, further investigation is required.

For further details, see Job seeker change of address.

Job seekers already connected to Workforce Australia claiming for JSP/YA (job seeker)

A job seeker will not require a Workforce Australia appointment upon
claiming for income support payment and will be automatically exempt
from RapidConnect. This applies when a job seeker is claiming for JSP or
YA and they are:

-   registered as an active job seeker
-   connected to Workforce Australia, and
-   current in or suspended from Employment Provider Services

An existing volunteer job seeker who is now claiming JSP or YA will have
their registration change to Fully Eligible Participant (FEP). These job
seekers are assessed under the RapidConnect provision and will need to
have a RapidConnect appointment booked with their provider.

Errors with Workforce Australia Employment Services Provider selection and appointments

If a selection and appointment is created in error, it cannot be changed
by Services Australia.

If the wrong provider was selected by the Service Officer, they must
advise the job seeker to contact their provider or the Department of
Employment and Workplace Relations National Customer Service Line (NCSL)
for job seekers. See the Resources page for a link to the website and
useful contact information containing contact phone numbers.

Community Development Program (CDP)

There is only one CDP provider per remote area, job seekers in these
areas will not have a choice of providers.

The Resources page contains links to the contact details and website for
the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations and a list of
reasons for choosing a provider with no immediate appointments.
