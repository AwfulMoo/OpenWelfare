|                                   | Services Australia will permit a  |

|                                   | adjustment is required to support |
|                                   | a person with disability. For     |
|                                   | example a customer who is deaf,   |

|                                   | Generally, reasonable adjustment  |
|                                   | should be made if stopping the    |
|                                   | recording would cause an          |

|                                   | In all cases, consider why the    |

|                                   | requirements, the nature of the   |
|                                   | person's circumstances (for       |
|                                   | example, disability) and the      |
|                                   | impact of not recording the       |
|                                   | interaction must be significant   |

|                                   | important that the location of    |
