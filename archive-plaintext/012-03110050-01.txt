This document outlines how to restructure a Healthcare Provider
Identifier - Organisation (HPI-O) that has been bought by another
organisation.

Reasons for organisation restructures

There are 2 reasons why organisations would be restructured:

1.  A seed or network organisation are bought out by another
    organisation. If this happens, the seed or network organisation plus
    some or all of its hierarchy can be transferred into the other seed
    organisation’s hierarchy. If a network organisation is bought out by
    another organisation, it can also become a seed organisation in its
    own right.
2.  When a company has a restructure and seeds and networks move around
    in their organisation hierarchy. For examples, see Seed becomes a
    network of another seed or network moves to a different hierarchy in
