This document outlines general information about Workload Management
(WLM).

WLM functionality

WLM is the functionality used by a suite of systems to create,
prioritise and allocate work items to staff.

WLM ensures the right work is delivered to the right person at the right
time.

WLM also provides near real-time and historical reporting.

The WLM systems include:

-   Customer First, Process Direct and Pluto, used by staff to allocate
    and complete work
-   Work Optimiser, used by staff to manage and monitor workload for
    themselves and/or their teams. It is also used by workload managers
    and analysts to monitor and prioritise workloads across the agency

The Resources page contains access roles, work item status definitions
and reallocation reasons. It also has intranet links for more
information and support.
