|                                   | Alex is studying an Australian    |
|                                   | course full time. As part of this |
|                                   | course, Alex is required to       |
|                                   | complete a unit lasting 10 weeks  |
|                                   | in the USA from 1 August. Once    |
|                                   | the course is completed, Alex     |
|                                   | will remain in the US for a       |
|                                   | further 3 weeks to tour the local |
|                                   | area. Alex is leaving Australia   |
|                                   | on 29 July.                       |

|                                   | Generally, it is reasonable to    |
|                                   | allow additional travel time      |
|                                   | either before and/or after the    |
|                                   | study period to travel and set up |
|                                   | or pack up. The 3 days prior to   |
|                                   | the course start date can be      |
|                                   | included in the approved          |
|                                   | portability period; however as    |
|                                   | Alex is having a holiday after    |
|                                   | the course there is no allowance  |
|                                   | for additional travel time. In    |
|                                   | this case, the start date of      |
|                                   | approved portability is the       |
