|                                   | Beverley advises that a           |
|                                   | court-registered parenting plan,  |
|                                   | made two years ago, is in place   |

|                                   | parents. However, the child, Tim, |
|                                   | aged 4, was supposed to have been |
|                                   | returned on the weekend by the    |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | An assessment is currently based  |
|                                   | on parent A having 0% care and    |
|                                   | parent B having 100% care. Parent |
|                                   | A contacts Child Support and      |
|                                   | advises the care has changed and  |
|                                   | they now have 183 nights a year   |
|                                   | (with parent B having 182         |
|                                   | nights). The Service Officer      |
|                                   | contacts parent B and although    |
|                                   | they agree the care has changed,  |
|                                   | they advise they still have 265   |
|                                   | nights a year and parent A only   |
|                                   | has 100 nights per year. Neither  |
|                                   | parent can provide any            |
|                                   | documentary evidence to support   |
|                                   | their claims about the level of   |
|                                   | care. However, each parent agrees |
|                                   | that:                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   parent A has at least 100     |
|                                   |     nights of care per year       |
|                                   | -   parent B has at least 182     |
|                                   |     nights of care per year       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Based on the verbal information   |
|                                   | each parent provides about the    |
|                                   | pattern of care (such as why each |
|                                   | parent believes they will have    |
|                                   | the level of care they claim) and |
|                                   | relevant information on Cuba (for |
|                                   | example, work/study patterns of   |
|                                   | each parent), the Service Officer |
|                                   | makes a decision that the most    |
|                                   | likely care for each parent is:   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   120 nights for parent A       |
|                                   | -   245 nights for parent B       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The Service Officer determines    |
|                                   | that parent A has 32% care and    |
|                                   | parent B has 68% care, based on   |
|                                   | parent A having care for 120      |
|                                   | nights and parent B having 245    |
|                                   | nights of care                    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This is not a ‘point of           |
|                                   | agreement’ decision. Decisions    |
|                                   | must be based on what is most     |
|                                   | likely to occur based on the      |
|                                   | information provided by both      |
|                                   | parents. This type of decision    |
|                                   | must be discussed with the        |
|                                   | customers.                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Note: as this remains a decision  |
|                                   | based on the actual care          |
|                                   | occurring, record this decision   |
|                                   | under Actual care.                |
