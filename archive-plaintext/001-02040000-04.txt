Legislation

There is no legislative requirement for a customer to be registered as
unemployed. The Business Partnership Arrangement with the Department of
Employment and Workplace Relations outlines the requirement.

Services Australia deliver payments and services on behalf of other
government agencies. A range of bilateral agreements and Bilateral
Management Arrangements (BMA) governs our relationships with those
agencies.

For more information, contact the Services Australia relationships
teams.
