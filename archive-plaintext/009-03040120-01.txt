This document outlines the reasons a claim for CA may be rejected and
the actions to process the claim.

Reasons for rejecting a CA claim

Carers who lodge a claim for CA may not be eligible because they:

-   do not meet the basic qualifications or payability for CA, or
-   have lodged an inappropriate or incorrect claim

In almost of these circumstances, the claim is rejected.

Voluntary withdrawal of a CA claim

Sometimes, a carer may withdraw their claim voluntarily. Withdrawn claim
are not rejected as they are deemed to never have never been made. If
the carer withdraws their claim, the claim is to be made not required.

Automatic and manual coding when rejecting a CA claim

When making a decision to reject a claim, the system uses information
provided by the carer. While many rejections are automatic based on
claim details recorded, other rejections need to be coded manually. For
example, the care and dependency requirements may not be met (CRM), or
for failing to reply to correspondence (FRC).

Code all information provided by the carer for their claim. This allows
the system to use the most appropriate rejection reason. This removes
the need to manually reject the claim FRC.

When manually rejecting a CA claim an advice may not automatically
issue. In this circumstance, send a manual advice to the carer to:

-   explain the rejection, and
-   advise the steps in the review of decision process.

Relevant date

When rejecting a claim, the relevant date will be the date the claim was
lodged.

Note: different processes apply for carers in vulnerable circumstances.

Rejecting a CA claim for a residence related reason

A carer whose claim is rejected for a residence related reason may have
the claim rejected based on information they have provided on their
claim.

Visa, citizenship and movement information provided directly from the
Department of Home Affairs datalink may cause the claim to be rejected.
The information provided by the Department of Home Affairs datalink
always takes precedence over any conflicting information provided by the
carer.

Rejecting a CA claim – Failed to reply to correspondence (FRC)

Documents can be requested again with the claim placed on hold for 14
days when:

-   a claim has been submitted, and
-   documents lodged are not relevant to the claim
-   but the carer believed they were lodging the correct information

For requests sent by Australia Post, a reasonable time to comply is 22
days (14 days plus an extra 8) from the date of the original notice.

If a claim is submitted under an exception category, it cannot be
rejected until 22 days has been reached. If the claim presents via WLM
and 22 days has not been reached, hold the claim until day 22 before
rejecting it.

The claim can be rejected at any time when:

-   documents lodged are inappropriate or not relevant to the claim
-   the claim has not been lodged under an exception category
-   the carer has failed to respond to a request for information
