Treatment specifics

Treatment cycles

A treatment cycle commences when the authority application for the first
PBS-subsidised biological medicine is approved for a given patient under
the ‘Initial 1’ treatment phase. The treatment cycle continues until a
fourth biological medicine fails to provide the patient with an adequate
response. A new treatment cycle begins each time PBS subsidy is obtained
through the ‘Initial 3’ treatment phase.

Treatment failures and breaks

-   Within the same treatment cycle, a patient cannot trial and fail, or
    cease to respond to, the same PBS-subsidised biological medicine
    more than once
-   Once a patient has either failed or ceased to respond to treatment 4
    times (once with each of the 4 biological medicines), they are
    deemed to have completed a treatment cycle. They must have a minimum
    5 year break in PBS-subsidised biological medicine therapy before
    they are eligible to commence the next cycle
-   There is no limit to the number of treatment cycles a patient may
    undertake in their lifetime
