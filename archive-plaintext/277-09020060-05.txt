Locating the correct source of issue

When finalising a complaint select a source of issue in Cuba. This
should reflect the business area, product, policy, individual or service
that lead to the complaint reasons. Often there are multiple sources –
select the 1 that most contributed to the complaint. This is not an
indication of whether a complaint is upheld or not, it just reflects the
triggers for normal complaints. This helps Services Australia understand
our customer’s feedback.

The accurate identification of source of issue when finalising
complaints, allows the agency to understand what leads to customer
complaints. Source of issue needs to include Cuba details including
Region / Office / Stream – Team and Position. Note: the source should
only be allocated to an individual staff position when you have
confirmation from both the customer and through your review that this is
main contributor to the complaint. If the complaint source was not an
individual service officer, choose a Cuba position that is not an
individual, that is a ‘none’ pool or allocation position in a team.

If the source of issue is unclear, take the following steps to identify
the source:

-   check the customer transfer history
-   check RAS for any actions or notes on intrays
-   if it is about a staff member but that has moved business lines,
    contact the Service Officer's current Team Leader to discuss where
    the staff member was located when the reason for the complaint
    occurred
-   check notepads for signature blocks and user identification numbers
-   use Microsoft Teams or Outlook to determine which team or business
    line someone works in and their manager's details
