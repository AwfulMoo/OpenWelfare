This document outlines provider registration measures for the
coronavirus (COVID-19) response.

Ahpra pandemic response sub-registers

The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra) created a
pandemic response sub-register in response to coronavirus (COVID-19).
There are now 2 pandemic response sub-registers:

-   2020 pandemic response sub-register was established in April 2020 in
    response to COVID-19 to fast track the return of experienced and
    qualified health practitioners to the workforce. Practitioners on
    the 2020 sub-register have registration limited to practice for the
    COVID-19 response and their registration expired on 5 April 2022
-   2021 pandemic response sub-register was established in September
    2021 to provide additional surge workforce to support the changed
    COVID-19 response. Practitioners on the 2021 sub-register can
    practise to the full scope of their registration, which expires on
    21 September 2022, subject to any notations

During the COVID-19 pandemic up to and including 5 April 2022 Health
professionals on the pandemic response sub-register include:

from 6 April 2020:

-   medical practitioners
-   nurses
-   midwives, and
-   pharmacists

from 20 April 2020:

-   physiotherapists
-   psychologists, and
-   radiographers

from 22 September 2021:

-   Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Practitioners
-   dental practitioners
-   medical practitioners
-   midwives
-   nurse practitioners
-   occupational Therapists
-   optometrists
-   physiotherapists
-   podiatrists
-   psychologists
-   health professionals who extended their registration on the pandemic
    sub-register in April 2021

It was expected the majority of health professionals on the Ahpra
pandemic response sub-register:

-   would return to public health jurisdictions, not private
-   are unlikely to have accessed Medicare Benefit Schedule (MBS) items
-   would have their registration lines updated in the Provider
    Directory System (PDS). This did not open up any closed specialty
    codes such as 130, 132 and 532
-   would have had the same Medicare access they held before retiring or
    becoming non-practicing unless they were Continuing Professional
    Development (CPD) non-compliant

Eligibility

Ahpra returned to the sub-register health professionals who:

-   held general or specialist registration in the past 3 years and hold
    an Australian address
-   have not had their registration with Ahpra cancelled or suspended in
    the last 3 years
-   have no outstanding complaints or sanctions, and
-   are not the subject of conduct, performance or health notification
    at the time they were removed from the register

Health professionals were added to the sub-register automatically. The
Provider Directory System (PDS) updated the Registration lines via the
Ahpra data feed.

    about the sub-register

Coronavirus (COVID-19) respiratory clinics

Private practice respiratory clinics have been established to provide
dedicated services to people with mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms.

These Commonwealth-approved COVID-19 respiratory clinics have been
established at existing medical practices:

-   which meet a clear criteria
-   have the necessary infrastructure, and
-   have sufficient existing staff to assess, test and diagnose
    respiratory cases, including COVID-19

These clinics are:

-   located in urban, regional and rural settings
-   not claiming MBS items, but paid per patient seen and via direct
    payment by the Australian Government

Health professionals with an existing provider number at the medical
practice do not require another provider number to be created and may
use it at the respiratory clinic for refer and request purposes only.

See the Resources page for the list of approved COVID-19 respiratory
clinics.

Provider numbers for BMP and MRBS at approved COVID-19 respiratory clinics

The Department of Health and Aged Care (Health) introduced measures to
ensure Bonded Medical Program (BMP) and Medical Rural Bonded Scholars
(MRBS) participants can support approved COVID-19 respiratory clinics
whilst meeting their contractual obligations with Health.

Refer and request provider numbers for approved respiratory clinics can
now be issued for:

-   BMP scholars who have started their return of service period
-   MRBS who have started their return of service period and have
    approval from Health

Provider numbers can be issued if a health professional:

-   asks for a refer and request provider number, and
-   the requested location is an approved COVID-19 respiratory clinic,
    and
-   they are subject to return of service conditions

See the Process page for how to issue provider numbers for BMP and MRBS.

Provider numbers for COVID-19 pandemic mandatory isolation hotels

To enable medical practitioners to work in COVID-19 mandatory isolation
hotels, a new provider number is not needed unless they are:

-   subject to Section 19AB of the Health Insurance Act 1973 (the Act),
    and/or
-   going to be working in the hotel for more than 2 weeks

The medical practitioner must apply for a new provider number if needed.
The access granted will be for refer and request purposes only.

Further information

-   Health services provided are not billed to Medicare as they are
    billed under arrangement with the relevant State Health department
-   A provider number will only be needed to write scripts or refer and
    request purposes
-   Unrestricted medical practitioners can use an existing provider
    number for up to 2 weeks under the standard locum tenens
    arrangement. This applies at all hotels with COVID-19 pandemic
    isolation patients
-   Restricted medical practitioners under Section 19AB should apply for
    a refer and request provider number using the locum recruitment
    company’s business address

Provider numbers for COVID-19 vaccination centres

Health professionals working in respiratory clinic locations whilst
providing COVID-19 vaccinations are eligible for a provider number for
referring and requesting purposes only.

Additional provider numbers are not to be issued for health
professionals administering COVID-19 vaccinations from a respiratory
clinic.

Health professionals providing COVID-19 vaccinations may already have a
provider number for referring and requesting purposes whilst practicing
at a COVID-19 respiratory clinic. Regardless of COVID-19 vaccination
services provided at these locations, health professionals are not
eligible to access Medicare benefits or an additional provider number.

If a health professional is practicing in a COVID-19 respiratory clinic
and providing COVID-19 vaccinations, Provider Registration Service
Officers:

-   Must not remove 618 service rules
-   Must not create an additional location for the same practice at the
    same street address

If a health professional is practicing in a general practice medical
clinic that provides COVID-19 vaccinations, Provider Registration
Service Officers can:

-   issue a provider number with access to Medicare benefits in line
    with normal processes
-   Apply section 19AA and 19AB guidelines where applicable to determine
    eligibility

Where Service Officers receive enquiries about health professionals’
access and eligibility at these locations staff must explain that:

-   Applications for respiratory clinic locations are only eligible for
    referring and requesting purposes
-   Applications for other locations are assessed under normal
    guidelines in date of lodgement order

Locum tenens provisions

These provisions allow eligible health professionals claiming Medicare
benefits to use one of their existing provider numbers at a new practice
location if:

-   the period is less than 2 weeks, and
-   the health professional will not be returning to the new practice

There is no change to the health professional’s eligibility for the
locum tenens.

Eligibility

Eligible health professionals include:

-   medical practitioners
-   unrestricted allied health professionals
-   optometrists
-   dentists

To be eligible, a medical practitioner must be either:

-   an Australian trained doctor who has fellowship of an Australian
    medical college
-   an overseas trained doctor who holds fellowship of an Australian
    medical college and has completed their 10 year moratorium, or
-   a doctor working in a hospital with a Medicare provider number to
    refer patients to a specialist or request diagnostic imaging or
    pathology only

This arrangement is not available to restricted doctors who:

-   need a section 19AB exemption
-   need a 3GA placement, or
-   are participants on one of the Other Medical Practitioner (OMP)
    programs

Restricted medical practitioners need to apply for a new Medicare
provider number and 19AB exemption to receive Medicare benefits from a
new location.

Eligible health professionals delivering home-based services due to
COVID-19

Services Australia received enquiries from health professionals about
using their provider numbers while delivering home based Telehealth
services due to COVID-19. For example, self-isolating at home.

Health professionals can use an existing provider number (for their
usual practice location) to claim Telehealth services provided from
their home.

Note: this does not apply to locum tenens.

There are currently no timeframes for how long health professionals can
use their existing provider number (for their usual practice location)
when providing Telehealth services from their home location.

See the Resources page for a link to the Services Australia website for
information about the changes for locum tenens.

The Resources page contains links to contact details, the Services
Australia website, external websites, Ahpra pandemic sub-register
frequently asked questions, and approved COVID-19 respiratory clinics.
