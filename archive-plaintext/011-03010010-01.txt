This document outlines how an IHI is created and allocated.

Receipt of MS003 form

If a Request an Individual Healthcare Identifier (MS003) form is
received in a Service Centre:

-   Scan the form and evidence of identity documents to a folder. Ensure
    the individual has supplied at least 1 primary document or 2
    secondary documents, as listed on the application form and all EOI
    documents are certified, see Evidence of identity - Individuals
    apply for IHI
-   Pick up the form and documents from the folder and place in an email
-   Email the form and EOI documents to the processing centre mailbox
    that is printed on the form
-   Place the originals with the scanned documents and destroy after 70
    days, see Storing documents

Allocation of a Verified IHI during Medicare enrolment

At the end of the Medicare enrolment process the system automatically
allocates a:

-   Medicare card number for all persons included in the enrolment, and
    a
-   verified IHI to all active Medicare enrolled individuals

Note:

-   no further evidence of identity (EOI) is needed
-   once a Verified IHI is created, a Medicare online account may be
    requested. Existing Services Australia processes apply to set up a
    Medicare online account

Ongoing amendment of IHIs created for DVA data

A batch file is received from the Department of Veterans' Affairs to
automatically update DVA record details held in CDMS.

IHIs for individuals not eligible for Medicare or a DVA payment or benefit

Individuals who are not eligible for Medicare or a DVA payment or
benefit may apply for an IHI online through the IHI Service in myGov.

This enables a person to get an immunisation history statement as proof
of their vaccination history.

Alternatively, the Request an Individual Healthcare Identifier form
(MS003) may be completed.

The Resources page includes a link to the MS003 form and reciprocal
healthcare agreement information.
