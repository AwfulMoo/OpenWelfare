This document outlines information about the return mail indicator for
Medicare claims.

Return mail indicator

When mail is returned to Medicare marked as either:

-   'Not at this address'
-   'Return to sender'

it is necessary to set an indicator on the enrolment record in the
Consumer Directory Maintenance System (CDMS) to alert the system not to
send any Pay Doctor via claimant (PDVC), correspondence or cards to that
address until the address is updated.

Note: from 1 July 2016, any consumer cheques received by returned mail
and cancelled will be repaid via Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) when
the consumer has made contact with Services Australia.

Online claims with a return mail indicator

For online claims select [F1] under the message for instructions and pay
