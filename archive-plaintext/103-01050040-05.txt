Displaying balances on the Expense Management Summary Screen

This table outlines how the available balance and current balance
displayed on the Expense Management Summary screen are calculated.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| Details               | Transaction           | IM Account Balance    |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| Current Balance @     |                       | $200.00               |
| today                 |                       |                       |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| Credit Day 5          | +$200.00              | $400.00               |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| Debit Day 10          | -$350.00              | $50.00                |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| Available Balance     |                       | $50.00                |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

On day 5 the current balance would be $400 but this is not used as the
available balance because it is higher than the lowest balance during
the period.
