For staff conducting Earned Income Interventions - Mail (EIIM)

This document outlines the process for verifying, assessing and
finalising EIIMs, including when there is no response and raising any
related debts.

Verification from customer/third party EIIM

If the customer cannot provide the information verbally, they must be
given the chance to provide suitable verification documents for the
EIIM. If they cannot provide verification of earnings, the employer can
be contacted.

Contact with the employer is necessary when the customer:

-   fails to respond to a request to contact letter by the due date
-   fails to provide suitable verification documents by the due date
-   cannot obtain verification directly from the employer

Employers have an obligation to provide the information under section
192 of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999.

The References page contains a link to this legislation.

Assess and finalise EIIM

After obtaining the relevant employment information from the customer or
third party:

-   assess the earnings, and
-   calculate and raise relevant debts
