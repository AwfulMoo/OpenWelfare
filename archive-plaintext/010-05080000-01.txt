This document outlines the procedure to assist in determining the
appropriate rate of Pensioner Education Supplement (PES) to be paid to a
student.

Payment details

Pensioner Education Supplement (PES) is a non-means tested and
non-taxable payments for students in receipt of certain qualifying
income support payments. PES is paid at a flat rate of either $62.40 or
$31.20 per fortnight depending on the student's study load and
qualifying payment.

Higher rate - $62.40

Where students undertake a full-time study load (at least 75 per cent of
the normal amount of full-time work for the course), or are eligible for
a 66 per cent study load concession, the higher rate is payable.

A student who is granted a 25 per cent study load concession but
undertakes a study load of at least 50 per cent of the normal study load
will also qualify for the higher rate.

Reduced rate - $31.20

A student who is granted a 25 per cent study load concession and
undertakes a study load of at least 25 per cent but less than 50 per
cent of the normal study load, will qualify for the reduced rate (half
the higher rate), unless the student is in receipt of:

-   a Disability Support Pension (DSP)
-   an invalidity service pension, or
-   an income support supplement on the grounds that they are
    permanently incapacitated for work

Students in receipt of these payments are entitled to the higher rate.
