This document outlines the effect of part-time study on the payments of
a customer receiving JobSeeker Payment (JSP) and the impact on their
mutual obligation requirements.

Eligibility for JSP

Students studying part-time may be eligible for JSP in certain
circumstances. Customers must:

meet all normal qualifications

be studying a course that is

-   deemed to be 'part-time' by the educational institution they are
    enrolled with, and
-   less than 20 hours per week study time including both contact and
    non-contact hours

Customers undertaking part-time study will be required to undertake
additional activities to meet their requirements.

For customers receiving JSP, approval of part-time study outside the
short course policy can continue as long as they continue to meet all of
their requirements, including attending appointments and accepting
offers of employment. For example, a customer may be studying at night
and willing to look for work during the day. The customer will remain
qualified for JSP, if they are:

-   seeking and willing to undertake suitable work, and
-   their studies do not restrict their ability to satisfy their
    requirements

This applies even when the course cannot be approved as fully meeting or
counting towards their requirements. Part-time study can only be
included as a compulsory requirement in the customer's Job Plan by their
Employment Services Provider.

Principal carer parents and customers with a Partial Capacity to Work or
Temporary Reduced Work Capacity of 15-29 hours are the only customers
who can fully meet their requirements by undertaking part-time study of
15 hours or more per week or a combination of study and other approved
requirements.

While other customers may undertake part-time study, the requirement
will be approved by their Employment Services Provider.

Study for provider managed customers

When the customer is managed by an Employment Services Provider, the
provider will approve the part-time study and negotiate their Job Plan.

Customers can undertake part-time study or training at any time.

Before referring a customer to training, the provider will determine
whether training is in their best interests and identify a suitable
course.

Principal Carer Parents

Principal carers on JSP can participate in approved study of at least 15
hours per week (30 hours per fortnight) in any combination of contact
and non-contact hours to fully meet their mutual obligation
requirements. Single principal carers must first apply and qualify for
Pensioner Education Supplement (PES) before study can be approved. If
they are not participating in suitable requirements at claim they will
be referred to an Employment Services Provider.

If the study is less than 15 hours per week the principal carer must
participate in another requirement to fully meet their mutual obligation
requirements. This could be a combination of paid work and study, or
self-employment and study. See Mutual obligation requirements for
principal carers for information on combinations of approved
requirements for principal carers.

If no other requirement can be approved to fully meet the customer's
requirements, they must be referred to an Employment Services Provider
and will have job search requirements in addition to their hours of
study. The Provider will determine if the part-time study can be
approved.

Customers with a Partial Capacity to Work (PCW) or Temporary Reduced Work Capacity (TRWC)

Customers assessed as having a PCW or TRWC of 15 hours or more per week
are able to fully meet their mutual obligation requirements if
participating in part-time study up to their assessed work capacity.

If their study is less than 15 hours per week they must participate in
another activity to fully meet their requirements. This could be a
combination of paid work and study, or self-employment and study. See
Approved activities for customers assessed as having a partial capacity
to work (PCW) for information on combinations of approved requirements
for customers with a PCW.

If their study, or combination of approved requirements is for fewer
hours than their assessed work capacity, they must be referred to an
Employment Services Provider and will be required to undertake other
activities to satisfy their requirements.

PCW or TRWC customers with an assessed capacity of 0-7 or 8-14 hours per
week will only be able to undertake study as a voluntary requirement.
These customers will still be required to attend quarterly participation
interviews with Services Australia.

Customer entitled to Pensioner Education Supplement (PES)

JSP (single principal carers) qualifies as a PES attracting income
support payment. This means Parenting Payment Single (PPS) customers who
transfer to JSP (single principal carer) will continue to be able to
qualify for PES at any point in time (where all other qualifications are
met). These customers will no longer be required to be continuing in the
same course of study to retain access to PES.

Requirement is part-time course for Indigenous customers

If the requirement is a part-time course, and the customer is
Indigenous, they may be eligible for assistance. For example,
Incidentals Allowance, under the ABSTUDY scheme. If the customer is
thinking about applying for ABSTUDY for the part-time course, then the
customer must be made aware that the course cannot be included as a
compulsory part of the Job Plan. A customer is not eligible for ABSTUDY
assistance if the same course of study is a compulsory requirement.
Customers are eligible to apply for ABSTUDY assistance if the course is
only a voluntary component.

The Resources page provides an example of a customer returning to
part-time study.
