Conducting reviews of independence

This topic covers the procedures for conducting reviews of independence
for ABSTUDY and Youth Allowance (YA) customers.

ABSTUDY and YA customers may be granted independent status on a
permanent basis or on a reviewable, temporary basis. Customers with a
reviewable independent status may have that status reviewed to determine
whether or not the customer continues to satisfy the requirements for
independence.

Customers with reviewable independent status (for example, Unreasonable
to Live at Home (UTLAH)) will have that status reviewed if their
circumstances change (for example, they change address or return to the
parental home).

Where the requirements for independence are no longer met, a debt may be
raised for any excess payments the customer has received.
