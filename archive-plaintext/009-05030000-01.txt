This document outlines information about the Disability Care Load
Assessment (child) Determination (DCLAD). The DCLAD (2020) assesses the
functional ability, behaviour, and special care needs for eligibility
for Carer Payment (CP) (child) and Carer Allowance (CA) (child) claims.

DCLAD (2020) requirements

The Disability Care Load Assessment (child) Determination (DCLAD) (2020)
will require all CP (child) (excluding terminal care receivers) and CA
(child) (excluding List of Recognised Disabilities (LoRD) care
receivers) claimants to achieve a qualifying rating of 'intense'.

A qualifying rating of intense will be achieved if the carer and care
receiver have achieved a score of:

-   'greater than zero' on the Treating Health Professional (THP)
    functional assessment questions
-   85 or greater on the carer's Care Needs Assessment (CNA)

THP medical reports and a CNA form will assess the DCLAD 2020
eligibility criteria.

Re-use and reclaim provisions

For claims and reclaims of CP/CA (child), the most recent CNAs and
Medical Reports gathered under the following for new and existing carers
may be re-used if the carer, care receiver and the report meet re-use or
reclaim eligibility criteria:

-   Child Disability Assessment Determination (CDAD) 2001
-   DCLAD 2020
-   List of Recognised Disabilities (LoRD), or
-   terminal condition assessment for CP (child) including those under
    pre 1 July 2009 Profoundly Disabled Child provisions

Grandfathering provisions

Carers who are current or suspended on 30 June 2010 and were:

-   granted CP (child) under the DCLAD (2009) or CA (child) under the
    Child Disability Assessment Determination (CDAD) (2001) will
    maintain qualification and payability under their existing
    provisions. This remains until they are selected for review under
    DCLAD 2020 or lose qualification on or after 1 July 2010. This group
    of care receivers will not appear on the Carer Payment Grandfathered
    (CRGF) screen
-   granted CP (child) due to caring for a Profoundly Disabled Child
    (PDC), or two children who require the equivalent care of a PDC,
    will maintain qualification and payability under PDC provisions.
    This remains until they are selected for review under DCLAD 2020 or
    lose qualification on or after 1 July 2010. Carers in this group who
    reclaim CP (child) for the same care receiver from 1 July 2010 to 17
    August 2020 must provide a DCLAD (2020) care load assessment and
    medical report. These groups of care receivers will appear on the
    CRGF screen
