This document outlines the process where, due to the lack of other
recovery options, Child Support can recover certain types of debts from
a customer’s Family Tax Benefits (FTB). Recovery may only be by
deduction from ongoing fortnightly FTB entitlements.

Stay orders and collection from FTB

Stay orders made after 1 January 2007, under section 140 (Assessment
Act) and section 111C (Registration and Collection Act) will need to be
checked to ascertain what aspects of the legislation need to be stayed
and if there is any impact on collecting via FTB deductions.

See the References page for links to legislation.

Limitations on collection from FTB

FTB deductions can only be used to collect child support arrears or an
overpayment for an FTB eligible child. FTB deductions are not available
to collect from customers liable to pay to more than 1 customer.
Deductions cannot be made from lump sum payments of FTB.

FTB deductions cannot be used to collect a child support debt associated
with an overseas maintenance liability, including a New Zealand
liability.
