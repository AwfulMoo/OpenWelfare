Examples of circumstances impacting ability to comply at the time of the requirement

George was impacted by an episodic illness and missed the appointment.
George has previously provided medical evidence and discussed his
illness to Services Australia. A circumstance impacting compliance is
current on George's record which indicates this is an ongoing factor.

The PST-skilled Service Officer considers:

-   What is the nature of the illness?
-   How did the illness affect their capacity at the time of the
    requirement?
-   Do the impacts of the illness make it unreasonable for the job
    seeker to comply?
-   Was it unreasonable for the job seeker to contact their provider
    before the appointment or requirement start time?
-   Was the illness the only issue affecting their ability to comply?
-   Do George's actions suggest intent to comply?
-   If the same illness intermittently impacts George's ability to meet
    requirements, have reasonable steps been taken to address this (such
    as discussing with the provider, including receiving reminders or
    regularly checking the Job Seeker app)?
-   Has there been a change in, for example, medication or triggers,
    which correlate with the non-compliance?
-   What time was the appointment? Was it early in the morning, when it
    may be difficult for George to function? Has the provider discussed
    this with George? Has the provider considered this when arranging
    the appointment?
-   Did the illness affect George at the time of the requirement?
-   Would George have known prior to the appointment that he would
    unlikely be able to comply?
