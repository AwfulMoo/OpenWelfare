This document outlines how to determine if a Youth Allowance (YA)
customer:

-   is entitled to a different rate of payment, or
-   remains eligible for YA when they leave the parental home

Review and eligibility

A YA customer who leaves their parental home must have their
circumstances reviewed as:

-   they may be entitled to a different rate of basic benefit, and
-   their eligibility for Rent Assistance (RA) and Remote Area Allowance
    (RAA) may have changed

Away from home rate

The away from home rate of YA is a higher rate of YA payable to eligible
young people who need to live away from home to:

-   access study,
-   do an Australian apprenticeship, or
-   improve their employment prospects

Young people who fulfil the mutual obligation requirements as a job
seeker or study requirements as an Australian Apprentice or full-time
student, may qualify for the away from home rate of YA.

Not all young people living away from the parental home can qualify for
the away from home rate. It is not sufficient for the young person to
choose to live away from home, or for the parent to choose not to
support the young person.

Independent customers

Independent customers who live in the parental home are generally
considered an accommodated independent person. These customers are
entitled to the accommodated independent rate of YA. However, a customer
will be eligible for a rate equivalent to the away from home rate of YA
if they are:

living in the parental home and are independent because they:

-   are or have been married or a member of a YA couple, or
-   have, or have had, a dependent child

Effect on siblings

The departure of a YA customer from the family home may affect the
entitlements of other young people in the family unit who are also
receiving YA.
