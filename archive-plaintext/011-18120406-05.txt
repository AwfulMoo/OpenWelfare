Example 1 - date of service 26 July 2021

Table 1

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Service items                     | Text or note submitted            |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 45201                             | Flap repair-31360 - left hand     |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 31360                             | Associated with 45201 - left hand |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 31365                             | Separate excision - right hand    |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Item 45201 is a service that must be performed in association with items
31000, 31001, 31002, 31003, 31004, 31005, 31358, 31359, 31360, 31363,
31364, 31363, 31364, 31369, 31370, 31371, 31373 or 31376.

In addition, a health professional bills item 31365 as it was performed
via a separate excision on a separate site.

In this example, the restriction between item 45201 and 31365 can be
overridden. Sufficient information was given indicating there were 2
separate excisions, performed on 2 separate sites.

Example 2 - date of service 3 June 2016

Table 2

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Service items                     | Text or note submitted            |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 39118                             | C7/T1 - left                      |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 39118                             | C7/T1 - right                     |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 39118                             | C6/C7 - left                      |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 39118                             | C6/C7 - right                     |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 39118                             | L1/T12 - x2                       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 39118                             | L1/T12 - x2                       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Item 39118 has a time dependency. The restriction exists as item 39118
is only payable once per facet joint and up to 4 times per vertebrae.

In this example, a note against the items is sufficient to override the
restriction between item 39118 and itself as the services have been
performed on different vertebrae. The claim indicates that item 39118
was performed on the left and right side between C7/T1 and C6/C7
vertebrae, in addition to being performed on 2 different facet joints
between vertebrae L1/T12.

Note: this is an example only. The time dependency explaining this
scenario was ended 28 February 2022.

Example 3 - date of service 27 June 2020

Table 3

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Service items                     | Text or note submitted            |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 30621                             | Separate site - umbilical hernia  |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 30403                             | Separate site - left femoral      |
|                                   | hernia                            |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

The MBS item descriptor for item 30621 states ‘other than a service to
which item 30403 or 30405 applies’. The restriction exists between item
30621 and 30403 as ‘repair of hernia’ is included as part of both item
descriptors.

In this example, the information given by the health professional is
satisfactory to override the restriction between item 30621 and 30403.
The text indicates that 2 different hernias have been operated on and
each item applies to separate hernias.

Note: separate hernias of the same types can also occur on both sides of
the body and be payable, for example left and right inguinal hernias.
