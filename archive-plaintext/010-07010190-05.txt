| 1                                 | Honours year following            |
|                                   | pre-requisite study               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Katherine completed a Bachelor of |
|                                   | Arts (BA) in 1995 and has just    |
|                                   | finished a Bachelor of Science    |
|                                   | (Veterinary) at the University of |
|                                   | Sydney and has been receiving     |
|                                   | Austudy while studying. Both      |
|                                   | these courses are three years     |
|                                   | long. Katherine now wants to do   |
|                                   | the Honours year in Science       |
|                                   | (Veterinary), in the year         |
|                                   | immediately after completing her  |
|                                   | science degree. Katherine         |
|                                   | received Youth Allowance for the  |
|                                   | BA, but because of undertaking    |
|                                   | and completing the BA more than   |
|                                   | 10 years ago, this study can be   |
|                                   | disregarded when determining      |
|                                   | allowable time.                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Honours extends the minimum time  |
|                                   | of the course by one year so once |
|                                   | Katherine is enrolled in the      |
|                                   | Honours course, Katherine is      |
|                                   | effectively regarded as being in  |
|                                   | a four year course. Allowable     |
|                                   | time for a four year course is    |
|                                   | four and a half years (or five    |
|                                   | years if there is a year-long     |
|                                   | subject). Katherine has only      |
|                                   | completed three years of the      |
|                                   | Bachelor of Science (Veterinary)  |
|                                   | and so can be paid for a further  |
|                                   | year.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | As the Honours in Science         |
|                                   | (Veterinary) specifically states  |
|                                   | that students must have completed |
|                                   | the undergraduate Bachelor of     |
|                                   | Science (Veterinary) course at    |
|                                   | the University of Sydney to gain  |
|                                   | entry and Katherine will be       |
|                                   | studying the Honours course       |
|                                   | immediately following completion  |
|                                   | of the pre-requisite course at    |
|                                   | the same education provider, her  |

|                                   | course is extended to include her |

|                                   | Donna has just completed a three  |
|                                   | year Bachelor of Arts at The      |
|                                   | University of Adelaide and has    |
|                                   | enrolled in Bachelor of Arts      |
|                                   | (Honours) for one year. Donna has |
|                                   | chosen to undertake the one year  |
|                                   | Bachelor of Arts (Honours) at     |
|                                   | University of South Australia.    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Although Donna is undertaking the |
|                                   | Honours year immediately after    |
|                                   | completing the prerequisite       |
|                                   | course, it is regarded as a       |
|                                   | standalone Honours year as it is  |
|                                   | at a different institution. The   |
|                                   | one year Bachelor of Arts         |
|                                   | (Honours) at University of South  |
|                                   | Australia is coded as Honours     |
|                                   | Group B (HGB) level of study.     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | As Honours study extends the      |
|                                   | minimum time for a Bachelor       |
|                                   | degree by one year, the minimum   |
|                                   | time for the Bachelor degree,     |
|                                   | including the Honours component   |
|                                   | is now four years. Donna          |
|                                   | completed the prerequisite        |
|                                   | Bachelor degree within three      |
|                                   | years, with no previous Level B   |
|                                   | study, therefore Donna has no     |
|                                   | allowable time issues.            |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Note: satisfactory progress for Youth Allowance is about completing the
current course within allowable time. Therefore, previous study in a
different course, even at the same level as the current course, does not
reduce the allowable time remaining.
