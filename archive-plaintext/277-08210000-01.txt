This document outlines the process for identifying New Zealand 'In'
cases which are suitable for withdrawal or return.

Overview

When a payee resides in New Zealand they must lodge an application for
child support with Inland Revenue, New Zealand (NZIR). If the payer
lives in Australia and they do not enter into a satisfactory payment
arrangement, NZIR may forward the case to Child Support for collection.

When collection is no longer required due to final payment, a request is
made to NZIR to withdraw the case.

If collection is no longer possible, Child Support advises NZIR that the
case will be returned Non Collectable, Untraceable, Customer Deceased or
Customer No Longer Habitually Resident.
