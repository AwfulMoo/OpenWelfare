This document outlines the process taken by a user to create their
Provider Digital Access (PRODA) account. The information is for Service
Officers to help users with the process.

How to create an account

A PRODA account can be created by completing the following 3 steps:

-   Create account - provide details, create a username and password,
    and verify email address. Note: when creating the account, encourage
    the user to enter their name as it appears on their identity
    documents
-   Verify identity documents - Services Australia needs to verify the
    user's identity via government issued ID documents. The Resources
    page contains a list of suitable online documents
-   Match existing services - to gain access to the appropriate
    services, the user needs to complete the matching process for their
    existing services

Note: Health Professional Online Services (HPOS) administrative staff
with no identifiers can still create a PRODA account to access services
and link their PRODA account to HPOS.

When creating an account, their identity will be verified online and in
real-time using the government's Document Verification Service (DVS),
which connects to state and territory registration databases.

The new solution requires a greater level of security. The agency must
ensure a high level of certainty that the person performing the
transaction is correct and that the agency knows who they are, even if
they are known to the agency already.

The Resources page contains links to the National Disability Insurance
Scheme (NDIS) Provider Toolkit, frequently asked questions, screenshots
for staff to help users, and information about identity documents that
can be verified online through DVS.
