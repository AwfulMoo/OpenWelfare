+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | One customer receiving JobSeeker  |
|                                   | Payment (JSP) and their partner   |
|                                   | receiving Parenting Payment       |
|                                   | Partnered (PPP)                   |

|                                   | Note: this scenario uses a        |
|                                   | Partner Income Free Area of       |
|                                   | $1,124 for calculation purposes   |
|                                   | only.                             |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Brenda gets a job earning $602    |
|                                   | per fortnight (continuing         |
|                                   | income). Brenda's income          |
|                                   | reduction amount will be $260.60  |
|                                   | per fortnight for PPP and there   |
|                                   | will be no effect on John's JSP   |
|                                   | (PPP is still current as income   |
|                                   | is below $1,124 Partner Income    |
|                                   | Free Area).                       |

| 2                                 | One customer receiving JSP and    |
|                                   | their partner not receiving       |
|                                   | payment                           |

|                                   | Note: this scenario uses a        |

|                                   | $1,124 for calculation purposes   |
|                                   | only.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Stan is receiving JSP and Julia   |
|                                   | has a job earning $1,850 per      |
|                                   | fortnight.                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Julia is not entitled to any      |
|                                   | payment and Stan's JSP needs to   |
|                                   | be assessed based on Julia's      |
|                                   | income using the allowance Income |
|                                   | Test. See the following           |
|                                   | calculation (note all figures are |
|                                   | approximate):                     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Partner Income Free Area =        |
|                                   | $1,124.                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Partner income excess = $1,850 -  |
|                                   | $1,124 = $726.                    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Partner income reduction amount = |
|                                   | $726 x 0.6 = $435.60.             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Therefore, Stan's payment will    |
|                                   | reduce by $435.60 pf.             |

Note: these scenarios are representative of calculations only and the
amounts shown should not be taken to be current.

For an allowance customer, the way their Partner Income Free Area is
worked out differs depending on whether the partner is receiving a
social security benefit or not.

-   If the partner is receiving a social security benefit, the Partner
    Income Free Area is the amount of the partner's income beyond which
    that benefit would not be payable to the partner
-   If the partner is not in receipt of a social security benefit, the
    Partner Income Free Area is the amount of the partner's income
    beyond which Youth Allowance (YA) (job seeker) or JSP would not be
    payable to the partner
