| 1                                 | FAA for air travel between home   |
|                                   | and place of study                |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Guy's family lives in Tennant     |
|                                   | Creek. Guy is studying in         |
|                                   | Brisbane and therefore is         |
|                                   | eligible for FAA for air travel   |
|                                   | between home and place of study.  |
|                                   | Towards the end of first          |
|                                   | semester, Guy's parents           |
|                                   | temporarily move to Townsville to |
|                                   | look after Guy's grandparent (who |
|                                   | has flu). Guy applies for FAA to  |
|                                   | stay with them in Townsville for  |
|                                   | the holidays.                     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   FAA to Townsville is payable  |
|                                   |     as this is Guy's temporary    |
|                                   |     home. Air fares would not be  |
|                                   |     payable, however, as this is  |
|                                   |     not the appropriate mode of   |
|                                   |     transport between Brisbane    |
|                                   |     and Townsville                |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Guy's grandparent recovers and so |
|                                   | the family returns to Tennant     |
|                                   | Creek before the end of the       |
|                                   | holidays and Guy travels with     |
|                                   | them.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   FAA is not payable for        |
|                                   |     journeys between different    |
|                                   |     homes so the trip from        |
|                                   |     Townsville to Tennant Creek   |
|                                   |     is not covered. Guy will      |
|                                   |     however be able to claim the  |
|                                   |     journey from Tennant Creek to |
|                                   |     Brisbane to resume study      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | At the end of the year, Guy's     |
|                                   | family temporarily move to        |
|                                   | Darwin. Guy claims FAA to travel  |
|                                   | there from Brisbane.              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   FAA is payable for the trip   |
|                                   |     but the amount payable will   |
|                                   |     not exceed the equivalent of  |
|                                   |     the cost of travel to Tennant |
|                                   |     Creek                         |

| 2                                 | Not eligible for FAA as           |
|                                   | reasonable travelling time has    |
|                                   | not been exceeded                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Kath's family lives at Fremantle  |
|                                   | and Kath studies in Perth.        |
|                                   | Although Kath does not live at    |
|                                   | home the situation does not       |
|                                   | qualify for the away from home    |
|                                   | rate or FAA as travel between     |
|                                   | home and study does not exceed    |
|                                   | reasonable travelling time or     |
|                                   | distance. Towards the end of      |
|                                   | first semester, Kath's family go  |
|                                   | to Adelaide for a few weeks       |
|                                   | holiday. As they will still be    |
|                                   | there when Kath's holidays start, |
|                                   | Kath applies for FAA to return to |
|                                   | the temporary home.               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | FAA is not payable. Although      |
|                                   | Perth to Adelaide exceeds         |
|                                   | reasonable travelling time or     |
|                                   | distance it does not make Kath    |
|                                   | eligible for FAA as this is based |
|                                   | on her permanent home             |
|                                   | (Fremantle).                      |

|                                   |     resident of Sydney. FAA on    |
|                                   |     completion of study is only   |

|                                   | It is Kyle's right to ask for a   |
|                                   | review of the decision. The       |
|                                   | argument is that Kyle lied to the |
|                                   | Housing Authority to get cheaper  |
|                                   | rent. In any event, due to a      |
|                                   | shortage of suitable premises     |
|                                   | Kyle never obtained a place.      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   The decision stands. Kyle has |
|                                   |     formally declared residency   |
|                                   |     in Sydney. Services Australia |

|                                   | Nova is in the second year of a   |
|                                   | law degree in Melbourne. Nova has |
|                                   | not returned to Alice Springs     |
|                                   | since the start of the course and |
|                                   | wishes to travel there now. Nova  |
|                                   | applies for FAA.                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   FAA is rejected. Nova did not |
|                                   |     return to the permanent home  |
|                                   |     for the long holiday at the   |
|                                   |     end of the first year of      |
|                                   |     study and so it is deemed     |
|                                   |     that Nova has established a   |
|                                   |     new permanent home in         |
|                                   |     Melbourne                     |

|                                   | Nova asks for this decision to be |
|                                   | reviewed. Nova did not return     |
|                                   | home at the end of the first year |
|                                   | due to undertaking summer school  |
|                                   | and so could not return at that   |
|                                   | time.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   The decision is overturned    |
|                                   |     and FAA is granted. Attending |
|                                   |     summer school as part of the  |
|                                   |     course is an acceptable       |
|                                   |     reason for not returning home |
