This page contains information and procedures for student trained staff
to follow when recording an approved period of study outside Australia,
under the Overseas Full Time Study (OFS) provisions.

On this page:

Initial assessment of travel period and International coding

Initial assessment of travel period and International coding

Table 1: This table describes how to determine the period of travel for
payment under the Overseas Full Time Study (OFS) provisions. The table
includes additional coding required by Centrelink International Services
(CIS) Service Officers.

Note: for student trained staff only. Staff must assess the evidence and
determine that a student or Australian apprentice meets the requirements
for overseas study or work before coding the record. If a student is
combining a holiday with study or work, additional travel time is not to
be included in the approved period of portability.

coding also applies where a student has returned to Australia but has
not yet had payment restored or re-granted.
