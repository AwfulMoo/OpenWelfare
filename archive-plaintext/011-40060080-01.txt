This document outlines how to access, match, mark and bypass a Fact of
Death record in the Consumer Directory Maintenance System (CDMS).

Fact of Death Data (FODD)

FODD is received daily from State Registrars of Births, Deaths and
Marriages who provide details of all registered deaths in Australia.

Where an exact one-to-one match is obtained against Medicare enrolment
data (using first name, last name, date of birth and gender), the
customer's Medicare record is automatically updated with the date of
death.

Where FODD does not directly match Medicare enrolment data, the FODD is
referred to Medicare for manual matching in CDMS.

FODD processing includes the following options:

-   match a FODD record with a specific customer record so the date of
    death is updated for that customer
-   mark a FODD record as unable to be matched to a customer record
-   bypass the FODD record to allow for later processing

See Process page on how to access, match, mark and bypass a Fact of
Death Data (FODD) record in the Consumer Directory Maintenance System
(CDMS).
