Delegations and authorisations

The Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (PGPA
Act) provides that certain staff within Child Support may hold a
delegation to approve the non-pursuit of a debt.

Although the delegations provide for APS 3 and up to authorise a
non-pursuit of debt depending on the debt level, the agency has
restricted the authorisation to:

-   EL1s who manage staff that have responsibility for debt recovery, or
-   the relevant EL1 or their delegate in Employer Services for
    non-pursuit of employer debt

The practice of a minimum EL1 level approval is an internally endorsed
process.

The official financial delegations to approve non-pursuit of
administered debt before 2 April 2018 are provided in Accountable
Authority Instructions – section 5 Debts.

Note: non-pursuit delegation amounts relate to the total debt amount not
just the maintenance debt.

For more information about authorisations and delegations see the
Accountable Authority Instructions.
