process when a customer's taxable income information is received from
the Australian Tax Office (ATO) and compared to the estimated Adjusted
Taxable Income (ATI).

Automatic reconciliation procedure

Automatic estimate reconciliation procedure in Cuba

This table describes information about how Cuba processes an automatic
estimate reconciliation when income details are received from the ATO,
and manual intervention is not required.

|                                   |     annualised to identify the    |
