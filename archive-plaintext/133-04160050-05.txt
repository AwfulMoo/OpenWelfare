Privacy Statement and Conditions of Use

For customers calling our MBL’s the Privacy and Conditions of use are
provided in the IVR messaging. Should customers be issued a PIN by phone
or by staff in a Service Centre, the following statements must be read
to the customer.

Privacy statement

The privacy and security of your personal information is important to
us, and is protected by law. We need to collect this information so we
can process and manage your applications and payments, and provide
services to you. We only share your information with other parties where
you have agreed, or where the law allows or requires it. For more
information, go to servicesaustralia.gov.au/privacy.

Self Service conditions of use

Providing you with a voiceprint will assist you to access the agency’s
services, including Self Service. Your voiceprint will be securely
stored by Telstra on behalf of Services Australia. It will be linked
with information about you that is kept by the agency. This will allow
you to identify yourself when you call. Using the agency’s Self Service
facilities is voluntary. If you have a myGov account, it may be given to
your myGov member services so they can identify you. When using your
voice or PIN to access these services your personal information will be
treated as described in the privacy notice.

You can enrol only once. Voiceprints are checked to ensure only one
exists per customer. You must not permit any other person to record
their voice to access your record. If your access has been misused or
you wish to cancel your access, please contact us.

| 2                                 | Question: How can Voice           |
|                                   | Biometrics ensure my security?    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: All voiceprints are       |
|                                   | encrypted securely stored, in a   |
|                                   | database, in a secure data        |
|                                   | centre. Voice Biometrics security |
|                                   | is among the strongest            |
|                                   | authentication processes, and is  |
|                                   | more secure than a PIN or         |
|                                   | password as voiceprints use the   |
|                                   | individual characteristics in a   |
|                                   | voice, similar to a fingerprint – |
|                                   | no two voiceprints are the same.  |

|                                   | Biometrics technology is able to  |
|                                   | flag whether the voice coming     |
|                                   | into the system is recorded, or   |
|                                   | live, and can identify if the     |
|                                   | voice has changed after           |
|                                   | authentication in an attempt to   |
|                                   | fraudulently access a customer’s  |
|                                   | information.                      |

|                                   | available to all customers. The   |
|                                   | Common Passphrase (CPP) – (In     |
|                                   | Australia my voice identifies me) |
|                                   | must be repeated in English.      |
|                                   | Speaking the CPP in other         |
|                                   | languages would require an        |

| 4                                 | Question: Are there Privacy risks |
|                                   | using your voice to contact       |
|                                   | devices around the home?          |

|                                   | Answer: Home based voice devices  |
|                                   | are very different to using voice |
|                                   | biometrics to identify somebody.  |
|                                   | Home based devices respond to     |
|                                   | words or phrases and Voice        |
|                                   | Biometrics is the measurement of  |
|                                   | how someone speaks and the        |
|                                   | characteristics of the human      |
|                                   | voice, which is unique to an      |
|                                   | individual. Whilst some home      |
|                                   | devices might have voice          |
|                                   | recognition, our technology has   |
|                                   | strict security measures. This    |
|                                   | prevents attempts to mislead the  |

| 5                                 | Question: What if my voice        |
|                                   | changes e.g. with age or if I     |
|                                   | have a cold?                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: While the technology is   |
|                                   | very good, there are times where  |
|                                   | a customer’s voice will simply    |
|                                   | not match with their voiceprint.  |
|                                   | This could be due to a variation  |
|                                   | in the customer’s voice due to    |
|                                   | gender transitioning, aging or    |
|                                   | the customer experiencing a major |
|                                   | illness. A voiceprint can always  |
|                                   | be deleted and a new one recorded |
|                                   | but remember the customer would   |
|                                   | need to fully re-verify their     |
|                                   | identity with Services Australia  |
|                                   | to do so. Please see Voiceprints  |
|                                   | for phone self service (Table 7)  |
|                                   | for workflow.                     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | There is also the ability for     |
|                                   | your voiceprint to auto-update    |
|                                   | over time as your actual voice    |
|                                   | changes as you age. This is not a |
|                                   | feature we have had to use yet    |
|                                   | but is a capability of the        |
|                                   | technology we may use to support  |
|                                   | our customers into the future.    |

|                                   | Answer: The Authentication Team   |
|                                   | has received advice that there    |

|                                   | voiceprint cannot be used outside |
|                                   | of the current interaction. The   |
|                                   | customer will need to complete    |
|                                   | their voiceprint on their         |
|                                   | CAN/CRN. The Fast Note needs to   |
|                                   | be completed on the record the    |

|                                   | complete a fast note on the       |
|                                   | record, this will be highlighted  |
|                                   | in reporting. We recommend the    |

|                                   | coaching to explain why it could  |
|                                   | not be actioned. It is also       |
|                                   | paramount that when a caller      |

|                                   | provided a voiceprint, that the   |
|                                   | staff member educates the caller  |
|                                   | on the correct process (to only   |

|                                   | attempting to enrol a customer’s  |
|                                   | voiceprint                        |

|                                   | Answer: The questions that        |
|                                   | present for a voiceprint          |
|                                   | enrolment are dependent on the    |
|                                   | information available on the      |
|                                   | customer’s record. Current        |
|                                   | customers have more up to date    |
|                                   | information. The system will      |
|                                   | attempt to authenticate the       |
|                                   | customer in the quickest way      |
|                                   | possible which may mean asking    |
|                                   | questions around outdated or old  |
|                                   | information. If the customer is   |
|                                   | unable to correctly answer these  |
|                                   | questions, due to the information |
|                                   | on their record being old, there  |
|                                   | is the ability to select "Ask     |
|                                   | more questions” however based on  |
|                                   | their circumstances older/expired |
|                                   | documents may still present.      |
|                                   | Remember a customer’s driver      |
|                                   | licence may have expired but the  |
|                                   | licence number will remain the    |
|                                   | same as long as the State remains |
|                                   | the same.                         |

|                                   | It is important to remember,      |
|                                   | voiceprint authentication offers  |
|                                   | the highest level of security and |
|                                   | protects the customer from fraud  |
|                                   | and unauthorised access, and      |
|                                   | therefore we need to maintain the |
|                                   | integrity of the enrolment        |
|                                   | process by only confirming what   |
|                                   | is on record. This may mean a     |
|                                   | portion of customers will be      |
|                                   | unable to pass the voiceprint     |
|                                   | enrolment process required to     |
|                                   | finalise a voiceprint. If the     |
|                                   | customer cannot pass the PoRO     |
|                                   | questions and the Identity        |
|                                   | documents presenting are old and  |
|                                   | the customer cannot recall the    |
|                                   | details, the customer should      |
|                                   | attend a Service Centre with      |
|                                   | photo ID and have the details     |
|                                   | uploaded to their customer        |

|                                   | Answer: Yes. If the customer has  |
|                                   | a password on their record, it    |
