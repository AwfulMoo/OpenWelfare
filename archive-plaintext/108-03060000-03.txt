|                                   | 1 January 2022, DFISA will be     |
|                                   | automatically recalculated when   |
|                                   | there is a change in certain      |
|                                   | circumstances affecting the rate  |
|                                   | of the customer's pension or      |
|                                   | benefit. This rate recalculation  |
|                                   | occurs on the Services Australia  |
|                                   | system.                           |

|                                   | When there is a DFISA rate        |
|                                   | change, the new amount(s) will be |
|                                   | transmitted to DVA, where the     |
|                                   | customer's DFISA payments are     |
|                                   | adjusted and paid by DVA          |
|                                   | accordingly. DFISA is generally   |
|                                   | paid by DVA fortnightly on the    |
|                                   | DVA payday. DFISA adjustments can |
|                                   | result in a debt or an arrears    |
|                                   | payment with DVA.                 |

|                                   | DFISA may still be payable even   |
|                                   | if a customer's income support    |
|                                   | rate is nil. If their DFISA rate  |
|                                   | is greater than zero, the         |
|                                   | customer will be regarded as      |
|                                   | being current on their income     |
