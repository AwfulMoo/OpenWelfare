STARTUP-HELP loan indicator options

Y – Confirmed TCSI or evidence sighted by Service Officer

P – Pending evidence

N – Not entitled

Students who have a P or N status recorded for their STARTUP-HELP loan
indicator are not eligible for a student payment.

It is not necessary to code the EDC screen with either a P or N status
as the payment is able to be manually cancelled or rejected using reason
SUH – Not entitled to STARTUP HELP without coding the EDC screen. This
is in keeping with current practise where unapproved courses are not
coded on the EDC screen.

A student’s STARTUP-HELP loan status can only be coded with a Y
indicator on the EDC screen if the student’s loan status has been
verified via TCSI data match in an online claim, or a Service officer
has sighted evidence the student is enrolled and has been selected for a
STARTUP-HELP loan.
