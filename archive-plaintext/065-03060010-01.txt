This document outlines the effect of commencing or returning to work
when the customer or their partner is receiving Age Pension.

Details of employment

If an Age Pension customer or their partner commences or returns to work
they must advise Centrelink within 14 days of being paid. The customer
must supply the following:

-   date they were paid
-   employer's name, address and phone number
-   gross employment income paid per week/fortnight (including salary
    sacrifice into superannuation or assessable fringe benefits)
-   if employment is casual or part time
-   if partnered, any payment that the partner is receiving

Self-service

[]Age Pension customers who have commenced or returned to work or have
ceased employment are able to update their employment status through
their Centrelink online account or Express Plus Centrelink mobile app.
This service will automatically place them onto or turn off a 2 weekly
reporting requirement.

Eligible customers can also update their partner's employment status
when the partner:

-   does not receive an income support payment
-   receives an income support payment other than Disability Support
    Pension and has given the customer permission to enquire
-   receives Age Pension (Blind) or Disability Support Pension (Blind)
    with Rent Assistance

Genuine attempts must be made to transition customers to report via self
service options before assisted reporting is completed, unless an
Exception applies.

Online estimator

[] The Online estimator options can be used by customers and Service
Officers to show how the customer's payments will be affected by a
change in income.

Work Bonus, working credits and nil rate

When a customer has employment income (including salary sacrifice into
superannuation or assessable fringe benefits) and:

-   they are over Age Pension age and in receipt of a pension, they may
    be entitled to the Work Bonus. Work Bonus only applies to the
    customer’s own employment income – however, partners may still
    benefit by the reduction in total income. Note: customers paid under
    the transitional rules for pension customers are not eligible for
    the Work Bonus and therefore their partner’s rate is not affected
-   their partner is under Age Pension age and receives a payment with
    access to Working Credit, the partner may use their working credits
    to offset their employment income. The Age Pension customer is not
    eligible for Working Credit as they are over Age Pension age
-   the customer's or partner’s income reduces their fortnightly rate to
    nil, their payment may remain current at nil rate for up to 6
    fortnights and they may retain certain benefits. For example
    concession cards.

Choice between cancellation or employment income nil rate

If an Age Pension customer is in, or is entering, an employment income
nil rate period and they ask about eligibility for other payments, they
are to be offered the choice of cancellation or an employment income nil
rate period. The customer should be advised of the benefits and
disadvantages of each:

-   Cancellation - Pensioner Concession Card (PCC) is cancelled but the
    customer may access the Commonwealth Seniors Health Care Card (CSHC)
    and Pension Supplement for non-income support recipients. The
    customer needs to reclaim when payable
-   Nil rate period - PCC remains current but the customer may miss out
    on bonuses targeted to pensioners being paid and CSHC holders only.
    The customer will not need to reclaim Age Pension if it becomes
    payable before the end of 6 fortnights and 13 days

Income assessed fortnightly

From 7 December 2020, Age Pension customers have employment income
assessed in the fortnight it is taken to be paid. For more information,
see Recording and correcting employment income details.

Age Pension customers are generally to be placed on 2 weekly reporting
for both continuous and varying ongoing employment income. Some
exceptions apply.

Effect of income on Age Pension

Employment income is assessed under the Pensions Income Test.

For partnered customers, the system automatically applies half the
combined total ordinary income of the couple to each, regardless of
whether their partner receives a Centrelink payment. This means that if
combined income is above the allowable amount for a couple under the
pension Income Test, the customer's pension will be reduced by 25 cents
for each dollar above that amount (instead of 50 cents per dollar for a
single pensioner).

Transitional rules for pension customers

If the customer is receiving payment under the transitional rules for
pension customers, the reduction of 20c for a partnered pensioners or
40c per dollar for a single pensioner will stay in place until the
customer is no worse off under the current pension Income Test.

Effect of partner income

If the customer's partner receives:

-   a Centrelink pension, half the couple's combined total ordinary
    income will be applied to each customer's payment separately
-   a Centrelink allowance such as JobSeeker Payment, Partner Allowance
    or Parenting Payment, half the combined total ordinary income will
    be assessed for the partner under the Allowance Income and Asset
    Tests
-   Special Benefit (SpB), half the combined income will reduce the
    partner's SpB as a direct deduction

Special Employment Advance

Customers receiving Age Pension are not entitled to a Special Employment
Advance.
