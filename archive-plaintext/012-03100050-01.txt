This document outlines information on deactivating a Healthcare Provider
Identifier - Individual (HPI-I) records in the Healthcare Identifiers
(HI) Service.

Deactivate HPI-I record in HI Service

Once the last speciality or profession has been removed from a HPI-I
record, or the only speciality or profession is no longer current, the
HI Service updates the status of the record to ‘deactivated’.

A specialty is no longer current when the last speciality or profession
has either:

-   been removed from a HPI-I record
-   an end date that is earlier than today’s date

If a provider has been registered through the Australian Health
Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra), notification of speciality or
profession end date is provided by Ahpra through an automated data feed.

A request to end date current specialities or professions not covered by
Ahpra from an HPI-I record can come from either healthcare providers via
the Department of Human Service’s service channels, web services, or
Health Professional Online Services (HPOS).

Deactivated status

A ‘deactivated’ status is not useable in an operational context within
the HI Service. It is no longer displayed in the HI Provider Directory
Service (HI HPD) and access is removed to:

-   HI HPD
-   HI Services via HPOS

The eHealth system (EHP) denies access to a provider once the HPI-I
record has been deactivated.

Note: the links between the HPI-I and associated organisations are not
end dated.
