Issuing of s161 notices on estimating parent

For reviewing purposes, only issue s161 notices to third parties to
gather and confirm income information. Rarely will a s161 notice be
issued to the estimating parent. If a s161 notice is issued to the
estimating parent and they comply (respond within 14 days) with the
notice, then their estimate can only be amended from the date they
respond. This is even if Child Support is aware of an earlier event that
affects the accuracy of the estimate.

Do not issue a s161 on the estimating parent if the estimate is able to
be reconciled at the end of the period. Do not continue with an estimate
review and instead allow the estimate to be reviewed or reconciled later
when more reliable information is available.

Retrospective estimate reviews (income decrease)

There is no legal impediment to reviewing an estimate in the event of an
income decrease. However, to remain consistent with the overall
intentions of the child support scheme it is Child Support policy that
very few assessments will be retrospectively amended where there has
been a decrease in income.

Retrospectively reviews can only be done where a customer does not
advise of a reduction in income within 14 days of the event.

Consider the following to determine whether a review is appropriate:

-   the information available from the customer who lodged the estimate
    or from other persons
-   the effect upon both parents of any change
-   the extent to which a review and amendment of the assessment would
    affect the accuracy of the estimate

Information available

Consider why the parent did not advise within 14 days of the event. The
reason for non-compliance must be compelling before a review would be
considered.

Example: if a parent was physically incapacitated around the time of the
event then this could be a compelling reason for why they did not
contact within 14 days of the event.

Consider the degree to which the decrease in income was foreseeable by
the parent when they lodged their estimate. Only if the decrease was not
foreseeable should a review be considered.

If there is no compelling reason as to why the customer did not contact
within 14 days of the event then do not review the estimate.

If there is a compelling reason then also consider the remaining 2
factors before continuing with a review.

Effect upon both customers of any change

Where a retrospective review/amendment is proposed, extreme care must be
taken to identify the effect on both customers. If an overpayment would
be created, then do not continue with an estimate review.

Accuracy of the assessment

A parent is required to keep their estimate accurate. However not every
change or event will cause the assessment to change greatly. For the
purpose of a retrospective decrease an estimate should not be reviewed
if the change in the liability is less than 10% of the existing child
support liability or if the liability adjustment for the 'retrospective
period' is less than $50.

Proceeding with an estimate review

Table 1: this table describes what action is required to proceed with
the estimate review.

| 1                                 | Question: Can Child Support amend |
|                                   | any part of the child support     |
|                                   | formula when reviewing an         |
|                                   | estimate?                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: No. When reviewing an     |
|                                   | estimate only consider whether to |

| 2                                 | Question: For an estimate lodged  |
|                                   | after 1 July 2008, when           |

|                                   | Review, is there any discretion   |
|                                   | as to how I calculate this        |
|                                   | amount?                           |

|                                   | Answer: No. The Child Support     |
|                                   | Income must reflect the           |
|                                   | customer's adjusted taxable       |
|                                   | income (less the customer's       |
|                                   | self-support amount, any relevant |
|                                   | dependent child amounts and/or    |

|                                   | period. This is irrespective of   |
|                                   | whether an estimate review was    |
|                                   | lodged later in the original      |

| 3                                 | Question: I have discovered that  |
|                                   | more than one event has occurred  |
|                                   | since the estimate was first      |
|                                   | accepted. How should I review the |
|                                   | estimate?                         |

|                                   | Answer: Only review any estimate  |
|                                   | once at any given time. The       |
|                                   | amendment date will be the        |
|                                   | earliest event date that resulted |
|                                   | in an increase in income. When    |
|                                   | calculating the adjusted taxable  |
|                                   | income ascertain the income       |
|                                   | received since the event date (or |
|                                   | notification date) until the end  |
|                                   | of the original estimate period   |
|                                   | taking into account all further   |
|                                   | fluctuations in income. This may  |
|                                   | include income received in a      |
|                                   | period that is now covered by a   |

|                                   | Answer: Lump sums need to be      |
|                                   | treated no differently than       |
|                                   | 'regular' assessable income       |

|                                   | sum would ordinarily constitute   |
|                                   | an event for reviewing purposes.  |

|                                   | income received since the event   |
|                                   | date (or notification date) until |
|                                   | the end of the original estimate  |
|                                   | period taking into account the    |
|                                   | assessable lump sum payment if it |
|                                   | falls within this period.         |

| 5                                 | Question: How do I review         |
|                                   | multiple estimates?               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: Each estimate must be     |
|                                   | looked at separately when         |
|                                   | considering a review. In other    |
|                                   | words, there must be an event     |
|                                   | defined for any estimate that is  |
|                                   | to result in an amendment.        |
