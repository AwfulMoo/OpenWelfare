This document outlines how Services Australia deals with cases where
there is no Customer Reference Number (CRN) registered.

Requests for information

All requests must be in writing. The Compensation Recovery Team (CRT)
cannot answer any verbal requests.

After getting a request from a compensation payer or customer’s
solicitor, the CRT do a national system search. If the search finds:

-   no CRN, the CRT will create one. This allows for the recording of
    the correspondence and reply
-   a child record, the CRT will convert the child to person record
