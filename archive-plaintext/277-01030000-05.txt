|                                   | Susan Hodges (payee) called to    |
|                                   | end the child support assessment  |
|                                   | Susan is a party to. I asked      |
|                                   | Susan should Paul Jones (payer)   |
|                                   | pay the child support directly to |
|                                   | Susan instead of to Services      |
|                                   | Australia.                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Susan advised the request was to  |
|                                   | end the child support assessment. |
|                                   | The child Steve is now 17 and has |
|                                   | an apprenticeship. Susan said 'I  |
|                                   | have decided I no longer want to  |
|                                   | receive child support from Paul   |
|                                   | Jones.' I asked Susan about being |
|                                   | in receipt of Family Tax Benefit. |
|                                   | Susan advised she is not          |
|                                   | receiving payments from           |
|                                   | Centrelink. I checked the         |
|                                   | Benefits window and Susan is not  |
|                                   | receiving FTB.                    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The date Susan wanted the         |
|                                   | assessment to end - Susan advised |
|                                   | from today.                       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Discussion with payee             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | I explained to Susan that:        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   recording the end date as     |
|                                   |     today, would end the          |
|                                   |     assessment tomorrow           |
|                                   | -   Paul is required to pay the   |
|                                   |     child support owing for this  |
|                                   |     month up to the end date of   |
|                                   |     the assessment                |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Susan requested the Services      |
|                                   | Australia collect this amount. I  |
|                                   | explained all other payments are  |
|                                   | up to date (neither parent has a  |
|                                   | default income).                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | I told Susan she can make another |
|                                   | application for child support up  |
|                                   | until Steve turns 18. I explained |
|                                   | I would contact Paul Jones to     |
|                                   | advise the case is ending.        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Discussion with payer             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | I called Paul (payer) and asked   |
|                                   | if it was a convenient time to    |
|                                   | talk. Paul was on a work break    |
|                                   | and could take the call. I        |
|                                   | explained to Paul that Susan      |
|                                   | Hodges (payee) had elected to end |
|                                   | the child support assessment.     |
|                                   | Paul reported Susan had said this |
|                                   | on the weekend when Paul picked   |
|                                   | up Steve. I advised Paul to pay   |
|                                   | $176.19, being the child support  |
|                                   | liability from the first of this  |
|                                   | month to the end date. This       |
|                                   | amount will be due and payable on |
|                                   | the 7th of next month. Paul said  |
|                                   | payment would be made via EW as   |
|                                   | this is how the child support is  |
|                                   | currently paid.                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Finalisation                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | I checked the Ending Assessments  |
|                                   | and noted at section 6.1 that I   |
|                                   | should not end the employer link. |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | In accordance with the Ending     |
|                                   | Assessments I have checked the    |
|                                   | case and there are no outstanding |
|                                   | issues.                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | I have made the decision to end   |
|                                   | the assessment. Susan Hodges      |
|                                   | (payee) made an election to end   |
|                                   | the child support assessment and  |
|                                   | is not in receipt of FTB.         |
|                                   | Therefore, I have ended the       |
|                                   | assessment in accordance with     |
|                                   | section 151 of the Child Support  |
|                                   | (Assessment) Act 1989.            |
