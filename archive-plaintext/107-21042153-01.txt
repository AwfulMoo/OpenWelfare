This document contains information on how to process and complete a
financial adjustment request for Medicare Recovery.

For Medicare Debt Management Officers (DMO) only

Types of financial adjustment

Financial adjustments are made to invoices in SAP for:

-   Debt write offs
-   Refunds
-   Fund transfers
-   Invoice reversals

Writing off a debt

Accountable Authority Instructions and Financial Delegations apply to
writing off debts. See the References page for links.

Writing-off a debt shows that:

-   recovery of an overpayment is unlikely, or
-   the debt is unrecoverable

Writing-off a debt does not:

-   remove the debt, or
-   prevent the debt from future recovery

Write off a debt only if:

-   it is not legally recoverable
-   the Chief Executive considers that it is uneconomical to pursue the
    recovery of the debt, or
-   it is permitted under another Act

Refunds

A customer receives a refund when there is credit on their account. This
happens if there is:

-   a duplicate or excess repayment
-   an incorrect repayment, or
-   incorrect receipting or allocation

The Resources page contains write off scenarios with suggested text for
SAP Notes, a table of General Ledger (GL) codes and contact details.
