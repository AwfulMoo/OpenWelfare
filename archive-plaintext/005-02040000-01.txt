This document outlines information on Australia's Refugee and
Humanitarian Program and the registration, assessment and referral
procedures for refugees, humanitarian entrants and protection visa
holders.

The Humanitarian Program

The Humanitarian Program has 2 components: Offshore and Onshore.

The Humanitarian Program - Offshore resettlement

This offers resettlement for people outside Australia who are in need of
humanitarian assistance. Specific visa subclasses are:

-   Refugee Visa (Subclass 200)
-   In-country Special Humanitarian Programme Visa (Subclass 201)
-   Global Special Humanitarian Programme Visa (Subclass 202) applicants
    for this visa are proposed for entry by an Australian citizen or
    permanent resident or an organisation and may be subject to an
    Assurance of Support under Community Support Program
-   Emergency Rescue Visa (Subclass 203)
-   Woman at Risk Visa (Subclass 204)

When a person arrives in Australia on one of these visa subclasses, they
are referred to a Humanitarian Settlement Program (HSP) service provider
to access settlement support under the HSP. Individuals granted a
subclass 202 visa under the Community Support Program (CSP) are not
eligible for settlement support under the HSP as they receive settlement
services from their Approved Proposing Organisation.

The Humanitarian Program - Onshore protection

This offers protection to people who wish to apply for protection (or
asylum) after arrival in Australia.

The specific visa subclass is:

Protection Visa (Subclass 866)

-   holders of a visa subclass 866 are not eligible for the Humanitarian
    Settlement Program

Note: holders of the above visa subclasses are eligible for all payments
upon entry to Australia (Offshore) or grant of the visa (Onshore). The
procedure covering Refugee and special humanitarian visa sub-classes
contains a full list of refugee visa sub-classes.

Notification to Services Australia

The customer or someone on their behalf (that is, Humanitarian
Settlement Program (HSP) or proposer) may contact Services Australia,
via telephone, in person, mail, fax or email about an intention to lodge
a claim for a social security payment.

From 1 July 2018, eligible customers will receive payments or concession
cards from the date they submit a complete claim with all relevant
support documentation.

Note: different processes apply for customers in vulnerable
circumstances, see Intent to claim and vulnerable customers.

For most refugees and permanent protection visa holders, the HSP
provider notifies the local refugee servicing contact/team of the
arrival and intent to claim. This may/may not include notification for
202 visa holders (as the proposer is expected to familiarise the entrant
with services such as those provided by Services Australia).

For any further assistance, contact the Refugee and Asylum Seeker
Helpdesk.
