Act references

Act or Guide references must be included when a significant decision is
made. There may be multiple references that could be applicable.

The most reliable and up-to-date source for the correct reference is the
applicable Operational Blueprint.

Listed under each Business Line are commonly used Act references. If not
listed, check the relevant Operational Blueprint. If unable to find a
suitable Act reference, send a request to the owner of the Operational
Blueprint.

Updates to the Act references list will only be made at the request of
the relevant business owner.

Note: for Quality Online Line (QOL) and Quality Management Application
(QMA), as long as the reference/ s used covers the scenario, an activity
should not be returned.

Select the required Business Line from the drop down box below.
