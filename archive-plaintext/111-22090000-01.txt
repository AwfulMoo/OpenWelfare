This document outlines the Quality Checking Procedures for Medicare bulk
billing, patient claims and public eligibility.

Services Australia administers Medicare on behalf of the Department of
Health and Aged Care, which is responsible for developing Medicare
policy. Services Australia pays Medicare benefits in accordance with
legislation governing Medicare and has no discretion to pay benefits
outside of this legislation.

The Quality Checking process is designed to ensure Services Australia is
correctly assessing Medicare patient and bulk bill claims and public
eligibility transactions, by checking information on source documents
against information entered into the Customer Information Control System
(CICS) Mainframe and the Consumer Directory Maintenance System (CDMS),
using the Medicare Quality Control System, also known as QBBI.

The Resources page contains a link to the Medicare Quality Checking
Flowchart and Checklist and links to general quality topics on the
Intranet.
