|                                   | This includes taxable income from |

|                                   | or shares, a small wage or        |

|                                   | When a person has lodged a tax    |
|                                   | return, they should advise the    |
|                                   | amount assessed by the ATO. This  |
|                                   | is the amount we assess as the    |
|                                   | person's taxable income for CA    |
|                                   | income test purposes. If a person |
|                                   | has accessed superannuation under |
|                                   | the First Home Super Saver (FHSS) |
|                                   | Scheme these withdrawals will     |
|                                   | contain some portion that the ATO |
|                                   | will determine as taxable and     |
|                                   | this will be reflected on an      |
|                                   | individual's NOA. However, for    |
|                                   | Services Australia purposes, FHSS |
|                                   | Scheme withdrawals are not        |
|                                   | counted towards taxable income.   |
|                                   | If referring to a person's NOA    |
|                                   | who has accessed superannuation   |
|                                   | under this scheme, any taxable    |
|                                   | income attributed to the FHSS     |
|                                   | Scheme must be excluded. Advice   |

|                                   | to be excluded should be obtained |
|                                   | as this detail will not be        |
|                                   | included on the NOA but is        |

|                                   | negative, it is taken to be zero  |
|                                   | before adding any investment      |
