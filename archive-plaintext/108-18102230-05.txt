|                                   | It should be noted that this is a |

|                                   | vulnerable care recipients in a   |
|                                   | period of confusion and           |

|                                   | little perception of their        |
|                                   | obligations, but it would         |
|                                   | probably be reasonable for a      |
|                                   | person entering low level care to |
|                                   | advise Services Australia within  |

|                                   | Consideration should be given to  |
