|                                   | address coded, contact the CDC    |
|                                   | processing team who will review   |
|                                   | the customer's circumstances, and |
|                                   | if in agreement, will instruct    |
|                                   | that the customer's address       |
|                                   | details be corrected. The CDC     |
|                                   | processing team will then exit    |
