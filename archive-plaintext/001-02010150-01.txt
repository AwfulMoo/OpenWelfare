This document outlines information on the labour market for customers.

Career choice

When people are making career choices they should take into account a
number of factors including their interests, aptitudes, remuneration,
expectations and requirements of the occupation, rather than just
employment growth.

Information related to projected employment growth by industry or
occupation or for current skill shortages is very volatile and variable
in its translation across different states and even regions.
Unemployment rates and employment growth rarely impacts on all
industries or occupations at the same rate.

If customers require labour market information they should be referred
to expert sources such as the Department of Education, Skills and
Employment website or a Career Counsellor. Information can then be
placed in context and is more likely to be accurate and up-to-date.

The Resources page contains links to labour market information.
