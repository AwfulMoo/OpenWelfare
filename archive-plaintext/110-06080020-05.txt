This page contains details of the layout of the search screens for the
Integrated Review System (IRS).

User Guides

To maintain consistency the IRS search screens of Review Enquiry (IRRE),
Review Totals (IRRT), Review Performance (IRRP) and National Search
(IRNS) all have the same basic search screen header layout with subtle
field differences.

The screen layout is similar to the Activity Management Search screens
and works on the same principle. To use the screen, code data into the
fields to specify a search, press [Enter] and the relevant search
results will be returned.

Each search criteria field has help text which can be accessed by typing
a '?' in the field.

Some fields are subject to exclusion processing which means that certain
codes can be excluded from the search, for example '/DNL' in the Rslt
Rsn: field would exclude Service Updates and Reviews with a Result
Reason code of 'DNL' (Did Not Lodge) from being returned in the search.

Some search screens do not allow a search to be conducted by Logon ID
unless the Logon ID belongs to the person undertaking the search. This
is to prevent inappropriate searches to track the performance of
individuals.
