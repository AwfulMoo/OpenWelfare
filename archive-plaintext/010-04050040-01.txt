This document outlines the procedure for assessing eligibility for the
66% concessional study load for Austudy.

Eligibility criteria for Austudy

One of the eligibility criteria for Austudy is that a customer needs to
be undertaking a full-time study load in an approved course of study. A
customer will be considered to be full-time if they are enrolled in at
least 75% of the normal amount of full-time study in the course.

Activity test and concessional study load

Under certain circumstances an Austudy customer can meet the activity
test as a 66% concessional study load student. This would happen where
they are studying at least two thirds of the normal amount of full-time
study and the reduced study load is as the result of institutional
requirements. In some cases this concession may only be granted for half
an academic year.

Reasons for the concessional study load

Secondary or tertiary students seeking Austudy under the two-thirds
concessional study load rule must be studying the reduced study load
temporarily because of one of the following reasons:

-   The education provider's normal requirements for the course
-   A specific direction in writing from the academic registrar or
    equivalent officer, or
-   A recommendation in writing from the academic registrar or
    equivalent officer for vocational or academic reasons. There is no
    need for a reason to be given for this recommendation. Note: the
    concession can only be granted for a period of up to half an
    academic year for this reason

Unfavourable decision

When making an unfavourable decision, speak to the customer:

-   explain the decision
-   give them a chance to provide more information, and
-   advise their review and appeal rights
