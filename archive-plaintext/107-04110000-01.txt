This document outlines information about the processing of MFU's
resulting from the re-reconciliation action on debts.

On this Page:

Waiver provisions for Child Care Benefit (CCB) and Family Tax Benefit (FTB) debts for 2000-01 financial year

The procedures are to ensure:

-   customers receive the full benefit of the waiver provisions for CCB
    and FTB debts, and
-   FTB and CCB debts that were included in the reconciliation process
    are checked

New measures for 2000/01 financial year only

Measures were introduced for debts resulting from:

-   the family assistance reconciliation
-   the Australian Tax Office (ATO) amended tax notice of assessment
    (TNA) re-reconciliation, and
-   Centrelink family assistance generated re-reconciliation

These measures assisted customers with the transition to the new family
payment system.

Waiver of the first $1,000 of a FTB and CCB debt

In some cases, there will be a waiver of the first $1,000 of a:

-   FTB debt and
-   CCB debt

Eligibility for waiver include:

-   customers paid FTB via instalments during 2000-01
-   mixed delivery customers (customers who have been paid instalments
    and paid via an FTB ATO claim or Centrelink past period claim for
    2000-01) and
-   CCB customers

A debt may occur following:

underestimation of:

-   adjusted taxable income (ATI)
-   maintenance income provided for payment of FTB by fortnightly
    instalments
-   a child's ATI (where the child's actual ATI exceeded the $7662 cut
    out) for FTB by fortnightly instalments and/or CCB by reduced child
    care fees

FTB being paid fortnightly for a child at a percentage higher than the
customer's share of care for that child, and

overestimates of child care usage provided for payment of CCB by reduced
fees

From July 2001, notice is required in respect of a debt

Customers must receive a notice to advise of a debt. Where a MFU exists,
letters are not automatically issued after re-reconciliation. Complete a
family assistance re-reconciliation advice including statement of
recoverable amount (Q418). This needs to contain:

-   the overpayment information
-   the special arrangements during the transitional year of the new
    family tax system (including the transitional $1,000 waiver), and
-   other information that relates to the reason for manually checking
    the record

This letter will ensure the customer is aware of the information
relating to their reconciliation for 2000-01. This family assistance
re-reconciliation letter replaces all previous entitlement letters.

When manual notices are required

The Q418 cannot include all circumstances that are reviewed when
processing some MFUs. Where this is the case:

-   send a manual free text letter (Q999)
-   use suggested text
-   use a Q999 only when instructed

For further information, see Family Tax Benefit (FTB) and Child Care
Benefit (CCB) debts for the 2000-2001 income year.

Family assistance re-reconciliation debts are not recoverable, until the
Q418 or equivalent has been issued.

Interest charge for former Centrelink customers

Include the Interest Charge warning in the Q418 on the account payable
for:

former Centrelink customers, no longer receiving Centrelink payments

-   who are not in an acceptable payment arrangement and
-   who do not have any excludable circumstances

See Interest Charge (IC) for Centrelink debtors no longer receiving
payments.
