This document outlines information about the processing of MFU's
resulting from the re-reconciliation action on debts.

Manual Follow Up for Family Tax Benefit (FTB) when a re-reconciliation held/parked debt is changed

A MFU is created when a FTB re-reconciliation activity generates a
change to an already calculated held debt amount. As an automatic advice
is not issued, the MFU is a reminder that a manual account payable
letter is required to be sent.

Waiver provisions for FTB and Child Care Benefit (CCB) debts for 2000-01 financial year

Debt waiver measures were in place for the 2000-01 financial year for
debts resulting from:

-   family assistance reconciliation
-   Australian Tax Office (ATO) amended tax notice of assessment (TNA)
    re-reconciliation, and
-   Centrelink family assistance generated re-reconciliation

These measures assisted customers with the transition to the family
payment system and ensured customers received the full benefit of waiver
provisions for FTB and CCB debts .

In some cases, a waiver of the first $1,000 occurred for a:

-   FTB debt, and
-   CCB debt

Eligibility for transitional waiver included:

-   customers paid FTB via instalments during 2000-01
-   mixed delivery customers (customers who have been paid instalments
    and paid via an FTB ATO claim or Centrelink past period claim for
    2000-01), and
-   CCB customers

A debt may have occurred due to :

underestimation of:

-   adjusted taxable income (ATI)
-   maintenance income provided for payment of FTB by fortnightly
    instalments
-   a child's ATI (where the child's actual ATI exceeded the $7662 cut
    out) for FTB by fortnightly instalments and/or CCB by reduced child
    care fees

FTB being paid fortnightly for a child at a percentage higher than the
customer's share of care for that child, and

overestimates of child care usage provided for payment of CCB by reduced
fees

Send manual account payable letter to customer

Customers must receive an account payable letter to advise of a debt.
Where a MFU exists, letters are not automatically issued after
re-reconciliation. When completing a family assistance re-reconciliation
account payable letter including statement of recoverable amount (Q418),
the following details must be included:

-   the service reason FTB and/or CCF
-   debt reason
-   start and end dates
-   amount paid and amount entitled
-   less any repayments
-   amount owing
-   recovery information
-   special arrangements during the 2000-01 (transitional year) of
    $1,000 waiver

This family assistance re-reconciliation account payable letter replaces
all previous entitlement letters.

Note: for FTB and/or CCB debts for the 2000-2001 income year, see Family
Tax Benefit (FTB) and Child Care Benefit (CCB) debts for the 2000-2001
income year.
