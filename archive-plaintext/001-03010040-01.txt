This document outlines the mutual obligation requirements for a sports
person claiming JSP or YA (job seeker).

Eligibility as a sports person

Sports persons may be professional or amateur athletes. It is possible
to consider a sports person as unemployed, even though they may commit a
lot of their time to sport.

To be eligible for payments with mutual obligation requirements such as
JSP or YA (job seeker), sports people need to meet all eligibility
criteria. This includes meeting their mutual obligation requirements.

To meet their mutual obligation requirements, the job seeker will need
to show:

-   they are actively seeking suitable paid work
-   their commitment to finding work, or undertaking study/training or
    other tasks or activities is not affected by training, practice, or
    competition, and
-   financial or sponsorship arrangements are not considered a form of
    employment

Income received by sports persons is assessed under the income test.
