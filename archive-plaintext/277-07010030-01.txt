This document outlines information relating to deemed and default income
processing for Child Support customers. Using the most up to date income
for customers is essential to ensure accurate assessments and
compliance.

On this Page:

Definition - deemed income

When a customer has:

-   not lodged an income tax return, or supplied an income tax
    declaration (ITD) , for the Last Relevant Year of Income (LRYI)
-   lodged an income tax return for the year prior to the last relevant
    year

Cuba automatically calculates a deemed income by applying an indexation
factor to the taxable income of the year prior to the LRYI, see Child
Support (Assessment) Act 1989 subsection 58(3) and section 58AA.

Note: if a derived income is recorded in Cuba, a deemed income will not
be calculated.

An income cannot be deemed manually. Cuba will automatically perform the
indexation of an income.

A deemed income is also known as a provisional income.

Definition - default incomes

There are two types of default incomes:

-   Indexed default, and
-   2/3 MTAWE

Indexed default

An indexed default income is calculated by indexing the most recent
Australian Taxation Office (ATO) assessed income by the ATI indexation
factor.

Note: an indexed default is only created where the ATO income is from
earlier than the financial year immediately prior to the Last Relevant
Year of Income (LRYI). An ATO income for the immediately prior year
would result in Cuba calculating a deemed income.

2/3 MTAWE (Male Total Average Weekly Earning)

An amount that is at least 2/3 of the annualised Male Total Average
Weekly Earnings (MTAWE) figure for the relevant June quarter.

Note: due to a change in the frequency of the average weekly earnings
series from quarterly to biannual, the annualised MTAWE figure will be
based on the relevant June quarter from 2013. Prior to 2013 the
annualised MTAWE figure was based on the relevant September quarter, see
the Child Support Guide 2.4.2: Formula tables and values.
