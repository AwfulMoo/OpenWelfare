This document outlines the information required when a customer
receiving family assistance payments becomes partnered. Details of
address, income, Tax File Numbers (TFN), child custody, child care and
child support may need to be updated to make sure payments are correct.

Individual and partner claiming FTB

If a customer and their partner are claiming FTB, the following
procedures contain further information:

-   Partner of a current Family Tax Benefit (FTB) customer claims family
    assistance and/or Parental Leave Pay (PPL)
-   Blended families and Family Tax Benefit (FTB)

Becoming partnered for FTB and CCS purposes

A person is considered partnered if they are:

-   legally married and not separated
-   living as a member of a couple, or
-   customer re-partnering with an ex-partner

When a customer advises they have become partnered, consider:

-   what payments and services they and their new partner are currently
    receiving
-   what payments and services they may be entitled to after they become
    partnered
-   if both members of the couple have FTB children in care, which
    member of the couple will claim FTB for the children, or whether
    they are each claiming for the children in their individual care as
    a blended family
-   the income of the customer and their new partner
-   for CCS purposes, the activity details of the customer and their new
    partner
-   any other changes such as change of address
-   how many children each partner is bringing to the relationship
-   child support issues for all children
-   if the customer and partner are reconciling, whether there was a
    previous shared care arrangement that needed to be ended

The following details are required and can be provided verbally:

name and date of birth of partner

date the customer became partnered

address and accommodation changes

provision of Tax File Number for family assistance and Paid Parental
Leave scheme payments for both the customer and their partner

an income estimate for the partner (and for the customer if they were

their current estimate). Note: the exemption to the FTB Part A income
test due to being in receipt of an income support payment and in an
employment income nil rate period may no longer apply in certain
circumstances
