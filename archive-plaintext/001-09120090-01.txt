This document outlines the process for determining whether an exemption
from compulsory mutual obligation or Participation Requirements can be
granted for job seekers and ParentsNext participants who have been
personally affected by a natural disaster or a declared emergency.

Mutual obligation requirement exemptions

Job seekers and ParentsNext participants are expected to comply with
reasonable mutual obligation requirements and participation requirements
in return for receiving a participation payment.

Where a job seeker or participant has been affected by a natural
disaster or declared emergency, consideration should be given to the
reasonableness of their requirements during the period that they are
affected.

There are a range of mutual obligation and participation exemptions that
may be granted to job seekers and participants who have been personally
affected by a natural disaster or declared emergency.
