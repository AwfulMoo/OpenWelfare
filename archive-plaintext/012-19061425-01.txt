Payments to service providers and suppliers

For an enterprise to receive payments in full, they must comply with the
requirements of the GST legislation. If they receive or may receive
payments from Services Australia that are not GST-free, they are
required to provide Services Australia the Australian Business Number
(ABN) of the enterprise, and enter into a Recipient Created Tax Invoice
(RCTI) Agreement with Services Australia, signed by an appropriate
representative of the enterprise. They are also required to advise
Services Australia of any changes or updates to the ABN or any Services
Australia Reference identification numbers that are linked.

Enterprises who receive or may receive payments from Services Australia
which include GST may include:

-   Pharmacies, pharmacists and other approved dispensers
-   Radiation-oncology clinics
-   Colostomy and ileostomy associations, and paraplegic and
    quadriplegic associations
-   Wholesale medicine suppliers for the Botox and in-vitro
    fertilisation or gamete intra-fallopian transfer programmes
-   Simplified billing agents
-   Software suppliers
-   Registered health care providers for the provision of National Bowel
    Cancer Screening Programme information
-   Department of Veterans' Affairs service providers

Providers update their GST status

Australia, but have updated the following details, will need to complete
a new form:

-   ABN details or status
-   GST registration status
