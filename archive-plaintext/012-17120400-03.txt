|                                   |     delegate for their            |

|                                   | The EL1 checks the entire claim   |
|                                   | including the withdrawal advice   |
|                                   | received from the insurer, HP     |

|                                   | withdrawal letter. If the EL1     |
|                                   | agrees with the AO                |
|                                   | recommendation, the file is then  |
|                                   | handed over to the EL2 delegate   |
|                                   | for approval.                     |

|                                   | this point the claim is then      |
|                                   | handed back to the first AO. Once |

|                                   | errors, the claim undergoes the   |
|                                   | QC again before progressing to    |
|                                   | the EL2 delegate for approval.    |

|                                   | reviews the claim, they can cross |
|                                   | out the typed name, handwrite     |
|                                   | their name and sign the file note |
|                                   | if they support the AO            |
|                                   | recommendation.                   |

|                                   | Once completed, the EL1 will      |
|                                   | progress the claim to the EL2     |

|                                   | with the AO recommendation they   |
|                                   | will sign the withdrawal letter.  |

|                                   | If the delegate does not agree    |
|                                   | with the recommendation, the      |
