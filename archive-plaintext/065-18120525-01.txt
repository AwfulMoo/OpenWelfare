This document outlines information about the sanction process for aged
care service providers. This process applies to all aged care types.

Historical SPARC process

The System for the Payment of Aged Residential Care (SPARC) is the
legacy aged care payment system for residential care. SPARC is a view
only system from 20 August 2022.

To view the legacy SPARC process, see the historical version.

Sanctions

The Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission imposes sanctions on aged
care services where:

-   there is an immediate and severe risk to the health, safety or
    wellbeing of care recipients, and/or
-   the service does not rectify continued non-compliance

A range of sanctions can be imposed on an agreed care service including
the restricted approval to pay new care recipients who enter into care
during the sanction period.

The type of sanctions imposed on an aged care service will depend on the
nature of the non-compliance.

The Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission will notify Services
Australia of all sanctions applicable to all care types via email.

Services Australia’s responsibility in the sanction process is enabling
the correct payment during the sanction period.

Sanction process

The sanction process differs depending on the type of aged care service:

For home care and flexible care services

-   there is no system functionality and staff intervention is needed to
    manually apply sanctions in the Aged Care Management Payment System
    (ACMPS)

For residential care services

-   there is system functionality to register, update or delete a
    sanction period in the Aged Care Staff Portal (ACSP)
-   registering a sanction automatically restricts all payments to all
    new care recipients who entered into the residential care service
    during the sanction period
