+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Credit cards that have been       |
|                                   | prepaid                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A positive balance on a credit    |
|                                   | card is a financial asset as the  |
|                                   | available balance can be used to  |
|                                   | purchase goods in the same way as |
|                                   | cash. The only exception to this  |
|                                   | is if the customer has already    |
|                                   | purchased other goods thereby     |
|                                   | reducing the available balance    |
|                                   | indicated.                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Example: The customer's credit    |
|                                   | card statement shows they         |
|                                   | previously paid $5,000 more than  |
|                                   | the outstanding balance. They can |
|                                   | prove that since then, the card   |
|                                   | has been used to purchase $3,500  |
|                                   | worth of goods (which are         |
|                                   | recorded elsewhere as             |
|                                   | appropriate). Services Australia  |
|                                   | would therefore only assess       |
|                                   | $1,500 as a financial asset       |
|                                   | because the customer now only has |
|                                   | access to this amount of their    |
|                                   | own money paid onto the card - if |
|                                   | any more money is spent it will   |
|                                   | be on credit.                     |
