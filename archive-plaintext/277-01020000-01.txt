This document outlines the processes for confirming identity.

Purpose of identity checks

Verifying a person's identity supports Services Australia's identity
confirmation obligations. Conducting an identity check may prevent
someone other than the parent, carer or their representative gaining
access to or changing their information. An identity check is not
intended to prevent or make it difficult for the parent or carer to
obtain assistance.

The Resources page contains links to information about identity
confirmation for Child Support customers.
