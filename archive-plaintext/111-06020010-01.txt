This document outlines how to book appointments in the Centrelink
Appointment System using the Customer First guided procedure.

Booking a customer appointment

There are protocols for booking appointments.

A person does not need to be a customer in receipt of payments or
services to make an appointment. However, to book an appointment they
must have a customer record.

Nominees: Correspondence nominees (NOC) and Correspondence/Payment
nominees (NOB) have permission to access the appointment service on
behalf of the customer and perform activities or updates for the
customer.

Reminders or advices about appointments

Customers can view and manage most of their appointments using their
Centrelink online account through myGov or the Express Plus Centrelink
mobile app.

View, reschedule or cancel an appointment

See View, reschedule or cancel an appointment in the Centrelink
Appointment System.

Contact in relation to a claim

If a customer is contacting in relation to an intention to claim an
income support payment, ensure all their contact details are current.

The Resources page contains contact details, a complete list of
appointment types and parameters, time display issues to consider when
booking and reviewing appointments, and a link to Office Locator.
