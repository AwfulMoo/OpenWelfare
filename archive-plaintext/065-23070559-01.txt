Portal (ACSP) are allocated and managed.

Aged Care Staff Portal (ACSP) allocation of work items

In the ACSP there are 2 ways that work items can be allocated to Staff
to manage and action.

-   Worklist in the ACSP: the Worklist gives Staff and Team Leaders a
    way to manage (and allocate) work on hand within the ACSP
-   Work Optimiser - Aged care: this tool was introduced 13 May 2023 to
    modernise the allocation of Aged Care work on hand through
    centralising and enabling prioritisation of work items

The Process page outlines the work items in the ACSP Worklist and Work
Optimiser for aged care.
