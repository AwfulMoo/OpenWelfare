|                                   | complaint was initially assigned. |

|                                   | reviewed and updated as required. |

Finalise the complaint and provide referral services

The outcome of a complaint may not always meet the customer's
expectation but the complaint is considered to be finalised if:

-   an investigation has been completed
-   the customer has been advised of the remedy and notified of the
    outcome by phone or in writing
-   the department has taken all reasonable actions to resolve the issue
-   the customer needs to go to court, apply to the Administrative
    Appeals Tribunal (AAT), lodge forms or attend to other matters
    outside the department's control to resolve their specific issues
    and has been informed of these options

Table 6: This table describes the processes to finalise a complaint
including contacting the customer to advise them of the outcome and the
processes to make an external referral, refer to Personalised Services
and recommend a Managed Service Plan (MSP).
