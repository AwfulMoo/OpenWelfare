This document outlines a brief overview of the assessment of assets from
a private trust or private company. Different rules apply to an approved
Special Disability Trust (SDT). This procedure does not cover SDTs.

Asset attribution

Attribution takes place when the controllers of the trust or company are
said to exercise control over the assets of the entity. This control is
expressed as a percentage and can only be determined by a Complex
Assessment Officer (CAO). The CAO also establishes who is attributed
with the assets of the entity, the amount of assessable assets each
entity has, and also determines the amount of attributable assets to be
included in a customer's asset assessment.

Asset attribution is the attribution of an entity's assessable assets to
a customer and is determined by the person's attribution percentage
multiplied by the entity's assessable assets. This determination could
involve attribution of assets from multiple trusts and/or companies.

When a person occupies a house owned by a private trust or company, the
decision on whether that person is a homeowner depends on whether it can
be concluded the person has a right or interest in their accommodation
which provides them with reasonable security of tenure.

A person may be considered a homeowner even if they are not an
attributable stakeholder of the trust.
