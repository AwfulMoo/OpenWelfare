This document outlines the evidence of identity (EOI) requirements for
individuals and sites applying for Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
certificates.

On this Page:

EOI for individuals

Unless known to Services Australia (that is, the person’s name already
exists in Certificate Issuance Management System –CIMS, or is a
registered Medicare Provider with a current open provider number),
individuals must establish their identity to get a PKI individual
certificate, or to become an Authoriser and/or Certificate Manager for a
PKI site certificate.

Individuals who are not known to Services Australia must provide
evidence of identity (EOI) that consists of:

-   one primary identification document - primary evidence is generally
    government issued evidence types with robust identity proofing
    processes, issuance and management processes. Where it is a physical
    document, it will generally contain a photograph and security
    features. For example, a passport
-   one secondary identification document - secondary evidence includes
    evidence types from government or non-government sources that are
    support by moderate identity proofing processes, issuance and
    management processes, for example, a Medicare card or credit card

Note: all EOI documents supplied to eBusiness must:

-   be certified - dated and signed with notation 'This is a true copy
    of the original as sighted by me’
-   include an Acceptable Referee Identification Form completed by the
    person who certified the documents with the applicant being the
    Certificate Manager completing the first page

EOI for businesses

Organisation identity proofing requires applicants to provide legal or
regulatory documents as evidence of the organisation’s existence. The
organisational documents presented for establishing the organisation
identity must identify the organisation and confirm that the Authoriser
is a member of the organisation.

Organisational identity proofing is satisfied if either Option 1 or
Option 2 is completed.

Option 1:

-   An original or certified copy of the notice issued by the Registrar
    of the ABR bearing the business entity’s name and ABN. If either the
    owner, chief capacity or other officer or employee with clear
    capability to commit the business entity is named as the Public
    Officer on the document issued by the Registrar of the ABR, then
    this document only will suffice, and
-   Online verification with the ABR to link the Organisation’s ABN to
    its business name

Option 2:

-   If the notice issued by the Registrar of the ABR cannot be provided,
    then a legal or regulatory document binding either the individual or
    the Authoriser to the business entity, and
-   Online verification with the ABR to link the Organisation’s ABN to
    its business name

EOI for a business must establish that the person applying to become the
Authoriser has the authority to commit the business. The business’s
existence can be established with the Australian Business Number (ABN).

The following business examples need to supply relevant documentation
listed below:

Sole Traders – all sole traders do not require a business document if
they have provided personal EOI documentation

Trust - If the organisation is a Trustee, eBusiness only require the
first 2 pages of the Trust Document (showing name of the trust) and the
last one, or more pages of the trust document showing the name of the
Trustee and Certificate Authoriser for a HCL application. If the Trustee
is a corporation, it must also provide 1 of the following certified EOI
documents below (under the ‘All other businesses’) section

Not-for-profit - If the organisation is a not-for-profit, a suitable
business document listed under “all other businesses” must be provided.
If 1 of these is not obtainable by the organisation, see the Resources
page for a link to the Australian Charites and not-for-profit
Commissions website

-   Conduct a search on the organisation, in the “People” tab to match
    Certificate Authoriser details to the organisation, and their
    position. If a link between the nominated certificate authoriser to
    the organisation can be confirmed, this satisfies EOI requirements

Government – for all Government organisations, a suitable business
document listed under “all other businesses” must be provided. If one of
these is not obtainable by the organisation, refer enquiry to eBusiness
leadership inbox

All other businesses must provide 1 of the following certified EOI
documents:

A document that establishes that the organisation is an entity

A legal or regulatory document that establishes the Certificate
Authoriser has the authority to commit the organisation

The organisation could do this with one document, for example, a
certified copy of the notice issued by the Registrar of the Australian
Business Register (ABR) bearing the business entity’s name and ABN with
the Authoriser’s name listed on the document. Note: a Service Officer
must verify online with the ABR to link the business’s ABN to its
business, or trading name, or

Other types of acceptable documentary evidence could include a certified
copy of any one of the following documents:

-   certificate of registration of a company issued by the Australian
    Securities and Investments Commission and the   Authoriser’s name
    listed
-   the notice issued by the Registrar of the ABR bearing the business
    entity’s name, ABN and the Authoriser’s name listed
-   contract for sale or purchase of business addressed to the
    Authoriser
-   statement of transaction issued by a financial institution in the
    name of the company, addressed to Authoriser and less than 1 year
    old
-   lease agreement for the organisation’s primary place of business
    addressed to the Authoriser
-   rates notice for the organisation’s primary place of business
    addressed to the Authoriser
-   certificate of change of name for the organisation issued by the
    Australian Securities and Investments Commission and addressed to
    the Authoriser, or
-   a document issued by the Australian Taxation Office with the
    organisation’s name and tax file number and addressed to the
    Authoriser
-   Minutes from a general meeting, on the organisations letterhead,
    including ABN details, and Authoriser’s name could be used as a
    starting point if no other documentation can be provided.
    Note: this document alone, should not be used as conclusive evidence
    to satisfy EOI requirements, and staff must take relevant steps to
    conduct further searches, or obtain additional supporting
    documentation to definitively establish the Certificate Authoriser’s
    legal authority and entity details,

If the organisation has a Services Australia PKI Certificate or is a
pharmacy with a Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme approval number and the
Authoriser is listed as the approved person these numbers can be
provided as evidence of the business and the authority for the
authoriser to commit the business all in one. The organisation must also
supply a valid reason for requiring an additional certificate.

Note: all EOI documents supplied to eBusiness must:

-   be certified - dated and signed with notation 'This is a true copy
    of the original as sighted by me'
-   include an Acceptable Referee Identification Form completed by the
    person who certified the documents with the applicant being the
    Certificate Manager completing the first page
-   show a clear link between the Australian Business Number (ABN) and
    the business or trading name

The Resources page contains detailed information about EOI documents and
links to applications for PKI certificates for individuals and sites.
