Historical information about PES eligibility

In general, PES is not payable to people receiving JSP (except single
principal carers), YA (as a job seeker) or PPP. However, if they were
granted PES for a course of study and transferred to JSP (except single
principal carers), YA (job seeker) or PPP after 1 July 2006 from either:

DSP (granted between 11 May 2005 and 30 June 2006) because they had a
partial capacity to work, or

PPS (received on or after 1 July 2006) because their youngest child
turned 8 years of age:

-   these customers must continue to be qualified for both the
    attracting payment (JSP, YA and PPP) and PES throughout
-   one of the PES qualification requirements is that the person is
    receiving a payment attracting PES
-   if the customer ceases to receive JSP (except single principal
    carers), YA or PPP they will cease to qualify for PES (nil rate is
    considered 'receiving')
