|                                   | requests a review of the decision |

|                                   | Consideration should be given to  |
|                                   | the CDP participant's ability to  |
|                                   | voice what they wish to appeal.   |
|                                   | For example: if a CDP participant |
|                                   | requests a review of a serious    |
|                                   | failure for persistent            |
|                                   | non-compliance, this should       |
|                                   | generally be interpreted as       |
|                                   | including all previously          |
|                                   | unreviewed failures that          |
|                                   | contributed towards the           |
|                                   | application of the serious        |
|                                   | failure.                          |
