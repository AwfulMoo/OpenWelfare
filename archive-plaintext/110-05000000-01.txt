This document outlines the government intent behind Rent Assistance (RA)
reviews.

Government intent

It is the government intent that if a customer is in receipt of RA,
their RA may be reviewed to ensure that their circumstances are being
assessed accurately and they are receiving the correct entitlement.

On this Page:

Reviews

Reviews are conducted on a regular basis. Currently, a customer
receiving RA can expect to be reviewed unless:

-   their current accommodation is exempt from verification (customers
    in boarding style accommodation, such as a boarding
    house/hostel/private hotel, may be selected for a review)
-   verification has been provided in the previous 6 months (or 12
    months for verification code VEE)

Even if a customer has provided a copy of a lease or tenancy agreement,
a review may still be issued.

Responding to a review

If a customer fails to respond to a review within the specified time
frame, RA will cease.

If a customer and partner are both issued with a review, only one is
required to respond.

A customer may confirm or update their details via phone self service,
online services, the Express Plus Centrelink app or by contacting the
Rent Review processing team. Customers should be encouraged to use self
service to respond to the review.

Customers can access their Rent Assistance Profile Review online by:

-   logging into my.gov.au
-   signing in to access their Centrelink online account
-   selecting My Details from the menu
-   selecting Personal and contact details
-   then Rent Assistance reviews

The Rent Assistance Profile Review is also available from the Tasks
section on the landing page.

See Rent Assistance (RA) Profile reviews for further information.

The Resources page contains contact details for the Rent Review
processing team.
