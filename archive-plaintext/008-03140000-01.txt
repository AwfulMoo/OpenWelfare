This document outlines how to assess payment rates for Disability
Support Pension (DSP) customers under 21 years of age (including those
who are permanently blind).

Customer circumstances

DSP customers under 21 years (including those who are permanently blind)
are paid at different rates if they are dependent, independent or if
their circumstances meet other defined criteria.

The circumstances of a DSP customer under 21 years are relevant to a
number of outcomes including:

-   the maximum basic rate of DSP
-   income and assets limits
-   payment of Rent Assistance (RA)

Assessing payment rates for customers living in their parental home

Customers under 21 years who live in their parental home are usually
paid the dependent rate of DSP.

In some specific circumstances they may be paid the independent DSP or
equivalent rate, or the ’21 and over’ (common) DSP pension rate whilst
residing in the parental home.

Return to parental home

When a customer under 21 years returns to live in the parental home and
is paid the independent rate, their circumstances must be reassessed to
see whether they:

-   retain their independent status and can continue to be paid the
    independent rate
-   meet other criteria and can be paid the independent rate or the ’21
    and over’ (common) DSP pension rate, or
-   are now dependent and should be paid at the dependent rate

Parental income

DSP customers are not subject to the Parental Income Test (PIT).

Assessing payment rates for specific circumstances

A DSP customer can be paid at the independent rate if they are:

-   16 or 17 and living away from the parental home because of their
    medical condition
-   18 to 20 (inclusive) and living away from the parental home

Assessing payment rates for customers who have or have had a dependent child

DSP customers under 21 years who:

-   currently have a dependent child in their care are eligible for the
    '21 and over' (common) DSP pension rate from the date the child
    entered their care. This is a different rate to the independent rate
-   previously had a dependent child in their care are eligible for the
    independent rate from the date the child left their care. This is a
    different rate to the ‘21 and over’ (common) DSP pension rate

Assessing payment rates for independence – criteria that may apply

DSP customers under 21 years can be paid the independent rate if they
meet 1 of the following criteria:

-   are or have been married or in a registered relationship
-   are or have been a member of a couple for at least 1 year, or 6
    months in exceptional circumstances
-   have had a dependent child. Note: If they currently have a dependent
    child in their care, the ’21 and over’ (common) pension rate will be
    paid automatically when the dependent child details are recorded
-   are an orphan
-   are a refugee without parents in Australia and not dependent on
    anyone else
-   their parents cannot exercise their responsibilities for example, in
    prison, mentally incapacitated, living in a nursing home or missing
-   in state care or only stopped being in state care due to their age
-   have worked an average of 30 hours per week for at least 18 months
    during any 2 year period
-   have worked part-time for at least 15 hours per week for at least
    104 weeks (time worked does not have to be consecutive) since
    leaving secondary school
-   earned at least 75% of the National Training Wage Schedule (NTWS)
    rate in any 18 month period since last leaving secondary school

Unreasonable to live at home

Customers aged 16 or 17 can be paid the independent rate if it is
unreasonable for them to live at home (UTLAH) due to extreme family
breakdown, other similar exceptional circumstances, or their parents are
unable to provide a home. To assess UTLAH for customers aged 16-17 years
of age, book a Social Work Unreasonable to Live at Home (UTLAH)
appointment.

Note: a social worker referral is only required when a UTLAH assessment
is needed to determine the independence rate. However, if a customer
asks to speak to a social worker an appointment should be booked.

Reviewable Independence

Customers under 21 years of age who are claiming DSP may have previously
had their independence status assessed for Youth Allowance (YA), ABSTUDY
or DSP. Some categories of independence are subject to review if there
is a change in customer circumstance.

The Resources page contains independence categories that are subject to
review.
