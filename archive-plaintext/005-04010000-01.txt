This document outlines the services available for customers who have
limited English proficiency or who are deaf or hard of hearing.

Interpreter services

Interpreters help customers who speak a language other than English
conduct their business.

The benefits of using an interpreter include:

-   improved customer and staff experience
-   greater accuracy in the information recorded
-   fewer customer debts or compliance issues
-   less re-work or time resolving issues

Using qualified interpreters

Services Australia prefers the use of qualified interpreters. The use of
a customer's friend or relative as the interpreter is actively
discouraged. This avoids potential problems with language competency,
impartiality, content integrity and confidentiality.

Providing feedback

Staff are encouraged to provide feedback about their experience using
interpreters.

Feedback helps identify how services can be improved. It can include the
quality of the phone line, the interpreter's performance and
professionalism, complaints, compliments, or system issues.

To provide feedback, see Resources, Forms and the Interpreter Feedback
Form.
