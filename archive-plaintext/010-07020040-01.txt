This document outlines what action to take when students fail to notify
they have ceased full-time study within their notification period.

Requirement to notify

Students are required to notify Services Australia when ceasing
full-time studies. Failure to notify cessation of study, or reduction in
study load, within the notification period means that a debt may be
raised for the period of time that the student was not eligible to
receive their student payment.

Payments affected

The following payments may be cancelled and a person may incur a debt
for not notifying the agency that they have ceased full-time study:

-   Youth Allowance (YA)
-   Austudy
-   ABSTUDY
-   Pensioner Education Supplement (PES)

Determining when a potential debt has occurred

See:

-   Raising debts for students
-   Debt Management and Information System (DMIS) screens

Unfavourable decisions

See Advising verbally of an unfavourable decision.
