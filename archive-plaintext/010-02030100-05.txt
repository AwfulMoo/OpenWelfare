|                                   | Anna has completed one year of a  |
|                                   | Bachelor of Science degree at     |
|                                   | University of Queensland,         |

|                                   | physics-based units. After        |
|                                   | spending the summer break doing   |

|                                   | construction company, Anna        |
|                                   | decides to instead study a        |
|                                   | Bachelor of Engineering programme |
|                                   | at the University of Sydney.      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The University of Sydney requires |
|                                   | Anna to undertake a testing       |
|                                   | activity before admission to the  |
|                                   | Engineering course is approved.   |
|                                   | It is unclear why this testing    |
|                                   | activity would be necessary to    |
|                                   | determine Anna's academic         |
|                                   | suitability to undertake the      |
|                                   | course, as Anna has already       |
|                                   | studied in a similar field at a   |
|                                   | Bachelor level.                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The University of Sydney provides |
|                                   | a letter confirming Anna's        |
|                                   | academic ability to undertake the |
|                                   | Engineering degree cannot be      |
|                                   | assessed from the previous study  |
|                                   | because Anna gained only          |
|                                   | pass-grades in units while doing  |
|                                   | the Bachelor of Science degree.   |
|                                   | The letter explains Anna needs to |
|                                   | be tested to ensure the more      |
|                                   | rigorous demands of the           |
|                                   | Engineering program can be met.   |
|                                   | Anna is therefore assessed as     |
|                                   | eligible to undertake the testing |
|                                   | programme for entry to the        |
|                                   | Bachelor of Engineering at the    |
|                                   | University of Sydney.             |
