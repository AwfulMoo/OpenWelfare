Do not undertake any MALEP assessments. The Department of Social
Services (DSS) have paused all Moving to an Area of Lower Employment
Prospects (MALEP) assessments.

This document outlines when a Moving to An Area of Lower Employment
Prospects (MALEP) employment related exclusion period can be waived.

Suspension of MALEP due to Coronavirus (COVID-19)

From 25 March 2020 to 22 March 2021, the MALEP policy is suspended. This
means that no MALEP assessment is required.

For customers:

-   who contact and have a 26 week penalty, waive the MALEP from the day
    before the date of contact. This will put them onto a payment on the
    date of contact
-   on payment pending review (PPR) of a previous MALEP assessment,
    finalise it without applying a penalty

MALEP considerations

MALEP applies to job seekers in receipt or claiming JobSeeker Payment
(JSP), Youth Allowance (YA) principal carers receiving JSP and job
seekers obligated to comply with the Special Benefit (SpB) Nominated
Visa Holders mutual obligation requirements.

A job seeker can incur an employment related exclusion period of 26
weeks if they reduce their chances of getting a job by moving to an area
of lower employment prospects.

A MALEP employment related exclusion period can be waived from the date
a job seeker moves back to their original place of residence or to
another area of the same or higher employment prospects compared with
their original place of residence.
