P24845 problem and workaround

The P24845 system issue may cause impact in the following scenarios:

-   Where a step parent is claiming Family Tax Benefit (FTB) that has
    been transferred to them from a biological parent, and the other
    biological parent also becomes entitled to receive FTB, for example,
    their percentage of care increases to above 35%, and they make a
    claim
-   Where the biological parent transfers their FTB to a step parent and
    they later separate. Care details for the child will not be
    transferred correctly to Child Support if a past period care refresh
    is requested
-   The care may transfer to the step parent's child support record
    (with incorrect child relationship details) causing inaccurate child
    support assessments and impacting multiple parties

As a result, where FTB is transferred out to partner ('TOP' is coded on
the Child Override/Claim (CHOC) screen - from parent to step parent).The
customer is a Centrelink and Child Support mutual customer. These
records are to be referred for investigation. See the Resources page of
Assessment of shared care arrangements for Family Tax Benefit (FTB) for
further information and details of text for DOCs and workaround.
