This document outlines the process for reimbursement of fares for a trip
taken by an ABSTUDY student who has since died.

Eligibility for ABSTUDY FAA

ABSTUDY FAA is payable to eligible ABSTUDY students who have to live
away from their permanent home to study or who are participating in an
approved Away From Base activity.

Method of payment

Where an entitlement to reimbursement of travel costs has been approved,
payment of the FAA should be made to the student, third party or
institution that incurred the expense. Where the deceased customer
incurred the expense, the lump sum is to be paid to the customer's
account, as it may be assumed that the legal executors of the estate
will have access to the bank account. Immediate payment of FAA may be
arranged if the authorised person is in financial hardship due to
verified costs associated with the student's death.

Coding FAA claims to avoid overpayment

Coding the claim for FAA for a deceased ABSTUDY student is similar to
processing payments for a living student. However, as the student's
record may not be current, special care is taken to avoid overpayments
arising, inappropriate advices being sent to relatives, etc.

Australian Apprentice

An Australian Apprentice is not entitled to FAA for the Australian
Apprenticeship.
