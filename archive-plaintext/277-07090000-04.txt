SO4

-   To reconcile an estimate

Authorised staff must use the Estimate reconciliation checklist macro
when documenting estimate reconciliation approvals.

Note: this does not prevent an officer at the SO3 level who has the
support of their team leader from carrying out this type of work.
However, the final decision to reconcile must be  made by an officer at
the SO4 level or above.
