Escalation of display issues

This process does not apply if the customer disagrees with the
immunisation status held on the child's Centrelink record.

Within the Child Immunisation Summary, the following display issue must
be referred by a Service Support Officer (SSO) to the National ICT
Referral Officer (NIRO) when encountered by processing or telephony
staff:

If information contained on the customer's record, for example child
details on the Child Selection (CHS) screen or AIR link status details
on the Medicare Information (MEI) screen is not replicated in the Child
Immunisation Summary.

The ICT Referral Request webform is available from Business Processing
Branch intranet page > Featured Content > National ICT Referral Process.

Scenarios

Allowable timeframe override

An FTB Part A rate reduction due to immunisation can only be reassessed
up to 1 July of the previous financial year.

Example â€“ child met requirements prior to 1 July of the previous
financial year: An FTB Part A rate reduction has been applied from 1
December 2018 due to a child not meeting immunisation requirements. On
17 July 2020, the AIR provides an updated immunisation status, with a
Last Immunisation Update Event (LIUE) date of 30 November 2018.

The customerâ€™s FTB Part A is reassessed. Due to the allowable timeframe,
the FTB Part A rate reduction due to immunisation is reassessed for the
period 1 July 2019 to 16 July 2020. The FTB Part A rate reduction for
the period 1 December 2018 to 30 June 2019 does not change. If the
customer meets all other eligibility requirements, an immunisation
override can be recorded to reassess the rate of FTB Part A for the
period 1 December 2018 to 30 June 2019.

Permanent humanitarian visa holder

Example - Customer and child arrive in Australia on separate dates: A
customer has arrived in Australia on a 200 visa on 1 October 2018 but
the child does not arrive in Australia until 15 October 2018. The
exemption start date can be no earlier than 15 October 2018 and can be
applied until 14 April 2019 if eligible requirements are satisfied.

At the time of assessment, if there is information available on the
customerâ€™s record which shows the child became up to date with their
immunisations on 10 November 2018, the exemption can only be applied up
until 9 November 2018, the date before the child met immunisation
requirements.

Example â€“ Customer commences care after the date the child arrived in
Australia: A customer has arrived in Australia on a 200 visa on 10
November 2018. Their young nephew arrives in Australia on the 17
November 2018. The nephew is placed into the customerâ€™s care on the 26
November 2018. If all eligibility requirements are satisfied, the
exemption start date can be no earlier than 26 November 2018 as this is
the date the customer commenced care of the child.

The exemption can only be applied up until the earlier of, 16 May 2019
(6 months after childâ€™s first arrival into Australia) or the date before
the child met immunisation requirements.
