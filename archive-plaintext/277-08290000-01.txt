This document outlines the process for withdrawal or return of a Child
Support assessment from being administered by the Inland Revenue, New
Zealand (NZIR) authorities.

Withdrawal or return of case from NZIR to Child Support

This process is used when:

-   Child Support identify NZIR are no longer required to collect on a
    transmitted (out) case, or

A request from Child Support to NZIR to withdraw an NZ ‘Out’ Case occurs
when:

-   The case has no debt (general withdrawal). A case may be eligible
    for general withdrawal where the payer has paid their debt in full
    and there is no ongoing liability
-   General withdrawals are identified through general case management,
    such as being notified the customer is deceased or collection by
    Services Australia is no longer required

An NZ 'Out' case is returned to Child Support from NZIR when NZIR
determine the:

-   payer cannot be located in New Zealand
-   child support debt has been deemed non collectable
-   payer is deceased
-   payer is no longer habitually resident of New Zealand
