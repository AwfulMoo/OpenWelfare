+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| PRVS                              | This is the first status written, |
|                                   | it shows that a reconciliation is |
|                                   | required for this family unit, no |
|                                   | summarised data will be present   |
|                                   | on this record.                   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| AMET                              | This status means that the        |
|                                   | adequate income rules have been   |
|                                   | met and that this family unit is  |
|                                   | ready for processing, this will   |
|                                   | normally occur within the next    |
|                                   | few working days.                 |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| ASSD                              | This means the SSP has been       |
|                                   | processed and an assessment is    |
|                                   | pending wash up via the debt      |

|                                   | has been received. This status    |
|                                   | will wait until the previous      |
|                                   | result has been completed, then   |
|                                   | apply the updated information,    |
|                                   | potentially triggering a new      |
|                                   | reconciliation instance           |
|                                   | (re-reconciliation).              |

|                                   | and a previous result has been    |
