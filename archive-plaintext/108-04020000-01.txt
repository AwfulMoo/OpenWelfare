of payment unless specifically exempted under a provision of the Act.

Applying appropriate assets test

When calculating a customer's entitlement to a payment under the Social
Security Act 1991, qualification, eligibility and payability is tested
under various rules. This is done to ensure that financial assistance is
directed to those members of the community most in need.

The Assets Test is based on the principle that customers with
substantial assets, apart from their principal home, should use these
assets to produce income for their own support.

On 1 July each year, assets thresholds are indexed to the Consumer Price
Index (CPI) along with deeming thresholds and Income Test free areas.

The type of payment a customer is applying for or receiving determines
which Assets Test to apply. A customer can also apply under hardship
provisions if necessary.

For Disability Support Pension (DSP) customers aged under 21, the
allowable assets thresholds for full pension are the same, but the cut
off limits for part pension will be lower due to the lower maximum rate
of payment.

Assessable and exempt assets

Section 11 of the Social Security Act 1991 defines an asset as
'property'. Property is not defined in the Act, but has an established
common law meaning - any possession, belongings or property owned solely
or partly, including beneficial interests, and/or debts owed to a
person. Some assets are exempt under the Social Security Act 1991,
section 1118.

Market value

Assets are assessed at their net market value. Net market value is not
the replacement value or the amount it is insured for - it is the amount
likely to be received by selling the asset. The market value of an asset
can be reduced if there is an encumbrance or unsecured loan against it.

If the asset is owned with another person, the asset value for a
customer is determined using their proportion of their interest in the
asset.

Property settlements

Property settlement pending: The percentage of ownership the person has
before they are separated remains after the separation until any
property settlement is finalised. If the customer asserts a beneficial
or trust ownership different to the legal ownership of an asset, the
trust and companies provisions are applied to determine existence of a
trust and attribution of income and assets. If the assets are held in
trust, for example with a solicitor or accountant, the trust and
companies provisions apply. The source of the funds and prior legal
ownership are used when determining attribution. If a customer is unable
to realise assets due to a pending property settlement, the Assets Test
hardship provisions may apply.

Property settlement finalised: The outstanding balance of a property
settlement is an asset. If the court order allows for income/interest to
be paid on the outstanding balance, the interest is assessed as income.
The trust and company rules apply to any trust created or declared by a
court, tribunal or arbitrator as a result of a property settlement, or
created as a result of a property settlement.

Deprivation: When a person gives away assets as a result of a court
order or property settlement following a relationship breakdown, it is
not regarding as deprivation for Social Security purposes. Satisfying
the demands of a court order or property settlement is considered
adequate consideration for the asset.

Loans

An amount lent by a customer is an assessable asset and is assessed as a
financial investment subject to the deeming provisions. A customer may
apply through the Financial Information Service (FIS) Officer to the
Minister for Social Services to exempt investments and loans from the
deeming provisions.

Real estate, businesses, trusts and companies

To work out the total net value of a customer's assets, the primary
production aggregation rules are applied.

Real estate, businesses, trusts and companies are assessed as primary
production assets or a non-primary production asset so that negative net
primary production assets can be offset against other primary production
assets.
