This document outlines how compensation clearances are located, checked
and recorded.

Compensation

A compensation clearance is a notification result of a compensation
claim assessment conducted by the Compensation Recovery Team (CRT) and
is used to determine the customer's payability for an income support
payment.

Issue a Compensation and Damages (MOD C) when a customer:

-   notifies of a previously unidentified compensation incident, and
-   advise they received, are receiving or may be eligible to receive
    compensation

Customers who make an online claim for JobSeeker Payment (JSP), Youth
Allowance (job seeker), Age Pension or Low Income Health Care Card (LIC)
will be asked to provide their compensation information within their new
claim.

Clearances are required for criminal injury compensation claims. The CRT
must determine if those claims will be treated as compensation and
provide a clearance. Payments made to victims of crime by victims’
compensation schemes established under Commonwealth, State or Territory
laws are not compensation as defined by Social Security Law, however
other payments such as restitution made by the criminals may be
compensation.

When clearances are not needed

Clearances are not needed for compensatory payments, such as:

-   income protection policies attached to superannuation policies
-   payments made to ‘victims of crime’ by victims’ compensation schemes

See The effect of compensation on Social Security payments.
