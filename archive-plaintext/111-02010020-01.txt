This document outlines the process of accessing archived receipt numbers
using the Archiving and Culling Engine (ACE) application.

Scope and functions of ACE

In the past, the Receipt Confirmation System (RCS) provided customers
with evidence of their contact with Centrelink Call (CC), however this
system had limitations outside the CC network. Also, the receipt numbers
were restricted to 4 digits. Archiving was done through the Customer
Archiving Retrieval (CAR) system.

The introduction of the ACE application for generating and archiving
receipt numbers enables handling of the new format of 6 digit receipt
numbers, regardless of the channel through which they were generated,
including CCs and service centres.

This ACE system provides the facility to store, retrieve and display
archived data to internal users. However, the restricted access to view
archived receipts of Restricted Access customers will remain. Receipt
numbers are held for 56 days prior to being archived via the browser
based ACE system.

Customer Record Access Monitor (CRAM) reports, logging data accessed
from ACE, will also be retained.

The Resources page contains a link to the Archiving and Culling Engine
