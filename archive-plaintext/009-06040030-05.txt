|                                   | A carer provides care on Tuesday  |
|                                   | morning and the care receiver     |
|                                   | enters respite that same day.     |
|                                   | They provide care again on the    |
|                                   | Friday afternoon that the care    |
|                                   | receiver returns home from        |
|                                   | respite. This would result in a   |
|                                   | total of 2 respite dates being    |
|                                   | coded. The start date is          |
|                                   | Wednesday and the end date is     |
|                                   | Thursday.                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This is because the carer is      |
|                                   | taken to have provided care on    |
|                                   | the Tuesday and again on the      |
|                                   | Friday. There are only 2 full 24  |
|                                   | hour periods from midnight to     |
|                                   | midnight that the care receiver   |
|                                   | was absent.                       |
