|                                   | clients they have been treating   |

|                                   | be paid when 2 providers are from |

|                                   | Answer: where a second provider   |

|                                   | initial consultation), it is      |
|                                   | reasonable for this provider to   |
|                                   | be able to claim the End of Cycle |
|                                   | report. This situation could      |
