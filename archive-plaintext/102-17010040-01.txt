This document explains how Service Officers can help parents to identify
and address individual challenges and help them to prepare for, find and
maintain paid work. Through early identification of these challenges,
the transition to being competitive in the employment market and seeking
employment will be easier.

Overcoming challenges and achieving participation

It is important to help customers to recognise that overcoming each
challenge is a milestone or personal achievement. It needs to be
recognised that for some customers, achieving participation is a long
term challenge and it is not anticipated that all customers would
overcome their challenges immediately.

First Contact Concessions, Carers and Seniors (FCCCS)

As part of the First Contact Concessions, Carers and Seniors (FCCCS)
workflow, a customer's job readiness and capability to look for and
accept work will be determined. This will result in an appropriate job
readiness pathway being identified for the job seeker. This may include
an appointment with a Service Officer or specialist officer (for
example, social worker).

During the interview, the Service Officer will build a holistic picture
of the customer's individual and family circumstances, and assist the
customer to set participation focused goals and identify challenges to
achieving these goals. The challenges identified will determine the type
of interactions required and solutions brokered. All progress made
toward work outcomes, including personal and skill development, training
and volunteering will be recognised at subsequent service update
contacts.

Examples of challenges faced by parents

Examples of challenges that may be faced by parents include:

-   cultural issues impacting on participation options available
-   family and domestic violence
-   partner's attitude to customer participating
-   impact of participation on time spent with the children
-   child care issues (especially for older children)
-   workforce disincentives

Employment income

When the customer has employment income:

-   If under Age Pension age - Working Credits may enable the customer
    to keep some of their income support payment while they are working
-   If over Age Pension age and in receipt of a pension (excluding
    Parenting Payment Single (PPS)) they may be entitled to the Work
    Bonus. Note: the Work Bonus is not used in the customer's
    transitional rules calculation, however the Work Bonus will still be
    used in the comparison calculations and partners may still benefit
    by the reduction in total income
-   If the customer's income reduces their fortnightly rate to nil and
    some of that income is employment income, the customer's payment may
    remain current at nil rate for up to 6 fortnights and are able to
    maintain certain benefits during the employment income nil rate
    period
-   Resume payments within the employment income nil rate period without
    the need to reclaim if income decreases
