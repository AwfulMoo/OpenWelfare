Agreements and arrangements

Services Australia's relationships with other government
departments/agencies are bound by a high-level multilateral strategic
partnership document and several detailed Bilateral Management
Arrangements (BMA), each between Services Australia and individual
departments/agencies.

BMAs specify Commonwealth services to be provided by Services Australia
and conditions applying to the provision of those services. They improve
assurance arrangements to provide greater transparency over Services
Australia's performance in meeting service delivery outcomes, risk
management and accuracy targets.
