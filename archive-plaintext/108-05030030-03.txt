|                                   | including 1 December 2019, the    |

|                                   | related reason, the DOV of the    |
|                                   | estimate must be no earlier than  |

|                                   | overseas absence. John has never  |
|                                   | been in receipt of FTB. John      |
|                                   | claims FTB and is eligible from   |
|                                   | the date Emily’s FTB had          |
|                                   | cancelled (14 October 2019). The  |
|                                   | DOV must be corrected from 1 July |
|                                   | 2019 to 14 October 2019.          |
