The Department of Health are regularly adding, removing and changing MBS
items.

Help is available for health professionals who have MBS interpretation
questions:

-   AskMBS email advice service assists health professionals understand
    and comply with MBS requirements
-   Health Professional Education Resources Gateway and Services
    Australia website have education guides, infographics, and eLearning

Services Australia staff should give general MBS interpretation advice
about:

-   patient or health professional eligibility
-   payments, and
-   claiming

See the assessing rules in QITI and explanatory notes on MBS Online when
giving advice or processing a claim. Note: information in QITI is for
internal use only.

Contact a Programme Support Officer (PSO) for technical support.

If a health professional is asking which item relates to a specific
service they will perform or has a complex enquiry, tell them to contact
askMBS.

Examples of when Services Australia staff should assist with
interpretation

Query: What does it mean in the description for item 30071 when it says
‘as an independent procedure’?

Action/Response: Staff can first look at item description in MBS Online.
They could also search that phrase in:

-   MBS Online to find Note TN.8.1

Assist the caller to navigate to information in MBS Note TN.8.1 and/or
the Education guide - Billing multiple MBS items on the Services
Australia website. If the enquiry changes to be about a specific
clinical situation to meet the requirements of an independent procedure
refer them to askMBS.

Query: What does it mean when my patient’s claim was rejected with
reason 162, and what can I do?

Action/Response: Assist the caller to locate the Education guide -
Medicare reason codes and reducing claim rejections on the Services
Australia website. Show them the row in the first table for reason code
162. If needed, perform the security check and follow Release of claims
information in Medicare. Read text or notations in claims and on patient
history.

Examples of when the caller needs to contact askMBS

Query:

-   What mental health item should I bill now that it is a new calendar
    year?
-   What is this conflicting or unclear information on MBS Online?
-   How am I meant to interpret this legislation?
-   How can I give feedback on factsheets or news articles?
