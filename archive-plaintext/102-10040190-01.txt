This document outlines information about the restoration of Parenting
Payment (PP) following suspension or cancellation.

Re-establishing qualification or payability

Restoration of PP may be possible when a customer's qualification or
payability for payment has been re-established after PP has been
cancelled or suspended, and PP qualification and payability have
continued since the date of suspension/cancellation.

This may be the result of:

-   a change in the customer's circumstances
-   a review of a decision made by Services Australia
-   the customer providing information
-   negotiating a Job Plan after failing to do so, or
-   an event which has made the customer temporarily ineligible for
    payment

Generally, there must not be a gap in entitlement for PP to be restored.
When restoring payments it is important to establish continuing
qualification for payment. If there have been any changes in the
customer's circumstances, these must be recorded before restoring
payment to avoid incorrect arrears being generated.

Reasons for restoration

PP can only be restored if one of the following applies:

-   The payment is suspended and there is a reason that is restorable.
    PP will automatically cancel 12 weeks after the date of suspension
-   The decision to cancel PP was incorrect and the review of decision
    (13 week) rules allow for the date of effect of the restoration to
    be the date of the suspension/cancellation

Restoration limitations

In most cases, payment cannot be restored if it is more than 13 weeks
after the customer was notified of the decision to cancel or suspend.
The customer must reclaim the payment.

Outstanding compliance action

Where a customer has a participation-related payment suspension or
outstanding compliance action, they may need to re-engage with their
provider and/or speak to the Participation Solutions Team (PST) about an
outstanding failure investigation before reporting can be finalised.
Service Officers must check the Participation Compliance Hub and where
the:

-   Outstanding compliance actions section shows a compliance
    investigation is outstanding, assist the job seeker to contact the
    Participation Solutions Team and/or
-   Completed provider compliance actions section shows outstanding
    actions the provider is responsible for managing, tell the job
    seeker to contact their provider

Family Tax Benefit (FTB) and Child Care Subsidy (CCS) customers

Before restoring, it is important to check the:

-   FTB status. If FTB is cancelled (for example, off income support
    CAN-OIS), FTB may need to be restored
-   annual family income estimate to ensure it is still reasonable and
    request a revised annual income estimate if appropriate
-   CCS Activity Test details are correct and if needs to be updated
