This document outlines the return of payments made to a customer and the
effect on reconciliation of Family Tax Benefit (FTB) and Child Care
Benefit (CCB). If the payment is not reissued to the customer, it should
not be included in the reconciliation calculation.

Returned payments

The following returned payments are covered:

-   FTB instalment payments
-   FTB or CCB reconciliation payments

Payments may be returned by a financial institution because a customer's
account details are incorrect or the account has been closed. In this
case the payment should be reissued after correcting payment destination
details.

When a customer manually returns a payment by cash/cheque in a Service
Centre receipts should be issued via ESSentials Production staff with
access to the system. A manual receipt should only be issued if a
printed ESSentials Production receipt is not available.

If a reconciliation payment is manually returned because the customer
states they are not entitled to the payment, the payment should not be
reissued and needs to be excluded from the reconciliation calculation.

To ensure the reconciliation result is correct, a reconciliation manual
adjustment needs to be recorded to exclude the payment from the
reconciliation calculation.

Note: the returned payment should not be reissued to the customer once
the manual adjustment has been made.
