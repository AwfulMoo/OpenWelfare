|                                   | SO5. For example if a customer    |
|                                   | elected to exercise their right   |
|                                   | to lodge a Change of Assessment   |
|                                   | (COA) application upon receipt of |

|                                   | In these cases, the Debt          |
|                                   | Enforcement SO5, in consultation  |
|                                   | with the team leader, must decide |

|                                   | demand. This is especially        |
|                                   | important when the debt has       |
|                                   | changed.                          |

|                                   | The team leader will arrange for  |
|                                   | the case to be reviewed within 5  |

|                                   | litigation. If appropriate, the   |
|                                   | team leader allocates the         |
|                                   | customer and any other parties    |

|                                   | Also the amount of the debt can   |

|                                   | consideration. The court has the  |

|                                   | respondent's address to have      |
|                                   | changed since the profile was     |
|                                   | completed or for the respondent   |
|                                   | to actively avoid service. In any |

|                                   | likely that the process server    |

|                                   | attempts at personal service.     |

|                                   | can then be filed by the Legal    |

|                                   | effecting personal service have   |
|                                   | been made, and any other relevant |

|                                   | whether there is sufficient       |
|                                   | evidence that sub service will    |
|                                   | bring the documents to the        |

|                                   | If the court is satisfied it is   |
|                                   | appropriate to make orders for    |
|                                   | substituted service, it may make  |
|                                   | an order substituting another way |
|                                   | of serving the documents, such as |
|                                   | by post and an SMS advice to the  |

|                                   | receives the orders for           |

|                                   | respondent in accordance with the |
|                                   | orders.                           |

|                                   | Note: if the court is not         |
|                                   | satisfied that sufficient         |
|                                   | attempts at personal service were |
|                                   | attempted it may refuse to make   |
|                                   | the orders for substituted        |
|                                   | service. In this case, the court  |
|                                   | will usually direct that further  |
|                                   | attempts at personal service be   |
|                                   | attempted in the first instance.  |

|                                   | A respondent may be unwilling to  |

|                                   | due to their assertion that they  |

|                                   | instance, it is not uncommon for  |
|                                   | a respondent to seek to exercise  |

|                                   | In the event the respondent       |

|                                   | proceeding is on foot, subject to |
|                                   | the individual circumstances of   |
|                                   | the case the matter may be        |
|                                   | adjourned until the avenue of     |
|                                   | appeal (and any subsequent appeal |
|                                   | rights) have been finalised or    |
|                                   | have lapsed.                      |

|                                   | This approach ensures the agency  |
|                                   | is not seeking to enforce a debt  |
|                                   | which may be subject to change    |
|                                   | (increase or decrease) at a later |

|                                   | The court does not have the       |
|                                   | jurisdiction to make any orders   |
|                                   | in relation to the remission of   |
|                                   | late payment penalties (LPP). It  |
|                                   | is unlikely that the agency will  |
|                                   | agree to remit any LPPs once a    |
|                                   | matter proceeds to a contested    |
|                                   | hearing as the failure by the     |

|                                   | Note: the court has a general     |
|                                   | discretion as to whether or not   |
|                                   | it will enforce the child support |

|                                   | may refuse to make any orders if  |

|                                   | Enforcement SO5 can instruct      |
|                                   | their Legal Service Provider to   |
|                                   | seek the same orders (final or    |
|                                   | interim) which were originally    |
|                                   | attempted to be negotiated during |

|                                   | negotiations. In doing so, the    |
|                                   | Debt Enforcement SO5 must consult |
|                                   | with LIR and act upon the advice  |

|                                   | capacity to repay the debt, for   |

|                                   | It is usual for the court to      |
|                                   | award costs in accordance with    |
|                                   | the Court Scale of costs. See     |
|                                   | Schedule 1 of the Federal         |
|                                   | Magistrate Court Rules 2001 or    |
|                                   | Schedule 3 of the Family Law      |
|                                   | Rules 2004 which provides for     |
|                                   | certain amounts to be claimed in  |
|                                   | relation to each stage of the     |
|                                   | proceedings. As a general rule,   |
|                                   | costs on the Court Scale are      |
|                                   | usually less than the actual      |
|                                   | legal costs which have been       |
|                                   | incurred by the agency.           |

|                                   | -   for enforcement of the debt   |
|                                   |     if payment is not made in     |
|                                   |     accordance with the orders    |

|                                   | of Western Australia              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Unlike the Federal Circuit Court, |
|                                   | the Family Court of Western       |
|                                   | Australia does not have a         |
|                                   | schedule of fixed costs for       |
|                                   | proceedings before it. Instead    |
|                                   | the Court has an itemised scale   |
|                                   | of costs in Schedule 3 of the     |
|                                   | Rules.                            |

|                                   | In enforcement matters, the       |
|                                   | Registrar relies on the Court's   |
|                                   | power to make a costs order in a  |
|                                   | fixed amount, pursuant to Rule    |
|                                   | 19.18(1) (a). The quantum of the  |
|                                   | costs order sought is based on an |
|                                   | estimate of the scale             |
|                                   | (party-and-party) costs of the    |

|                                   | As a general rule, the Registrar  |
|                                   | seeks an order for costs fixed in |
|                                   | an amount in the Form 2           |
|                                   | Application in a Case, and will   |
|                                   | seek an order for this amount if  |
|                                   | the matter is finalised at or     |

|                                   | If the matter is listed for       |
|                                   | hearing more than once, the Legal |
|                                   | Service Provider will generally   |
|                                   | seek a higher costs order. The    |
|                                   | respondent is given notice of the |
|                                   | higher costs claim in the Minute  |
|                                   | of Proposed Orders and the        |
