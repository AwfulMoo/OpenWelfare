This document outlines the reductions and deductions that may impact on
AVTOP.

Reductions to AVTOP

When determining the amount of AVTOP, consider the following reductions
to the payment amount.

If the primary victim or the deceased person acted without due regard to
the consequences of their actions or against advice, the AVTOP must be
reduced by the percentage stated below.

If the victim:

-   failed to take reasonable steps to avoid harm or acted recklessly
    when the terrorist act occurred - 10%
-   travelled to the place where the terrorist act occurred despite
    travel advice on an Australian government website advising people to
    reconsider the need to travel to that place because of a high risk
    of a terrorist act - 15%
-   travelled to the place where the terrorist act occurred despite
    travel advice on an Australian government website advising against
    travelling to that place because of a high risk of a terrorist act -
    20%
-   was directed by an official of Australia or a foreign country to
    leave or not to go to the place where the terrorist act occurred
    because of a high risk of a terrorist act - 50%

If the primary victim or the deceased person acted without due regard to
the consequences or against advice in relation to more than one
circumstance mentioned, the AVTOP must be reduced by the circumstance
that has the highest percentage reduction.

The reductions apply to a:

-   primary victim 16 years or over, and
-   deceased person 16 years or over

Travel advices

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) periodically issues
travel advices for countries around the world to help travellers make
informed decisions about their travel and safety. These travel advices
are split into 4 levels:

-   Level 1 - Exercise normal safety precautions
-   Level 2 - Exercise a high degree of caution
-   Level 3 - Reconsider your need to travel
-   Level 4 - Do not travel

See the Resources page for a link to DFAT’s Smartraveller website for
more information on the definition of these travel advices.

When considering a reduction to an AVTOP, consider the travel advice in
place when the claimant, or the deceased person, left the country.

Travel advice:

-   set at level 3 due to terrorism - apply a 15% reduction
-   set at level 4 due to terrorism - apply a 20% reduction

The application of the 10% and 50% reductions will depend on the
circumstances of the case.

Circumstances when AVTOP must not be reduced

An AVTOP must not be reduced if the person was in the place where the
terrorist act occurred:

-   for a humanitarian purpose, or
-   on official business for the government of the Commonwealth, a State
    or Territory, or
-   the Secretary of the Department of Home Affairs considers it is
    appropriate, in the circumstances of the particular case, not to
    reduce the amount of AVTOP

Note: the Secretary of the Department of Home Affairs has delegated
their powers to the Secretary of Services Australia, under the Social
Security Act 1991 and the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999
regarding the AVTOP scheme.

Deductions to AVTOP

If the claimant or the deceased person has received any of the following
payments, they will be deducted from the AVTOP amount:

-   The amount of any financial assistance a primary victim received
    from a foreign country for an injury arising from the terrorist act
-   The amount of any financial assistance the secondary victim received
    from a foreign country for the death of the deceased person
-   The amount of any financial assistance received from a foreign
    country by the deceased person for injuries suffered by the deceased
    person as a direct result of the terrorist act
-   The amount of any AVTOP received by the deceased person as a primary
    victim

Deductions apply to all primary and secondary victim claims.
