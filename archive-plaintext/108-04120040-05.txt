|                                   | the deprivation disregarded.      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Check if the farmer would have    |
|                                   | qualified for a pension under     |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | For example:                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   the farmer met the severe     |
|                                   |     financial hardship criteria   |
|                                   |     and                           |
|                                   | -   the farm met the criteria of  |
|                                   |     an unrealisable asset at the  |
|                                   |     time of transfer              |

|                                   | financial assets                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A single person who gives away    |
|                                   | financial assets worth $300,000   |
|                                   | and ends up with $5,000, is not   |
|                                   | eligible.                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This is because the hardship is a |
|                                   | direct result of giving away the  |
|                                   | assets.                           |
