This document outlines procedures for staff during initial phone contact
with customers and the public.

Greetings

When answering a call the Service Officer can use a best practice
greeting phrase or an appropriate greeting of their own, for example:

-   'Hello, this is [Service Officer’s name], can I start with your name
    please?' (unauthenticated record)
-   ‘Hi, my name is [Service Officer’s name], may I start with your
    Centrelink reference number please?’ (unauthenticated record)
-   ‘Hi, this is [Service Officer’s name], how can I assist you today?’
    (authenticated record)
-   ‘Hello, my name is [Service Officer’s name], how can I help you
    today?’ (authenticated record)

The Service Officer then authenticates the customer appropriately,
depending on the authentication level achieved on Services Australia
Workspace.

It is appropriate to confirm the name of the caller regardless of the
authentication status before proceeding. This is to ensure that Customer
Overview is displaying the correct record.

If the caller is unauthenticated, Proof of Record Ownership (PoRO) must
be completed before proceeding with the call.

Confirming customer phone numbers

This may be completed in the IVR. The Update Phone Number instructions
must be checked on Customer Overview to confirm the action required.
This is a Business Imperative.

Customer Overview displays cards with a Green icon for successful
interactions that need no further action:

-   Phone number confirmed
    The phone number the customer is calling from has been checked
    against the number on the customer record
-   Updated phone number
    The customer has successfully updated their phone number in the IVR

Customer Overview displays cards with an Amber or Red icon if Service
Officer action is needed:

-   Phone number check required
    The IVR could not confirm the customer’s phone number. Phone details
    must be checked and updated if necessary
-   Please update Phone
    The IVR has received new telephony details from the customer.
    However, the update was not completed as the customer did not have
    the required level of authentication
-   Attempt to update phone number failed
    There was a technical error in the IVR. Phone details must be
    checked and updated if necessary
-   An alternate method
    All contact details must be updated from claim information in new
    claims and scanned images

Confirming family assistance income estimates

If the customer has Voice Print Authentication this may be completed in
the IVR. Staff must check the income estimate instructions on Customer
Overview to confirm if action is required. This is a Business
Imperative.

Customer Overview displays cards with a green icon for successful
interactions that need no further action:

-   Income estimate confirmed: the customer has confirmed the income
    estimate recorded and no further action is needed

Customer Overview displays cards with an amber or red icon if Service
Officer action is needed:

-   Income estimate update required: the customer has indicated they
    would like to update their family assistance income estimate. The
    income estimate must be updated via normal processes
-   Income estimate update failed: there was a technical error in the
    IVR. The income estimate should be checked and updated via normal
    processes if required

Reviewing Display on Access(DOA) DOCs

Service Officers must read and comply with all DOA DOCs at every
customer contact. It is possible to access DOA DOCs in Customer First
and Process Direct.

These alerts display immediately when a customer record is accessed and
help to provide a better customer service. This is a Business
Imperative.

When accessing a customer record, staff must:

-   check the Document List (DL) screen for DOA DOCs
-   open and read each DOA DOC on the customer's record
-   follow the directions and information in each DOA DOC

Staff must read and adhere to DOA DOCs to avoid:

-   placing customers affected by family and domestic violence at risk
    of further harm
-   exposing customers and the agency to fraudulent activity
-   inadvertent disclosure of a customer’s personal information
-   staff being exposed to extreme customer aggression
-   staff being unaware of relevant critical information such as
    bereavement periods and Managed Service Plans

Checking the Customer Issues page

Service Officers must check the Customer Issues page in Customer First
at every customer contact. Customer Overview will warn if there are
issues on the Customer Issues page.

The Customer Issues page is used to ensure any mandatory actions or
handoffs are handled correctly.

Any payment related issues must be actioned if the Service Officer has
the capability.

The Customer Issues page can be accessed in Customer First in the Quick
Links (left panel), in the Other Links block on the Workspace screen, or
at the top right corner of the Customer Summary (CRN/BP) screen.

Any actions outside the Service Officer's skills must be handed off to
the relevant queue or business area, and the customer advised why their
call is being transferred.

Promoting self service

Self service is the preferred way for customers to do business with the
agency and for most customers is the quickest and easiest option. Self
service is available through mobile apps, online accounts and phone self
service.

Staff are expected to:

-   transition customers to self service at every opportunity, unless
    the customer is not eligible or the staff member deems it
    inappropriate
-   educate customers about self service options
-   encourage eligible customers to enrol a voiceprint
-   troubleshoot self service issues and, where possible, transition the
    customer back to self service to complete their business
-   escalate self service issues unable to be resolved through
    troubleshooting

This is a Business Imperative.

Applying first contact resolution principles

Service officers must apply first contact resolution principles.

Privacy

Privacy and confidentiality provisions administered by the agency must
be followed at all times. This includes times when a Service Officer may
accidentally access a record of a person they know.

If staff, during the course of their duties, inadvertently access the
information of a person in whom they have a personal interest, they must
record the incident on the Inadvertent Access Register. This was
previously known as the Oops register.

Call transfers from Child Support

When an announced transfer (warm) is received from Child Support, a full
authentication check is not required because both agencies have a
similar authentication procedure.

Child Support will provide the necessary identifying details to locate
the correct customer record when transferring the call. Note: if the
customer has a password on their record, check this before proceeding
with the enquiry.

The Resources page contains intranet links to privacy and secrecy and
information release.
