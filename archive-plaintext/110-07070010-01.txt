This document explains how to reissue an End of Year (EOY) circumstance
review form for AIC. Services Australia uses the form to confirm an AIC
student's circumstances, eligibility and entitlements for the following
year. It is sent to current applicants during the last week in October.

Applicant needs duplicate review

Reprint the review on the system. If unable to reproduce, send a manual
review. AIC trained Service Officers can take the applicants EOY review
details verbally.

Review not automatically sent

The system will send the review to all AIC applicants except:

-   AIC Pensioner Education Supplement (PES) students
-   students that are current with a future cancellation date of other
    than 1 January next calendar year
-   secondary students in Years 12 or 13
-   students who will be over the maximum AIC age by 1 January of the
    following year
