Forms

Claim for a Commonwealth Seniors Health Card form (SA296)

Comparable Foreign Payments and New Zealand

The New Zealand Agreement on Social Security differs from all other
Agreements in that if a registered member of the PBS was to pursue their
entitlement to New Zealand (NZ) Superannuation (New Zealand's equivalent
to Australia's Age Pension) the NZ authorities would require the person
to lodge a claim for Australian Age Pension. If the claim for Age
Pension is granted, even at Current Zero Rate (due to the direct
deduction of the NZ payment) the person would no longer be qualified at
any time for a Pension Bonus Payment.

|                                   | the customer has met the work     |
|                                   | test requirements (or been a      |
|                                   | non-accruing member) during the   |
|                                   | pre-application period. The       |
|                                   | registration may also be          |
|                                   | backdated to the customer's Age   |
|                                   | Pension qualification date if     |
|                                   | they meet the special factors     |
|                                   | that would allow the registration |
|                                   | to be backdated.                  |

|                                   | John's date of qualification for  |
|                                   | Age Pension occurs on 1 February  |
|                                   | 2001 and John applies to register |
|                                   | for PBS on 2 January 2004. John   |
|                                   | worked a 35 hour week from 1      |
|                                   | February 2001 until 30 June 2003. |
|                                   | Therefore, John satisfies the     |
|                                   | work test over the part of the    |
|                                   | pre-application period from 1     |
|                                   | February 2001 to 31 January 2003  |
|                                   | and would have accrued 2 full     |
|                                   | bonus years.                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | During the period 1 February 2003 |
|                                   | to 30 June 2003 John worked 735   |
|                                   | hours (21 weeks x 35 hours).      |
|                                   | Although work ceased on 30 June   |
|                                   | 2003 John failed the PBS work     |
|                                   | test on 6 November 2003 because   |
|                                   | 735 hours of work = 279 PBS days  |
|                                   | (because 960 hours of work = 365  |
|                                   | PBS days so there are 2.63 hours  |
|                                   | in a PBS day and 1 February + 279 |
|                                   | days = 6 November).               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | John applies to register for PBS  |
|                                   | on 2 January 2004. Therefore      |
|                                   | John's pre-application period     |
|                                   | ends on 1 January 2004. As the    |
|                                   | work test was failed on 6         |
|                                   | November 2003 John has not met    |
|                                   | the work test for the entire      |
|                                   | pre-application period and the    |
|                                   | application for registration      |
|                                   | cannot be accepted and it should  |
|                                   | be rejected.                      |

|                                   | pre-application period            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | In the example above if John had  |
|                                   | met the work test for the entire  |
|                                   | pre-application period the date   |
|                                   | of registration could either be   |
|                                   | the date it was lodged - 2        |
|                                   | January 2004 or the date of       |
|                                   | qualification for Age Pension - 1 |
|                                   | February 2001, depending on the   |
|                                   | circumstances of the case. If     |
|                                   | special factors exist, the        |
|                                   | discretion would generally be     |
|                                   | exercised in the customer's       |
|                                   | favour to backdate the            |
|                                   | registration to date of           |
|                                   | qualification for Age Pension.    |

| 3                                 | Example of using partner's work   |
|                                   | to meet work test when partner    |
|                                   | has previously claimed Age        |
|                                   | Pension but customer hasn't       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | When Bob turned age 65 and was    |
|                                   | working casual hours and could    |
|                                   | not guarantee the 20 hours per    |
|                                   | week minimum requirement to       |
|                                   | become a member of the PBS, so    |
|                                   | claimed the Age Pension. Bob's    |
|                                   | partner, Mary was below Age       |
|                                   | Pension age at that time and      |
|                                   | worked part-time 10 hours per     |
|                                   | week. Bob found full-time work 4  |
|                                   | months later and Age Pension was  |
|                                   | cancelled because their combined  |
|                                   | income was above the limit. When  |
|                                   | Mary turned Age Pension age a     |
|                                   | year later Mary retired from work |
|                                   | and their combined income reduced |
|                                   | to below the limit. Bob was still |
|                                   | working full-time and intended to |
|                                   | continue working for at least     |
|                                   | another year. Mary could either   |
|                                   | claim Age Pension (part rate) or  |
|                                   | defer Age Pension and register    |
|                                   | for the PBS using Bob's work to   |
|                                   | meet the work test. Both Bob and  |
|                                   | Mary would need to register in    |
|                                   | the Scheme even though Bob will   |
|                                   | never be paid a bonus because Bob |
|                                   | had previously been paid Age      |
|                                   | Pension.                          |
