This document outlines information relating to reviews for the Home
Equity Access Scheme (the Scheme).

Overview of the Scheme

The Scheme enables customers to access equity in their Australian real
estate via a loan administered by Services Australia. The loan is paid
to customers in fortnightly instalments, or as lump sum advance payments
for a short period or until the maximum loan amount is reached.

Loans are repayable by the customer to the Commonwealth.

A person must maintain eligibility and comply with notification
obligations throughout their participation in the scheme. Services
Australia also conducts periodic and circumstance reviews.

Most Scheme reviews are generated automatically with some requiring
manual action. Manual Scheme reviews are actioned by Complex Assessment
Officers (CAO) in the Home Equity Access Scheme National processing
team.

Periodic reviews

The Scheme periodic reviews are generally automated and do not require
manual intervention. Exceptions may apply, for example where the
customer is deceased. Periodic reviews include:

-   fortnightly calculation of interest and update of loan balance
-   annual update of the customer’s age component and maximum loan
    amount
-   annual issue of the person’s loan statement
-   annual real estate review (manual review)
-   checking if the customer’s loan balance is approaching, or exceeded,
    the Maximum Loan Amount (MLA)
-   Consumer Price Index (CPI) reviews

Customers can review their circumstances through the online services via
the Home Equity Access Scheme summary screen.

Circumstance reviews

A manual follow up (MFU) is automatically generated and a Work Item
assigned to a Complex Assessment Officer (CAO) for investigation if any
of the following change of circumstances is recorded for a Scheme
customer:

-   single customer becomes a member of a couple
-   partnered customer separates from their partner
-   customer or partner passes away
-   the customer’s qualifying payment is cancelled (in certain
    circumstances)
-   the customer is of Age Pension age (and not receiving Age Pension)
    and their qualifying payment (for example, DSP) is cancelled

An MFU is created if task locking conflicts prevent certain automated
updates from finalising.

Customers obligation to advise of change in circumstances

Customers receiving a loan under the Scheme must advise Services
Australia within 14 days of any change in circumstances that affects
their eligibility or the real estate used to secure the loan. This
includes circumstances where a customer:

-   becomes a member of a couple, separates from their partner or their
    partner passes away
-   or any co-owner of secured real estate becomes bankrupt or subject
    to a personal insolvency agreement
-   intends to change the title details or dispose of (for example,
    sell) any secured real estate
-   takes out, or changes the details of, a mortgage on any secured real
    estate
-   intends to use the secured real estate to guarantee a loan taken out
    by the customer or another person
-   allows the insured value of the secured real estate to fall below
    the market value of all buildings on that property

Failure to notify of changes to the secured real estate may result in
the customer being ineligible for the No Negative Equity Guarantee. See
Settlement of Home Equity Access Scheme loans for more details.

Customers must also notify Services Australia if they:

-   close, change or can no longer use the account their payments are
    sent to
-   are sent to prison or charged with an offence and are in custody on
    remand
-   change their contact details or their residential or postal address
-   leave the country, temporarily or to live somewhere else

Customer initiated requests

If a customer wishes to make changes to their loan, they must request
the change in writing.

The easiest way for customers to do this, is to request the change via
their myGov Centrelink online account.

This includes if they want to:

-   change, cease or re-start fortnightly loan payments
-   request an advance payment
-   increase or decrease their Maximum Loan Amount (MLA)
-   apply, remove or adjust a Nominated Amount
-   make changes to the real estate asset(s) being used as security for
    the loan

Most requests for change can be via the customer’s myGov Centrelink
online account. Alternatively, customers can be sent a Home Equity
Access Scheme variation form (SA497) to request these changes.

If the customer is partnered, both members of the couple must consent to
any change to elements of the loan. Consent can be provided using their
Centrelink online account, or on the SA497 form. The underlying
principle is that both partners are aware of the terms of the loan
including any changes, regardless of whether the partner shares
ownership of the real estate used to secure the loan. For example, where
a new asset is added as security, both partners must provide consent.

Similarly, in the case where there is a third party/trust or company
interest in a loan, the third party/trust or company must also agree in
writing to any change.

For information about actioning customer initiated requests see Home
Equity Access Scheme.
