Impact of coronavirus (COVID-19)

From 30 March 2020 until 27 September 2020, job seekers who were in
receipt of JobKeeper Payment were automatically exempt from mutual
obligation requirements.

From 28 September 2020, this no longer applied. Job seekers were
required to meet their mutual obligations unless they were exempt for
another reason. See Altered mutual obligation requirements for job
seekers due to coronavirus (COVID-19) response.
