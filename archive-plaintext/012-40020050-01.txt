LDA pathology services procedures

Effective 30 October 2011, the payment system automatically applies
restrictions between pathology items according to the patient episode
(date of request (DOR)/PA line). This includes some time dependent
restrictions and some item association restrictions.

LDAs must be used for all occasions when 6-RST ADJ displays. Use of
processing indicator (PI) PI 58 only applies when an LDA cannot be
performed. When using PI 58, PI 42 must not be used to override a
restriction until PI 58 has been applied to the item.

The Process page provides a table showing how to action pathology claims
with 6-RST ADJ message.

Processing Indicator (PI) 58 LDA adjustments for pathology services

When the 6-RST ADJ message displays for pathology services wherever
possible an LDA must be performed. Although there are some occasions
using the LDA system is not possible and PI 58 can be used to adjust
benefit for those pathology services.

Instances where an LDA is not possible are:

-   the patient episode has been claimed using different claiming
    channels, such as bulk bill and patient claims
-   the claim has been lodged through the Simplified Billing/ECLIPSE
    channel
-   the Medicare benefit cheque for the previously claimed services is
    unpresented
-   bulk bill services for the same patient episode have been claimed as
    in and out of hospital services
-   the patient episode has been bulk billed by 2 different pathology
    providers

When using PI 58 and coning applies to the patient episode, the
adjustment amount must be calculated for all services in the whole
episode so that only the adjusted amount for the 3 items to which coning
applies is paid.

PI 42 must not be used to override a restriction between 2 restrictive
services until after PI 58 has been used as the restrictive item may
have the highest schedule fee.

The patient episode coning rule applies to pathology tests requested by
general practitioners (GP) but not to pathology tests requested by
specialists or consultant physicians (speciality code ranges: 001-099
and 800-899), dentists or in-hospital services.

Example for PI 58 LDA adjustments for pathology services

A patient has been paid 3 separate pathology claims, all services have
been requested by a general practitioner (GP) and the system has applied
coning adjustments so only the 3 items with the highest schedule fee
have been paid. A new pathology claim has been lodged for an item that
restricts with an item on history and the item in the new claim has a
higher benefit. As the Medicare benefit cheques have not been presented,
an LDA is not possible.

The adjustment amount must be calculated based on the 3 items (that are
not exempt from coning) with the highest schedule fee.

Non-coned patient episodes LDA procedures

LDA for pathology services where coning doesn't apply include:

in-hospital services

services requested by:

-   specialists
-   consultant physicians
-   dentists

LDAs must be performed for restrictions between bulk billed pathology
items rendered by the same practitioner in separate manual and
electronic claims.

For example:

-   item 66695 was claimed in a patient episode requested by a
    specialist in bulk bill claim identification (ID) K0014
-   the same pathologist has subsequently claimed item 66698 in bulk
    bill claim ID K0022, also requested by a specialist
-   when assessing claim ID K0022, item 66698 comes up as restricting
    with item 66695 in claim ID K0014 on the patient's history
-   the return message 6-RST ADJ is displayed as item 66698 has a higher
    schedule fee

None of the services are endorsed as rule 3 (R3) exempt or S4B3
services. An LDA is required to pay the difference between items 66695
and 66698.

The patient episode coning rule does not apply to pathology tests
requested by specialists or consultant physicians (specialty code
ranges: 001 - 099 and 800-899), dentists or in-hospital services.

The Process page provides a table showing how to action non-coned
patient episodes for bulk bill LDAs.

Coned patient episodes LDA procedures

LDAs must be performed for restrictions between bulk billed and patient
claim pathology items rendered by the same practitioner in separate
manual and electronic claims. The only exception is simplified billing
claims.

The patient episode coning rule applies to pathology tests requested by
general practitioners (GP) for out of hospital services.

Example for a bulk bill claim

Bulk bill claim

-   item 65070 has been claimed in a patient episode requested by a
    general practitioner (GP) in bulk bill claim ID A0013
-   the same pathologist has subsequently claimed item 65096, also
    requested by a GP for the same date of request (DOR)
-   when assessing claim ID A0024 item 65096 restricts with 65070 in
    claim ID A0013 on history
-   the return message 6-RST ADJ is displayed as item 65096 has a higher
    schedule fee

None of the services are endorsed as rule 3 exempt or S4B3 services. An
LDA is required to pay the difference between items 65096 and 65070.
