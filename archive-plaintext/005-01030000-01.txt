This document outlines the cultural considerations that should be
provided to customers who come from culturally and linguistically
diverse (CALD) backgrounds.

Addressing specific needs of customers

When assisting customers who are either newly arrived residents,
refugees or migrants who have been living in Australia for some time,
Service Officers should consider how a person's background may affect
their abilities to communicate and comprehend, levels of anxiety,
abilities to recall detailed information and how they should be
addressed.

The Bilateral Management Arrangements (BMA) between Services Australia
and its partner agencies contains specific service and performance
measures to address the specific needs of customers from CALD
backgrounds.

See References for more information on the BMA.
