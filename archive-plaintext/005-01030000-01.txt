This document outlines the cultural considerations that should be
provided to customers who come from culturally and linguistically
diverse (CALD) backgrounds.

Addressing specific needs of customers

Customers who are either newly arrived residents, refugees or migrants
and have been living in Australia for some time, may have complex
issues.

Service Officers should consider:

-   how a person's background may affect their abilities to communicate
    and comprehend
-   levels of anxiety
-   abilities to recall detailed information, and
-   how they should be addressed

The Multicultural Guide helps staff interact with migrant communities in
a culturally sensitive manner.

The Resources page has a link to the Language Identification Sheet.
