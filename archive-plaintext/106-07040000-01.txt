This document outlines the Legacy POI tiered model. When claiming a
payment that requires POI to be provided, the customer must establish
their identity to the required tier level by providing documents
considered acceptable by Services Australia.

Legacy POI tier level model

The model has 2 components:

-   Commencement of Identity - proof of birth in Australia/ proof of
    arrival in Australia, which establish a customer's existence in
    Australia, and
-   Use of Identity - identity documents have points allocated according
    to their integrity, and demonstrate a customer's continuing
    involvement in the community under that identity

For acceptable documents, see Legacy POI tiered model A to Z documents.

Legacy POI tier levels

The current Legacy POI tiers used by Services Australia:

Tier Zero

-   No POI documents required
-   Payments: ABSTUDY Schooling A Allowance

Tier One

-   POI required: 1 Proof of Birth or Proof of Arrival document, or any
    documents from the approved list to the value of 50 points or more
-   Payments:
    - Australian Government Disaster Relief Payment (AGDRP)
    - Disaster Recovery Allowance (DRA)

Extra procedures apply to ABSTUDY customers in some situations.
Customers can meet POI requirements without providing POI documents in
person.

For other agency payments and services, see Identity Confirmation.

The Resources page contains links to Confirm your identity information
