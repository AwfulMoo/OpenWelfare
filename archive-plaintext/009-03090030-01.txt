This document outlines information about processing the death of a
dependent child of a lower Adult Disability Assessment Tool (ADAT) score
adult. When a dependent child of a lower ADAT adult dies, the carer's
qualification to payments will be established as well as assessing the
entitlement to a lump sum Bereavement Payment (LBP).

Confirmation and recording of death

Before any action is taken, confirmation of death must be provided. Once
confirmed, it is important that the death be recorded as soon as
possible to ensure that customers receive their correct entitlement.

The notification period to advise of a bereavement is 28 days for carers
in receipt of Carer Payment and/or Carer Allowance. The References page
contains links to the policy.
