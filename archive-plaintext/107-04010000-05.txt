Tax adjustments

Customers no longer receive a Payment Summary at the end of each
financial year. Payment summary information is reported automatically to
the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).

See Electronic transfer of Payment Summary details to the Australian
Taxation Office (ATO).

Customers can view or obtain a copy of their Centrelink Payment
Summaries using self service channels:

-   The Request a document option online
-   Express Plus applications
-   Self-service terminals at service centres
-   Via the IVR

Services Australia (the agency) and the ATO have agreed that the agency
must adjust a customer tax record for debts.

This is due to the agency reporting on what the customer received in a
financial year. For tax purposes, it is as if the amount of this debt
was never received by the customer. The amount of the debt is deducted
from the customer's tax record:

-   for the relevant financial year, and, or
-   an amended Payment Summary will be issued to the customer for any
    past financial year(s) affected by the debt

This happens automatically if:

-   the period is within 5 years
-   a repayment plan is in place, and
-   the first repayment is received

When the agency waives a debt, the amount should still appear on the
payment summary, as the customer received the money. The agency is
waiving their right to recover this amount.

Tax adjustment example

A customer has a debt of Basic rate, Rent Assistance and Clean Energy
Supplement calculated for 20 May 2018 to 22 September 2018. A Centrelink
system based calculation will populate OPCA with the following dates:

Table 1:

  ------------------------- ------------- -------------------
  Component type            Start date    End date
  Basic payment             20 May 2018   30 June 2018
  Basic payment             1 July 2018   22 September 2018
  Rent Assistance           20 May 2018   30 June 2018
  Rent Assistance           1 July 2018   22 September 2018
  Clean Energy Supplement   20 May 2018   30 June 2018
  Clean Energy Supplement   1 July 2018   22 September 2018
  ------------------------- ------------- -------------------

OPCA will reject these dates (as per Table 2) as 17 June 2018 to 22
September 2018 crosses financial years.

Table 2:

  ------------------------- -------------- -------------------
  Component type            Start date     End date
  Basic payment             20 May 2018    16 June 2018
  Basic payment             17 June 2018   22 September 2018
  Rent Assistance           20 May 2018    16 June 2018
  Rent Assistance           17 June 2018   22 September 2018
  Clean Energy Supplement   20 May 2018    16 June 2018
  Clean Energy Supplement   17 June 2018   22 September 2018
  ------------------------- -------------- -------------------

Solve this by adding the entitlement period as a separate line as
indicated in Table 3.

Table 3:

  ------------------------- -------------- -------------------
  Component type            Start date     End date
  Basic payment             20 May 2018    16 June 2018
  Basic payment             17 June 2018   30 June 2018
  Basic payment             1 July 2018    22 September 2018
  Rent Assistance           20 May 2018    16 June 2018
  Rent Assistance           17 June 2018   30 June 2018
  Rent Assistance           1 July 2018    22 September 2018
  Clean Energy Supplement   20 May 2018    16 June 2018
  Clean Energy Supplement   17 June 2018   30 June 2018
  Clean Energy Supplement   1 July 2018    22 September 2018
  ------------------------- -------------- -------------------

MultiCal reports the breakdown in the same way as the debt calculations
do in Example 1. Obtain adjustments for individual entitlement periods
from the debt report.

The OPCA screen must be coded for each actual component the overpayment
is for. These are found in ADEX or on the PS screen.

Note: if using the PS screen, investigate the record thoroughly to
ensure any arrears payments made or debts raised for the same period are
considered.
