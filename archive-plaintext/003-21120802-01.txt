NZ DRA tax participation

A customer must have participated in the Australian taxation system for
at least one year in the past 3 financial years:

-   2020-21
-   2019-20
-   2018-19

If they have not, they must do so before 25 January 2023.

Claiming period

Customers:

-   must lodge claims by 22 June 2022
-   can only claim after this time if special circumstances apply

How to claim

The easiest way for customers to claim is by calling the Australian
Government Emergency Information Line. Services Australia operates this
phone line.

If a customer calls another agency phone number:

staff not trained in assessing or processing emergency payments, see
Claiming emergency payments for important steps to follow before
transferring the customer

warm transfer the customer to:

-   internal transfer number - 171534
-   full number - 02 8440 2538. Do not give this number to customers.
    Use only if unable to use the internal transfer number

Claim forms are on the intranet for staff.

Rejecting claims

Formal approval has been given to reject claims that are ineligible and
do not meet eligibility criteria. This includes claims for:

-   declared localities
-   non-declared localities

Before finalising an ineligible claim, staff must check any Verbal Claim
Fast Note/DOC, paper claim or DOC on the customer’s record to make sure
the customer is not eligible. Staff must determine if a claim should be
granted or rejected.

All DRA and NZ DRA claims must have 2 genuine attempts to contact the
customer before rejecting the claim. Record the outcome of each contact
attempt in a DOC.

Note: when talking to customers, do not use the term rejection. Use the
term ineligible.
For example, ‘After assessing your claim we have found it does not meet
the conditions of the payment and therefore your claim outcome is
ineligible.’

See Processing DRA and NZ DRA claims in Customer First.

Extra help with the cost of child care

Additional Child Care Subsidy (ACCS) (Temporary Financial Hardship) may
be paid if the customer or their partner is affected by the declared
disaster.

If the customer wants to apply for ACCS, warm transfer the customer to
the Family and Parenting (FAO) phone queue using Services Australia
Workspace.
