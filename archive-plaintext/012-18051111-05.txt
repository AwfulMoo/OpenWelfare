|                                   | Do I reject the prescription for  |
|                                   | being too soon?                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: Check the application is  |

|                                   | lost/replacement prescriptions.   |
|                                   | If so, follow instructions for    |
|                                   | top-ups or lost/replacement       |

| 4                                 | Question: The prescriber calls    |
|                                   | and asks for a 1-month approval   |
|                                   | due to infection. Can this be     |
|                                   | approved?                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: Check if the patient has  |
|                                   | any outstanding repeats. If there |
|                                   | are repeats available, tell the   |
|                                   | prescriber to use them first then |
|                                   | reassess response.                |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | advise to complete a continuing   |
|                                   | application and document the      |
|                                   | reason. Escalate to a PA for      |
|                                   | assessment.                       |

|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | the database – do I need to       |
|                                   | update?                           |

|                                   | number if OPA advises the number  |

| 7                                 | Question: Why does the            |
|                                   | restriction and item code have    |
|                                   | date tabs?                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: This indicates if there   |

|                                   | schedule update for the program.  |
|                                   | You need to key a prescription    |
|                                   | under the item code and           |
|                                   | restriction from the date of      |

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 8                                 | Question: What dates do I key     |
|                                   | into a ‘too soon’ rejection       |
|                                   | letter?                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: Key the ‘supply start’ as |
|                                   | either the date of approval or    |
|                                   | the date of first dispensing      |
|                                   | (whichever is greater). Key the   |

|                                   | Assessment Date.                  |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 9                                 | Question: The prescriber has      |
|                                   | requested quantity/repeats higher |
|                                   | than the restriction allows – can |
|                                   | I reduce the number for approval? |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | can be reduced, but not           |
|                                   | increased. An ‘approved with      |
|                                   | changes’ letter should be         |
|                                   | returned to the prescriber in     |
|                                   | these cases.                      |

|                                   | should I do?                      |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | response’. If not, a reject       |
|                                   | letter may be required            |

|                                   | name. Can I copy the previous     |
