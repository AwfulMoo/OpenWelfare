This document outlines how to update, correct or delete miscellaneous
circumstances on a child's Centrelink record.

CHM screen

The Child Miscellaneous Circumstances (CHM) screen can be used to
indicate whether:

-   The child is an adopted child. These details are used to assess a
    customer's eligibility for family assistance. Details include
    whether or not the child was adopted from overseas and the date the
    child arrived in Australia
-   The child is a foster child. A foster child may qualify for a Health
    Care Card (HCC) to be issued in the child's name to the foster
    carers who receive Family Tax Benefit (FTB) but do not qualify for
    an automatic HCC. This information is also used to assess
    eligibility for family assistance and payments for principal carers
    including Parenting Payment (PP) and JobSeeker Payment (JSP)
-   An exemption from mutual obligation requirements is appropriate
    based on the type of foster care arrangement in place (for principal
    carers only)
-   The child attracts a Child Disability Allowance (CDA) and/or Double
    Orphan's Pension (DOP) savings provision
-   An exemption from taking action to obtain child support is in place
    for the customer claiming FTB in respect of the child
