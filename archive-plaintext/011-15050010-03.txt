This page contains the process for Service Officers to validate and
record payments against the Compensation Case Management System (CCMS)
and National Compensation Recovery Information (NCRI) mainframe screen.
It also outlines how to change the allocation of payments and request
missing documentation from a compensation payer.

Payment received - Existing Work Identification Number (WIN)

Validating payment - Existing WIN

Table 1: This table describes the process for Service Officers to
validate a payment for an existing case (WIN) in the Compensation Case
Management System (CCMS). Payments may be received individually or as
part of a multiple receipt so each payment must be validated as part of
this process.

Payment received - No existing Work Identification Number (WIN)

Validating payment - No existing WIN

Table 2: This table describes the process for Service Officers to
validate a payment when it is banked to a Medicare Number, 8600 number
or 8700 number where there is no existing case (WIN) in the Compensation
Case Management System (CCMS). Payments may be received individually or
as part of a multiple receipt so each payment must be validated as part
of this process.
