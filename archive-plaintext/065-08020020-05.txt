|                                   | To determine the real asset value |
|                                   | of the real estate offered as     |
|                                   | security for a loan under the     |
|                                   | Scheme, the current market value  |
|                                   | is reduced by the deductions and  |
|                                   | Nominated Amount (if any). The    |
|                                   | real asset value is worked out    |
|                                   | using the following formula:      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Real asset value = current market |
|                                   | value minus (Nominated Amount +   |
|                                   | deductions)                       |

|                                   | -   Nominated Amount = $45,000    |
|                                   | -   Deductions = $17,500          |

|                                   | Real asset value = $350,000 –     |
|                                   | ($45,000 + $17,500) = $287,500    |
