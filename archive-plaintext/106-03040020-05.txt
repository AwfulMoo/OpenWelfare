|                                   | start from the day Robby turns    |
|                                   | Age Pension age, provided the     |
|                                   | pension is payable (for example,  |
|                                   | payable under the income and      |

|                                   | Age Pension. For example, an Age  |

|                                   | Mary contacts on 27 September to  |
|                                   | lodge a claim for Mary's child,   |
|                                   | John, who will be commencing      |
|                                   | secondary studies in the new      |
|                                   | year. John's qualification start  |
|                                   | date will be 1 January;           |
|                                   | therefore, the earliest a claim   |
|                                   | can normally be lodged is 2       |
|                                   | October.                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Mary advises of going into        |
|                                   | hospital for a major operation on |
|                                   | 28 September and is unsure about  |
|                                   | the length of confinement. Mary   |
|                                   | is anxious to submit John's claim |
|                                   | due to the uncertainty of the     |
|                                   | length of the hospital stay. In   |
|                                   | this instance, discretion can be  |
|                                   | applied to accept the claim       |
|                                   | earlier than 13 weeks prior to    |
|                                   | qualification.                    |

|                                   | Sarah contacts on 20 November to  |
|                                   | lodge a claim for ABSTUDY.        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Sarah will commence a university  |
|                                   | course which starts on 26         |
|                                   | February. Sarah's qualification   |
|                                   | start date will be 26 February    |
|                                   | and the earliest date that        |
|                                   | ABSTUDY can be claimed is 27      |
|                                   | November.                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Sarah advises of an overseas      |
|                                   | trip, departing on 22 November    |
|                                   | until 10 February and will not    |
|                                   | have access to the internet. As   |
|                                   | Sarah will not be able to         |
|                                   | re-contact to lodge a claim until |
|                                   | close to the course commencement  |
|                                   | date, discretion can be applied   |
|                                   | to accept the claim earlier than  |
|                                   | 13 weeks. This allows the claim   |
|                                   | to be taken when Sarah first      |
|                                   | contacts on 20 November. This     |
|                                   | will give Sarah time to provide   |
|                                   | any further supporting            |
|                                   | documentation for the claim and   |
|                                   | have the claim finalised prior to |
|                                   | commencing studies.               |

|                                   | would be 2 October. In these      |

|                                   | claim until January, discretion   |
|                                   | can be applied to accept the      |
|                                   | claim earlier than 13 weeks. This |
|                                   | will allow the claim to be taken  |
|                                   | when Darren first contacts on 20  |
|                                   | September.                        |

|                                   | Second Home Allowance as Maggie   |
|                                   | has special needs and has been    |
|                                   | offered a place in the new year   |

|                                   | start date will be 1 January;     |
|                                   | therefore the earliest a claim    |
|                                   | can normally be lodged would be 2 |
|                                   | October. In these circumstances,  |

|                                   | accept the claim earlier than 13  |

|                                   | contacts on 15 September. This    |
|                                   | will give Marg time to provide    |

|                                   | before the start of the year. The |

|                                   | depending on the date that the    |
|                                   | second home is set up. It is not  |

|                                   | early as there are no extenuating |
