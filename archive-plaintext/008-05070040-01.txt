This document outlines a list of the cancellation, suspension and
rejection codes for Mobility Allowance (MOB). The list of codes is not
available to the public.

Codes used by Services Australia

Services Australia uses codes when a decision is made on a customer
record to:

-   cancel or suspend a payment
-   reject a claim

Customers in a Period of Grace (POG) also have a set of codes. In some
cases, the codes are the same as the cancellation and suspension reason
codes.

A description of the code is used in correspondence with customers.

Some of these actions occur automatically due to an update being made to
the customer's circumstances on their record. For example, income or
asset details. Others are coded manually.

Records placed into POG will automatically be restored to either the
higher rate or standard rate if the approved activity is restored or
updated.

The Process page contains cancellation, suspension and rejection codes
for MOB.
