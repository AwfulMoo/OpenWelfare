This document outlines the process to conduct an Initial Assessment
interview to place a customer onto Income Management (IM), under
Voluntary Income Management (VIM).

Initial Assessment interview

An Initial Assessment interview is required to place a customer on IM
when they enter into a VIM Agreement. The interview:

-   explains the terms and conditions of VIM
-   explains how IM works
-   determines how the customer's income managed funds can be best used
    to meet the priority needs of the customer and their family, and
-   provides information about other services which may assist them,
    including Centrepay

As this is a voluntary action there are no sanctions applicable to the
customer's payments if they do not attend the interview.

Role of a correspondence nominee

When there is no payment nominee, correspondence nominees can generally
act in place of, or on behalf of, the customer in the application of IM.

A correspondence nominee can:

-   enter into a VIM agreement, and
-   terminate a VIM agreement

If a correspondence nominee requests to enter or exit VIM on behalf of
the customer, the Service Officer must get confirmation from the
customer that they agree with the instructions of the correspondence
nominee about entering or ending a VIM Agreement.

In some circumstances, a correspondence nominee can act in place of a
customer.

Customers receiving ABSTUDY

Customers in receipt of ABSTUDY volunteering for Income Management
should be aware 100% of ABSTUDY with Living Allowance or Pensioner
Education Supplement (PES) is Income Managed.

The Resources page contains further information about declared IM areas,
links to the VIM fact sheet and the Services Australia Website.
