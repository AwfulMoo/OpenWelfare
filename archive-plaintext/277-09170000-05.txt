Completing the Statement of Reasons macro - General Objections

The statement of reasons report generated by the macro is completed and
sent to the customers to inform them of the objection decision and
explain how the decision was reached. The length of the report will vary
according to the complexity of the decision.

The report should be as succinct as possible without omitting relevant
information.

The statement of reasons report must be written using plain English,
short sentences and no jargon.

The first time a shortened phrase is used spell it out in full and give
the shortened form in brackets, for example Change of Assessment (CoA).
Once it has been written in this way, use the acronym in the document.

See the General Objections Guide to Writing a Statement of Reasons and
Services Australia Writing Style Guide for more information.

The statement of reasons must be written using the General Objections
macro and include:

Statement of Reasons report

Statement of Reasons report by using the Statement of Reasons macro.

Objections COA Reasons evidence table

This table outlines the relevant questions and possible evidence sources
to consider in establishing each of the 10 Change of Assessment (COA)
reasons. It is not mandatory to gather all of the evidence suggested
under each reason as the specific circumstances will vary for each case.
In some cases it is necessary to gather additional information to
establish a COA reason and in other cases gathering all the evidence
listed is not required.

Customers’ financial circumstances must be established using the
Financial Circumstances Worksheet.
