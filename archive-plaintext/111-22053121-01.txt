This document outlines the objectives of claim automation by supporting
the agency’s vision to make government services simple. These
capabilities allow staff to assist vulnerable customers or those with
more complex circumstances.

Straight through processing

Straight through processing is an automation capability that automates
the processing of a claim from beginning to end. It is used for a range
of claims for:

-   social security, and
-   emergency payments and services

Straight through processing uses business rules to identify if claims
are suitable for an automated outcome.

Process Step Automation

Process Step Automation (PSA) is another automation capability that
works with straight through processing. PSA allows Service Officers to
action specific tasks within a social security claim that require
verification. Once these tasks are completed, the claim will progress to
an automated outcome.
