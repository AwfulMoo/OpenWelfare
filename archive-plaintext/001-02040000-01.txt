This document outlines how to register a customer as a job seeker
outside of the Participation Interview for claimants of JobSeeker
Payment, Youth Allowance, Parenting Payment Single and Special Benefit.

Eligible job seekers

Job seekers eligible for services from Workforce Australia Employment
Services Providers need to register to access these services. Services
Australia usually only conducts registration for job seekers claiming
payments subject to mutual obligation requirements. The system will
attempt to automatically register them upon submission of their online
claim. If this is not possible, registration will be completed as part
of the Participation Interview workflow during the Job Seeker new claim
appointment. Other customers who are eligible for employment services
can be registered manually at any time.

Types of job seeker registration

There are several types of job seeker registration for employment
services assistance:

Customers claiming or receiving Job Seeker Payment (JSP), Youth
Allowance (YA) (job seeker) including early school leavers, Special
Benefit (under JSP conditions), and Parenting Payment Single (PPS) with
mutual obligation requirements are required to register as Fully
Eligible Participant (FEP) job seekers. Young people who present with at
least one non-vocational barrier are eligible for FEP registration and
will have either a Vulnerable Youth (VY) or Vulnerable Youth (Student)
(VY(S)) flag recorded on their record. Other customers claiming or
receiving a payment without mutual obligation requirements may also be
fully eligible to be registered for Workforce Australia employment
services as a volunteer, such as Parenting Payment Partnered (PPP) and
Disability Support Pension (DSP) recipients

Job seekers in a Department of Employment and Workplace Relations
designated remote area are referred to a Community Development Programme
(CDP) provider. Job seekers in CDP regions can be registered as Remote
Fully Eligible (RFE), which is the equivalent of Fully Eligible (FEP).
In these areas, the job seeker will not have a choice of providers, as
there is only one CDP provider servicing each area. The CDP provider
will provide similar services to a Workforce Australia Employment
Services Provider or Disability Employment Services (DES) provider

Customers requiring registration only to access employment services as a
volunteer, and who do not require a referral to an Employment Services
Provider or a CDP provider, can be registered as Job Seeker Registration
Only (JSRO)/No CDP Referral Required (NRRR). This includes:

-   customers who need a Department of Employment and Workplace
    Relations record to be referred for an Employment Services
    Assessment (ESAt), such as customers claiming or receiving
    Disability Support Pension (DSP)
-   full-time students who are transferring to a job seeker payment
    within 4 weeks of their student end date
-   some customers requiring a Job Plan as a condition of their family
    or income support payment. This includes principal carers or people
    assessed as having a partial capacity to work who already fully
    meeting their requirements by undertaking suitable work of at least
    30 hours per fortnight and do not want to volunteer for employment
    services during this period
-   New Enterprise Incentive Scheme (NEIS) participants presenting to
    Services Australia after 39 weeks of participation in the scheme to
    claim income support

Registered young people

Young people who have registered will be able to access education, a
variety of youth services, or other programs according to their assessed
needs and availability. Any claimant for YA as a job seeker must be
registered as a FEP/RFE, where they:

-   are under 22, and
-   have not completed Year 12 or attained an equivalent qualification,
    but
-   are currently undertaking a program of study or training that would
    fully meet their mutual obligation requirements

Registration by Services Australia

The process of registering a job seeker is completed by selecting the
Participation Interview workflow (for new claims of payments subject to
mutual obligation requirements) or the Job Seeker Registration workflow
via the Participation Summary page in Process Direct for all other
registrations. These tools are used to assess the type of service a job
seeker is eligible for.

Automatic registration

For some job seekers, registration might have already been completed
during the claim submission process. In these cases, the role of
Services Australia is to encourage completion of the Job Seeker Snapshot
online or complete with job seeker.

Eligible job seekers are automatically referred to Workforce Australia
Online for Individuals, (unless already connected to a provider or a
provider is deemed more suitable) when they are registered.

On submission of new claim, the Department of Employment and Workplace
Relations will assess suitability for Workforce Australia Online for
Individuals and refer customers to a physical provider where
appropriate.

Job seekers eligible for CDP, TtW or ParentsNext are referred to a
provider of their choice who provide these services. Services Australia
will arrange an initial appointment with the provider.

Voluntary Registration

Job seekers can register directly for Workforce Australia Online as a
Volunteer via myGov or the Workforce Australia website. If the job
seeker approaches Services Australia to register and they are eligible,
Service Officers can provide this service.

Issuing a Job Seeker Identification (JSID) number

When a customer initially contacts Services Australia to register as a
job seeker, the agency issues a Job Seeker Identification (JSID) number.
This is done in person but if a JSID number has been issued previously
and the registration is still current, the job seeker can be advised of
the number over the phone.
