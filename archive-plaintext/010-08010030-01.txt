This document outlines how the application of the Partner Income Test
affects ABSTUDY customers aged 22 years and over.

Types of Income Tests

ABSTUDY customers are subject to a Personal Income Test on any income
they receive. Depending on their circumstances, they may also be subject
to a Partner Income Test and Parental Means Test.

Income Bank

ABSTUDY customers can access an Income Bank enabling them to build up
credits while not earning an income, for use when they do.

The Resources page contains information about the Partner Income Test
and adjustments to the Partner Income Free Area for ABSTUDY customers
aged 22 years or over with dependent children and/or dependent students.

See Rates and Thresholds for current and historical rates of payment.
