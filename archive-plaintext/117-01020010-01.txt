This document outlines information on the role of staff assisting or
reviewing customers who are receiving, or may be eligible to receive
payments of compensation.

Initial Contact

When a customer is injured, it is a requirement for them or their
partner to pursue and obtain compensation if eligible.

If there is no previous record of the compensation claim, issue the
Compensation and damages form (Mod C).

Advise the customer they have 14 days from when they start their claim
to:

-   answer all questions on the Mod C, and
-   provide the required documents when they submit their claim

If there is an existing compensation claim and the customer is advising
the receipt of compensation payments ask the customer to provide payment
details

-   periodic payment documentation
-   lump sum settlement documentation, or
-   any document from the compensation payer that details the payment

Different rules apply to ABSTUDY for the treatment of compensation.

What staff can do

Customers may contact about

-   compensation letters
-   compensation payments they are receiving or about to receive, or
-   a compensation lump sum preclusion period

Service Officers can:

-   explain how compensation will affect their or their partner’s income
    support payments
-   update or cease periodic compensation payments, see Coding and
    raising debts for periodic compensation payments
-   explain a compensation lump sum preclusion period (CLK)
-   ask the customer if they would like to see a Financial Information
    Service (FIS) Officer

Refer more complex enquiries to the Compensation Recovery Team (CRT).
CRT will investigate all claims for a compensation payment via the
clearance process.

The Resources page contains links to the Mod C and further information
on Compensation Recovery Teams.
