This document outlines the process of accessing archived Assurance of
Support (AoS) data using the Archiving and Culling Engine (ACE)
application.

Searching the ACE application

When searching the ACE application for an archived record the user must
have the Customer Reference Number (CRN) of the customer. To view both
Assurer and Assuree records, the user must do the search in separate
actions - both records cannot be viewed at the same time.

The

Resources page contains a link to the Archiving and Culling Engine
