This document outlines the eligibility criteria for Distance Education
Allowance (DED) under the Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) Scheme.

Distance Education Allowance (DED) eligibility

The applicant must meet AIC Scheme eligibility criteria to be eligible
for DED and the student:

-   must usually be studying at home through an approved distance
    education provider, or
-   in another acceptable study location or arrangement

DED is also for when a student undertakes study by distance education
methods and needs to periodically attend:

-   a residential school, or
-   a short 'mini' school as part of their course

Part-time distance education study

DED may be payable on a pro-rata basis when the student:

is doing both face-to-face and distance education, and

has a special need that means they need to study from home, and

is not enrolled on a full-time basis, considering any reduction in study
load due to disability or health related needs, and

is undertaking less than 4 school days a week:

-   home schooling/education, or
-   work set by the school to do at home

These arrangements are usually:

-   for socialisation reasons, or
-   under a plan for a gradual return to full-time school attendance

State / Territory Department of Education approval

The relevant education authorities (through the distance education
school or home education/schooling authority) must:

-   be aware of the arrangements
-   agree with, or have no objection to, the student also attending the
    school

See the State/Territory Department of Education approval table on the
Resources page for details.

Homeland Learning Centres

Homeland Learning Centres (HLC):

-   are annexes of Northern Territory (NT) Government remote community
    schools (also known as 'hub' schools, which are normally located in
    the main community)
-   are located in communities around the main community

With the support of the hub school, the HLC:

-   provides education to students of Indigenous families living outside
    the main community in traditional homelands
-   may not provide the same range of grades for primary and/or
    secondary level study
-   are acceptable study locations for payment of DED

Students are eligible for AIC because their local government schools and
remote community schools or 'hub' schools, are:

-   all classified as limited program schools by the NT Government, and
-   not 'appropriate state schools' under AIC policy

Students are geographically isolated, regardless of the:

-   distance of the HLC, to the hub school, or
-   availability of transport to either school

DED is payable if:

-   the student attends a HLC, and
-   the student and the AIC applicant live at the homeland location

The payment should go to the administering remote community (hub)
school.

DED is not payable for a student if the student:

-   is attending the main remote community (hub) school and the student
    and/or their parent/guardian/carer(s) live in the main remote
    community
-   travels to the main community to attend the hub school from the HLC
    (for example because the HLC does not provide their level of study
    or grade), or
-   lives in the main community and travels to the homeland location to
    attend a HLC

Income Management

AIC applicants who are subject to Income Management, may still get AIC
Allowances.
