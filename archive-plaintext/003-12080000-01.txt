Service Delivery Support

Consultation

    capacity to meet their compulsory requirements. It is not
    appropriate for PST-skilled social workers to be consulted just for
    an exemption from compulsory requirements
-   To develop the PST-skilled Service Officer's skill set and knowledge
    in relation to assessing and understanding a customer's personal
    circumstances and their impact. Developing capability builds
    confidence to undertake future assessments, in particular to use a
    strengths-based approach, effective communication and questioning
    techniques

Targeted training/coaching

    in relation to assessing and understanding a customer's personal

Service recovery

decision-making process.

    quality decision making, drawing on professional skills, and
    utilising various modes of practice

    social work colleagues in the network to enhance their ability to
    identify, understand and assess the impact of the circumstances on a
    customer's capacity to comply and determining appropriate
    interventions
-   Use their expertise to provide feedback and inform business
    planning, programme design and service delivery, with particular
    attention to the needs of vulnerable client groups in the
    participation and compliance context
