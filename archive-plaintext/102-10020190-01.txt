This document outlines how a customer can voluntarily request Services
Australia cancel their JobSeeker Payment (JSP) or Youth Allowance (YA)
(job seeker) payments.

A customer voluntarily requests their JSP or YA (job seeker) be cancelled

A customer can choose to cancel their income support payment
voluntarily.

Reasons may include:

-   Customer and or partner returns to work
-   Customer has a change in their relationship status resulting in them
    no longer requiring an income support payment (ISP)
-   Customer temporarily/permanently moves overseas (investigate
    portability of ISP)
-   Customer comes into money e.g. Inheritance/lottery winnings, see
    Assessment of income for Centrelink payments

A customer may surrender or cancel their income support payment without
providing an explanation

Flow on impacts from voluntary cancellations of payment

When a customer voluntarily cancels their payment, impacts include:

-   Loss of Working Credit balance
-   Part-time/casual employees can work for 12 weeks prior to
    cancellation of their payment when income exceeds the allowable
    threshold.
-   Loss of Rent Assistance and/or other supplementary payments
-   Customer may not be able to use their Concession Card, see Changes
    in customer’s circumstances and effect on concession card
    entitlement
-   Rate of Family Tax Benefit
-   Child Care Subsidy, see: Eligibility for Child Care Subsidy (CCS)

Commencing work - checks before cancellation

If a job seeker has started work (full time ongoing, full time,
part-time, casual), check to see if the customer may be entitled to keep
some of their income support payment while they are working:

-   if the customer's employment is full time on-going, they immediately
    lose qualification and payability
-   working credits may enable the customer to keep some of their income
    support payment while they are working
-   the job seeker can continue to lodge a Reporting Statement via []
    self-managed service channels (Online account, Express Plus
    application or phone), in person or in writing (SU19) to take
    advantage of the employment income nil rate period

When the job seeker makes the request to cancel in person or by phone,
without reporting, the Service Officer should advise the job seeker that
it is in their interest to lodge a final Reporting Statement via []
self-managed service channels (Online account, Express Plus application
or phone), in person or in writing (SU19). If they do not lodge:

-   the job seeker will not be paid any entitlement they may have
    accrued, or
-   job seekers on variable reporting may incur a debt if they have
    received payment since their last report

Customer advised they have become a full time Australian Apprentice

If the customer advises they have become a full-time Australian
Apprentice, investigate entitlement to ABSTUDY, Austudy or YA.

Dependent YA (job seeker) customers

Changes to a dependent YA customer's circumstances may affect the family
pool if those siblings receive dependent ABSTUDY, Assistance for
Isolated Children (AIC) or YA.

Customer requests voluntary surrender of JSP or YA (job seeker) to claim Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment (PLDP)

Customers can voluntarily surrender their Income Support Payment (ISP)
to claim PLDP.

A customer cannot be paid Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment while on an
income support payment at the same time. Alternatively, customers on an
ISP may qualify for a Crisis Payment for National Health Emergency
(COVID-19)

To be eligible for Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment, customers:

-   need to prove they are unable to attend work, and are therefore
    unable to earn an income
-   were likely to have worked during the period of self-isolation,
    quarantine or caring
-   have insufficient appropriate leave entitlements, including any
    pandemic sick leave, or will use up this leave during the 7 day
    period

Make sure the customer understands, that by cancelling their ISP, they
will not be entitled to any supplementary or add on payments, see
Process page

For more details, see Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment.

Cancel my current payment online service

Eligible customers may use the Cancel my current payment service in
their [] Centrelink online account to voluntarily cancel their own
income support payment see Cancel my current payment online.

Outstanding compliance action when payment is cancelled

When a participation payment is cancelled or suspended, background
processing automatically:

-   finalises any outstanding compliance action that is no longer
    required
-   holds compliance action that will need to be considered if payment
    restarts within 3 months

For more information, see Rejecting a compliance action.

Request for a review of decision to voluntarily cancel a payment

If a JSP or YA (job seeker) payment is REJ or CAN/CLR, even where the
customer has cancelled their payment themselves, they have the same
appeal and review rights regardless of the reason for the cancellation.
