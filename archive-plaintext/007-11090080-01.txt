This document outlines why a Family Tax Benefit (FTB) reconciliation
overpayment occurred, once it has been identified that the overpayment
was due to details used to assess an FTB claim for a previous year,
lodged with Centrelink.

Why FTB overpayments may occur

An overpayment could occur if the actual adjusted taxable income as
assessed by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is more than the income
estimate that was used to assess the claim.

A change in relationship status could also cause changes in income and
therefore result in an overpayment in the same way. A relationship
status change could also cause an overpayment related to changes in:

-   maintenance income and/or
-   maintenance action

Overview of FTB reconciliation

Part A supplement, Part B supplement and Single Income Family Supplement
(SIFS) are included in the reconciliation calculation for eligible
customers once adequate income/ not required to lodge details are
available. FTB top-ups, including supplement and SIFS entitlement, are
automatically used for debt offsetting.
