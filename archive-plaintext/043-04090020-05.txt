|                                   | A liability of $100,000 is        |
|                                   | secured against a pie making      |
|                                   | machine with a market value of    |
|                                   | $80,000. Only $80,000 would be    |
|                                   | allowed as a liability and this   |
|                                   | is the amount that should be      |
|                                   | recorded as the total liability.  |

|                                   | A liability of $100,000 is        |
|                                   | secured against a pie making      |
|                                   | machine with a market value of    |
|                                   | $80,000 and a farm worth          |
|                                   | $120,000. As 60% of the assets    |
|                                   | are primary production assets,    |
|                                   | $100,000 would be recorded as the |
|                                   | total liability, with 60% of this |
|                                   | as primary production.            |

|                                   | A liability may be secured        |
|                                   | against an asset(s) which         |
|                                   | includes a mix of exempt and      |
|                                   | assessable assets. In this        |
|                                   | situation the amount of the       |
|                                   | liability allowed will need to be |
|                                   | apportioned.                      |

|                                   | Example: A trust has assets of    |
|                                   | $1,000,000 comprising a farm on   |
|                                   | which the principal residence     |
|                                   | (worth $300,000) of the 100%      |
|                                   | entity controller is situated.    |
|                                   | There is a $400,000 liability     |
|                                   | which was used to purchase the    |
|                                   | farm including the principal      |
|                                   | residence secured against the     |
|                                   | whole property. As only 70% of    |
|                                   | the trust assets are assessable,  |
|                                   | only 70%, or $280,000, of the     |
|                                   | liability will be allowed. The    |
|                                   | following would be recorded:      |

|                                   | the system will calculate the     |
