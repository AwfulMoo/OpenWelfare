Determining principal carer status in shared care situations

This table describes the process relating to a principal carer
determination in shared care arrangements. Note: a principal carer
determination should be completed if one or both customers are claiming
or receiving income support. This includes if each person has another
qualifying child solely in their care or a change in shared care Manual
Follow-up (MFU) has been created following a care determination made by
Child Support.

|                                   | at least 10% more than the other  |

|                                   | For example, where care is shared |
|                                   | 54/46% the difference is 8% so    |
|                                   | care would be considered equal.   |
|                                   | Where care is shared 45/55% the   |
|                                   | difference is not less than 10%   |
|                                   | so care would not be considered   |
|                                   | equal and the carer with 55% has  |
|                                   | the greater degree of care.       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Note: percentages between 45.1    |
|                                   | and 45.9 should all be rounded up |
|                                   | to 46%. Having at least 45.1%     |
|                                   | care means there is less than a   |
|                                   | 10% difference in care, therefore |
|                                   | equal care policy applies. The    |
|                                   | system will only allow coding of  |
|                                   | whole numbers, so 46% should be   |
|                                   | used. However, care should be     |
|                                   | taken when rounding up 45.1-45.9  |
|                                   | to ensure the other carer(s) is   |
|                                   | not disadvantaged when assessing  |
|                                   | whether the care situation should |
|                                   | be considered ‘equal care’.       |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | could have less than 46%.         |
