This document outlines the procedure when assessing income from a trust
which can affect the rate of the Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A.

Trust income as maintenance income

Income from a trust may be assessed as maintenance income which can
affect the rate of Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A.

Income from a trust can be maintenance income of a person if:

-   it is received as child support or as spousal maintenance from a
    person liable to pay child support or spousal maintenance, and
-   it is actually received (only beneficiaries can receive income from
    a trust, and sometimes the discretion to release the payments made
    into a trust is not exercised)

Any income from the trust of a deceased parent is not assessable as
maintenance income. It may need to be assessed as ordinary income of the
child or person.

Centrelink may request a copy of the Trust Deed and the financial
statements of the trust to assess income from the trust.

Some maintenance income is not assessable as it is exempt maintenance
income.

Child Support agreements

Child Support agreements with a start date of 1 July 2008 or later are
no longer manually assessed or coded by Centrelink staff, they are
assessed by Child Support.

For agreements with a start date before 1 July 2008, any non-cash
maintenance must be manually recorded on the Centrelink system for the
period up to and including 30 June 2008. For agreements that were in
place before 1 July 2008 that have been accepted by Child Support and
transitioned under the Child Support Scheme Reforms from 1 July 2008,
non-cash maintenance previously coded on the Centrelink system is
maintained by Centrelink.
