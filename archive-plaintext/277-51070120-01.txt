This document explains how to process an increase in Family Tax Benefit
(FTB) after action has been taken by the customer to obtain child
support.

Background

If a customer is required to satisfy the Maintenance Action Test (MAT)
to receive more than base rate Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A for a
child, the action to obtain child support by the customer must be
recorded to allow FTB Part A to be paid at more than base rate.

Initial action must be taken to obtain child support within the 13 week
(91 day) timeframe for FTB Part A to continue to be paid at more than
the base rate.

After this initial 13 week period, more than base rate of FTB Part A can
be paid from the date the MAT is satisfied or reasonable action to
obtain child support is taken. For example, this could be the date they
apply for a child support assessment, the date a letter is provided from
a lawyer stating that proof of parentage cannot be obtained, the date
from which an exemption is granted.

Once the Maintenance Action Test code for the child is updated, the
customer's FTB Part A rate will be reassessed from the date the customer
took reasonable action.
