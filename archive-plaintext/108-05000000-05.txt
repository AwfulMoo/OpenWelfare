|                                   | Example: On 1 August 2017, Peter  |

|                                   | fund to start his income stream.  |
|                                   | Peter is eligible to receive his  |
|                                   | income stream from that date. The |

|                                   | September because Peter's income  |
|                                   | stream date of claim is a         |
|                                   | notifiable event                  |
