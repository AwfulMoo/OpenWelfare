This document outlines how Service Officers and Team Leaders request
urgent completion of Quality Management Application (QMA) work items
created by Smart Centre, Labour Hire or Service Zone staff.

Service Delivery Partners

For urgent QMA of a work item created by a Service Deliver Partner,
refer to Office Locator. Check details for the site that created the
item for quality checking instruction.

Service Delivery Partners manage their own QMA as part of BAU processes.
This procedure would only apply to Service Delivery Partners when urgent
completion of QMA is required for work completed by Smart Centre or
Labour Hire staff.

Service Officers

Ensure any urgent QMA request meets the urgent QMA criteria before
escalating.

It is the responsibility of the Service Officer completing customer work
to determine when an urgent QMA is required and make this request. This
includes requesting an Urgent QMA for an activity submitted by a
previous Service Officer.

Service Officers are not to contact a previous Service Officer with a
submitted activity on a record to request they action the urgent QMA.

Team leaders

Arrange an urgent QMA with a local Quality Management Officer (QMO) if
one is available.

When a local QMO is not available, follow the appropriate urgent QMA
escalation procedure based on the details available via Work Optimiser
and the customer's record. Note: when team leaders are not available, a
Service Support Officer may help complete this process.

The Resources page contains intranet links for more information and
contact details.
