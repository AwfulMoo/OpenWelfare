| 1                                 | Lucas is claiming Youth Allowance |
|                                   | as a dependent full time          |
|                                   | secondary school student who      |
|                                   | until recently, due to a downturn |
|                                   | in the family business, was being |
|                                   | supported by his mother and       |
|                                   | stepfather. His assurer, Janice   |
|                                   | is a distant relative who lives   |
|                                   | over 300 kilometres away and has  |
|                                   | had little contact with Lucas     |
|                                   | since his arrival in Australia.   |
|                                   | Janice agrees to support Lucas by |
|                                   | offering to provide free board    |
|                                   | and lodging where she lives. She  |
|                                   | feels this support is better than |
|                                   | sending money.                    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The Service Officer must consider |
|                                   | all factors to determine if it is |
|                                   | reasonable for Lucas to relocate  |
|                                   | 300 kilometres. This offer of     |
|                                   | support would require Lucas to    |
|                                   | change schools, be separated from |
|                                   | his parents and move in with a    |
|                                   | distant relative. It could be     |
|                                   | determined that this type of      |
|                                   | support is not adequate or        |
|                                   | reasonable for Lucas. The Service |
|                                   | Officer can grant Youth Allowance |
|                                   | to Lucas.                         |

| 2                                 | Rosario is claiming Special       |
|                                   | Benefit. She advises she is a     |
|                                   | victim of domestic abuse          |
|                                   | allegedly perpetrated by her      |
|                                   | husband, she has been in a refuge |
|                                   | since she left her home 2 days    |
|                                   | ago. Rosario's assurers are her   |
|                                   | husband and his sister. The       |
|                                   | sister has offered Rosario free   |
|                                   | board and lodging at her home,    |
|                                   | plus financial support of $100    |
|                                   | per week cash which Rosario has   |
|                                   | refused.                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The Service Officer must consider |
|                                   | all factors including SSO and     |
|                                   | social work recommendations to    |
|                                   | determine if it is reasonable for |
|                                   | Rosario to refuse support.        |
|                                   | Rosario would need to live with a |
|                                   | close family member of the        |
|                                   | alleged domestic violence         |
|                                   | perpetrator. Therefore, it could  |
|                                   | be determined that this type of   |
|                                   | support is not reasonable for     |
|                                   | Rosario.                          |
