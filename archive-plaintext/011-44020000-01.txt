This document outlines Medicare eligibility for people who have lodged
an application for a permanent resident or protection visa. They lodge
these with the Department of Home Affairs (Home Affairs).

Application for permanent residency

A person can apply for a permanent residency or protection visas. They
can do this:

-   offshore (outside of Australia), or
-   onshore (in Australia)

There are different types of permanent residency visas including
protection visas. The legislation states that an applicant for a
permanent resident visa must hold a valid temporary visa. It does not
specify the type of visa.

Home Affairs are introducing a new pathway for eligible residents for
permanent residency. There are 2 commencement dates:

-   5 March 2022, and
-   November 2022

The first commencement date 5 March 2022, is for eligible residents who
have applied for a Permanent Residence (Hong Kong) (Regional) subclass
191. They will be eligible for Medicare as a conditional migrant.

Eligibility for Medicare

A person can enrol in Medicare if they meet all of the criteria. When
they enrol, they will get a blue 'interim' Medicare card.

A person is eligible to enrol if they:

-   apply for a permanent residency or protection visa, and
-   have permission to work

This does not include a Parent visa.

The person must supply documents to enrol in Medicare.

If they do not have permission to work, they are only eligible for
Medicare if:

they have a relationship with a parent, de facto, spouse or child who
is:

-   an Australian citizen, or
-   holds a permanent resident visa and resides in Australia, or
-   if they were residing in a Reciprocal Health Care Agreement (RHCA)
    country immediately before coming to Australia, and meet the
    criteria of that country they can enrol under RHCA

See the Process page for more details.

Extending Medicare eligibility

If the customer’s visa details are shared via an electronic data link,
the system automatically extends eligibility, using the allowable card
extension periods. See the Resources page for more details.

If the customer’s Medicare Eligibility did not automatically extend,
Service Officers can manually extend using the allowable extension
periods. The customer must continue to meet the visa application
criteria. A person is eligible to extend their entitlement if:

-   their valid visa has not been refused, and
-   they have permission to work

If the person does not have permission to work, they are only eligible
to extend if they have a relationship with a parent, de facto, spouse or
child who is:

-   an Australian citizen, or
-   holds a permanent resident visa, and resides in Australia

The customer must supply documents to extend their eligibility for
Medicare.

If the customers visa has been refused, see Appeals to visa refusal.

See Table 5 on the Process page for more details.

Appeals to visa refusal

A customer may have their visa application refused by the Department of
Home Affairs. They can appeal this decision. They are eligible for
Medicare while appealing the decision. To re-enrol they must provide the
following:

-   a completed Medicare enrolment form (MS004)
-   evidence of an appeal
-   a valid visa with permission to work
-   an identification document

Note: an Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) document must be dated
within the last 2 years of date of processing.

See Table 4 on the Process page for more details.

Child born in Australia to parent/s who have lodged an appeal

-   A child born in Australia to a parent or parents who have lodged an
    appeal against a visa refusal, may be eligible to enrol
-   The child must hold a bridging visa with permission to work, and
    must be on the Administrative Appeal Tribunal (AAT) letter

Note: the child is not required to hold a valid passport. See Child born
in Australia enrolling in Medicare for more details.

New Zealand citizens

New Zealand citizens living in Australia are eligible for Medicare and
can apply for permanent residency.

Do not add an immigration data link to these enrolments. This can
incorrectly change or cease their Medicare eligibility.

A New Zealand citizen enrolled in Medicare as an applicant for permanent
residency may have their application refused. In these cases, update
their Medicare entitlement to reflect their New Zealand citizen
eligibility. Do not refuse a Medicare card in these cases.

For help, see Amending a New Zealand entitlement type.

Asylum Seekers Assistance Scheme and the Red Cross Refugees

The Red Cross will help people who have come to Australia with limited
financial means.

The customer will:

-   be subject to constant review, and
-   must provide the immigration documents to enrol in Medicare

The Medicare eligibility of these persons is no different to other
people from overseas.

For refugees who do not have photo ID, see Table 2 on the Process page
for more details.

Electronic data from the Department of Home Affairs

The Department of Home Affairs (Home Affairs) shares some customer visa
application details with Services Australia. They share details via an
electronic data link, which tells the status or outcome of an
application with Home Affairs:

-   Lodged
-   Granted
-   Withdrawn, or
-   Refused

They share these details for customers who:

-   are migrants. This includes people who have a permanent resident
    status before or after they arrive in Australia
-   are conditional migrants. This includes people who have a temporary
    resident visa, and they have applied for permanent visa. For
    example, a spouse of an Australian citizen
-   live in Australia and have applied for a permanent resident visa
-   have some Ministerial orders once the visa has been granted

Service Officers will access this in the Consumer Directory Maintenance
System (CDMS). They use the link when enrolling a customer or amending
their record.

The link from Home Affairs may not be present on the system. This is
often because it has been a short time since the customer:

-   first arrived in Australia, or
-   has lodged their visa application

The details that they send may change a customer's Medicare entitlement.
This can also affect how they will get a Medicare card.

When Home Affairs refuses an application for permanent residency or a
protection visa, Medicare entitlement ceases. The system sends a letter
telling them about their Medicare entitlement.

For example:

A customer has a Conditional Migrant status with Medicare. The
Department of Home Affairs will share a data link. It will say they are
now a permanent resident. This will update the customers Medicare
record.

If a customer’s data link is not on the system, they can still enrol in
Medicare.

Document verification

Identification documents must be verified in the Document Verification
System (DVS) before processing the application. The Process page
contains details on how to verify and record this information.

Service Officers must attempt to identify them via the:

-   Visa Entitlement Verification Online (VEVO), or
-   Immigration data link

If Service Officers:

-   can identify the applicant via VEVO or the Immigration data link ,
    Service Officers do not need to use DVS
-   cannot identify them via VEVO or the Immigration data link , Service
    Officers must verify the documents in DVS prior to processing the
    application

Expired Identity document

Expired Foreign passport

Services Australia can accept an expired passport up to a maximum of 2
years from the expired date providing the passport number:

-   was recorded in CDMS at the initial enrolment, and
-   can be verified in the Visa Entitlement Verification Online (VEVO)

Expired Immicard

An expired Immicard is still a valid identity document. We do not accept
an expired Immicard as evidence of identity for initial enrolments.

If a customer shows an expired identity document, they must show one of
the below:

-   current Australian driver’s licence, or
-   current Proof of ID card

The Resources page contains links to contact details and the Medicare
enrolment application form. There are links to results codes, data
tables and country codes, as well as details about issuing a card and
the time frame for each card.
