Trainee is a job seeker

A trainee, other than an Australian Apprentice (apprentice or trainee),
is considered to be a job seeker and may qualify for JobSeeker Payment
(JSP) or Youth Allowance (YA) (job seeker) provided they meet all the
relevant qualification and payability criteria.

Provider as an approved activity that satisfies their mutual obligation
requirements. The approved activity may be:

-   Specific to the study - Skills for Education and Employment (SEE),
    and Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP). Trainees may contact
    Services Australia on 132 850 or their nearest service centre to
    find out more about these programs or

    primary role in the approval of short courses of full-time study for
    job seekers that are provider managed. For more information see
