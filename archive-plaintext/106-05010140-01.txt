This document outlines how AIC Scheme Smart Centre Processing staff
assess the entitlement end date for the AIC Scheme.

Entitlement end date

An AIC student is generally eligible to 31 December if they continue to
study to the end of the school year. Short-term boarders are eligible to
the date they cease to board.

If the student ceases study before the end of the school year they would
be eligible to be paid to the date they last attended class. Students
who discontinue on the last day of a term other than the final term, are
paid to the later of:

-   the end of the relevant instalment period, or
-   the last date of the school term

A debt may result even if an applicant notifies within 14 days, as most
AIC payments are made in advance. Students are not eligible for AIC from
the date they stop boarding or living in a second home, cease
undertaking distance education or approved home schooling.

AIC debts are usually the responsibility of the applicant. Funds paid
incorrectly to a third party, (e.g. educational institution) may be
recovered in some circumstances. Check to confirm which party directly
received the payment.

Students may continue to be eligible for AIC as a deemed isolated
student under the 'Continuity of schooling concession' if:

they continue to attend the same school (or continue to be enrolled
through the same distance education school or undertake approved home
schooling) and

they either

-   cease to meet an isolation condition or
-   have a special need because of a change of circumstance. For
    example, change of principal family home, travel conditions, health
    conditions, parent's occupation

In this case, they are eligible:

-   from the date of the change of circumstance until the end of the
    year in which the change of circumstance occurred; or
-   for a student in Year 11, from the date of the change of
    circumstance until the end of the following year, provided they
    continue to Year 12

If they do not meet these requirements, their eligibility ceases on the
day of the change of circumstances.

Eligibility during vacation periods

If the student has resumed study:

-   in the new term no later than the 14th day of the term (or if they
    were prevented from doing so due to unforeseen circumstances), they
    are eligible for the allowance applicable to that term from the
    beginning of the vacation period
-   after the 14th day of the term, they are only eligible for the
    allowance applicable to that term from the date they resumed study

Tertiary students

AIC is intended to assist students at primary, secondary or tertiary
level, who cannot attend an appropriate state school due to geographical
isolation or other reasons specified in AIC policy.

Therefore, AIC is only available for a tertiary student whose study
comes under the state and territory minimum education or training
requirements. This means a student who has:

-   chosen TAFE or vocational education and training level study instead
    of attending a secondary school; and
-   meet the geographical isolation rules in relation to the nearest
    appropriate state school

As a result, Services Australia is unable to approve AIC for a higher
education student as they are no longer required to attend an
appropriate state school.

The Resources page contains the age and qualification requirements for
each state and territory including the end date for tertiary students.
It also contains AIC Term Instalment Periods and examples.
