This document outlines Supporting People at Risk (SPaR) Income
Management.

Determining eligibility for SPaR

Once a Notice to Commence Income Management has been lodged by an
approved referring authority, Services Australia will determine if the
customer meets all other relevant eligibility criteria for SPaR Income
Management. The agency will contact the customer and inform them of
their requirement to attend an interview as they have been referred for
Income Management.

SPaR is compulsory. However, an approved referring authority contact
worker can revoke the notice at any time.

The partner of an income managed customer will not be automatically
income managed. However the approved SPaR authority may refer both
partners for Income Management where they believe the customer will
benefit from Income Management.

Supporting People at Risk areas

SPaR is available for the approved referring authority to refer
customers for Income Management in the Northern Territory only.

Duration of Income Management

A SPaR notice can be for a period of 3, 6, 9, 12 or 24 months. The
notice can be extended if the approved referring authority believes this
would benefit the customer.

The approved SPaR authority can request Income Management be ceased at
any point in time by sending a Revocation of Income Management or
enhanced Income Management.

Payments that can be income managed under SPaR

For Income management to be applied to a customer, either the customer
or their partner must be in receipt of a category H welfare payment.

Payments that can be income managed under SPaR are a category H welfare
payment and category I welfare payment (other than instalments of
ABSTUDY).

Percentage of payments income managed

The following payments are income managed under this measure:

-   70% of a customer's regular fortnightly Category I welfare payment
    (which includes Category H welfare payments)
-   100% ABSTUDY (with Living Allowance or Pensioner Education
    Supplement (PES)) payments
-   100% of lump sum payments income managed

There are specific payments that are not income managed.

Hierarchy of Income Management Measures

A customer can be eligible for more than one Income Management measure
at the same time. In these cases, a hierarchy is used to determine which
measure the customer will be subject to. SPaR Income Management is
ranked third on the hierarchy of Income Management measures.

Note: an approved referring authority can refer a customer to Services
Australia to discuss Voluntary Income Management.

SPaR and DVA payments

The Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) administers payments which are
Category H payments and therefore recipients of these payments are
eligible for Supporting People at Risk (SPaR) and Voluntary Income
Management (VIM).

The DVA Category H trigger payments are:

-   Service Pension
-   Income Support Supplement
-   Defence Force Income Support allowance (DFISA)
-   Age Pension paid by DVA
-   Veteran Payment

DVA customers are subject to the same Income Management rules as
Services Australia customers. The task of providing this service to
these customers is controlled by the Memorandum of Understanding between
DVA and Services Australia.

It will be necessary to confirm that the customer receives one of the
DVA eligible payments and that they reside in an area where the relevant
measure is available. An Income Management Contact Officer (IMCO) will
handle all DVA cases.

Voluntary Income Management provides further information for customers
who are receiving a DVA Category H payment and want to be income
managed.
