This document outlines the process where a Parental Leave Pay (PPL)
employer has accepted the determination to pay PPL to their employee,
received PPL funds from Services Australia and has not complied with
their payment delivery or record keeping obligations.

Assisted dispute resolution

Assisted dispute resolution may be required where an employer:

-   has accepted the employer determination to pay PPL to their
    employee, and
-   has received PPL funds from Services Australia, and
-   has then failed to comply with their payment or record keeping
    obligations

Assisted dispute resolution for employer obligations may be required if
the employer has failed to:

-   pay the full PPL funding amount to the eligible employee or has made
    unauthorised deductions from PPL funds
-   provide PPL to the employee in accordance with their normal pay
    cycle (including where payment delivery dates are impacted by
    employer shut down periods or national public holidays)
-   provide the employee with reasonable access to a written record of
    their PPL, that is, payslips and/or a Payment Summary
-   keep accurate records of PPL funds received from the agency and PPL
    provided to employees

The agency may become aware of an employer's non-compliance through
contact with the employee. In the first instance, the employee must
attempt to resolve the issue with their employer. If the employee’s
attempt to resolve the matter is unsuccessful, the assisted dispute
resolution process may then be initiated.

Cases where the customer advises that their employer has become
insolvent or is in liquidation should be immediately referred to the
Paid Parental Leave Employer team (PPLEPT) for investigation.

Employers have an obligation to notify the agency of events that are
likely to affect their employee’s PPL.

Commission (ASIC) insolvency website. It also contains the insolvency
email template.
