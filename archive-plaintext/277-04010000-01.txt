This document outlines how to determine the correct account balance when
a payer is linked to an employer and their liability is calculated based
on their pay cycle.

Annual and daily rates of child support

Child Support uses annual and daily rates of child support. Generally a
child support liability is calculated per calendar month however when a
customer is linked to an employer their liability is calculated based on
their pay cycle. The calculation of liability based on a pay cycle can
cause the account balance to be incorrect. The account balance will be
incorrect where the liability accrues on the account before it becomes
due and payable.
