This document outlines the how to action and record a notification of a
change in care using the integrated approach in both Child Support and
Centrelink programs.

Care date of effect

For the purposes of family assistance payments, the date of event is
always the date the actual care changed. Where a child has come in to
care, late notification may result in the customer failing the
Maintenance Action Test (MAT). This is due to the Deciding Maintenance
Action (DMA) period expiring. This may result in a reduction of Family
Tax Benefit for the period they have failed the MAT.

For Child Support, when a care change occurs on or after 1 July 2018 and
Services Australia is notified more than 28 days after it has occurred,
the new care determination will be used for child support in the
assessment from the date:

-   the care changed, if a customer’s care has decreased
-   notified to Services Australia, if a customer’s care has increased

Where a change in care is advised after 28 days, the change will take
effect in the assessment on different days for each party to the
assessment.

Care changes for WA Ex-nuptial child support cases notified between 23
May 2018 and 14 May 2019 must be made under the legislation in place
before the amendments (effective 23 May 2018 and 1 July 2018) were
applied. When a care change occurs on or after 1 July 2018 and is
notified within 28 days, the new care determination will be used for
child support in the assessment from the date of the care change event.

Integrated Care Customer Management

Service Officers in Integrated Care work in both the Centrelink and
Child Support programs. The following customer management process apply:

-   Child Support’s Customer Management Approach (CMA). Staff undertake
    Minimum Collection Activity and common activities until the care
    decision is made. See Common and specialised activities for Child
    Support staff
-   In scope Centrelink Business Imperatives. The Resources page
    contains a link to the Business Imperatives homepage

Note: the 'Ready for Work' option in Customer First allocates work to
Integrated Care Subject Matter Expert (SME). Some Operational Blueprint
content refers to locating SME work via a report. This is not the
process for Integrated Care.

Real-time expectations

While on the phone with a customer, Service Officers will complete the
above activities and any other items within scope to finalise or
progress as far as possible. This would generally not include Family Tax
Benefit (FTB) new claims unless the customer is experiencing financial
hardship.

Integrated Care Service Officers must check the routing of the SCT
Referral intray (or other SCT intray) on both customers. If the SCT
intray are:

-   already routed to an Integrated Care Service Officer, lock relevant
    customers to that Service Officer
-   routed to a team’s none position, lock customer to that team’s none
    position
-   not allocated and sitting in the Z – DISAGREED REFERRALS Cuba
    position. The receiving Integrated Care Service Officer will keep
    ownership and lock customers in dual systems as appropriate
