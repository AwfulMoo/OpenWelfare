This document outlines the assessment of a non-customer care receiver's
assets and whether or not their assets can be exempted for Carer Payment
(CP). When assessing entitlement to CP, the income and assets of the
carer and the care receiver are taken into account.

On this Page:

Assessment under non-customer CRIA

If the care receiver does not receive a Services Australia or Department
of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) income support payment, they are assessed
under the non-customer Care Receiver Income and Assets (CRIA) test.

Note: if the care receiver only receives a non-income tested payment
from DVA, for example, War Widows Pension - WWP, they are subject to the
non-customer income and asset test.

Exemption provisions

If a non-customer care receiver's assets are over the minimum care
receivers assets test limit, they may be exempt from the test depending
on the value of their assets, liquid assets and the income amount that
will be used in calculating the income limit.

Liquid assets limits are $6,000 for single people and $10,000 combined
for partnered people. For care receivers assets test limits see the
Carer Payment (CP) - Care Receiver Income and Asset Limits link on the
Rates and Threshold page.

A decision may be made to exempt a non-customer care receiver from the
non-customer care receiver assets test where all the following
conditions are met:

-   a request has been made by the carer (for an adult care receiver) or
    the carer/parent (for a child care receiver or 2 or more child care
    receivers)
-   the request is that the assets test not be applied
-   the request provides a written estimate of the appropriate taxable
    incomes for the current tax year
-   the estimate is accepted as being reasonable

The effect of these exemption provisions is that some people with assets
above the care receiver assets test threshold will be considered to meet
the assets test if their liquid assets and current income are below the
exemption thresholds.

Disregarded assets

Some assets must be disregarded when applying the Care Receiver Income
and Assets (CRIA) test, including:

-   the family home
-   National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) funds received from the
    National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA), deposited into an
    account specifically for the purposes of managing the care
    receiver's NDIS plan, and
-   assets obtained to specifically assist the care receiver in respect
    of their disability

For more information, see Applying the assets test component of the
non-customer Care Receiver Income and Assets (CRIA) test.

The Resources page contains 2 tables with information about the rules
for the non-customer care receiver assets and income tests.
