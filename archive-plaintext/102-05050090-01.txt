This document outlines information for Service Officers when updating
data for a child (name, sex, date of birth, date of death and whether or
not the child’s birth has been registered). Child details exist as a
separate record and this record is linked to each customer caring for
the child. Customers in different environments to the child record will
have a ‘shadow’ child record.

Child linked to more than one person

Where more than one person is linked to a child, child updates made on
the Change Child (CCH) screen of one carer’s record will flow across and
automatically reassess the other carer’s record, whether the carers are
in the same environment or not. However, updates should be made on the
current carer’s record.

Child is a customer

If the child is a customer, for example, they have claimed Youth
Allowance (YA) or a Health Care Card (HCC), child details must be
updated on the child’s record. Details will still flow across to
customer records linked to the child.
