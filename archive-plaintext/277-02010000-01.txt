This document outlines how to interpret a child support agreement,
decide whether an agreement is properly made and administrable, how to
administer clauses, how to suspend or terminate an agreement following a
relevant care change and how to terminate or end an agreement that is
not due to care changes.

Agreements between Child Support customers

Child support agreements are legally binding and allow child support
customers to mutually decide on the amount of child support payable. An
agreement can include specific clauses, inflation factors and
instructions to address periods of unemployment or when the care
arrangements for a child change. Customers can apply for their agreement
to be administered with, or in place of, a child support assessment.

Note: for agreements and court orders for overseas maintenance
liabilities see the International New Customers section on the process
page of Customer referral guidelines, International New Customers and
Registration of overseas maintenance liabilities (excluding New Zealand)
(CS).
