This document explains the penalties that apply because of a No Show, No
Pay failure under the Job Seeker Compliance Model for Community
Development Program (CDP) job seekers.

Identifying a No Show, No Pay failure

The Job Seeker Compliance Model aims to ensure CDP job seekers remain
engaged with their provider, and comply with their compulsory
requirements. Financial penalties may be applied when a CDP job seeker
fails to comply.

A No Show, No Pay failure occurs when a CDP job seeker who is in receipt
of a participation payment:

-   does not attend a job interview, or
-   deliberately behaves inappropriately during a job interview that
    risks an offer of employment

No Show, No Pay failure penalties

When a No Show, No Pay failure is applied, this results in a No Show, No
Pay failure penalty for the failure incident date.

Penalty calculation

The No Show, No Pay failure penalty is calculated after the income and
assets test has been applied to their basic participation payment, but
before:

-   any deductions
-   withholdings of penalty amounts for previous failures
-   debts
-   advance payments or
-   Centrepay deductions are deducted from the payment

The legislative intent is that the penalty for a No Show, No Pay failure
is equivalent to 1 'working day' of a CDP job seeker's basic rate of
payment plus any participation supplements. This means over a 14 day
instalment period, a No Show, No Pay penalty is equivalent to 1/10th of
the:

-   total basic payment (after the income and asset test has been
    applied)
-   fortnightly amount of Energy Supplement
-   participation supplementary payments

The participation supplementary payments included in the No Show, No Pay
penalty calculations are:

-   Approved Programme of Work Supplement (APWS) - paid to participants
    in Work for the Dole, National Work Experience Programme (NWEP) and
    Community Development Program (CDP) Structured Activities
-   Language, Literacy and Numeracy Supplement (LLNS)
-   Energy Supplement (when received on a fortnightly basis)

Payments excluded from penalty calculation

The following payments are not included in the calculation of a No Show,
No Pay failure penalty:

-   Carer Allowance (CA)
-   Energy Supplement when paid on a quarterly basis
-   Mobility Allowance (MOB)
-   Pensioner Education Supplement (PES)
-   Pension Supplement
-   Pharmaceutical Allowance (PhA)
-   Remote Area Allowance (RAA)
-   Rent Assistance (RA)
-   Telephone and Utilities Allowances
-   Youth Disability Supplement (YDS)
-   Family Assistance payments

Penalty calculations when participation payment not paid for instalment period

When a CDP job seeker does not receive an amount of participation
payment for the instalment period in which the failure occurred, the No
Show, No Pay failure must be rejected. If the failure is already
applied, it must be revoked.

A No Show, No Pay failure penalty can be applied for the same instalment
period, if the CDP job seeker did not receive any participation payment
in the instalment period due to:

-   the recovery of previous failures
-   the recovery of debts
-   advance payments
-   Centrepay deductions

The Resources page contains a sample penalty calculation for
reconnection and No Show, No Pay failures.
