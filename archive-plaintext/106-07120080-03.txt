Customers in receipt of an income support payment whose partner has had
their visa cancelled may apply for assessment under Section 24
provisions.
Any cases where the agency has been advised that the partner's visa has
been cancelled due to security reasons must be escalated via the Level 2
Policy Helpdesk for consideration and advice on the customer's continued
entitlement under Section 24 determinations.
If a customer is already receiving payment under Section 24 provisions
when the agency is made aware that the partner's visa has been
cancelled, Section 24 provisions should continue to apply pending
further investigation (subject to regular reviews).
