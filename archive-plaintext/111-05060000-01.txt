This document outlines the Business Continuity Procedures.

Business Continuity Procedures

These procedures help Service Officers in the Centrelink Call Network
(CCN) respond to, manage and recover from the impacts of disruptions.
These include:

-   natural disasters (for example, storms, fires and floods)
-   failure of computer systems

Service Officers must follow the appropriate procedure to minimise the
impact on customers.
