Errors with automatic payments

Table 2: Follow this process only if there are errors with automatic
payments being issued to customers.

Do not follow this process if a customer's payment rate needs to change
following an explanation of a decision (review) process. That is, there
are no errors with an automatic payment, but a customer does not agree
with a payment amount they have received.
