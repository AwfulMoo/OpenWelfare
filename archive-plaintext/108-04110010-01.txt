This document outlines the process to follow when an actuarial valuation
is required. The referral is made to a Complex Assessment Officer (CAO)
who will determine if a further referral to the Australian Government
Actuary (AGA) is appropriate.

Actuarial variation referral

Service Officers must refer documents the customer has returned to the
CAO via a CAO referral. An actuarial valuation referral to the AGA can
only be made by the CAO. CAOs may request actuarial valuations for:

-   value of a deferred annuity
-   value of a life interest created by a person, their partner or upon
    the death of their partner
-   value of a surrendered life interest for disposal purposes
-   value of a purchased (private) annuity or annuity received on
    transfer of property for disposal purposes, not an annuity purchased
    from a financial institution
-   value of a contingent, remainder or reversionary interest created by
    a customer or acquired for valuable consideration

From 27 October 2011, actuarial valuations are no longer requested to
assess asset-test exempt (ATE) lifetime and life expectancy income
streams for deprivation or return of purchase price. CAOs calculate the
return of purchase price and any deprivation is assessed from
commencement of the income stream.
