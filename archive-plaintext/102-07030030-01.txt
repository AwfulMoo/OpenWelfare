This document outlines the effect of commencement of full-time
employment by a student for whom Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC)
is paid.

Maintenance of required study load

As these students are not subject to personal income testing, AIC can
continue if the full time work does not interfere with their ability to
maintain the required study load, e.g. work undertaken over vacation
periods.

If an AIC student has discontinued study and is commencing work as a
full-time Australian Apprentice, AIC should be cancelled. Entitlement to
Youth Allowance or ABSTUDY should be considered instead.
