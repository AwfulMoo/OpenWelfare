This document outlines how the coronavirus (COVID-19) response starting
in March 2020, has impacted mutual obligation, participation
requirements and job seeker compliance processes. Service Officers must
check Operational Messages for any current altered arrangements.

Altered Requirements

In response to COVID-19 restrictions the Government made temporary
changes to mutual obligation requirements for affected job seekers and
ParentsNext participants (hereafter referred to as job seekers). When
this has occurred, specific rules applied to mutual obligation
requirements and job seeker compliance based on geographical location,
such as: State / Territory and/or by postcode/LGA/CDP region. Generally
the Government applies these contingency arrangements as a result of a
public health order issued by the relevant State or Territory.

For Community Development Program (CDP) job seekers, reduced or altered
mutual obligation requirements may also be implemented at a local level
by the CDP provider for their CDP region. This can occur in
circumstances where the community or CDP region is impacted by COVID-19
and where localised restrictions may be introduced by community or
regional authorities, without a public health order being issued by the
Territory or State Government.

Some locations were affected by multiple COVID-19 outbreaks. This means
that mutual obligation requirements and job seeker compliance
arrangements may have changed multiple times for specific locations.

Information regarding changes to mutual obligation requirements and/or
employment servicing in specific communities and CDP regions due to
COVID-19 can be obtained from a range of sources:

-   Ask the job seeker to provide details about local COVID-19
    management measures
-   Contact the job seeker's CDP provider
-   Check media and internal messaging
-   Access and utilise the knowledge of Indigenous Service Officers
    (ISO)
-   Check the Indigenous Community Events page

Some locations were affected by multiple COVID-19 outbreaks. This means
that mutual obligation requirements and job seeker compliance
arrangements may have changed multiple times for specific locations.

These arrangements may apply to customers in receipt of:

-   JobSeeker Payment (JSP)
-   Youth Allowance (YA) (other)
-   Parenting Payment (PP) for a single customer (when their youngest
    child turns 6)
-   Parenting Payment and are a compulsory ParentsNext participant
-   Special Benefit (SpB) (Nominated Visa Holders)

If a job seeker changed address, the relevant mutual obligation
requirements and job seeker compliance arrangements for their new
location are automatically applied.

Note: in addition, other COVID-19 related measures remain in place for
all job seekers, regardless of geographical location (e.g. exemptions
from mutual obligation requirements due to COVID-19 impacts).

The Resources page contains:

-   exemption codes
-   links to external websites for further coronavirus (COVID-19)
    details
-   a link to the Indigenous Community Events page, which contains
    details of CDP regions where servicing is impacted by COVID-19
    restrictions, and
-   tables containing mutual obligation pause and resumption dates for
    all states
