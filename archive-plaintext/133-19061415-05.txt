Current Push Notifications

Push Notifications provide an easy way for customers to connect to the
agency’s digital channel. They alert customers to tasks they can
complete in the Express Plus Centrelink mobile app. When they select a
Push Notification, it directs them to sign into the app where they are
authenticated and taken to the required task to complete it.

To get Push Notifications, customers need to:

-   be connected to the internet
-   have the app installed on their device
-   be subscribed to Push Notifications
-   have Push Notifications turned ON in the Settings in their device.
