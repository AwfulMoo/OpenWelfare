Treatment specifics

Treatment cycles

A cycle reset for this program occurred on 1 October 2021. All previous
trials and failures of PBS-subsidised biological medicines for a patient
for this condition have been reset.

Treatment failures and breaks

-   Within the same treatment cycle, a patient cannot trial and fail, or
    cease to respond to, the same PBS-subsidised biological medicine
    more than once
-   Once a patient has either failed or ceased to respond to treatment 3
    times, they are deemed to have completed a treatment cycle and they
    must have, at a minimum, a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised biological
    medicine therapy before they are eligible to commence the next cycle
-   There is no limit to the number of treatment cycles a patient may
    undertake in their lifetime
