|                                   | percentage is used to calculate   |
|                                   | how much of the standard hourly   |
|                                   | rate of Child Care Benefit (CCB)  |
|                                   | the customer is eligible to       |
|                                   | receive. The child care service   |
|                                   | will adjust the fees using the    |
|                                   | CCB percentage displayed. The     |
|                                   | percentages displayed are only    |
|                                   | applied to the standard child     |
|                                   | care hourly rate. This rate may   |
|                                   | be lower than the rate the child  |
|                                   | care service charges.             |

|                                   | For example, if the percentage is |
|                                   | 100% the customer could have up   |
|                                   | to a maximum of the standard      |
|                                   | hourly rate per hour deducted     |
|                                   | from the total fee for a child    |
|                                   | who is not at school.             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The amount of fee reduction is    |
|                                   | less if the child attends school. |
|                                   | If the customer has more than one |
|                                   | child in child care, or they use  |
|                                   | family day care, the fee          |
|                                   | reduction may be higher. The      |
|                                   | child care service will tell the  |
|                                   | customer exactly how much they    |
|                                   | have to pay.                      |

|                                   | calculated can differ to any      |
