P24845 problem and workaround

The P24845 system issue may impact in the following scenarios:

-   A step parent is claiming Family Tax Benefit (FTB) that has been
    transferred to them from a biological parent, and the other
    biological parent also becomes entitled to receive FTB, for example,
    their percentage of care increases to above 35%, and they make a
    claim
-   The biological parent transfers their FTB to a step parent and they
    later separate. Care details for the child will not be transferred
    correctly to Child Support if a past period care refresh is
    requested
-   The care may transfer to the step parent's child support record
    (with incorrect child relationship details) causing inaccurate child
    support assessments and impacting multiple parties

As a result, if FTB is transferred out to partner ('TOP' is coded on the
Child Override/Claim (CHOC) screen - from parent to step parent) and the
customer is a Centrelink and Child Support mutual customer, these
records are to be referred for investigation. See the Resources page of
Notification and assessment of shared care arrangements for Family Tax
Benefit (FTB) for more information and details of the workaround.
