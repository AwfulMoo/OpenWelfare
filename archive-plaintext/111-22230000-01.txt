This document explains the quality checks completed by the Tasmanian
Transport Programs (TTP) Team. It covers what to check, recording
details, feedback and error codes.

Quality checks

The TTP Team Leader enters Quality Assurance (QA) checking percentages
for each staff member in myHSI for the following:

-   Process claim
-   Adjust claim, and
-   Approve Claimant

myHSI randomly selects activities for checking for each Service Officer:

-   100% of activities for new staff
-   50% of activities for newer staff who have reached an accuracy of
    90% for at least 4 weeks
-   2% of activities for proficient staff and newer staff who have
    reached an accuracy of 90% for at least 4 weeks, with 50% of
    activities being checked

The following not system, generated activities require 100% quality
checking for all staff:

-   Eligibility of new claimants
-   Eligibility of migrated claimants
-   Eligibility of southbound goods

The aim for accuracy is:

-   90% for Approve Claimant (eligibility, claimant details
    additions/updates)
-   90% for Claims
-   90% for Adjustments

TFES Assessor Tool

When an activity needs quality checking, Service Officers change the
status of the activity in the TFES Assessor Tool to Awaiting QA Officer.

Service Officers upload all forms and supporting documents to:

the Claim Documents tab for:

-   Claims
-   reviews of decisions, and
-   claim adjustments

the Claimant Documents tab for:

-   new, existing or migrated claimants
-   claimant detail additions/updates
-   applications for southbound goods

The QA Checker uses the TFES Assessor Tool to:

-   locate the activity
-   complete the check
-   record the outcome, and
-   send feedback to the Service Officer

The Resources page contains error codes and links to more TFES
information.
