This page contains links to the Services Australia website for
information for carers, and to the My Aged Care website for information
about Commonwealth Respite and Carelink Centres. It also contains an
example of how to calculate the start and end dates for coding of
respite or hospitalisation days for Carer Payment (CP) and Carer
Allowance (CA).

Scenario

Calculating start and end days

This table provides a scenario to illustrate how start and end dates are
calculated for respite or hospitalisation days.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Scenario                          | Description                       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Start and end dates               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A carer provides care on Tuesday  |
|                                   | morning and the care receiver     |
|                                   | enters respite that same day.     |
|                                   | They provide care again on the    |
|                                   | Friday afternoon when the care    |
|                                   | receiver returns home from        |
|                                   | respite. This would result in a   |
|                                   | total of two respite dates being  |
|                                   | coded. The start date is          |
|                                   | Wednesday and the end date is     |
|                                   | Thursday.                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This is because the carer is      |
|                                   | taken to have provided care on    |
|                                   | the Tuesday and again on the      |
|                                   | Friday. There are only two full   |
|                                   | 24 hour periods from midnight to  |
|                                   | midnight that the care receiver   |
|                                   | was absent.                       |
