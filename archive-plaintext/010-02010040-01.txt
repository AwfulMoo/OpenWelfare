This document outlines the process for completing a claim via the
ABSTUDY Claiming Tool (ACT).

When to use the ABSTUDY Claiming Tool

The ACT is used to record verbal claims from applicants claiming
ABSTUDY:

-   Schooling A
-   Schooling B
-   Incidentals Allowance only for secondary level study
-   Pensioner Education Supplement

The ACT is also used when an applicant or parent/guardian wants to
provide additional information to continue an ACT claim.

Applicants unable to claim via the ACT can be issued the relevant paper
claim.

For all other claims, see Claiming ABSTUDY.

Lodging the verbal claim and supporting documents

The applicant is offered a Verbal Declaration when the ACT is completed.
Where the applicant declines to accept this offer they are required to
submit a signed Customer Declaration Form (CDF). The CDF and any
supporting documents can be lodged using any of the following options:

-   [] Online - using the Upload documents service
-   Fax - see Processing Services details for: ABSTUDY and ABSTUDY PES
-   Post - via a reply paid envelope or by posting to Services
    Australia. See Processing Services details for: ABSTUDY and ABSTUDY
    PES
-   In person - at a service centre, or in remote areas, with a
    Centrelink field officer

The Resources page contains links to forms, phone us, a list of
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), and information about documents
