This document outlines information about processing pathology services
for Veterans' Affairs Processing (VAP).

Pathology services

Pathology services (Medical Benefits Schedule (MBS) Category 6) are
tests carried out on specimens of body fluid or tissue to help a medical
practitioner make or confirm a diagnosis. These tests are normally
claimed by an approved pathology practitioner (APP) in an approved
pathology laboratory (APL) that is an approved pathology authority
(APA).

All pathology tests require a specimen collection point (SCP) that
identifies the approved collection centre (ACC) where the specimen has
been collected. This SCP is linked to the APA governing that
pathologist.

The treatment location of pathology services is indicated by the initial
character of a claim ID. If the initial character is #, the claim is to
be treated as in-patient services.

The Resources page contains quick reference guides to pathology pend
message assessment.
