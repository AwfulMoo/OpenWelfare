Social Security Act 1991

-   section 1068A(3), Rate of parenting payment-pension PP (single)
-   section 4(2), Family relationships definitions-couples

Note: scroll to 'Member of a couple - general' (Subsection 2) to access
the relevant information.

Subparagraph 4(2)(b)(iv) of the Social Security Act prevents a person
who is in a member of a couple relationship from being regarded as a
member of a couple where either party is under the age of consent under
the law of the State or Territory in which they live. This restriction
does not apply to persons who are legally partnered (married or
registered relationship).

A person who has a Parenting Payment (PP) child and who is in such a
relationship will therefore not be regarded as a member of a couple, and
will be assessed under the pension PP (single) qualification and
payability conditions. The rate payable, however, cannot exceed the PP
(partnered) rate that would apply if the person was regarded as a member
of a couple (subsection 1068A(3)).

A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999

-   section 3 defines that member of a couple has the same meaning as in
    the Social Security Act 1991.
