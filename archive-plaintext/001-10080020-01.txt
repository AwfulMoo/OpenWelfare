This document outlines when a Community Development Program (CDP)
participant's payment will be restored after it has been suspended for
not attending a compulsory appointment that is managed under the Job
Seeker Compliance Framework or a compulsory requirement included in
their Job Plan, for example job search efforts.

Restoration following a suspension failure APA

A CDP participant's participation payment may be suspended 'Did not
attend compulsory participation appointment or activity' (APA) when a
suspension failure is generated or they do not accept a reconnection
requirement for a suspension failure.

The suspension is imposed to encourage the CDP participant to re-engage
with their requirements as quickly as possible. For this reason, payment
should only be restored when the CDP participant:

-   has accepted a re-engagement requirement and a re-engagement
    appointment has been booked with their CDP provider in the Online
    Diary
-   has self-re-engaged, or re-engaged following an earlier refusal to
    re-engage, by attending an appointment with their CDP provider after
    the event date of the latest suspension failure
-   is not required to re-engage due to their circumstances and this has
    been discussed with the Services Australia
-   is no longer required to re-engage with their CDP provider as they
    have been notified of the requirement to attend a Comprehensive
    Compliance Assessment (CCA) instead

Where a suspension failure is invalid and finalised or rejected without
CDP participant contact and there are no other suspension failures
outstanding, the CDP participant's payment should be restored.

The decision to restore the CDP participant's payment occurs during or
immediately after the investigation of the suspension failure providing
the CDP participant accepts the reconnection requirement. Restoration
should not occur if re-engagement has not been discussed because the CDP
participant terminates the call or the call is disconnected.

Restoration following a Non-Attendance Report (ANR)

A CDP participant's participation payment may be suspended
'Non-Attendance Report Received' (suspension reason ANR) when a valid
Non-Attendance Report (NAR) is received due to not attending an
appointment (including reconnection appointments) with their provider.
Payment is restored automatically once contact has been established
between the CDP participant and their provider and the NAR is finalised,
and:

-   the CDP participant has attended a reconnection appointment, or
-   the provider does not require the CDP participant to reconnect

When payment is restored, the CDP participant will receive payment back
to the date the suspension started.

Services Australia staff are unable to manually restore an ANR
suspension via the Benefit Action (BA) screen prior to finalising the
NAR. If this is attempted the error message 'E466PB - Unable to restore
when a NAR is pending' will appear with the following details:

-   This customer is currently suspended as there is an outstanding Non
    Attendance Report (NAR) that they need to resolve with their
    employment services provider
-   The customer needs to contact their provider and have the NAR
    completed in order for their payment to be restored
-   The customer will need to submit any outstanding reports once their
    payment has been restored

In limited circumstances, PST-skilled Service Officers with WNPPD or
PFDEC security resources are able to manually finalise a NAR where:

the participant has attempted to contact and re-engage with their CDP
provider during the provider's standard opening hours, and

they have been unable to re-engage due to circumstances outside their
control, and

they have contacted Services Australia to discuss, and

Services Australia has:

-   also been unsuccessful in contacting the provider, or
-   confirmed the provider is unable to finalise the NAR, or
-   received formal advice that the provider site is closed

Examples of circumstances outside the participant's control where a
PST-skilled SO should manually finalise a NAR in order to restore an ANR
suspension include:

The CDP provider office is closed temporarily, for example, due to lack
of staffing or other issues, or

Community events such as sorry business or community unrest have
required the CDP provider to temporarily cease offering services, or

There are no case managers available at the CDP provider office to
action the NAR, or

The provider is unable to finalise the NAR as:

-   the participant is no longer on the provider's caseload; for
    example, they have relocated and are now linked to a new provider,
    or
-   there are connectivity or systems issues

Suspension of mutual obligation requirements

Where mutual obligation requirements are suspended, for example, due to
a natural disaster or a lockdown due to COVID-19, an Operational Message
is published to advise of impacted CDP regions.

In these circumstances, outstanding NARs are automatically finalised by
the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR). If a CDP
participant from an impacted region contacts Services Australia and an
outstanding NAR has not been automatically finalised, they should be
referred to a PST-skilled SO. The PST-skilled SO should manually
finalise the NAR in order to restore the ANR suspension.

Restoring where reconnection requirement not initially accepted

If the CDP participant does not accept the reconnection requirement,
their payment will remain suspended until they agree to re-engage or
Services Australia has confirmed they have attended an appointment with
their CDP provider. In this case, where the suspension was 'Did not
attend compulsory participation appointment or activity' (APA), the
decision to restore the CDP participant's payment may occur when the CDP
participant contacts Services Australia or the 'FAILAPA' manual follow
up activity appears on the CDP participant's record to confirm their
attendance.

Restoration will occur automatically for suspension 'Non-Attendance
Report Received' (ANR) once the provider has finalised the NAR and
recorded that the CDP participant has either attended an appointment
with them or is not required to re-engage.

Roles and responsibilities

Service Officers with a PFDEC or WNPPD security resource are responsible
for the following action in relation to 'Did not attend compulsory
participation appointment or activity' (APA) suspensions:

-   determining if payment can be restored
-   manually restoring payment on the Benefit Action (BA) screen
-   completing the 'Restore payment' (FAILAPA) manual follow up activity
    (where one exists)
