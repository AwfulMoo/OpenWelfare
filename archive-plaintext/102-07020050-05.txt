|                                   | Anita is receiving Youth          |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If Anita wants to test            |
|                                   | eligibility for another Income    |
|                                   | Support Payment, the new payment  |
|                                   | may start on the day after        |
|                                   | cancellation of YA, if            |

|                                   | notification period + Read more   |
|                                   | ...                               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Referring to the same scenario as |
|                                   | above, if Anita did not tell the  |
|                                   | agency within the notification    |
|                                   | period that study stopped, the    |
|                                   | coding would remain the same as   |
|                                   | above. But if Anita wanted to     |
|                                   | test eligibility to another       |
|                                   | payment, this payment is only     |
|                                   | payable from the date Anita made  |
|                                   | contact in regards to the new     |
|                                   | claim.                            |
