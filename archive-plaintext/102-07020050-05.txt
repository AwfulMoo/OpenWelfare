|                                   |     in. This is because Anita     |

|                                   |     days of ceasing but Services  |

|                                   |     the course) Anita is eligible |
|                                   |     for YA up until the end of    |
|                                   |     the last date of the 14 day   |
|                                   |     notification period. This is  |
|                                   |     because Anita notified the    |
|                                   |     agency within the             |

|                                   |     Australia did not update the  |
|                                   |     record in either the          |
|                                   |     entitlement period that Anita |
|                                   |     ceased studies in, or the     |
|                                   |     following entitlement period. |
|                                   |     Therefore, Anita is eligible  |
|                                   |     to be paid YA up until 20     |
|                                   |     February. The student End     |
|                                   |     Date on the EDC screen will   |
|                                   |     need to be updated to 20      |
|                                   |     February. The DOE to be coded |
|                                   |     on BA and NES screens is 21   |
|                                   |     February to ensure no system  |
|                                   |     errors occur, and the         |
|                                   |     payments are not incorrectly  |

|                                   | above, if Anita did not advise    |
|                                   | the agency within the             |
|                                   | notification period that study    |
|                                   | ceased, Anita would only be       |
|                                   | eligible up until the last day    |
|                                   | studied.                          |

|                                   | Therefore, the Student End Date   |
|                                   | on the EDC screen will need to be |
|                                   | updated to 5 February, and the    |
|                                   | Date of Effect (DOE) to be coded  |
|                                   | on the BA and NES screens is 6    |
|                                   | February.                         |
