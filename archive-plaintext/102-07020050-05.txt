+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Item                              | Scenario                          |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Advising within notification      |
|                                   | period + Read more ...            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Anita is in receipt of Youth      |
|                                   | Allowance (YA), is 23 years old   |
|                                   | and ceased full-time studies on 6 |
|                                   | February. Anita must advise       |
|                                   | cessation of studies within 14    |
|                                   | days. Anita advises on 14         |
|                                   | February, that studies have       |
|                                   | ceased. Anita would only be       |
|                                   | eligible for Youth Allowance      |
|                                   | (student) up until the last day   |
|                                   | studied.                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Therefore, the Student End Date   |
|                                   | on the EDC screen will need to be |
|                                   | updated to 6 February, and the    |
|                                   | Date of Effect (DOE) to be coded  |
|                                   | on the BA and NES screens is 7    |
|                                   | February.                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If Anita wants to test            |
|                                   | eligibility for another Income    |
|                                   | Support Payment, the new payment  |
|                                   | may commence on the day after     |
|                                   | cancellation of YA, if            |
|                                   | eligibility is established.       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 2                                 | Failing to advise within          |
|                                   | notification period + Read more   |
|                                   | ...                               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Referring to the same scenario as |
|                                   | above, if Anita did not tell the  |
|                                   | agency within the notification    |
|                                   | period that study ceased, the     |
|                                   | coding would remain the same as   |
|                                   | above. But if Anita wanted to     |
|                                   | test eligibility to another       |
|                                   | payment, this payment is only     |
|                                   | payable from the date Anita made  |
|                                   | contact in regards to the new     |
|                                   | claim.                            |
