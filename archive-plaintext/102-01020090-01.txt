This document outlines information about the Service Component and
Action elements of the Service Profiling tool which enables Service
Officers to manage their customer contacts and conduct Service Updates.

Screen overview

The Service Component History (PQSH) screen displays historical data of
Service Components and Service Actions. This provides the ability to
track a Service Component or Service Action over time by its status.

This screen is 'Display Only' as its only function is to provide
information. There are no updates or actions performed on this screen.
The history is shown in order of the most recent status for a Service
Component/Action at the top. Each time a new status is created for a
Service Component/Action, it is automatically inserted at the top and
the data below will be shuffled down one line. This screen is accessed
from the Profile Service Strategy (PQSS) screen by placing a 'H' next to
a Service Component. This screen cannot be manually accessed by typing
'PQSH' in the Next: field.
