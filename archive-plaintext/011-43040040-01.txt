Suppress services

Services may be suppressed on a patient history where there is doubt the
services have been recorded correctly on that patient's history.

Example: Where a Compliance investigation identifies services have been
claimed inappropriately, the services on the patient's history can be
suppressed, indicating they were fraudulent.

Suppression is only used where:

-   no other adjustment transaction applies to the adjustment, and
-   investigation of the service cannot determine who the benefit was
    paid to, or where the service should have been allocated

The suppressed services remain on the History enquiry screens for
Medicare audit trail and processing purposes.

If a patient contacts Services Australia and states that a service on
their Medicare history is not theirs, the service can be suppressed
where Medicare:

-   has investigated to the fullest
-   cannot verify how the service was recorded on the patient's history
-   is unable to substantiate the error

Qualifiers

The following qualifiers are used to suppress a line from an adjustment
claim:

-   F - Suppress unrelated services - Fraud
-   H - Suppress unrelated services - HIC
-   M - Suppress unrelated service - MOL

Adjustment reason codes for transfer and suppress transactions

Each reason code instructs the system to generate an explanation on the
statement when benefit has either been paid or rejected and to record on
patient history the reason the action took place on each line.

With the introduction of transfer and suppress actions the existing
adjustment reason code range has been expanded to indicate what type of
adjustment took place.
