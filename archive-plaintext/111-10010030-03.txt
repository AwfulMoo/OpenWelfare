|                                   | -   Ensure pages are flat and     |

|                                   |     high contrast. For example,   |

|                                   |     backgrounds, photos. If       |

|                                   |     consider writing key          |

|                                   |     prevent unnecessary rescan    |

|                                   | -   Do not date stamp the         |
|                                   |     documents. Unless it is       |

|                                   |     the date of receipt is the    |
|                                   |     date of scan                  |

|                                   | For documents with a barcode,     |
|                                   | ensure the first page to be       |

|                                   | Barcodes are often at the bottom  |
|                                   | of forms. System generated        |
|                                   | letters have the barcode at the   |
|                                   | top. Always scan the new claim    |
|                                   | form first if scanning multiple   |
|                                   | forms. See the Resources page for |

|                                   | For documents with no barcode,    |
|                                   | choose the most relevant          |

|                                   | in front of the unstructured      |
|                                   | document. See the Resources page  |
|                                   | for reclassification pages. Print |

|                                   |     1 and 2 of a 4 page form, or  |
