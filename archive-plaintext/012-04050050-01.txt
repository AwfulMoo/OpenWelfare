This document outlines information about the archiving procedures for
assessed and completed My Health Record provider applications.

Background

Applications and documents need to be stored securely because personal
information is collected with a provider My Health Record application.

Secure storage of the information applies both during and after
processing, and differs slightly depending on whether the application or
documentation is received via email or as a hard copy.

Where records are stored

HP Records Manager is the electronic storage system used by Services
Australia to securely store documentation.

The Training and Support page contains a link to HP Records Manager
reference guides.

The Resources page contains a table of naming conventions and storage
locations for My Health Record provider application types.
