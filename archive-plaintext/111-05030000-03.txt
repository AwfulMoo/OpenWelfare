|                                   | -   explain the reason for the    |
|                                   |     transfer to the customer      |
|                                   |     before the transfer           |
|                                   | -   clear out of the customer's   |

|                                   |     transferring the call         |
|                                   | -   remain in the customer's      |
|                                   |     record until the transfer has |
|                                   |     completed. This allows the    |
|                                   |     customer's record to transfer |
|                                   |     to the next Service Officer.  |

|                                   | staff must ensure that Urgent QOL |
|                                   | requests meet the criteria. See   |
