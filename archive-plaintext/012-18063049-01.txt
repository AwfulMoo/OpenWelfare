Podiatrists

Podiatrists are Allied Health professionals who undertake the diagnosis,
treatment, prevention, and management of medical conditions and injuries
of the foot, ankle and lower limb.

Disputes about removing a registration

Direct any disputes about a registration to the Australian Health
Practitioners Regulation Agency (Ahpra). The Resources page has the
contact details.

Medicare eligibility and registration

An applicant must have current registration to practise Podiatry with
the Podiatry Board of Australia. This board is supported by the
Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra).

Evidence of registration may be:

-   a copy of the Ahpra registration certificate submitted with an
    initial application for a provider number
-   an existing 'shell' record in the Provider Directory System (PDS)
    where registration details are prepopulated
-   Ahpra Information window (if available), or
-   Ahpra website search result

Registration is renewed annually on 30 November.

The Resources page has a link to the Ahpra website.

Enquiry escalation

The Medicare Provider Registration enquiry line and email inbox, managed
by Medicare Provider Services (MPS), are the front door for all
enquiries relating to processing of provider registrations.

Enquiries to this area are responded to by a Service Officer trained in
all aspects of provider registration. These Service Officers raise
complex enquiries to their team leader or a Programme Support Officer
(PSO). Where required, the enquiry will be escalated to a Programme
Officer (PO) who will liaise with the Provider Eligibility team in
National Office for assistance.

The Resources page contains a quick reference guide, useful contacts,
and links to external websites.
