This document outlines information for Assistance for Isolated Children
(AIC) Smart Centre staff on AIC payments which are normally made to the
applicant. However, payments can be directed to a third party (for
example, the school, boarding institution, private board provider, or
the student) if this is requested by the applicant.

Request and procedure

The request can be made at the new claim stage or while in receipt of
AIC.

This procedure is for AIC Smart Centre staff. It describes the coding
procedures for arranging an AIC payment to be sent to a third party or
an educational institution. Service Officers outside AIC Smart Centres
should not process these requests. Phone calls, DOCs and forms should be
referred to the relevant AIC Smart Centre. Look up Processing Service
details for: Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC).
