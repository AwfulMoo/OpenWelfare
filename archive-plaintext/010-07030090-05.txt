|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Aminah is a Youth Allowance       |
|                                   | student who starts her approved   |

|                                   | 2021 as part of her online claim. |
|                                   | Her claim is finalised on 10      |
|                                   | August 2021 - her QTD is 10       |
|                                   | August 2021 and her QTD type      |
|                                   | (QTT) is A.                       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Aminah stops studying on 31       |
|                                   | August 2021 as she does not want  |
|                                   | to continue to study her course.  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Although Aminah remains eligible  |
|                                   | on her QTD 10 August 2021, she    |
|                                   | has not meet the SSL study        |
|                                   | requirements for the loan period  |
|                                   | as she ceased studying within 35  |
|                                   | days of her QTD and the reason    |
|                                   | was not due to exceptional        |
|                                   | circumstances beyond her control. |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The system will raise a Social    |
|                                   | Security debt and the debt will   |
|                                   | be recovered by Services          |
|                                   | Australia. The SSL payment will   |
|                                   | not be transferred to the ATO to  |
|                                   | recover through the taxation      |
|                                   | system.                           |

| 2                                 | QTD type (QTT) A customer         |
|                                   | completes course within 35 days   |
|                                   | of QTD                            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Sam is completing the final       |
|                                   | semester of his approved          |
|                                   | scholarship course and his course |
|                                   | will end on 20 November 2021. He  |
|                                   | uses the 'Apply for/Manage        |
|                                   | Student Start-up Loan' online     |
|                                   | service on 10 September 2021 to   |
|                                   | apply for SSL for Loan Period 2   |
|                                   | 2021 but due to reporting high    |
|                                   | income he is current on nil       |
|                                   | entitlement until 1 November      |
|                                   | 2021.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Sam applied for the loan more     |
|                                   | than 35 days before his course    |
|                                   | ended, so has met claim time      |
|                                   | limits. His QTD is 1 November     |
|                                   | 2021 as this is the first day     |
|                                   | after submitting his claim that   |
|                                   | he is payable due to high income. |
|                                   | His QTD Type (QTT) is A.          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Sam was enrolled and completes    |
|                                   | his course on 20 November. It     |
|                                   | does not matter that this was     |
|                                   | within 35 days of his QTD as he   |
|                                   | completed his course, and         |
|                                   | therefore has met the study       |
|                                   | requirements for SSL for this     |
|                                   | loan period.                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Sam does not have a Social        |
|                                   | Security/ABSTUDY debt. The SSL    |
|                                   | will be transferred to the ATO    |
|                                   | and Sam will need to repay this   |
|                                   | loan through the taxation system. |

|                                   | Jane lodged a claim for ABSTUDY   |
|                                   | on 1 November 2020. Her approved  |
|                                   | scholarship course started 1      |
|                                   | March 2020 and finishes on 28     |
|                                   | November 2022. She applied for    |
|                                   | SSL for loan period 2 2020. Her   |
|                                   | claim was processed on 9 January  |
|                                   | 2021.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Jane's SSL was determined on 9    |
|                                   | January 2021. This is after the   |
|                                   | loan period has ended, therefore  |
|                                   | her QTD is 31 December 2020 and   |
|                                   | QTD Type (QTT) is C, the last day |
|                                   | of the loan period.               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Jane ceased studying on 20        |
|                                   | January 2021, as she no longer    |
|                                   | wanted to continue in her course, |
|                                   | there were no exceptional         |
|                                   | circumstances. Even though the    |
|                                   | date she ceased studying is in    |
|                                   | loan period 1 2021, it was still  |
|                                   | within 35 days of her QTD for     |
|                                   | loan period 2 2020, meaning she   |
|                                   | has not met the study             |
|                                   | requirements for loan period 2    |
|                                   | 2020.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The system will raise an ABSTUDY  |
|                                   | debt and the debt will be         |
|                                   | recovered by Services Australia.  |
|                                   | The SSL payment will not be       |
|                                   | transferred to the ATO to recover |
|                                   | through the taxation system.      |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Sophie lodged a claim for Youth   |
|                                   | Allowance on 20 September 2019.   |
|                                   | Her approved scholarship course   |
|                                   | started on 25 February 2017 and   |
|                                   | finished 28 October 2019. She     |
|                                   | applied for SSL for loan period 2 |
|                                   | 2019 as part of her claim as      |
|                                   | there were more than 35 days      |
|                                   | before the end of the course. Her |
|                                   | claim was processed on 15         |
|                                   | November 2019.                    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Sophie's SSL was determined on 15 |
|                                   | November 2019. As this is after   |
|                                   | her course has ended, her QTD is  |
|                                   | 28 October 2019 and QTD Type      |
|                                   | (QTT) is B (the last day of the   |
|                                   | approved scholarship course).     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | As the QTD Type (QTT) is B, there |
|                                   | is an exception to the study      |
|                                   | rules and there is no study       |
|                                   | requirement for that loan period. |
|                                   | This means that she must be       |
|                                   | qualified and studying on the QTD |
|                                   | (the last day of the course), but |
|                                   | has no obligation to continue     |
|                                   | studying after this to remain     |
|                                   | eligible to SSL for that loan     |
|                                   | period.                           |
