This document outlines the eligibility criteria for ABSTUDY Part-time
award.

Allowances

Students not studying a full-time study load, or who do not qualify for
a study load concession, cannot receive ABSTUDY Living Allowance or the
Pensioner Education Supplement (PES). If, however, they are eligible for
the ABSTUDY Part-time Award, a student may be eligible for other
allowances, such as Incidentals Allowance and Away From Base Assistance.

ABSTUDY Australian Apprentices

ABSTUDY Australian Apprentices are not eligible for the Part-time Award.
However, Australian Apprentices whose income is too high to qualify for
Living Allowance may still qualify for Incidentals Allowance under the
Tertiary Award.

Note: Australian Apprentices are not entitled to Away from Base
Assistance or PES.

Eligibility criteria for the Part-time Award

A student is eligible for the ABSTUDY Part-time Award if they:

-   are not studying a full-time study load, and
-   meet the general ABSTUDY eligibility criteria, and
-   are studying a post-secondary course, or are 18 years or older at 1
    January in the year of study and studying a secondary course

Customers who only wish to apply for Incidentals Allowance but are
studying a full-time or concessional study load are assessed under other
ABSTUDY Awards, are not eligible for the 'Part-time Award' as they are
not studying a part-time study load.
