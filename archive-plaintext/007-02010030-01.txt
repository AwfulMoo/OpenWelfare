This document outlines how customers can change their claim choice for a
newborn or adopted child.

Claim choice

Customers can choose to apply for:

-   Parental Leave Pay (PPL) and Family Tax Benefit (FTB), or
-   FTB only, and receive Newborn Supplement (NBS) and Newborn Upfront
    Payment (NBU) for the child. NBS is part of a customer's FTB Part A

Customers cannot receive PPL and NBS for the same child. For multiple
birth/multiple adoption, PPL can be payable for 1 child and the higher
rate of NBS can be claimed for other children.

PPL is generally the best choice, even if the PPL period is short, as
the rate of payment is higher. Since the introduction of Flexible PPL, a
customer can remain eligible for up to 6 weeks of Flexible PPL after the
initial PPL period has been reduced.

[] Customers can use the online estimator options to work out their
potential FTB rate. This does not include NBS/NBU.

The Resources page contains the NBS rate map and maximum rate matrix.
This shows the maximum rate payable based on whether the child is a
first or subsequent child.

Income support payments (ISP)

PPL counts as income for calculating rates of ISP. Customers should
consider the impact PPL will have on their ISP.

If the ISP reduces to a zero rate:

-   the ISP and any linked concession cards will cancel

If the customer or their partner:

-   lose eligibility for their ISP, or
-   it reduces to zero due to an employment income nil rate period, this
    also impacts their FTB

For more information, see Effect of income support entitlement on Family
Tax Benefit (FTB).
