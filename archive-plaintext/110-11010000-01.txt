For Intelligence and Investigations Branch only

This document outlines the process by which investigations are allocated
and recorded, and requirements for an approved investigation plan and
critical decision recording.

Case selection

All cases allocated for investigation have been subjected to analysis/
assessment by tactical intelligence teams and evaluation/acceptance by
the Operational Management Committee for that site. Case Selection and
Prioritisation Guidelines for each program are used to decide whether a
matter is appropriate for referral for investigation, and to prioritise
cases selected for investigation.

Gather admissible evidence

The Australian Government Investigations Standards (AGIS) state that the
primary purpose of an investigation is to gather admissible evidence for
any subsequent action, whether under criminal, civil penalty, civil,
disciplinary or administrative sanctions.

Upon receipt of a case, Intelligence and Investigations Branch staff
must ensure that case details are recorded and the case allocated on the
case management system.

Approvals

An investigation plan must be created by the investigator and approved
by the Senior Investigator or Approver before commencing the
investigation.

During an investigation, all critical decisions must be recorded and
approved by the Senior Investigator, Approver or Regional Investigations
Operations Meetings as appropriate before the proposed action is
undertaken.
