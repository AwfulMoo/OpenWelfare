This document outlines information to support initial contact about
Special Disability Trusts (SDT).

SDT definition and purpose

An SDT is a private trust established for a sole beneficiary who has a
severe disability or medical condition, generally by the parent/s or a
close relative, for the future care and accommodation needs of the
beneficiary.

The contributor may also be exempt from the deprivation provisions if
all of the following are met:

-   they are of Age Pension age. This may differ if the customer or
    partner is in receipt of a Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) Age
    Service Pension as qualification for this payment is 5 years
    earlier, and
-   they are in receipt of an income support payment or a DVA Age
    Service Pension, and
-   they are an immediate family member or a certain close relative, and
-   the SDT funds do not exceed the concessional gifting cap

An immediate family member and close relative includes natural parents,
step-parents, adoptive parents, grandparents, legal guardian for SDT
purposes and sibling for SDT purposes. It does not include foster
parents, step-grandparents, aunts, uncles, partners, children or
in-laws.

To establish an SDT the beneficiary must be assessed as meeting
specified medical and work capacity qualifications, but they do not have
to claim or be in receipt of a social security pension or benefit. The
trust is primarily for accommodation and care related costs incurred by
or on behalf of the beneficiary.

Requirements of an SDT

An SDT must meet the following requirements:

-   be 'protective' in nature
-   have only the one principal beneficiary
-   the beneficiary must meet the eligibility criteria
-   provide primarily for the accommodation and care needs of the
    principal beneficiary
-   have a trust deed containing the clauses set out in the model trust
    deed
-   have a professional trustee, or alternatively have more than 1
    trustee
-   comply with the investment restrictions
-   provide annual financial statements and statutory declarations
-   conduct independent audits when required

The sole beneficiary of the SDT must meet the definition of a person
with a severe disability or medical condition for SDT purposes to access
SDT concessional arrangements.

Gifting to an SDT

Anyone can gift to the complying trust although income support customers
must meet certain conditions to qualify for an exemption from the
deprivation provisions.
The exceptions are:

-   the beneficiary and their partner, who are only allowed to make
    contributions when funded by a bequest or superannuation death
    benefit, within 3 years of receipt of these assets
-   the Settlor, who can only contribute the settled sum

In certain circumstances, the requirement to transfer within the last 3
years may be waived under Section 1209U of the Social Security Act 1991
and in accordance with Part 3 of the Social Security (Special Disability
Trust) Guidelines where:

-   transfer of the asset to the trust was delayed as a result of court
    proceedings relating to the asset, or
-   assets were previously transferred to a trust intended to be a
    Special Disability Trust, or
-   intention was to transfer the assets within the allowable 3 year
    timeframe, and
-   contravention of paragraph 1209R(1)(b) did not involve fraudulent
    conduct

These waivers must be referred to the Income Support Means Test Level 3
Policy Helpdesk for approval.

Assets and income test

The complying SDT is exempt from the Assets Test for the beneficiary to
the extent of the funds below the concessional asset limit. If the asset
value of the trust is over this limit, the excess will be included in
the means test assessment of the beneficiary of the SDT.

If the beneficiary's principal home is part of the trust assets, it is
an exempt asset and does not count towards the trust's concessional
limit or assessable assets. Any income earned by the SDT is not
assessable under the Income Test for the beneficiary.

Deprivation provisions

The following are subject to the deprivation provisions:

-   gifts that are above the concessional gifting cap
-   gifts made prior to 20 September 2006 for 5 years from the date of
    gift
-   gifts made by customers under Age Pension age
-   gifts made by customers who are not immediate family members

Age pension age customers can contribute to an SDT and be exempt from
the deprivation provisions provided the SDT is for their child,
grandchild or sibling and the total SDT concessions applied funds do not
exceed the concessional gifting cap.

Escalation to a SDT Complex Assessment Officer (recommended for all cases)

If a customer or nominee is making initial contact about a potential
Special Disability Trust, or querying the progress of an existing case,
escalation to a SDT Complex Assessment Officer must be made for or to
expedite an assessment.
