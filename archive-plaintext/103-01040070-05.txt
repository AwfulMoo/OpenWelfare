|                                   | BasicsCard which will be used to  |
|                                   | buy food each fortnight. Sarah    |
|                                   | also set up the following regular |
|                                   | expenses:                         |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | -   Rent $260                     |
|                                   | -   Utilities $30                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Sarah usually has $65 credited to |
|                                   | the Income Management account     |

|                                   | and Family Tax Benefit (FTB).     |
|                                   | Sarah has enough to cover all     |
|                                   | regular expenses incurred.        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | As Sarah's BasicsCard allocation  |
|                                   | is via the Residual Payment       |
|                                   | method, $115 will automatically   |
|                                   | be transferred to the BasicsCard  |
|                                   | after the expenses have been      |
|                                   | paid.                             |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Sarah starts casual work and      |
|                                   | their PPS payment is reduced so   |
|                                   | only $330 goes into the Income    |
|                                   | Management account this           |
|                                   | fortnight. The system will pay    |
|                                   | Sarah's expenses using the        |
|                                   | payment priority order.           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Note: the system does not make    |
|                                   | part payments and once it cannot  |
|                                   | pay an expense in full it stops   |
|                                   | going down the list.              |

|                                   | funds                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The following expenses will be    |
|                                   | paid for Sarah                    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | 1. Schools Meals Program of $50   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | 2. Medical Expenses of $10        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | 3. Rent of $260                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This would leave $10 in Sarah's   |
|                                   | Income Management account. As     |
|                                   | there are insufficient funds      |
|                                   | available, the utilities of $30   |
|                                   | would not be paid, and no funds   |
|                                   | would be transferred to the       |
|                                   | BasicsCard, as all regular        |
|                                   | expenses were not paid. If Sarah  |
|                                   | still wanted a payment to be made |
|                                   | to the utilities company, Sarah   |
|                                   | would need to make arrangements   |
|                                   | to pay it from their              |
|                                   | discretionary funds.              |
