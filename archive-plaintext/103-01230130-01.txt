Income management

Income management is designed to ensure that money provided for the
welfare of individuals and their families is spent on priority goods and
services.

Income management is a practical measure to assist customers to meet
essential household needs and expenses. It does not reduce a customer's
entitlements, rather it sets aside a percentage of certain income
support and family payments to be spent on priority goods and services
such as food, housing, clothing, education and health care.

Customers cannot purchase alcohol, home brew concentrate, home brew
kits, tobacco, pornography or gambling products and services with income
managed funds. Customers receive the remaining part of their payments as
usual, and have total discretion to spend that money as they wish.

How income management can benefit a business

Once a business is approved to receive income managed funds it may
benefit in the following ways:

-   receiving frequent and regular payments
-   improved cash flow
-   improved financial planning
-   a reduction in overdue bills
-   a reduction in the amount of time and/or money spent on
    administering bad debts and service disconnections

Different ways a business can receive income managed funds

There are various ways in which a business can receive income managed
funds. These include:

-   the BasicsCard (EFTPOS network)
-   a direct deduction facility
-   manual 'one off' payments

BasicsCard

The BasicsCard provides customers on income management with greater
choice and flexibility to purchase priority goods and services from a
broad range of merchants. Customers can use their BasicsCard at approved
stores and businesses.

The BasicsCard is a PIN protected card which allows customers to access
their income managed money through a business or store's EFTPOS
facilities.

The BasicsCard cannot be used to purchase prohibited items. For a list
of prohibited items see excluded goods and services.

Locating organisations where a BasicsCard can be used

The Find a business or organisation search facility available on the
Services Australia website can be used to search for BasicsCard
businesses and organisations.

See the Resources page for a link to the Organisation Finder Service.

Guidelines for storage of confidential information

Guidelines have been developed for Third Party Organisations (TPOs) to
help meet their obligations to securely store confidential documents.
See the Resources page for a copy of the guidelines.

The Resources page also contains links to the Income Management
organisations page and the BasicsCard for businesses page on the
Services Australia website.

BasicsCard Merchant application process

Businesses can apply to be a BasicsCard merchant by downloading and
completing a BasicsCard Merchant Application form from the Services
Australia website. Businesses should also download and read the
BasicsCard Merchant Terms and, if applicable, the BasicsCard Special
Conditions for Taxi cab and Minibus.

Businesses can also download and read the BasicsCard Merchant Approval
Framework. This contains the Department of Social Services' (DSS) policy
guidelines which outline merchant eligibility for BasicsCard approval.

See the Resources page for a link to the Applying to use BasicsCard
payment method web page which links to all four documents.

Businesses can contact the Income Management and BasicsCard Helpdesk for
assistance and further information. The helpdesk is also able to email
any of the above documents to businesses at their request. See the
Resources page for a link to contact details for the Income Management
and BasicsCard Helpdesk.

Process when an application is received

Once a BasicsCard Merchant Application is received, a record is created
for the new merchant and the business application is attached to the
merchant's record. New records are only created as necessary.
Applications are scanned to an existing record where a record exists.

The business application is then processed by the National Business
Gateway's (NBG) Business Applications & Registration Team.

Eligible merchants

To be eligible to become a BasicsCard merchant, the requirements are as
follows:

-   the main business activity of the merchant is the sale of priority
    goods and services or other eligible goods and services
-   the ability to prevent the sale of excluded goods and services, and
-   sales in terms of dollar value of excluded goods and services is
    less than 50 per cent of the total annual dollar value turnover

DSS may determine that a merchant, who is not otherwise eligible for
BasicsCard, should be considered eligible if exceptional circumstances
exist. This may occur if the merchant:

-   is the only reliable source of food security in a community, and/or
-   provides an essential service that is necessary for meeting
    essential needs

Ineligible merchants

Merchants are not eligible for BasicsCard approval if their main
business activity is not the sale of priority goods and services or
other eligible goods and services.

The following categories of merchants are not eligible for BasicsCard:

-   door-to-door sales businesses
-   cafes that sell alcohol
-   restaurants

Merchant withdrawal

If a Business has asked to be withdrawn from the BasicsCard programme
(Voluntary Withdrawal), send an email to the BasicsCard Merchant
Helpdesk in National Business Gateway. See Resources.

The helpdesk will issue a Q723 BasicsCard Merchant – Voluntary
Termination OLA letter. Change the merchant status in the BasicsCard
Merchant Registration Workflow to withdrawn, deactivate the terminals
and DOC the record.

If the business is being terminated as a result of a compliance action,
the TPO programme assurance team in Deduction and Confirmation Branch
will supply a termination letter. See Resources for a link to the branch
intranet page. The request to deactivate the merchant’s EFTPOS terminals
from accepting the BasicsCard and updates to the BasicsCard contract
workflow can then be sent to the BasicsCard Merchant Helpdesk.
