the profit and loss for excess superannuation expenses paid on behalf of
controllers or associates Note: pre 16 March 2017

Super Expense equal to Super Guarantee (SG) amount

The following examples are based on an SG rate of 10% as applicable for
the 2021/22 financial year. See

ATO Super guarantee percentage.

No salary sacrifice to super

In many instances, the superannuation expense is equal to the SG levy.
Simply multiply the wage expense by the SG rate applicable for the tax
year.

For example, the 2021/22 entity tax return shows the following:

-   Wage expense of $20,000
-   Superannuation expense of $2,000

CAOs can also check personal superannuation statements of the customer
and partner for any SG amount(s).

The mandated SG contribution levy for wages of $20,000 is 10%, or
$2,000. This is the same as the superannuation expense of the entity so
there is no excess super contribution. No further action is required in
this example.

Employment income salary sacrificed to super

Amounts salary sacrificed to super are employment income and are subject
to the SG levy. Where the superannuation expense of an entity appears
greater than the SG Levy amount, for example, wage expense is $20,000
and superannuation expense is $7,500 (10% of $20,000 is $2,000, not
$7,500), CAOs need to determine the actual SG Levy amount by deducting
any salary sacrificed amounts.

For example, the customer’s personal tax return shows:

-   Reportable super contributions (salary sacrifice) of $5000 on their
    tax return
-   Employer Contributions of the same amount on their super statement

The entity tax return shows:

-   Wage expenses of $20,000
-   Superannuation expense of $7,500

As the personal tax return and super statement show an amount of $5,000
sacrificed to super, the total employment income of the controller or
their associate is $25,000 ($20,000 wages plus $5,000 salary sacrifice).
Deduct the salary sacrifice amount of $5,000 from the superannuation
expense of the entity. This leaves an amount of $2,500.

The SG levy amount is applied to the total wages of $25,000, which
equals $2,500 (10% of $25,000). This amount is equal to the super
expense of the entity less the salary-sacrificed amount. No further
action is required in this example.

Super expense greater than Superannuation Guarantee (SG) amount

The entity (employer) may pay an amount to superannuation that is
greater than the mandated SG levy. The controller or associate may also
choose to direct some or all of their pay to super before tax (salary
sacrifice).

CAOs need to determine the SG levy amount, which is not considered
income from employment, and therefore the excess super contributions to
determine the assessable employment income of the controller or
associate. See Assessing salary sacrificing/salary packaging
arrangements for employment income.

CAOs should first check the personal superannuation statement of the
customer and partner for any SG amounts. These will show as Employer
superannuation guarantee contributions. The personal income tax
return(s) must be obtained to determine salary-sacrificed amounts which
are shown as Reportable Superannuation Contributions. They will also
display as Employer Contributions on the superannuation statement.
Salary sacrificed amounts are added to the customer’s employment income
and deducted from the superannuation expense of the entity

For example: the 2021/22 entity tax return shows:

-   Superannuation expense: $12,500
-   Wage expense: $20,000.

The SG rate for the 2021/22 financial year is 10%. See ATO Super
guarantee percentage. The SG rate is applied to all earnings, including
salary sacrificed amounts. As such, the excess super contributions need
to be determined in order to calculate the correct SG amount.

Use the Excess super calculator to determine these amounts. Previously,
the calculator only applied to pre 16 March 2017 cases to determine
excess super contributions that were not an allowable deduction of the
entity. The calculator can also determine excess super contributions to
calculate assessable employment of the controller or associate under the
post 16 March 2017 assessment rules.

Alternatively, the following formula can be used to calculate the SG
amount and excess super contributions:

E = S - {P/(P+100} X (S + W) where:

-   P = superannuation guarantee expressed as a percentage
-   S = superannuation expense claimed
-   W = wage or salary expense
-   E = Excess superannuation not allowable

Applying the formula to the amounts:

-   E = $12,500 - {10/(10+100) X ($12,500 + $20,000)}
-   E = $12,500 - {10/110 X ($32,500)}
-   E = $12,500 (0.0909090 X $32,500)
-   E = $12,500 - $2954.54
-   E = $9545

Assessable employment income is the employment income expense shown on
the tax return, plus the excess super contributions: $29,545 ($20,000 +
$9,545). The formula also shows that the SG amount is $2954. This can be
checked by applying the SG rate (in this case 10%) against the adjusted
employment income amount: $29,545 x 10% = $2954

If the customer has salary sacrificed an amount super as evidenced by
Reportable super contributions on their tax return and/or Employer
contributions on their super statement, deduct this amount from the
entity superannuation expense and add it to the wage expense. The same
method still applies after this adjustment.
