This document outlines information about Alternative Identity reviews.
Use Alternative Identity processes when customers experience genuine
difficulty providing identity documents.

Alternative Identity reviews in the Identity Confirmation Dashboard

When completing Alternative Identity assessments, the Identity
Confirmation Dashboard automatically applies a category and review
period based on the customer's circumstances.

Service officers must have a conversation with the customer when doing
the initial Alternative Identity assessment, or a future Alternative
Identity assessment. This gives the customer extra time to provide their
identity documents or satisfy linkage.

The conversation must be done face-to-face or over the phone where
appropriate.

This allows staff to:

-   understand the customer’s circumstances to determine an appropriate
    decision and accurate coding
-   tell customers of their identity obligations and timeframe to
    provide documents and/or to satisfy linkage requirements
-   tell customers of the consequences if they fail to meet their
    obligations, e.g. payment cancellation

The customer will receive a letter asking them to provide the required
identity documents before the review due date ends.

Code any identity documents the customer provides using the Identity
Confirmation Dashboard in Process Direct.

If the customer can lodge the required identity documents but cannot
complete linkage, see the Process page in Alternative Identity.

Reasons for reviews

A reviewable Alternative Identity category will automatically create a
future review on the customer’s record. This will need further action by
the due date to prevent possible cancellation of payments.

Alternative Identity review periods:

-   are needed where a customer can lodge identity documents and
    complete linkage in the future
-   vary between 4 to 24 weeks, depending on the outcome of the
    Alternative Identity assessment

Customers are asked to provide further identity documents and complete
linkage to confirm their identity before the end of the review period.

Customers can provide documents to satisfy their identity requirements:

in person

-   at a service centre, or
-   Agent site

by post

upload them through their Centrelink online account, or

by phone when coded and verified in the Identity Confirmation Dashboard
in Process Direct

if linkage is required, the customer is required to attend in person or
complete a Video Chat

Review periods vary in length depending on the customer's circumstances
and the Alternative Identity category applied.

All Alternative Identity reviews must be completed in the Identity
Confirmation Dashboard in Process Direct.

Service officers must not place reviews on hold for any reason.

Centrelink International Staff (CIS) only

Centrelink International staff (CIS) use different Alternative Identity
assessments to grant payments under International Social Security
Agreements. See Claims for Australian payments under International
Agreements.
