| What is considered contact        | 'Contact' for claiming a Crisis   |
|                                   | Payment is considered to mean     |
|                                   | contact by any available channel  |
|                                   | by a person seeking help in the   |
|                                   | form of a social security payment |

|                                   | For example, through online       |
|                                   | channels, at a service centre or  |
|                                   | by the phone.                     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Note: the person does not need to |
|                                   | mention a specific                |
|                                   | payment/concession card or know   |
|                                   | what they are eligible for when   |
|                                   | they make contact, only that they |
|                                   | need help.                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | For example, a customer calls     |
|                                   | their regular payment line and    |
|                                   | explains that they came into      |
|                                   | contact with a confirmed case of  |
|                                   | COVID-19. The person asks if      |
|                                   | there is any help that they might |
|                                   | be eligible for.                  |
|                                   |                                   |

| What is not considered contact    | Contact by a person by any        |
|                                   | available channel that deals      |
|                                   | exclusively with a                |
|                                   | payment/concession card the       |
|                                   | person already receives, is not   |
|                                   | considered to be ‘contact’ for    |
|                                   | claiming a Crisis Payment.        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | For example, a customer’s income  |
|                                   | reporting period happens to fall  |
|                                   | within 14 days of them going into |
|                                   | self-isolation. The customer      |
|                                   | reports their income online.      |
|                                   | After 16 days, the customer calls |
|                                   | their regular payment line to say |
|                                   | they need to self-isolate and if  |
|                                   | there is any help available to    |
|                                   | them. Reporting income is not     |
|                                   | considered ‘contact’ for the      |
|                                   | purposes of claiming a Crisis     |
|                                   | Payment. The customer has missed  |
|                                   | the 14 day contact timeframe, and |
|                                   | is not eligible for a Crisis      |
|                                   | Payment for the National Health   |

|                                   | -   having a COVID-19 test        |
|                                   | -   being instructed by an        |

|                                   | are received versus needing to    |

|                                   | contacted his doctor and has      |
|                                   | taken Blake for a COVID-19 test.  |

|                                   | The claim is granted because he   |

|                                   | Maria has two children aged 5 and |
|                                   | 8, who returned from an overseas  |
|                                   | trip on 1 April 2020 and needed   |
|                                   | to self-isolate for 14 days.      |
|                                   | Maria had to leave her job to     |

|                                   | self-isolation. After the 14 day  |

|                                   | the children had returned to      |
|                                   | school, Maria contacted Services  |

|                                   | as she was no longer employed,    |
|                                   | and was granted JobSeeker         |
|                                   | Payment.                          |

|                                   | further queries about Maria’s     |
|                                   | situation to see if she was also  |
|                                   | eligible for CrP-NHE. However, as |
|                                   | it had been more than 14 days     |
|                                   | since the start of the            |
|                                   | self-isolation period, Maria was  |
|                                   | not eligible.                     |

|                                   | This is because she also needs to |

|                                   | Biswesh was contacted by the      |

|                                   | Care, who informed him that he    |
|                                   | had been identified as coming in  |
|                                   | close contact with a confirmed    |
|                                   | case of COVID-19. He was          |
|                                   | instructed to take a COVID-19     |
|                                   | test, self-isolate for 14 days,   |
|                                   | and monitor for any symptoms. The |
|                                   | day after entering                |
|                                   | self-isolation, Biswesh claimed   |
|                                   | CrP-NHE and was granted soon      |
|                                   | after, as he was getting          |
|                                   | JobSeeker Payment and met all     |
|                                   | other criteria. Wondering if he   |
|                                   | could get more than 1 payment,    |
|                                   | Biswesh lodged another claim for  |
|                                   | CrP-NHE on the same day.          |

|                                   | claim, the Service Officer        |
|                                   | checked the CRISIS_PS screen and  |
|                                   | saw that a CrP-NHE had already    |
|                                   | been granted for the same         |

|                                   | claimed again for the same        |
|                                   | quarantine or self-isolation      |
|                                   | period, his second claim was      |

|                                   | self-isolating. Jo tells the      |
