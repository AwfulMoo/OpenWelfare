This document outlines how to contact Interpreter Connect (on-demand
telephone interpreting service).

Interpreter Connect (on-demand telephone interpreting service)

Interpreter Connect is solely for staff and provides immediate
(on-demand) access to a telephone interpreter. It uses an automated
system that connects staff to the most qualified and available
interpreter for International and Indigenous languages.

Staff must not transfer calls to this service and must stay on the line
at all times. Customers cannot access a telephone interpreter on their
own. The service is not for customers to contact directly and they must
not be provided with its number.

On-demand telephone interactions are suitable for:

• Centrelink, Medicare and Child Support interactions for Smart Centres
and service centres

• staff and customer initiated calls

• unscheduled interactions

• urgent interpreter requests

• scheduled appointments where an interpreter was not booked or did not
attend

• staff working outside an agency's premises, for example staff working
from home

On-demand telephone interpreters

On-demand telephone interpreters are:

-   non-agency staff
-   contractors who are part of the agency’s panel of interpreters and
    translators or are contracted via external service providers
-   required to undergo cultural vetting if the request is for an
    Indigenous language
-   limited to availability (delays connecting to interpreters for
    certain languages may be experienced)
-   available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. There is decreased
    availability and technical support provided outside core business
    hours, weekends and NSW public holidays
