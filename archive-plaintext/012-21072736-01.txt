This document outlines information and processes for the Practice
Incentives Program (PIP) COVID-19 Vaccine General Practice Incentive
(COVID-19 Vaccine Incentive).

COVID-19 Vaccine General Practice Incentive

The PIP COVID-19 Vaccine Incentive:

-   supports eligible PIP general practices participating in Australia’s
    COVID-19 vaccine national rollout
-   helps eligible practices provide continuity of care and deliver 2
    doses of a COVID-19 vaccine to their patients

COVID-19 Vaccine Incentive payments will be:

-   paid to eligible practices quarterly
-   based on Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) COVID-19 vaccine
    suitability assessment services (assessment services) provided from
    March 2021

Eligibility

To be eligible for the COVID-19 Vaccine Incentive, a practice must:

-   be approved for the PIP
-   be accredited as a general practice against the Royal Australian
    College of General Practitioners Standards for general practices
-   maintain PIP eligibility for the entire payment quarter, including
    the point-in-time date, to be eligible for the quarterly payment
-   be authorised by the Australian Government Department of Health and
    Aged Care to administer COVID-19 vaccines to patients
-   have completed COVID-19 vaccination training for the safe management
    and administration of COVID-19 vaccines

Once a practice is approved for the PIP, there is no additional
registration process for the COVID-19 Vaccine Incentive. Payments will
be calculated automatically.

Payment criteria

The below criteria must be met to receive the payment:

-   Be the first eligible PIP practice to process a first-dose and a
    second-dose assessment service to the same patient at the same
    practice
-   Assessment services must be successfully processed i.e. billed to
    Medicare and all MBS requirements have been met
-   Vaccine doses must occur within the timeframes approved by the
    Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA)

General practitioners providing the assessment services must:

-   be current on the practice’s PIP profile
-   provide a first and second-dose assessment service to a patient at
    the same practice

Change of practice details

Practices must tell Services Australia about changes to practice
arrangements:

-   within 7 days of the change, or
-   at least 7 days before the point-in-time date

An incentive payment will still be generated if a change of ownership or
amalgamation occurs in the payment quarter that the second assessment
service is provided. The incentive payment will be made to the nominated
bank account of the registered owner at the point-in-time date of that
payment quarter.
