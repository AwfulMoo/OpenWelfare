automatically take on the residency status of the parents. The
References page contains a link to the Act.

When a child born in Australia to parent/s who is are an applicant for
permanent residency or protection visa (866), the child is automatically
taken to hold the same visa type and conditions held by the parent/s.
The child will take on the same Medicare eligibility status as the
parent.

Appeal in Progress

A child born in Australia to a parent or parents who have already lodged
an appeal against a visa refusal (active merits review):

-   prior to the child’s birth, and
-   the visa application was refused prior to the birth,
-   then the child is not taken to have applied for the same visa type (
    for example, subclass 866) as the parent/s.

In most cases the child will hold a bridging visa.

To enrol the child in Medicare, the child must be on the Department of
Home Affairs letter and listed on the Administrative Appeals Tribunal
(AAT) letter.

If the child is not listed on the Home Affairs and AAT letter:

-   the child will need to lodge a valid visa with work rights to enrol
    in Medicare, and
-   the child is not required to hold a valid passport.

Note: This would be a separate visa application to the parents. For
assistance, refer to Escalation process for Medicare Eligibility.

Both parents are eligible for Medicare

A child born in Australia who has both parents eligible for Medicare by
virtue of 2 different arrangements (for example, 1 parent is an
applicant for permanent residency and the other is a migrant) is
eligible for Medicare on the same terms as the parent who has the most
Medicare cover.

Both parents are New Zealand citizens

When a child is born in Australia and 1 or both parents are New Zealand
citizens enrolled in Medicare as New Zealand citizens the child will
take on the residency status of the parents and, the child should be
enrolled as a New Zealand citizen. The child does not automatically
acquire Australian citizenship by birth unless the parent/s can provide
evidence from the Department of Home Affairs showing that they have
applied for and have been granted a Permanent Resident visa prior to the
child's birth.

automatically becomes an Australian citizen on their 10th birthday
regardless of the parents' status.
