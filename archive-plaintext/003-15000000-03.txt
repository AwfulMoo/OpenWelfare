The Risk Identification and Referral Model process

Table 2: Use an

interpreter for interactions with customers who have limited or no
English skills or who are deaf/hearing impaired.

Staff must complete proof of identity checks to make sure they are
speaking with the customer who owns the record. If sensitive information
about family and domestic violence is disclosed to the incorrect
customer, it can put someone at an increased risk.
