Table 1: This table contains changes in customer's circumstances, links
to relevant Operational Blueprint pages and information about when it is

Marital Status field codes

Table 2: all Marital Status field codes that can be recorded for a
customer via the Marital Status (MS) screen.

Some customers may have a code recorded that is not listed in the below
table:

-   NRE (Not Required), or
-   UNK (Unknown)

These codes should not be manually coded by Service Officers. When one
of these codes has been recorded, Service Officers must verify the
customer's correct relationship status and update the system using the
appropriate code from the below table. There is no time requirement for
applying these codes. For example, a customer does not need to be de
facto for a certain period before they are considered partnered. They
also can be applied indefinitely until they need to be updated to record
when a customer's relationship status changes.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| Marital Status field  | Description           | Relationship Status   |
| Code                  |                       |                       |

Event Date field

The Event Date field on the MS screen must be updated to correctly
reflect the date the change occurred. For example, if a customer is
recorded as de facto (DEF) and advises they are now married, the event
date when recording married (MAR) must be the date they were married,
not the date they were recorded as DEF, unless the customer was
incorrectly recorded as de facto instead of married and the entry needs
to be corrected. The same rule applies when updating the Qualifier Code
field (relationship qualifier code).

Recording relationship qualifier codes

Table 3: all current relationship status qualifier codes that can be
recorded on a customer's record via the MS screen in the Qualifier Code
field.

Note: a system limitation does not allow multiple events to be coded on
the MS screen with the same event date. There may be instances where the
event date will need to be recorded on the date prior to the event (for
example, if Person Permitted to Enquire (PPE) authority is being ended
because the customer is separating from their partner, the date of event
for the PPE update must be the day prior to the separation date).
Service Officers must follow relevant Operational Blueprint processes.

Care must be taken when recording a relationship qualifier code. Service
Officers must ensure the correct code is recorded based on the
customer's current circumstances and the Event Date field is updated to
reflect when the change occurred.

Historical relationship qualifier codes

Some customers may have a relationship qualifier code recorded that are
not listed in the below table as follows:

-   GAO, ILS, PSY, RES or TEM - these codes can no longer be applied
    however, they are still valid historical codes
-   DES, PIJ, PMH - although the system will allow the user to apply
    these codes on the MS screen, they should not be used. When it has
    been identified one of these codes has been recorded, Service
    Officers should update the code to the appropriate equivalent code
    from the below table

Current relationship qualifier codes (Qualifier Code field on MS screen)

Where couples qualify for Rent Assistance (RA) as a temporarily
separated couple, the coding of the relevant temporary relationship
qualifier code TEB, TEC or TEP will not adjust their income support
payments to the single rate. The temporary relationship qualifier code
must also be used where the customer is advising of a change of address
due to separation from their partner and the separation is pending the
return of the Mod S and/or verification. This will ensure rent and
address details for the customer can be updated independently.
