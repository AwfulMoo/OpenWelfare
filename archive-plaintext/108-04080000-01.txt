This document outlines information about income and assets that have a
legislated exemption from the income and/or asset tests.

Exempt income and assets

Although exempt income is not assessed against fortnightly entitlements,
if the funds are invested, then deeming provisions apply.

An exempt asset is one that is disregarded under the assets test,
irrespective of its value. All assets, other than those specified as
exempt, are assessable.

Care must be taken when assessing a customer's entitlement that exempt
income is disregarded under the income test, but may be an assessable
asset, and vice-versa.

Note: different rules apply to an approved Special Disability Trust
(SDT). An SDT's income is exempt from the income test. The SDT's assets
are exempt from the assets test as long as the assets are not over the
concessional asset limit.

The Training & Support page contains links to the courses/training
modules in the Learning Portal relevant for this topic and its
procedures.
