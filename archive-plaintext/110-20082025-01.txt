This document outlines the process to remediate a customer’s record when
an income compliance debt had been raised wholly or partially using
averaged information from the ATO, and has now been reduced to zero
within the refund process.

Remediation processing

Remediation will be undertaken for customers who have had an income
compliance debt reduced to zero within the refund process. These
customers had:

-   an income compliance review loaded on or after 1 July 2015
-   a debt raised wholly or partially using income averaging of ATO
    data, and
-   the debt/s reduced to zero and any monies paid toward the debt
    refunded

Remediation is the process of reversing the application of income
averaging of ATO data and addressing any subsequent actions that may be
identified during the process. To do this staff will remove the averaged
income information and restore any previously declared and/or verified
earning information that was recorded on the customer's record.

Staff will need to complete all actions relating to the customer during
this process. This may include:

-   reviewing multiple Activity Management Reference Numbers (AMR)
-   reviewing multiple debts and debt periods
-   reviewing multiple compliance interventions or reviews
-   removing income from multiple employers
-   adjusting working credit and student income bank amounts
-   reassessing Family Tax Benefit (FTB) and Child Care Subsidy (CCS)
    entitlements, and
-   identifying compensation preclusion periods and subsequent charges
    raised
-   restoring Student Start-up Loan (SSL) eligibility and refunding the
    payment to the correct destination

Work items for remediation work

Staff will review the record, remove the earnings and complete any
subsequent actions that may arise. After completing all actions, staff
will record the Remediation Outcome Fast Note.
