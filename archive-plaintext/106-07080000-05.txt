|                                   | legal name on CPDS, ask the       |
|                                   | customer how this occurred. This  |
|                                   | can indicate changes in the       |
|                                   | customer’s circumstances, e.g.    |
|                                   | they have partnered or separated. |

| Common BP Match Error resolutions | Check the Name and DOB on the     |

|                                   | information matches, you can      |
|                                   | override the BP Match error by    |
|                                   | ticking the override box after    |
|                                   | attempting to verify.             |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | with the first names. For         |
|                                   | Example: Customer Name: John,     |
|                                   | William, Smith, “John William”    |
|                                   | can be coded as the First Name    |
|                                   | and “Smith” as the last name.     |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Single Name Customers             | As a general rule, place a hyphen |
|                                   | “-“ in the first name field. If   |
|                                   | the document still does not       |
|                                   | verify, try switching with the    |
|                                   | surname field. Otherwise, refer   |
|                                   | to the operational blueprint      |

| 2                                 | What are the advantages of a      |
|                                   | current address on a document?    |

|                                   | details show a person's           |
|                                   | 'locational identity'. That is,   |
|                                   | the person is at a particular     |
|                                   | address and is contactable at     |

|                                   | In addition, people will often    |
|                                   | throw out documents when a        |
|                                   | replacement arrives. The 'old'    |
|                                   | document could be found and used  |
|                                   | by someone else.                  |
