This document outlines the treatment of compensation payments that are
assessable for customers receiving, ABSTUDY Living Allowance, if the
compensation payment is taxable and is paid for economic loss due to
personal injury.

On this Page:

ABSTUDY is not a compensation affected payment (CAP)

ABSTUDY is not a compensation affected payment (CAP). The usual
requirements do not apply for:

-   claiming or obtaining compensation
-   direct deduction assessments
-   lump sum preclusion
-   recovery rules that apply to most Services Australia income support
    payments

A Module C is not required for ABSTUDY as it is not a compensation
affected payment (CAP).

Treatment of lump sum compensation payments

Assets

-   Taxable payments are regarded for ABSTUDY as the assets of the
    person to whom the compensation payment was made
-   Non-taxable payments are not regarded as an asset for ABSTUDY

Income

-   Compensation lump sums do not affect ABSTUDY like other CAPs
-   Income derived from investments made with compensation lump sum
    amounts may be assessable

The ABSTUDY child must be 16 or older for these assessments to apply.
Examples of possible assessments include:

-   deemed income where amounts are placed in savings or investments
-   attribution income from a trust if the lump sum is placed in a trust
    under a court order

Treatment of ongoing compensation payments

Taxable payments made on an ongoing, regular basis are regarded for
ABSTUDY purposes as income of the person to whom the compensation
payments are made. Ongoing taxable payments made to the:

-   parent, are included as a component of parental income under the
    Parental Income Test (PIT)
-   student or partner, are included as a component of ordinary income
    under the Personal Income Test and Partner Income Test

A partner's Compensation Preclusion Period does not affect ABSTUDY
payments if the period cannot be adjusted to take into account any
effect on the student's or Australian Apprentice's ABSTUDY payments.

Non-taxable payments made on an ongoing, regular basis are disregarded
for ABSTUDY.

Compensation payments not assessed as income or assets

Do not assess the following compensatory payments as income or assets
for ABSTUDY purposes at the time of receipt. Record these payments on
the Other Income (OIN) screen:

-   Criminal injuries
-   Discrimination
-   Workplace harassment
-   Non-economic loss
-   Death benefits
-   War injuries
-   One-off $7000 compensation payments paid to Indigenous people
    employed under the former Community Wages Scheme on Queensland
    settlements and reserves between 1975 and 1986
-   One-off compensation payments paid by BHP distributed to Indigenous
    people by the IBN Corporation (a foundation set up for the
    Innawonga, Banjyma and Niapaili peoples) that represent compensation
    for loss of Native Title rights

Continue reviewing circumstances to follow-up any amounts and their
ongoing effect on the Income Test and Assets Test. For example:

-   if a customer saves $10 000 from a settlement in their bank account,
    the higher balance may affect their ongoing payments under the
    Income Test or Assets Test

Recording of compensation payments

Payments that are compensatory in nature will usually be recorded on the
Other Income (OIN) screen. Do not use Employment Income Details (EAN)
screen to record periodic compensation paid as part of a customer’s
wages. It is not employment income and to do so may result in an
incorrect payment as well as incorrectly allowing a Working Credit
offset.

Record compensation details in a DOC where the customer:

-   is receiving ongoing periodic payments and
-   claims or is in receipt of ABSTUDY
