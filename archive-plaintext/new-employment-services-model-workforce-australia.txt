What you need to know 

Existing job seekers (including Disability Support Pension recipients
with participation requirements) will transition to the relevant
Workforce Australia service on 1 July 2022. The Department of Education,
Skills and Employment will contact them to confirm arrangements prior to
1 July.

NESM changes do not apply to job seekers engaged in any of the
following:

-   Community Development Program
-   Disability Employment Services
-   ParentsNext

 

Changes starting from 1 July 2022 include:

Rebranding
Workforce Australia will replace Jobactive. Existing references to the
current jobactive Employment Services Model and associated providers
will be replaced in all Services Australia & DESE staff and customer
facing applications such as Websites, customer online services, myGov,
Centrelink and DESE systems etc. Services Australia staff will not see
these changes applied until 1 July 2022.

A new points-based system
Jobseekers with compulsory Mutual Obligation or Participation
Requirements will be subject to a new points target. This will replace
the current activities based model and will allow job seekers greater
flexibility to choose how and when they fulfil their mutual obligation
requirements. The Targeted Compliance Framework will remain unchanged,
however the focus will shift to a points-based requirement. The Job
Seeker Compliance Framework for CDP jobseekers will remain business as
usual.

Job Seeker Snapshot
The Job Seeker Snapshot will replace the JSCI. The snapshot will be more
dynamic with questions targeted to individual customer circumstances.

Workforce Australia Online
This is a new digital platform for all Australians. It will provide
services including resume tools, online learning and job matching
services.

Workforce Australia Provider Services
They will provide an enhanced and more tailored services by focusing on
job seekers who need more support. Community Development Program and
Disability Employment Service Program will continue to be available.

Job Plans
Will be simplified and streamlined with reference to job seekers
achieving a monthly points target. The points target will replace
activities described in the job plan. Job Plans will be simplified for
job seekers and Centrelink Managed cohorts.

Transition to Work
Enhancements to the Transition to Work programme, including expansion of
eligibility and extension of programme length for some disadvantaged
participants (from 18 months to 24months).

Jobseeker registration and referral processes
New registration and referral processes will be introduced for volunteer
jobseekers. These job seekers will be referred to Workforce Australia
Online for Volunteers. There will be no maximum timeframe that these
jobseekers will be able to access this service. 

Data exchange
Improved technology and data exchange between Services Australia and the
Department of Education, Skills and Employment (DESE) will ensure staff
see updated information in near real time. This will also ensure Job
seekers do not need to provide the same information multiple times to
Services Australia and their Employment Service Provider.
