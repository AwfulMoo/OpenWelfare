How community based schemes are assessed, where job seekers can exchange
goods and services without money.

Exchange Trading Systems (ETS)

The treatment of Exchange Trading Systems (ETS) is for the purposes of
the Social Security income test.

Exchange Trading Systems (ETS) are community based schemes, where job
seekers can exchange goods and services without money (for example,
ironing could be exchanged for gardening).

Exemption from the income test

ETS schemes have a local unit of exchange, often called an 'eco', but
other names for the unit of exchange are also used.

Credits (labour) received from participation in approved ETS and other
community exchange schemes are not treated as income for Social Security
purposes. However, if both cash and credits in ETS schemes are received,
the cash is assessed as income.

To be exempt from the income test, the scheme has to be an 'approved
scheme' under the Social Security Act. The Secretary may class an ETS as
an 'approved scheme' if:

-   it is a local community-based system
-   the primary purpose is to help persons maintain their labour skills
    and keep them in touch with the labour market, and
-   it is not a system run by a person or organisation for profit

No ETS are currently approved for exemption from the income test.

The References page contains the policy link which has a list of
previously approved ETS that are now revoked.

Unemployed people remain free to participate in activities of their
choice for up to 20 hours a week, providing they continue to look for
suitable paid work.
