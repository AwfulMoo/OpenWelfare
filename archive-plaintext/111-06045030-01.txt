This document outlines how to access, navigate and complete an
Interaction Record using Customer First.

Purpose

Interaction Records are created when a customer’s online change of
circumstances update cannot be completed.

Examples of when an Interaction Record might be found include:

-   reporting employment income
-   updates to family address
-   updates to study details

Generation and completion

An Interaction Record can be generated when:

-   a customer updates their circumstances online but the update is
    unsuccessful
-   a customer accesses the online service and no updates are made but
    it is submitted by the customer

Always check the Customer Summary screen in Customer First then scroll
to the Activities tab to ensure all incomplete/outstanding work is
complete before exiting the record
