This document outlines procedures that have information regarding the
service updates that are applicable to principal carers of dependent
children who also have compulsory mutual obligation requirements.

Service updates for principal carers

Service updates for principal carers of dependent children initiate the
contact required to:

-   tell customers of their mutual obligation requirements
-   assess customers when their exemptions to participation have
    expired, and
-   review customers whose Job Plan is to work part-time and they have
    declared employment hours below 15 hours per week for 2 consecutive
    fortnights

Service updates are displayed as service components for the relevant
profile on the customer's record. Each service component is a set of
service actions to be completed, some automated within the system such
as appointment booking, and some manually (for example, conducting a
face to face contact), to finalise the process.

The details of a customer's profiles are displayed on the Profile
Summary (PQS) screen to allow Service Officers to better prepare for
customer contacts.
