This document outlines how to action job seeker management activities
generated on customer records.

Job seeker management activities

Job seeker management activities alert Service Officers that follow-up
action is required for a job seeker.

There may be a keyword (parameter) attached to an activity. It is a
short code or description that provides more details, such as the source
or purpose of an activity, and allows for a search of that activity via
the Worklist in Work Optimiser.

Job seeker activities can be created via job seeker activity management
processing or Job Seeker Registration processing.

Job seeker management activities can be actioned by Service Officers in
Smart Centres or service centres.

Outstanding activities are completed during contact with the job seeker
via the Participation Summary within Process Direct.

JSR/ADD activities

These activities are created when:

the job seeker is receiving an income support payment that has mutual
obligation requirements but does not have an active Job Seeker
Registration (JSR/ACT) status, or

a student lodges a student to job seeker transitional claim within four
weeks of their Student End Date (SED). See:

-   Student to job seeker transfers
-   Eligibility and registration as a Job Seeker Registration Only
    (JSRO)/No Remote Referral Required (NRRR) job seeker

Note: these activities should not be cancelled unless the corresponding
job seeker claim has recently been rejected, in which case, they should
be cancelled.

JSR/UPD activities

These activities apply to job seekers who receive an income support
payment with mutual obligation requirements. The activities are an alert
