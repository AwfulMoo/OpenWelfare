This document outlines how to amend Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS)
Authority approval applications.

On this Page:

Amend an application for an authority item

Service officers can amend authority prescriptions in the following
situations:

-   completing saved/pended applications
-   correcting errors made during processing written applications
-   changing a written prescription previously rejected which has been
    resubmitted for approval
-   processing phone applications or written authorities to add
    information into the Authority Comments field
-   prescription issues (for example, did not print) for which a new
    approval has been granted

Service Officers must not amend approvals in the following situations:

-   General authority items (if not proficient)
-   Complex Authority Required (CAR) drugs (if not proficient)
-   Department of Veterans' Affairs items – Contact Repatriation
    Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (RPBS) Authorities.

Record approvals - indication and/or information modified

For phone authority applications, prescribers must:

-   Provide the indication for use of that medication
-   State the restriction requirements
-   Answer any relevant questions attached to that PBS restriction

Note: The only exception is unrestricted items.

When the indication and/or information do not meet the PBS restriction
requirements, advise the prescriber that restriction requirements for
subsidy have not been met.

Grant an approval:

-   when the patient does not meet the PBS restrictions, and
-   the prescriber makes a different statement that satisfies the
    criteria (either during the course of the same telephone application
    or after calling back)
