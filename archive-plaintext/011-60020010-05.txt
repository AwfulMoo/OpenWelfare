|                                   | by the pharmacy, from the         |

|                                   | details to include the number of  |
|                                   | the prescribing doctor, or for    |

|                                   | repeat supplies, this number is   |

|                                   | practices, unlike Medicare where  |

|                                   | provider number.                  |

|                                   | is required to identify the       |
|                                   | prescriber named on the official  |
|                                   | receipt. This number must be      |
|                                   | recorded so it can be used when   |
|                                   | processing the Patient Refund     |
|                                   | claim.                            |

| Regulation 24 (Y/N)               | Under some circumstances, usually |
|                                   | because of hardship for the       |
|                                   | patient, the prescriber can       |
|                                   | indicate that the original and    |
|                                   | the repeats be supplied at the    |
|                                   | same time. This is known as       |
|                                   | supply under Regulation 24.       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | In these cases, the total cost of |
|                                   | the item is slightly less than    |
|                                   | the total cost, when the item had |
|                                   | been supplied individually. The   |
|                                   | patient is expected to pay a      |
|                                   | contribution for each of the      |
|                                   | supplies.                         |

|                                   | completed. When not, the item     |
|                                   | should be rejected, as correct    |
|                                   | payment cannot be determined.     |
