This document outlines how to assess and record lump sums.

Types of lump sum

There are 2 types of lump sums:

A form of wage or amount received for a service provided. They are:

-   remunerative lump sums
-   generally assessable if received after claiming an income support
    payment

A 'profit' that is not an exempt lump sum. They are:

-   non-remunerative lump sums
-   treated as income for 52 weeks

Assessment start date

Remunerative Lump Sums:

For remunerative lump sums, the assessment start date is the entitlement
period start date (EPSD) of the period in which the lump sum is paid.
Assessment is for a period of up to 52 weeks from this date. Any period
where an income support payment is not paid is included in this period.

The period of up to 52 weeks rule will apply to all affected
remunerative lump sum amounts received by the person or their partner
after claiming.

For assistance in determining the correct date of event, see Determining
the Date of Event for employment income.

Non-remunerative lump sums:

For non-remunerative lump sums, the assessment start date will be the
earlier of the date the lump sum is received or is able to be received.
Assessment will be for a period of 52 weeks from this date. Any period
where an income support payment is not paid is included in this period.

-   For ABSTUDY payments, non-remunerative lump sums are only taken into
    consideration when they are paid on or after the date of claim. See
    Leave and Termination payments paid by an employer for details of
    specific coding.
-   All other income support payments, are assessed for a period of 52
    weeks even if they were paid before claiming a payment

Some assessable foreign lump sums are treated differently:

-   arrears of a comparable foreign payment are assessed for the period
    to which the arrears relates, and
-   arrears of foreign income streams are assessed as if the payment was
    received throughout the arrears period

Example of lump sums

Some examples of lump sums include:

arrears of a comparable foreign payment

arrears of foreign income streams

other foreign lump sums, such as, payments in lieu of pensions and other
commutations or refunds of contributions or other withdrawals

arrears of defined benefit income stream payments from a superannuation
fund prior to commencing regular ongoing payments. See Adding or
updating a defined benefit income stream

Total and Permanent Disability benefits (TPD) from superannuation:

-   arrears for the period before regular ongoing payments of a
    invalidity lifetime pension started, see Adding or updating a
    defined benefit income stream
-   paid as a one-off lump sum payment, see Assessing withdrawals from
    superannuation

Total and Temporary Disability benefits (TTD) from superannuation:

-   arrears of Income Protection or Salary Continuance Payments received
    for the period before regular ongoing payments started. See
    Verifying and recording other income on the Other Income (OIN)
    screen

lump sum withdrawal from a superannuation fund or lump sum arrears from
a defined benefit superannuation fund

leave paid out, but not taken. That is, the money received when accrued
leave entitlements are received but instead of taking time off, the
employee remains at work and receives wages at the same time. The
procedure, Leave and termination payments paid by an employer, provides
further details

royalties

payments to sports people (such as sign on fees, sponsorship)

compensation lump sums (refer all compensation related enquiries to the
Compensation Recovery Team in the relevant state)

income from a profit sharing arrangement

commissions from employment

$7,000 lump sum from Queensland Government for Indigenous people

$4,000 or $2,000 lump sum reparation payments from the Queensland

$5,000 Rebuilding Grant for Bushfire Affected Residents in the ACT

2019/2020 Volunteer Fire Fighter payments

payments from state governments in relation to taxi industry reform

Aged Care Workforce Bonus payments

Some of these lump sums are exempt from the income test, see Exempt lump
sums.

Back pay for a period of employment

Back paid employment income is:

-   treated as income
-   assessed from the Entitlement Period Start Date (EPSD) of the
    entitlement period in which the income was paid
-   assessed for the same period of time for which the income was paid,
    up to 52 weeks. This includes where there was both a 'present legal
    entitlement' and 'no present legal entitlement' for the period of
    back pay

For example, if a customer is paid a lump sum of back pay on 9 May 2022
for the period 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2020, the back pay is assessed as
income for 52 weeks from the EPSD of the customer’s entitlement period
that includes 9 May 2022.

Note: From 7 December 2020, when back pay is paid for individual pay
periods, there is no need to correct the periods to include the back
pay.

Back pay received prior to 07 December 2020

Assessment of a lump sum of back pay received by a customer before 7
December 2020, depends on whether there was a 'present legal
entitlement' at the time it was earned.

Arrears of pay are assessed retrospectively as income if the person had
a 'present legal entitlement' at the time the arrears were earned. For
example,

-   they were paid less than the award wage
-   they were underpaid due to administrative error

The employment income must be corrected for the past period to which the
back pay applies and an overpayment raised.

If there was 'no present legal entitlement', for example when a
workplace agreement backdates a pay increase, the back pay is a
remunerative lump sum and the amount is held as income for 52 weeks from
the date the person becomes legally entitled to receive the payment.

Examples relating to back pay of wages (including prior to 07 December
2020) are available in the Resources page.

Death benefits

Death benefits paid from an employer in respect of accrued leave or paid
by a super fund in respect of accumulated super to a beneficiary (for
example, partner or dependent child) of a deceased person are not income
for Centrelink purposes. Any increase in financial investments or other
assets must be notified.

Lump sums for Family Assistance

See:

-   Taxable income for family assistance and Paid Parental Leave scheme

    family assistance payments
