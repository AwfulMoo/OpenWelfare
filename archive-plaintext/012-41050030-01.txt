This document outlines information about the calculation of derived fee
item amounts and error codes relating to Telehealth claims.

Derived fee items

Specialists, consultant physicians and psychiatrists are identified as
providing a Telehealth consultation by billing a Medicare Benefits
Schedule (MBS) ‘derived fee’ item in addition to a base consultation
item number.

Derived fee items do not have an individual fixed schedule fee or
benefit, as do other items listed in the Schedule. These items ‘modify’
the fee and benefit for the service they are associated with by applying
a fixed loading or factor. Derived fee items are readily identified by
their description of service.

Note: Telehealth derived fee item numbers have a loading of 50% (subject
to change).

For a complete list of Telehealth MBS item numbers, fees, descriptors
and related explanatory notes, see MBS Online.

The Resources page contains error codes for derived fee items for
Telehealth claims and a link to MBS Online.
