| Item                              | Scenario                          |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Nil payment due to an IMP + Read  |
|                                   | more ...                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Polly ceased work on 1 February   |
|                                   | and was paid 30 days annual leave |
|                                   | for a total amount of $2,100.00   |
|                                   | received on the same day. Polly   |
|                                   | is claiming JobSeeker Payment     |
|                                   | (JSP) on 2 February, and the IMP  |
|                                   | works out to be $70.00 per day    |
|                                   | for 30 days. The Participation    |
|                                   | Summary screen shows Polly is     |
|                                   | managed by Services Australia.    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   This means that Polly will    |
|                                   |     not be entitled to any JSP    |
|                                   |     for the first 30 days         |
|                                   | -   As the IMP is longer than 2   |
|                                   |     weeks, Polly has a choice of  |
|                                   |     either negotiating a Job Plan |
|                                   |     at the new claim interview or |
|                                   |     waiting until the IMP has     |
|                                   |     ended                         |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 2                                 | Part payment due to IMP + Read    |
|                                   | more ...                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Molly ceased work on 3 March and  |
|                                   | was paid 30 days annual leave for |
|                                   | a total of $1,000.00 received on  |
|                                   | the same day. Molly is claiming   |
|                                   | JSP on 4 March, and the IMP works |
|                                   | out to be $33.00 per day for 30   |
|                                   | days.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   This means that Molly will    |
|                                   |     still be entitled to a part   |
|                                   |     payment of JSP for the first  |
|                                   |     30 days of the entitlement    |
|                                   | -   Molly will need to negotiate  |
|                                   |     a Job Plan at the new claim   |
|                                   |     interview                     |
