CTG PBS Co-payment Program patient contributions

Table 7: this table shows the patient contribution for the measure.

  ------------------------------------------------- ------------------------
  General patients                                  Concession cardholders
  Pay the current concessional rate for each item   Free of charge
  ------------------------------------------------- ------------------------

The patient may need to pay premiums for a small number of items in
addition to the patient contribution.

PBS Safety Net Scenarios for patients participating in the measure

Joe is a non-concessional patient. He is registered for the Program and
presents you with a prescription for atorvastatin 80mg tablets. While
Joe is charged $6.80 for this supply, $42.50 is printed on his ‘Safety
Net’ sticker that you add to his family’s Prescription Record Form
(PRF).

Joe’s mother is a concessional patient and is also registered for the
Program. After dispensing her prescription for her insulin, she doesn’t
have to pay for the medicine, but $6.80 counts towards her family’s
Safety Net records for that calendar year. For more examples see
Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) Safety Net processing and
enquiries.
