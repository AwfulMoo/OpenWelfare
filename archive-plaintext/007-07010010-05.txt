|                                   | Note: Joanne will need to provide |
|                                   | the full surrogacy agreement to   |
|                                   | verify the legal                  |

|                                   | On 15 July both babies are born   |
|                                   | and Graeme and Lindsay take on    |

|                                   | is because both Graeme and        |

|                                   | If Liz meets eligibility          |
|                                   | requirements for FTB, it would be |
|                                   | payable from 3 March. This is     |
|                                   | when Pili was entrusted as part   |

|                                   | Australia, eligibility for FTB    |
|                                   | can commence because Pili was     |
|                                   | entrusted to the care of          |
|                                   | permanent Australian residents    |

|                                   | NBS and NBU would be              |
|                                   | automatically assessed with the   |
|                                   | eligibility for FTB Part A. If    |
|                                   | Liz becomes eligible or elects to |
|                                   | change to PPL, any NBS and NBU    |
|                                   | paid will be a recoverable debt.  |

|                                   | pending finalisation, Joy lodges  |
|                                   | a claim for FTB on 25 November.   |
|                                   | This is, within 52 weeks of       |

|                                   | requirements, Joy may have been   |
|                                   | eligible for PPL rather than      |
