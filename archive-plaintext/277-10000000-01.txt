Government intent

The child support scheme was introduced by the Australian Government in
1988 to assist separated parents to take responsibility for the
financial support of their children. The Child Support Registrar
administers the child support scheme.

Services Australia delivers the services and payments provided by Child
Support, Medicare, and Centrelink. Child Support is a service delivery
brand within Services Australia.

The child support scheme involves the assessment of child support in
accordance with a formula as well as the collection and enforcement of
court orders, child support agreements and child support assessments.
