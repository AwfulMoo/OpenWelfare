This document outlines information about voluntary recoveries for
Medicare Compensation Recovery including how to process a voluntary
recovery in the Compensation Case Management System (CCMS).

Voluntary recoveries

A voluntary recovery is any incoming payment toward a case that is not
considered a valid advance payment or full payment of a notice of
charge.

Examples of voluntary recoveries made by a compensation payer include
payments:

-   For expenses that have already been approved for a claim. This
    mainly occurs in workers compensation cases, and usually happens
    before judgment or settlement. This is not the same as a
    reimbursement arrangement
-   Toward a notice of past benefits before judgment or settlement, or
-   Which would have been considered an advance payment if all the
    mandatory criteria for advance payments had been met - this happens
    after judgment or settlement

Note: specific criteria must be met if the compensation payer chooses to
make an advance payment. Any payment that does not meet the criteria for
advance payments is considered non-compliant and will be treated as a
voluntary recovery and used to offset any debt owed by the injured
person.

Identifying voluntary recoveries

A voluntary recovery is identified when:

-   a receipt has been forwarded to Medicare Compensation Recovery by
    the Compensation Finance Team after a payment is received and banked
-   a payment has been received in Systems, Applications and Products
    Financial Accounting (SAPFI) and has been noted in case notes in the
    Compensation Case Management System (CCMS), or
-   advice has been received in writing from a compensation payer that a
    payment has been remitted to Services Australia

When a payment has been identified it is validated by Service Officers
who check the amount paid matches either the notice of past benefits,
notice of charge or an advance payment. Receipts or written advice from
a compensation payer are scanned to the CCMS to activate a case (if
necessary) when follow up action is required.

Unless the compensation payer advises Medicare Compensation Recovery of
a payment, the agency may be unaware the payment has been made.

Processing voluntary recoveries

Payment received before a case has reached judgment or settlement

A voluntary recovery must be added to a case in the Compensation Case
Management System (CCMS) as soon as possible to ensure when the next
notice of past benefits or notice of charge is issued, the payment will
appear as a 'voluntary recovery' and is deducted from the total amount
owing.

Payment received after a case has reached judgment or settlement

A payment where the advance payment criteria has not been met must be
processed as a voluntary recovery and the case will be finalised as a
non-advance payment in the judgment/settlement work step. If the amount
of the voluntary recovery is less than the notice of charge, the excess
amount is payable by the compensation payer to Services Australia.
