This document outlines methods of debt recovery.

Debt investigation

Sometimes customers get a higher rate of payment than they are entitled
to. Services Australia needs to determine if the amount is recoverable.
An excess payment is only recoverable if one of the debt creation
provisions says it is.

Dealing with debts

Apply the following options on raised debts, individually or in
combination:

collection:

-   recovery
-   cash repayments
-   withholding repayments from current Centrelink payments
-   garnishees
-   referral to a collection agent
-   legal proceedings (civil recovery)

waiving the Commonwealth's right to recover the debt, or

temporary or permanent write off

Note: Parental Leave Pay (PPL) employer debts can only be recovered by
cash, garnishee, or collection agent.
