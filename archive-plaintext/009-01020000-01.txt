This document outlines the employment assistance available to carers who
are in receipt of Carer Payment (CP) and/or Carer Allowance (CA).

Employment Service Providers

Disability Employment Services, jobactive and Community Development
Program (CDP) providers are the Australian Government's gateway for job
seekers to access training, skills development and work experience. The
Employment Service Providers will assist carers to develop a Job Plan
that will set out the specific services and training carers can receive
based on their individual circumstances and caring responsibilities.
Referrals are made via the Job Seeker Classification Instrument (JSCI).

Carers who are paid CP and/or CA can be referred to Employment Services
Providers at any time. Links to further information on jobactive is
available in the Resources page.

Other non-employment related services, such as support services for
carers, are also available.

assistance services:

    support by engaging in work, study or training activities. CP is an
    ACCS (Transition to work) eligible payment. A customer may be

    eligibility requirements.
