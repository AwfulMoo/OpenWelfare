This document outlines information on processing MFU tax activities, due
to multiple debts raised incorrectly.

Action MFU tax activities

The MFU tax activity:

flags that the payment summary is prevented from being issued

must be actioned to:

-   correct the negative amount, and
-   issue a payment summary to the customer

Not all MFU tax activities are the responsibility of the Compliance and
Debt Operations (CDO) Branch.

CDO debt staff will:

-   investigate the errors
-   correct the debt component amounts in the customer’s record
-   determine when a MFU tax activity needs to be reassigned to a
    non-CDO team for corrective action

MFU tax activities that do not require access to the 'Change' function
on the TXGS screen will be reallocated.
