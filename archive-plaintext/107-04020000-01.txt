This document outlines information about the raising of Social Security
debts.

Recoverable debt

A debt is only legally recoverable if it meets one of the debt creation
provisions. These provisions are in the Social Security Act 1991, which
Services Australia administers.

No recovery can start if one of the debt creation provisions is not
satisfied.
