Government intent

The HI Service is a national system for uniquely identifying healthcare
providers, including healthcare organisations and individual healthcare
providers, and individuals (patients). The HI Service forms the basis of
other eHealth initiatives such as the My Health Record. Services
Australia manages the allocation, maintenance and disclosure of
healthcare identifiers to healthcare providers and the public. This is
legislated under the Healthcare Identifiers Act 2010 (Resources).
