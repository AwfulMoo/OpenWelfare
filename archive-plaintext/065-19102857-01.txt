This document outlines the process to manually link a Services
Australia - Centrelink (CLK) or Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA)
record to an Aged Care Management Payment System (ACMPS) record.

CLK/DVA potential match requests

When a care recipient has an aged care means assessment finalised in
Customer First or in DVA Aged Care System (DVA-ACS), means test data is
sent to ACMPS. Aged care systems will compare care recipient data and
try to match the care recipient record with an existing ACMPS record. If
an exact match is found, the systems will be linked automatically and
means test data will be received in ACMPS.

If there is no exact match located, a new CLK - potential match or DVA -
potential match task is registered and held pending action in ACMPS.
Manual intervention is required to complete searching and matching.
Search ACMPS records to identify the correct ACMPS record to match to
the Customer First or DVA-ACS record. Manual CLK/DVA potential matching
may result in:

-   creating a new ACMPS record for a care recipient when one does not
    already exist
-   identifying multiple ACMPS records and further investigation to
    determine the correct record
-   identifying and resolving an error that may be preventing a match
-   referral to the Aged Care Payments Team for further action

These tasks are created in ACMPS throughout the day.

The Resources page contains a link to the Aged Care DVA referral web
form.
