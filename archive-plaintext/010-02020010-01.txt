This document outlines the protocols for processing ABSTUDY claims and
enquiries. These protocols determine the responsibilities of each
section dealing with ABSTUDY matters.

ABSTUDY enquiries

General enquiries about ABSTUDY may be handled over the phone or in
person.

The Resources page has a link to the contact details for ABSTUDY
customers and third parties.

ABSTUDY processing

ABSTUDY claims and enquiries can come through Smart Centre Call, service
centres and ABSTUDY Smart Centre Processing teams.

ABSTUDY processing is consolidated into a National Smart Centre
Processing Team. Look up Processing Service details for: ABSTUDY and
ABSTUDY PES.

ABSTUDY processing has been consolidated into a national queue and
individual claims may be processed by any of the four Smart Centre
Processing sites. There are some exceptions to this general approach.
The Process page outlines the exceptions.

The Resources page contains links to the Services Australia website and
Office Locator.
