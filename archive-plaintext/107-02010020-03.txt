|                                   | customer's rate of payment.       |
|                                   | Customers must confirm or dispute |

|                                   |     lodge a tax return, because   |
|                                   |     their income is below the ATO |

|                                   | Tell the customer to contact the  |
|                                   | ATO to find out if their Tax File |

|                                   | compromised. If the ATO confirms  |
|                                   | that their identity has been      |
|                                   | compromised, the ATO will tell    |
