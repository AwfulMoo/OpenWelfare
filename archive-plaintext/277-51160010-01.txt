This document outlines the action required by Service Officers to
complete reviews that are generated on customers' records to prompt the
follow-up of action to obtain child support for a customer receiving
Family Tax Benefit (FTB).

Actioning reviews

It is important that the review is processed as soon as possible. In
some cases a further automatic review is set to limit the customer's FTB
Part A rate for the child to the base rate if the action to obtain child
support details are not updated on the customer's record as part of the
manual follow up.

Action will vary depending on the type of review, but can include:

-   checking to see if the current maintenance action details are
    correct
-   checking to see if a data mismatch with the Child Support Master
    Program is preventing data being transferred correctly
-   contacting the customer to advise what action they need to take, or
    to find out what action to obtain child support they have taken
-   referring the case to a Social Worker to review an exemption from
    seeking child support
-   updating maintenance action details if these are incorrect or if the
    customer has taken reasonable steps to obtain child support

In some cases, details will need to be referred to the Child Support
Unit to ensure that child support details on the customer's record are
correct.
