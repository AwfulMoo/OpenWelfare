GSO records

A GSO assists in the delivery of healthcare but is not operating in the
capacity of either a healthcare provider organisation or a contracted
service provider.

Examples of GSOs include:

-   a repository operator - a person that holds, or can hold,
    information records included in My Health Records for the purposes
    of the My Health Record system
-   a portal operator - a person that operates the electronic interface
    that facilitates access to the My Health Record system
-   the HI Service Officer
-   the My Health Record System Officer
-   the Service Officer of any component of the My Health Record system
-   the National Repositories Service Officer
-   the operator of any component of National Repositories Service

Registration requirements

GSOs must be registered in the HI service, where they receive a unique
16 digit registration number. GSOs use this number when acting in their
own right.

PKI requirements for a GSO

GSOs are required to have a National Authentication Service for Health
(NASH) PKI certificate to be able to operate in the eHealth space.

Registration contacts

Potential GSOs can register in the HI service and apply for a NASH PKI
by completing the HI Service - Application to register a General
Supporting Organisation form (HW013) (the Resources page has a link to
the form). The GSO will receive a physical token.
