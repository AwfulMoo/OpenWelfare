| 1                                 | Portability of payments for up to |
|                                   | 6 weeks (4 weeks for DSP) + Read  |
|                                   | more ...                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Portability is allowed when the   |
|                                   | customer:                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   would normally meet the       |
|                                   |     mutual obligation             |
|                                   |     requirements exemptions even  |
|                                   |     if they were in Australia     |
|                                   |     (for example: family crisis,  |
|                                   |     legal proceedings), but       |
|                                   | -   the customer also needs to be |
|                                   |     overseas because that is      |
|                                   |     where the crisis or legal     |
|                                   |     proceedings are occurring     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | These payments can be portable    |
|                                   | for up to 6 weeks (4 weeks for    |
|                                   | DSP) for an approved reason.      |
|                                   | However, the actual period        |
|                                   | approved will generally be a much |
|                                   | shorter period - only as long as  |
|                                   | is needed to deal with the reason |
|                                   | for the absence.                  |

|                                   | Travelling time might be a few    |
|                                   | days or longer depending on the   |
|                                   | type of travel involved. For      |
|                                   | example, a long bus trip to a     |
|                                   | remote village could take some    |
|                                   | time. Consideration needs to be   |
|                                   | given to what travel arrangements |
|                                   | are available to the customer at  |
|                                   | the time.                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | For example: an airline might     |
|                                   | only have seats available on      |
|                                   | certain flights, or might operate |
|                                   | infrequently to an area.          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Assess the normal requirement to  |
|                                   | satisfy mutual obligation         |
|                                   | requirements. Make allowances for |
|                                   | immediate crises.                 |

|                                   | To assess the period of absence:  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   find out how long the person  |
|                                   |     would be exempt from any      |
|                                   |     mutual obligation             |
|                                   |     requirements if they were in  |
|                                   |     Australia,                    |
|                                   | -   then add travelling time and, |
|                                   | -   time which may be required    |
|                                   |     for any other arrangements    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Consider the circumstances of the |
|                                   | customer. Example: if the parent  |
|                                   | of a customer dies in Australia 4 |
|                                   | or 5 days exemption might be      |
|                                   | allowed. If the parent dies in a  |
|                                   | remote town then travel time to   |
|                                   | and from the remote area should   |
|                                   | be added. The total now might be  |
|                                   | 10 days to 2 weeks.               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Extra time may be allowed if the  |
|                                   | customer also needs to attend to  |
|                                   | related family matters. For       |
|                                   | example:                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   dealing with family property  |
|                                   |     or other interests            |
|                                   | -   custody of the deceased's     |
|                                   |     children                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The same needs to be considered   |
|                                   | where overseas travel is          |
|                                   | involved. For example:            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A person travelling to attend a   |
|                                   | custody hearing (humanitarian     |
|                                   | reason) could need:               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   A period as long as the       |
|                                   |     hearing is scheduled for      |
|                                   | -   A week before the hearing for |
|                                   |     discussions with solicitors   |
|                                   | -   A week after the hearing to   |
|                                   |     settle up and complete        |
|                                   |     arrangements                  |
|                                   | -   Travelling time               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If there are delays (for example: |
|                                   | case rescheduled), the customer   |
|                                   | should ring and discuss any need  |
|                                   | for a longer portability period   |
|                                   | (assuming the maximum period of   |
|                                   | portability has not been used     |
|                                   | up). Generally payment can only   |
|                                   | continue where the delay is of    |
|                                   | short duration. If the hearing is |
|                                   | delayed for more than a short     |
|                                   | period (for example: a week),     |
|                                   | they are generally expected to    |
|                                   | return to Australia pending the   |
|                                   | next hearing                      |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | family crisis reason) would need  |
|                                   | a week, further time if there are |
|                                   | family affairs to sort out, plus  |
|                                   | travelling time                   |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | might need a week for the visit,  |
|                                   | plus travelling time. However, if |

|                                   | should be given to the customer   |

|                                   | after returning. For example:     |

|                                   | to visit a critically ill family  |
|                                   | member then returned. Shortly     |
|                                   | after return, the family member   |
|                                   | dies therefore the customer would |

|                                   | is preferable to negotiate a      |

|                                   | Australia might be in question.   |
