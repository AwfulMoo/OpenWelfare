This document outlines the circumstances under which an ABSTUDY
secondary school student can be eligible for Fares Allowance (FAA) for
vacation travel during the study year.

Eligibility for FAA

The purpose of vacation travel for a secondary school student is to
reunite the student with family during school vacation breaks.

An eligible full time secondary school student is entitled to one return
journey between the permanent home and the study location to coincide
with each of the school term vacation breaks to a maximum of three
journeys per academic year.

Travel to a destination other than the permanent home or usual study
location may be available in certain circumstances.

Restrictions

Unused vacation travel entitlements cannot be accumulated.

An Australian Apprentice is not entitled to FAA for the Australian
Apprenticeship.

Note: some restrictions apply to eligibility for assistance to travel
interstate.

Dates.
