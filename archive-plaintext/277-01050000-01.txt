This document outlines the process to locate current address and contact
details for customers in Australia and overseas. This process is also
known as tracing.

Importance of having correct customer contact details

Having correct customer contact details ensures Child Support:

customers get the information they need, when they need it

-   can help customers manage their child support responsibilities
-   can effectively collect money for children
-   are reducing costs to the community in wasted postage, stationery
    and time, and
-   display professionalism by treating customer information with
    respect

Note: Cuba will not release a letter to be viewed by the customer via
the CS Online/myGov without a valid address recorded, even where the
customer has requested correspondence be sent via online only

When customer location is required

Customer location is required in the following situations:

Application for assessment if the applicant cannot provide the other
customer's address details

Returned Unclaimed Mail (RUM) if an intray generates because mail sent
to the customer's address is returned to Child Support

Reactive identification if a customer is already on tracing and (for
customers overseas) information obtained from the Department of Home
Affairs or another source indicates the customer is outside Australia

Proactive identification if Child Support has sufficient reason to
believe the customer's address has changed. Note: these need to be
considered with the overall information available on the case. For
example:

-   there is no recent payment history
-   letters have been sent to last known address
-   there is no returned unclaimed mail
-   the other customer or correctional services contacts Child Support
    to advise the customer has moved
-   an Equifax search or another third party indicates there is a
    different address for the customer
-   an Austrac search or other third party information indicates there
    is a different overseas address for the customer

Transmittal (payer overseas) if Child Support needs to confirm the
payer's location in order to establish their jurisdiction of residence
prior to transmitting a liability for enforcement

Residency if a customer has left Australia or a customer has moved
between 2 overseas jurisdictions and the contact information is no
longer correct

Proactive customer location activities if a customer's address is marked
as invalid on Cuba and identified via:

-   a report of customers with a Tracing indicator
-   allocation of a Tracing intray
-   the Debt Collection Ranking window

For New Zealand 'In' and 'Out' requests as outlined below

New Zealand 'In' Pre-Transmittal request

New Zealand Inland Revenue Child Support (NZIRCS) sends Child Support
customer location requests via a spreadsheet. These customer location
requests are completed by Service Officers in the International Central
Authority (CA) team.

-   NZIRCS may request customer location only or also request Child
    Support to determine a payer's Australian habitual residency (Pre
    Transmittal)
-   New Zealand 'In' Pre Transmittal request information must be
    recorded in the NZ - International tracing macro to ensure
    consistent presentation of data provided to NZIRCS

Note: under the Australia - New Zealand Agreement, for a case to be
transmitted Child Support must have first determined the payer is
habitually resident in Australia.

New Zealand 'Out' customer location request (payer resident in New Zealand and payee resident in Australia)

Child Support sends a spreadsheet of tracing requests to NZIRCS.

If NZ 'In' Pre Transmittal request check Cuba (International Central
Authority team).

If the customer is overseas (excluding New Zealand), check Department of
Home Affairs records.

In all other circumstances, attempt customer contact to confirm details.
