This document outlines the procedures involved in recording changes to a
customer's study or training and various issues surrounding these
topics.

Government intent - Change in circumstances

Changes in a customer's study, work or training activities may affect
their entitlement to receive a payment. For example, a customer who is
looking for work and who becomes a full-time student or Australian
Apprentice may not be able to receive JobSeeker Payment (JSP) or retain
their Health Care Card from the date they commence full-time studies.

Note: if in the previous 12 months, a customer has left work or was
terminated from a job, check whether earnings and/or cessation of
employment were previously declared. Where earnings or cessation of
employment has not previously been advised, an Employment Separation
Certificate (SU1) must be requested to ascertain if a failure needs to
be investigated or an income maintenance period should be applied.
