This document outlines how Service Officers can access and use MultiCal
to calculate Centrelink entitlements, other than ABSTUDY, Family Tax
Benefit (FTB) and Farm Household Allowance (FHA).

MultiCal

MultiCal is a standalone debt calculation tool, which allows for a
manual retrospective calculation of the customers entitlement to
payment.

The MultiCal debt calculator will calculate the correct customer
entitlement for:

-   Newstart System (NSS) and Pension (PEN) system rates from 1 January
    1993
-   Parenting (PGA) system rates from 1 July 1995. This is the
    legislative start date
-   Austudy and Youth Allowance (YA) debts from 1 July 1998. This is the
    legislative start date. Note: changes to YA after March 2008 and
    income bank changes after July 2008 have not been updated in
    MultiCal

The MultiCal debt calculator will not calculate:

-   ABSTUDY debts
-   Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) Scheme payments
-   Dependent children components for periods prior to 1993
-   Farm Household Allowance (FHA) debts
-   Dependent YA customer debts where there are parent income
    deductions. Due to changes to YA from 1 July 2010 with the Bradley
    Review changes, Family pool calculations of Parental Income and
    ABSTUDY

Note:

-   All debts that can be calculated via the Centrelink system and
    explained using ADEX should be calculated in that manner
-   Use MultiCal if the Centrelink system calculation is not possible
-   If needing to hand-write adjustments or other notes about the
    MultiCal calculation, it is a requirement for prosecution referrals
    not to write on calculation sheets. Write any notes on a separate
    piece of paper
-   Scan all MultiCal calculations to the customer's record
