This document outlines information to manage all aspects of the recovery
(or non-recovery) process of debts.

Manage the recovery process

The recovery process starts when a debt is raised, (determined). The
recovery process includes:

-   deciding if the debt will be recovered
-   if there is to be recovery, the best method
-   informing the customer about self service payment options
-   monitoring broken payment arrangements, and
-   selective review of current payment arrangements

Decisions about recovery or non-recovery may need to be made a number of
times during the life of a debt.

The Debt Recovery Script helps Debt Management Officers (DMO) to process
recovery of a debt.
