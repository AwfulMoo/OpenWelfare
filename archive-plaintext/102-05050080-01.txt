This document outlines information to assist Service Officers when they
need to perform a refresh action on a child's record.

Child Benefit Action (CHBA) screen

The Child Benefit Action (CHBA) screen is used to perform a refresh
action on a child. A child must be selected from the Child Selection
(CHS) screen before accessing the CHBA screen. If a child has a child
record, the only action permitted on the screen is a refresh (RSH). If
the child is a customer in their own right, all actions normally
available on the Benefit Action (BA) screen are allowed.

A child refresh action must be processed in a separate activity. No
child data can be changed in an activity where a refresh is being
undertaken.

A child refresh action is usually done as a result of an error being
displayed on the Assessment Warning and Error (AWE) screen as follows:

E103CH - Refresh action required for child (child's name)

                                   

-   Services Australia ABN 90 794 605 008
