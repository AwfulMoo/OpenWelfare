This document outlines all the issues relating to Service Profiling for
JobSeeker Payment (JSP) customers.

Service Profiling

Service Profiling is a way of identifying groups of customers in need of
a more targeted level of service.

Preparing for customer contact

Information displayed on Profiling screens allows Service Officers to
better prepare for customer contacts. Service Officers have access to a
set of recommended actions and information about issues that should be
discussed during the contact in order to achieve the best outcomes for
the customer.

The Profile relates to a specific program outcome and requires the
completion of a Service Update and to check that the correct entitlement
is received.

Service Updates are displayed as Service Components for the relevant
Profile on the customer's record. Each Service Component contains a set
of Service Actions which may need to be completed for the customer. Some
of these actions are automated and some are completed manually.
