This document outlines the process for assessing IBNR and IBNR/High Cost
Claim Indemnity Scheme (HCCS) initial, subsequent and S38 response
applications.

IBNR applications

Eligible Medical Defence Organisations (MDO) must submit an IBNR or
IBNR/HCCS application via the Medical Indemnity Online Claiming (MIOC)
system. In the event the MIOC system is unavailable for a period of time
(determined by the Director), an IBNR or IBNR/HCCS application can be
submitted with the relevant supporting documentation, via post or email.

For more information on IBNR claiming, see Medical Indemnity (MI)
Schemes Claiming.

The Resources page contains an IBNR overview, links to the Services
Australia website and an external website about MI.
