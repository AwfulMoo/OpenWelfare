This document describes the process to follow when a customer initiates
contact with a Service Officer about issues that cannot be finalised by
some staff.

Communicate with Service Officers

Customers may wish to communicate with Service Officers about issues
that cannot be finalised by some staff. The principles described in this
procedure are intended to guide staff in responding to those customers.

Services Australia will give the customer choices as to when it is
possible for them to be contacted by a Service Officer and includes
timeliness and performance standards. The choices are tailored to the
customer's individual needs.

This procedure provides general information about how to deal with
customer initiated contacts. There are protocols for booking
appointments.
