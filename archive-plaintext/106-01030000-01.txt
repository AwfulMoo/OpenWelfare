This document outlines Services Australia’s responsibility when
customers contact seeking assistance. It is the responsibility of the
agency to provide support to the customer by directing them to and
delivering the right services.

Identifying entitlements and services

Each customer contact is valued. The customer is aware of their personal
situation but may not be aware of what entitlements, assistance and
choices are available, and which appropriate referrals would help them
overcome their current circumstances.

Service Officers dealing with customer enquiries have a responsibility
to identify and provide support to the customer to ensure customers
receive the right entitlements and services.

The agency has a commitment to provide payments and services that match
the customer’s circumstances to help them achieve greater self
sufficiency.

Services Australia Bilateral Management Arrangements (BMA)

Service Officers are also required to answer questions from customers
and members of the general community about available services and
payments. They are required to provide high-quality advice to customers
about available payments and services, and encourage customers seeking
payments or services to test their eligibility by submitting a claim.

These responsibilities are outlined in the agency's BMA with the
Department of Social Services (DSS).
