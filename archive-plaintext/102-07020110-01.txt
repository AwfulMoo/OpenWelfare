This document outlines the effect on a customer's entitlement to Austudy
if they are ill or injured and are unable to continue their study or
Australian Apprenticeship, whether temporarily or permanently. It also
provides details of other payment options which may be available to
these customers.

Students

If the student continues to study, but at a reduced study load, they may
be entitled to continue to receive Austudy. To remain eligible for
Austudy payments the student must be enrolled, undertaking at least 75%
of the normal amount of full-time study and be making satisfactory
progress. If they are undertaking at least 25% of the normal amount of
full-time study and qualify for a 25% study load concession for Austudy
they also remain eligible for payment.

If the student ceases to be enrolled in their course or ceases to
undertake study, they must test their eligibility for an alternative
payment.

Australian Apprentice

An Australian Apprentice who is temporarily incapacitated and unable to
continue their Australian Apprenticeship will be eligible to receive
Austudy as long as their Commonwealth registration number remains
current. If this number is suspended or cancelled there is no
entitlement to Austudy under Australian Apprentice conditions.
