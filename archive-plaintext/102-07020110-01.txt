This document outlines the effect on a customer's entitlement to Austudy
if they are ill or injured and are unable to continue their study or
Australian Apprenticeship, whether temporarily or permanently. It
provides details of other payment options which may be available to
these customers.

Students

If the student continues to study, but at a reduced study load, they may
be entitled to continue to receive Austudy. To remain eligible for
Austudy payments the student must:

-   be enrolled, undertaking at least 75% of the normal amount of
    full-time study and
-   be making satisfactory progress

They also remain eligible for payment if:

-   they are undertaking at least 25% of the normal amount of full-time
    study and
-   qualify for a 25% study load concession for Austudy

A student may continue to get Austudy in certain circumstances as if
they were full-time where:

-   the student reduces their study load to less than full time because
    of health reasons but
-   does not qualify for a 25% concessional study load

See Resources page for examples.

A student must test their eligibility for an alternative payment if
they:

-   cease to be enrolled in their course or
-   cease to undertake study

get Austudy if:

-   their Commonwealth registration number remains current
