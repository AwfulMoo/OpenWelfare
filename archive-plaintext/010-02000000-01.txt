This document outlines information regarding ABSTUDY eligibility and
requirements for payments.

Government intent - purpose of the payment

The ABSTUDY scheme is available to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
students and apprentices.

It is administered and delivered by Services Australia on behalf of the
Department of Social Services.

Payments are made to assist with increasing access and participation in
education and training to improve employment opportunities for
Indigenous Australians.

ABSTUDY eligibility criteria

To be eligible for any ABSTUDY assistance, a student or Australian
Apprentice must meet the primary eligibility criteria:

-   an Australian citizen, who normally lives in Australia, and
-   an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, and
-   studying an approved course at an approved education institution, or
-   an Australian Apprentice, or
-   planning to study and undertaking an approved Testing and Assessment
    activity, and
-   not receiving or will not receive any other government assistance to
    study

If the applicant is aged 16-19 years, dependent, living at home and in
full-time secondary study, check if Family Tax Benefit (FTB) may be more
beneficial for the applicant's family.

Students aged 16-19 years receiving a means tested ABSTUDY payment (such
as Living Allowance and/or School Fees Allowance (Group 2)) can still be
considered an FTB child if they are:

-   a full time secondary student
-   approved to live away from home to study, and
-   boarding to attend secondary school

Awards

There are 7 Awards available under the ABSTUDY scheme. The eligibility
of a student or Australian Apprentice for a particular Award will depend
on their study, training and personal circumstances:

-   Schooling A Award (students only)
-   Schooling B Award (students only)
-   Tertiary Award (students and Australian Apprentices)
-   Part-time Award (students only)
-   Testing and Assessment Award (students only)
-   Masters and Doctorate Award (students only)
-   Lawful Custody Award (students and Australian Apprentices)

Students and Australian Apprentices approved for an ABSTUDY Award may be
entitled to one or more of the ABSTUDY allowances. The Resources page
contains a table of allowances and benefits payable under specific
ABSTUDY Awards.

Identifying the appropriate Award

A customer is not required to know which Award they may qualify for, but
they (or a person enquiring on their behalf) should be able to answer
basic eligibility questions such as their age and study details.

Service Officers should ask the applicant relevant eligibility questions
and work through the process to their answers.
