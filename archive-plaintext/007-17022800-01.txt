This document outlines FCC processing principles which provide the best
practice guidelines for all Service Delivery staff processing FCC new
claims and activities in Process Direct and Customer First.

Purpose

The FCC processing principles provide a consistent approach to manage
FCC work by:

-   working with Operational Planning to ensure organisational
    efficiencies
-   timely completion of new claim, non-new claim, telephony and
    internal review work, with fewer touch points, and
-   achieving consistent, quality outcomes for customers, regardless of
    where they live or their demographics

The FCC processing principles sets out:

-   high level principles for the management of FCC work
-   mandated process steps for working within Workload Management (WLM)
-   cross programme business process steps for management of claim work
-   lower level programme specific business/programme process detail
-   complementary support for the prescribed workflows, guided
    procedures and scripts as outlined within Operational Blueprint

Overarching principles

Workload Management

Service Officers need to follow correct Workload Management (WLM)
processes.

WLM contains information on how to access, reallocate, complete and
change the status of work items using Temporary Allocation and
troubleshooting guides.

Smart Centre staff must also follow the Business Continuity Procedures
when there are disruptions due to natural disasters and failure of
computer systems.

Business Imperatives and self-service

Smart Centre Business Imperatives are designed to ensure quality
customer service is provided at each contact. These include checking and
confirming:

-   phone details to ensure correct details are on file
-   the Customer Issues page at every contact, and
-   income estimates and payment choices for Family Tax Benefit (FTB)
    and income estimates for Child Care Subsidy (CCS)

[] In addition, all Service Officers are expected to transition
customers to the digital channel at every opportunity unless:

-   the customer is not eligible for self-service, or
-   the Service Officer deems it inappropriate based on the customer's
    circumstances. See Using self service and How customers create a
    myGov account and link services.

in Customer First. See relevant processing Operational Blueprint files
for further information.

Operational Blueprint and Network News Update (NNU)

All Service Officers need to follow business processes, prescribed
workflows and tools outlined in Operational Blueprint.

Service Officers are strongly encouraged to check each day for Current
messages and OB Updates to keep informed of initiatives and changes to
processes.

Staff must also regularly check NNU, FCC and/or National ICT Referral
Officer (NIRO) Current Issues and Process Direct sub-site Current Issues
pages for current system issues and approved workarounds. See the
Resources page.
