This document outlines action required to complete FTB reconciliation
for a customer where manual intervention is required due to immunisation
data being incorrect or the customer having a multiple record.

Check for incorrect immunisation data (#IMYALL/#IMYTON)

Manual reconciliation is required as a result of an Australian
Immunisation Register (AIR) update. This is due to the AIR data changing
from compliant to non-compliant for a child for at least 1 day in the
relevant financial year. The purpose of this reconciliation is to:

-   check the children’s FTB immunisation status
-   refer immunisation issues and override considerations to the
    Centrelink AIR liaison team
-   consider Administrative error debt waivers

These work items will hold the #IMYALL keyword

Multiple records (#MULTCRN)

Manual reconciliation on the primary record is required:

-   where a customer has more than 1 record, and
-   FTB has been paid under both records during the relevant financial
    year

The work item will hold the #MULTCRN keyword.

Manual reconciliation is not required on the secondary record/s, as any
overpayments or arrears generated will not be parked or paid. A MIV
trained Service Officer will manually transfer any overpayments or
arrears to the primary record.

The Resources page contains contact details, immunisation reason codes
and keywords associated with work items.
