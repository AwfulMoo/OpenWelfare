Historical asset tests

From 1 September 2018 to 11 June 2020, the farm asset test threshold was
$5 million. The FHA assets test for this period included 2 components.
Even if a customer qualified for FHA, it was only payable if both of the
following assets tests were satisfied:

-   Non-farm Assets Test (Tier 1) included the value of all non-farm and
    liquid assets. Net values of each asset were used. The net value of
    a non-farm asset is calculated by deducting the value of any charge
    or encumbrance over that asset from the gross asset value. The
    thresholds are the same as the allowance assets thresholds
-   Net Farm Assets Test (Tier 2) included the net value of all farm
    assets. Calculate the net value of all farm assets by adding up the
    value of all liabilities related to farm assets and deducting that
    amount from the total value of all farm assets. The value of Tier 2
    assets could not exceed the FHA farm assets value limit

|                                   | of each asset will be reduced by  |

Coding claims lodged before and after 5 April 2017

Where a customer and partner have both lodged a claim for Farm Household
Allowance (FHA) and 1 claim is lodged before 5 April 2017 while the
other is lodged on or after 5 April 2017, the customer and partner are
assessed under the assets test applicable to the date of lodgement of
their claims. This means there will be 2 different assets coding applied
to the record.

Coding examples where a customer and their partner both lodge claims and 1 is lodged before 5 April 2017 with the other lodged after 5 April 2017

Table 5: This table provides examples of how to code assets for a
customer and their partner under the assets test applicable to the date
of lodgement of their FHA claim, where one claim is lodged before 5
April 2017 and the other claim is lodged after 5 April 2017.

Coding for shares - claims lodged before and after 5 April 2017

Where a customer and partner have both lodged a claim for Farm Household
Allowance (FHA) and one claim is lodged before 5 April 2017 while the
other is lodged on or after 5 April 2017, the customer and partner are
assessed under the assets test applicable to the date of lodgement of
their claims. This means there will be 2 different assets coding applied
to the record.

Coding examples for shares where a customer and their partner both lodge claims and 1 is lodged BEFORE 5 April 2017 while the other is lodged AFTER 5 April 2017

Table 6: This table provides examples of how to code shares for a
customer and their partner under the assets test applicable to the date
of lodgement of their (FHA claim, where one claim is lodged before 5
April 2017 and the other claim is lodged after 5 April 2017.
