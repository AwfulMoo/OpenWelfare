This document outlines information to assist in determining when a
customer’s payment is to commence.

Government intent

It is the government intent that customer payments commence on the
correct date, based on their circumstances. Consideration must be given
to the deemed date of claim and any waiting periods a customer may have
to serve. These together determine the start day of payment.

Intent to claim provisions changed on 1 July 2018. From that date
eligible customers will receive payments or concession cards from the
date they actually submit a complete claim with all relevant supporting
documentation, however, deemed date of claim still apply in some cases:

-   intent to claim provisions will continue to apply to customers in
    vulnerable circumstances
-   inappropriate claims
-   incorrect claims

Even though a customer may be assessed as qualified on the day they
lodge their claim for payment, there are other factors that may affect
the commencement date such as the customer may be eligible to have their
claim backdated, and therefore their start date is earlier. Or the
customer may be subjected to a waiting period and therefore may not
receive payment until that period has expired.
