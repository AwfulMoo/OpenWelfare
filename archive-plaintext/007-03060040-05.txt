|                                   | John and Karen have 1 child,      |
|                                   | Norman, who usually attends care  |
|                                   | totalling 50 hours per week. The  |
|                                   | family has an eligible hours      |
|                                   | limit of 50 hours. In a           |
|                                   | particular week Norman is absent  |
|                                   | 2 days without specifying a       |
|                                   | reason, but this is still under   |
|                                   | the limit for allowable absences  |
|                                   | for any reason used in the        |
|                                   | financial year. The service       |
|                                   | provider may still claim CCB for  |
|                                   | 50 hours for the week and pass    |
|                                   | the fee reduction onto the        |
|                                   | customer for 50 hours of care.    |

|                                   | Charles usually attends care      |
|                                   | totalling 30 hours (or 3 days)    |
|                                   | per week. The family has an       |
|                                   | eligible hours limit of 50 hours. |
|                                   | In a particular week Charles is   |
|                                   | absent for all 3 days. Charles    |
|                                   | has already reached the 42 day    |
|                                   | allowable absence day limit in    |
|                                   | the current financial year. The   |
|                                   | family provides a medical         |
|                                   | certificate which explains the    |
|                                   | absence for the week. The service |
|                                   | provider can still claim CCB for  |
|                                   | the 30 hours as the absence is    |
|                                   | approved as additional absence    |
|                                   | days. There is no limit to the    |
|                                   | number of approved additional     |
|                                   | absence days providing suitable   |
|                                   | evidence is provided.             |

|                                   | reached and evidence provided     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Charles usually attends care      |
|                                   | totalling 30 hours (or 3 days)    |
|                                   | per week. The family has an       |
|                                   | eligible hours limit of 50 hours. |
|                                   | In a particular week Charles is   |
|                                   | absent for all 3 days. Charles    |
|                                   | hasn’t reached the 42 day         |
|                                   | allowable absence day limit in    |
|                                   | the current financial year. The   |
|                                   | family provides a medical         |
|                                   | certificate which explains the    |
|                                   | absence for the week. The absence |
|                                   | would be counted as an allowable  |
|                                   | absence as the 42 day limit       |
|                                   | hasn’t yet been reached.          |

|                                   | Monday, 7 August. CCB cannot be   |
|                                   | paid for an absence until Bobby   |
|                                   | actually starts to attend child   |

|                                   | Rachel is Poppy's parent. Rachel  |
|                                   | is moving interstate on 23        |
|                                   | September and on Friday 15        |
|                                   | September gives 2 weeks' notice   |
|                                   | to the child care service that    |
|                                   | Poppy will be ceasing care.       |
|                                   | Rachel is liable to pay for care  |
|                                   | for the entire 2 weeks until 29   |
|                                   | September however Poppy's last    |
|                                   | day of care is 22 September.      |
|                                   | Child Care Benefit (CCB) cannot   |
|                                   | be paid for an absence after 22   |
|                                   | September as there is no          |
|                                   | intention to use care for the     |
|                                   | final week.                       |

|                                   | and service claims exceptional    |
|                                   | circumstances                     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Jack uses 35 of the 42 initial    |
|                                   | absence days as a result of       |
|                                   | illness and the remaining 7       |
|                                   | absence days for public holidays  |
|                                   | and to spend time with            |
|                                   | grandparents who are visiting     |
|                                   | from interstate. CCB is paid for  |
|                                   | these 42 initial absence days and |
|                                   | supporting documentation is not   |
|                                   | required in order to claim these  |
|                                   | absences.                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Once the 42 initial absence days  |
|                                   | are exhausted then any further    |
|                                   | absences for which CCB is paid    |
|                                   | must be taken for an additional   |
|                                   | absence reason.                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | So if Jack were to take a 43rd    |
|                                   | absence day due to illness and    |
|                                   | had a medical certificate to      |
|                                   | support this, then CCB would be   |
|                                   | paid as this falls under the      |
|                                   | additional absence provisions.    |
|                                   | However, if Jack was absent on    |
|                                   | the 43rd day because the          |
|                                   | grandparents were visiting again  |
|                                   | then, ordinarily, CCB would not   |
|                                   | be paid as the initial 42 days    |
|                                   | absence have been used and the    |
|                                   | absence is not taken for one of   |
|                                   | the additional absence reasons.   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | However, because the service      |
|                                   | identifies that Jack has taken    |
|                                   | more than 31 of the initial 42    |
|                                   | absences as a result of illness,  |
|                                   | which is one of the exceptional   |
|                                   | circumstances reasons, the        |
|                                   | service may claim, on behalf of   |
|                                   | the family, this 43rd absence for |
|                                   | a break from care as an absence   |
|                                   | under exceptional circumstances   |
|                                   | and CCB can be paid. To support   |
|                                   | the claim, the family would need  |
|                                   | to provide supporting             |
|                                   | documentation (in the form of a   |
