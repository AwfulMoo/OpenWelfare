This document outlines how to handle calls from Border Force Officers
about prescription drugs being taken out of the country.

General information

Division 4D of Part VII of the National Health Act 1953 (the Act) sets
out restrictions on persons taking medicines that have been subsidised
under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) outside of Australia.

Services Australia works in conjunction with the Department of Home
Affairs to maintain compliance with Division 4D of the Act.

The Customs Prescription Drug Smuggling line was established to assist
Border Force Officers to determine if a PBS subsidy has been paid or is
payable for a medicine/item. For contact details, see Customs
Prescription Drug Smuggling.

The Resources page contains links to contact details for Customs
Prescription Drug Smuggling, PBS Operational Policy and Legacy
Programmes team and to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme website.
