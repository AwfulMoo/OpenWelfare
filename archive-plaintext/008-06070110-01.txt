Purpose of escalation protocols

The agency requires a single professional view of a customer's
functional impairment and work capacity between Assessment Services
(Assessors and Health Professionals Advisory Unit (HPAU) Advisors) and
determining staff such as Disability processing team Service Officers,
Authorised Review Officers (ARO), International Services processing, and
advocates for Program Litigation and Review Branch (PLRB).

The JCA report contains the Assessor's recommendations about a
customer's impairment rating, work capacity, appropriate interventions,
recommended referrals to employment assistance programs, risk of
non-compliance ratings and vulnerability indicator categories.

Assessment Services internal escalation process

The Assessment Services internal escalation process:

-   provides a mechanism to capture and manage issues as required within
    the agency's quality framework including reporting consistent with
    continuously improving business practices
-   provides a mechanism for Assessors to reconsider and adjust work
    capacity, in line with legislative requirements within the Guide to
    the Social Security Act
-   helps in clarifying congruency of medical evidence to assessed
    impairment and work capacity
-   maintains relationships between Assessors, HPAU advisors and
    determining staff to provide timely advice and consideration of a
    customer's functional impairment and work capacity when additional
    information becomes available during the review or appeal stage
-   provides determining staff with avenues to discuss additional
    information provided during review or appeal where reassessment is
    not warranted (for example, evidence of mental health diagnosis by a
    clinical psychologist or psychiatrist)
-   helps International Services staff in determining complex matters
    regarding impairment and work capacity for foreign pension and
    Agreement claim matters

Principles

At the new claim stage:

-   complete medical information is considered without the time and
    expense for customers or the agency needed in Enhanced Internal
    Review (EIR) processes, appeal and repeat claims
-   legal advice from PLBR confirms one agency view is required with
    regards to input into a JCA, meaning assessment services and HPAU
    advisors determine a shared view before submitting a JCA report.

There are escalation protocols for:

-   Disability Support Pension (DSP) new claims process
-   Enhanced Internal Review (EIR) process
-   Authorised Review Officers (ARO)
-   International Services (CIS) Subject Matter Expert (SME) officers
-   Program Litigation and Review Branch (PLBR) advocates
-   Assessment Services Assessors and HPAU advisors
