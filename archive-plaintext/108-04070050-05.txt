|                                   | investment property, or a caravan |
|                                   | Joan owns. Joan cannot gain a     |
|                                   | principal home exemption on the   |
|                                   | home being lived in as well as    |

|                                   | case, Joan wants the proceeds     |
|                                   | from the original home (or        |
|                                   | caravan) to be exempt while using |

|                                   | Therefore, given Joan does not    |

|                                   | currently being lived in to be    |
|                                   | the principal home it will be     |
|                                   | assessed as an asset. The sale    |
