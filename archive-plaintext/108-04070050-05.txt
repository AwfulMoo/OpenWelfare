|                                   | Joan owns. Joan cannot gain a     |
|                                   | principal home exemption on the   |
|                                   | home being lived in as well as    |

|                                   | case, Joan wants the proceeds     |
|                                   | from the original home (or        |
|                                   | caravan) to be exempt while using |

|                                   | Therefore, given Joan does not    |

|                                   | home in October 2017. They        |
|                                   | purchased a block of land in      |
|                                   | January 2018 and were unable, due |
|                                   | to delays with developers, to     |
|                                   | commence building on the land     |
|                                   | until June 2018. The Smiths       |
|                                   | signed a contract in June 2018    |
|                                   | for building completion by        |
|                                   | January 2019. The builder         |
|                                   | experienced delays and the new    |
|                                   | home was only partially complete  |
|                                   | by January 2019. The builder      |

|                                   | received from the sale. An        |

|                                   | exemption would apply to the      |

|                                   | from the sale of the home on a    |
