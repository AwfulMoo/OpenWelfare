This document outlines how to help customers advise of future study
intentions using the phone self service option. Customers can also
provide the correct end date of their current education course.

Access the service

This service is available to full-time students who are fully
authenticated customers. They can use this service by:

-   calling the phone self service line, or
-   selecting a self service option from the Youth and Students line

Notifying their future study intentions via phone self service:

-   is simpler for customers
-   reduces the time spent in an office or phone queue
-   alleviates the need for customers to complete some forms
-   frees up staff for more complex issues, and
-   reduces the need for staff to manually code all study details

For ABSTUDY, the phone self service will also allow students to notify a
change in their study details at any time.

[] A separate procedure applies for customers advising their future
study intentions online.
