This document outlines information on FTB debts resulting from the
reconciliation process.

On this Page:

Reconciliation when lodging a tax return is not required

Where a customer and their current partner are not required to lodge a
tax return, reconciliation will occur using:

-   the latest income estimates for adjusted taxable income on the
    record
-   actual maintenance income received in the relevant income year

Services Australia raise and recover FTB debts identified for these
customers.

Single Customers

The income test has no effect on single customers on income support for
FTB Part A or Part B.

If a single customer were on income support for the whole of the
relevant income year, any reconciliation debt would mainly be because of
maintenance income. This occurs when the actual maintenance income is
higher than the maintenance income estimated during the relevant income
year.

Automatic Recovery process

This is an automatic process using electronic transfer of information
between Services Australia and the ATO.

Recovery from a customer's tax refund occurs if actual income details
are used in the reconciliation process

Recovery from a partner's tax refund occurs if:

-   the partner has given consent on their income tax return and
-   the partner is entitled to a tax refund
-   reconciliation can occur at the time the partner's tax refund is due
    for issue

Recovery of debts when re-reconciliation has occurred and an Interest Charge has been applied

Debt amount decreases

Automatic recalculation of interest charged:

-   is from the original debt due date
-   occurs for any periods where interest has been applied
-   is on the new outstanding balance

Debt amount increases

The interest calculation is based on the previous debt amount for
another 28 days, where the:

-   debt amount increases and
-   debtor is not in an acceptable payment arrangement

The system automatically calculates the Interest Charge on the new
higher debt balance, 29 days from the issue date of the debt notice.

Recovery through the Australian Tax Office (ATO)

Attempt recovery through the ATO. The calculated debt is in the Debt
Management and Information System (DMIS) pending ATO advice of any
recovery action.

If the debt is fully recovered (or partially recovered leaving a balance
of less than $50) by the ATO from the customer's tax refund:

-   the debt is raised in DMIS
-   the amount recovered through the ATO is credited against the debt
-   any balance is automatically waived
-   the customer is advised of their reconciliation result

A debt is raised in DMIS and a Family Assistance Letter sent if the debt
is:

-   fully or partially recovered by the ATO from the partner's tax
    refund
-   partly recovered from the customer's tax refund leaving a balance of
    $50 or more or
-   not recoverable through the ATO

If the customer received maintenance during the relevant financial year:

-   details of the amount received are known in July
-   they will receive maintenance income details once reconciliation
    occurs
-   the result includes adjustments for maintenance and adjusted taxable
    income

Recovery from a person’s tax refund depends on the ATO issuing the
person's Notice of Assessment (NOA) by the time reconciliation is
finalised.

The Resources page contains examples of FTB debts and how they are
recovered.
