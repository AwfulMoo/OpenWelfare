| 1                                 | Independent Resident visa (class  |
|                                   | 126)                              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Maria arrived in Australia in     |
|                                   | February 2020 as a newly arrived  |
|                                   | resident, holding an Independent  |
|                                   | Resident visa (class 126). Aged   |
|                                   | 26 and partnered, Maria had       |
|                                   | arranged a job through her        |
|                                   | partner before leaving Haiti.     |
|                                   | However, the job involved only 2  |
|                                   | days' work per week and the       |
|                                   | employer was unable to offer any  |
|                                   | more. Maria was unable to find    |
|                                   | additional work due to relatively |
|                                   | poor English skills.              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Maria contacted the Services      |
|                                   | Australia to apply for JobSeeker  |
|                                   | Payment (JSP). Maria's claim was  |
|                                   | rejected due to being subject to  |
|                                   | the Newly Arrived Resident's      |
|                                   | Waiting Period (NARWP) and she    |
|                                   | would remain ineligible until she |
|                                   | had served the NARWP in February  |
|                                   | 2024.                             |

| 2                                 | Requesting an explanation or      |
|                                   | applying for a formal review of   |
|                                   | the decision to reject the claim  |
|                                   | for income support payment and    |
|                                   | consideration under the family    |
|                                   | member of a refugee exemption     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Several weeks later on the advice |
|                                   | of a friend, Maria requested an   |
|                                   | explanation of the decision,      |
|                                   | which was referred to a Subject   |
|                                   | Matter Expert (SME). Whilst       |
|                                   | discussing the decision, it was   |
|                                   | revealed that Maria and her       |
|                                   | partner were physically separated |
|                                   | during a period of armed conflict |
|                                   | in their home country. Maria's    |
|                                   | partner was able to gain asylum   |
|                                   | in Australia in 2013, before      |
|                                   | gaining Australian citizenship in |
|                                   | 2018. Following extensive         |
|                                   | searches through the UNHCR and    |
|                                   | Red Cross, Maria was located,     |
|                                   | applied for and granted a visa to |
|                                   | come and join her partner in      |
|                                   | Australia.                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Maria remained a family member of |
|                                   | her partner throughout the period |
|                                   | of forced separation. Her         |
|                                   | partner's documents maintained    |
|                                   | his hope and belief that Maria    |
|                                   | would be found alive and would    |
|                                   | eventually join him in his        |
|                                   | adopted country.                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Documents were provided to        |
|                                   | support Maria's claim, and on the |
|                                   | basis of that evidence, it was    |
|                                   | determined that Maria was exempt  |
|                                   | from having to satisfy the NARWP. |
|                                   | Specifically, Maria was exempted  |
|                                   | from the NARWP due to being a     |
|                                   | family member of a (former)       |
|                                   | refugee at the time that person   |
|                                   | arrived in Australia and at the   |
|                                   | date of claim.                    |
