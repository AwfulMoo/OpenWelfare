|                                   | NBS and NBU will be paid when     |

|                                   | choice anytime within the NBS     |
|                                   | period, any remaining NBS would   |
|                                   | be paid with the FTB Part A       |
|                                   | instalments but the NBU would be  |
|                                   | paid at reconciliation.           |

|                                   | received the NBU payment, the     |
|                                   | remaining NBS (91 - 28 = 63 days) |
|                                   | will be paid when reconciliation  |
|                                   | occurs at the end of the          |
|                                   | financial year.                   |

|                                   | Maria is eligible for FTB Part A  |
|                                   | and NBS for 13 weeks (91 days)    |
|                                   | from the child's date of birth.   |
|                                   | Maria has chosen to receive nil   |
|                                   | rate FTB Part A and will not      |
|                                   | receive NBS fortnightly or the    |
|                                   | NBU payment. Four months later    |
|                                   | Maria wants to revoke the payment |
|                                   | choice because the baby requires  |
|                                   | medical treatment. After careful  |
|                                   | consideration, it is determined   |
|                                   | that Maria would experience       |
|                                   | considerable financial hardship   |
|                                   | if arrears were not paid, to meet |
|                                   | the medical expenses. Due to      |
|                                   | revoking the choice, Maria is     |
|                                   | paid FTB Part A arrears from the  |
|                                   | child's date of birth. As this is |
|                                   | also the first day of eligibility |
|                                   | for NBS, the full 91 days of NBS  |
|                                   | and NBU would be included in the  |
|                                   | arrears payment.                  |
