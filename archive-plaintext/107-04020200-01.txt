This document outlines the raising of debts for one off payments to
older Australians.

One-off bonus payment

In 2006/7 and 2008 seniors who were in receipt of Utilities Allowance or
Seniors Concession Allowance received a one-off bonus payment.

Recovering a one-off payment

These payments are recoverable if:

-   there was no entitlement to the payment, or
-   the customer provided false or misleading information to obtain the
    payment

A debt shell will generate for these one-off payments. Add the amount to
an existing debt or create a manual debt shell.

Normal review procedures apply.

Subsection 1223ABAA(5) of the Social Security Act (SSA) applies to
one-off bonus payment debts. See the References page for a link.
