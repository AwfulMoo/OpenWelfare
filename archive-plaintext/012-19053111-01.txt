PDS allows users to view the transactions processed on a particular LSPN
record including:

-   identification (P number) and location (source office code) of the
    person who processed the transaction
-   the date and time of processing
-   the type of transactions that were effected, and
-   the field that was amended (Organisation, Physical Address,
    Associates, Contacts, Mobile Proprietor, Equipment, Accreditation
    and Comments)

If searching for a particular transaction type (for example, changes to
contact details) users can filter by transaction type and processing
date range to reduce the number of search results returned.

Transaction types include:

-   UPD - Update - Existing information was updated
-   INS – Insert - New information was inserted

Source Office codes indicate where the transaction was processed.

For examples of source office codes see the Resources tab.

LSPN and Health Professional Online Services (HPOS)

LSPN practices can view their LSPN details online through HPOS. There
are 2 types of HPOS access which determine what functions the user can
perform. The 2 user roles are:

Staff, who are able to perform the following functions:

-   View their LSPN details
-   View listed equipment and generate an Equipment list
-   View MRI providers listed and generate an MRI provider list

Administrator, who have additional functions to the staff role which
includes:

-   Updating postal address
-   Updating contact details
-   Changing or nominating an authorised representative, and
-   Granting user access to other PRODA account holders
-   Receiving automated electronic correspondence
-   Renewing an LSPN electronically

Once the authorised representative has been linked by the agency as an
administrator to the LSPN they will be able to manage other users’
access to the LSPN. It is up to the authorised representative to make
sure:

-   that access is not inappropriately provided to other users, and
-   removed when staff cease employment

If at least one person is linked to an LSPN with administrator access,
the following letters are sent electronically instead of via the post:

-   annual reminder
-   notification of suspension
-   notification of cancellation

An electronic communication opt out is available for practices that
prefer to receive notifications via post. This opt out applies to all
communications for the LSPN.

Accessing an LSPN through HPOS

To access an LSPN through HPOS, the LSPN authorised representative will
first need to register for Provider Digital Access (PRODA)

PRODA is an online authentication system used to access government
online services. Once a PRODA account is established, the user is issued
a unique RA Number and access to the Health Professionals Online Service
(HPOS)

LSPN staff must request a link to their LSPN to be able to access it in
HPOS

Authorised representatives can do this by:

-   providing their PRODA RA number in the authorised representative
    section of the Application to register or amend a diagnostic imaging
    or radiation oncology practice form (HW061), or
-   contacting the Provider Registration line and providing their RA
    number

Proprietors can be provided HPOS access by:

-   providing their PRODA RA number in the authorised representative
    section of the HW061 form (if also nominating to be an authorised
    representative)
-   contacting the Provider Registration line, and providing their RA
    number, or
-   being nominated by a user with administrator access via HPOS

LSPN staff who are not an authorised representative can be provided
staff access by being nominated:

-   by an authorised representative who calls the Provider Registration
    line and provides their RA number, or
-   by a user with administrator access via HPOS

Once the agency links the LSPN to the persons HPOS account, they can see
their LSPN on the My Organisation tile

It is not possible to use PKI certificates to link an administrator to
an LSPN

If there are issues with logging into HPOS the applicant can contact the
e-business line for support
