This document outlines the procedures to be followed when child support
debts are recovered by WA Ex-nuptial payees in court.

On this Page:

Private court action

Legislative amendments, effective from 1 January 2007 (1 November 2007
for WA Ex-nuptial cases), allow payees to initiate private court action
to enforce the registered child support debt without opting their cases
out of collection by Child Support.

Legislative amendments that allow payers to initiate private court
action to enforce the collection of overpayments of child support
effective from 1 July 2018

do not pertain to WA Ex-nuptial cases at this time.

If a payee wishes to pursue their own enforcement action, or is not
satisfied with the agency's collection actions, they can apply directly
to a court under section 113A of the Child Support (Registration and
Collection) Act 1988 to commence court enforcement proceedings in
relation to the liability owed by the payer. See Child Support Guide
5.4.7: Payee's right to enforce debt via court proceedings for further
information.

Note: enquiries about payee enforcement from legal representatives or
the courts should be referred to the Child Support Solicitors line. The
Resources page contains a link to the Child Support information for
legal professionals webpage for the Child Support Solicitors line.
