The Student Financial Supplement Scheme (SFSS) closed from 1 January
2004. Since December 2005 all outstanding Financial Supplement Loans
(FSL) have been transferred to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) for
recovery.

This page contains a link to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO)
website and some general information on how the ATO handles Financial
Supplement Loan (FSL) debts. It also contains a link to information on
repayment thresholds and rates on the ATO web site. Some links on this
