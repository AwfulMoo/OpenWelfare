For staff in Compliance and Debt Operations only.

This document outlines how the debt staff triage Manual Follow-up (MFU)
tax activities. The MFU generates because of a negative amount on the
payment summary.

Action MFU tax activities

The MFU tax activity:

flags that the payment summary is prevented from being issued

must be actioned to

-   correct the negative amount, and
-   issue a payment summary to the customer

MFU tax activities are allocated primarily to Compliance and Debt
Operations (CDO) staff for assessment and corrective action. See General
information on Manual Follow-up (MFU) tax activities.

Not all MFU tax activities are the responsibility of CDO.

CDO debt staff will:

-   investigate errors
-   correct the debt component amounts in the customer's record
-   determine when an MFU tax activity needs to be reassigned to a non
    CDO team for corrective action
-   send a TAXMFU Referral Fast Note with action required

MFU tax activities that do not require access to specialist 'Change'
functionality on the TXGS screen will be reallocated.
