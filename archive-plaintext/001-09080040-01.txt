This document outlines how participants in Work for the Dole, Community
Development Program (CDP) Structured Activities, and National Work
Experience Programme (NWEP) are entitled to the Approved Program of Work
Supplement (APWS) of $20.80 per fortnight to assist with the costs of
participating in their activity.

Eligibility to APWS

This supplement is:

-   taxable if the job seeker's primary income support payment is
    taxable, and will be included as part of the job seeker's taxable
    income
-   rebatable if the job seeker's primary income support payment is
    rebatable (that is, if the job seeker is eligible for a rebate
    through the taxation system, for example, a dependent rebate, the
    supplement can be included in that rebate)
-   exempt from the income test (it will be payable even if all other
    components have been precluded because of affecting income), and
-   not paid on a pro rata basis. The full amount of $20.80 is paid as
    long as the job seeker participated in the activity for at least one
    day in the pay period. A change in pay day code, which may be
    considered to ease lodgement of fortnightly forms, will not result
    in multiple payments

Payment of APWS

The APWS is paid to job seekers who are receiving the following
payments:

-   JobSeeker Payment (JSP)
-   Special Benefit (Nominated Visa Holders)
-   Youth Allowance (YA)
-   Parenting Payment (single and partnered)
-   Disability Support Pension (DSP)

Ineligibility to APWS

This supplement is not paid when:

-   a job seeker was removed from the activity during the period for an
    action which results in a failure, or
-   a job seeker has an exemption from mutual obligation requirements
    and they do not continue to voluntarily participate during the
    exemption period at any stage during the entitlement period. A job
    seeker can voluntarily participate in the activity during the period
    of the exemption and still be paid the Supplement

Note: job seekers participating with an Intensive Support - Transition
to Work provider may be exited during an exemption period and due to
system limitations, are not able to volunteer back in. This means
payment of APWS will cease.
