This document outlines how to perform a security check for individual or
provider roles in the My Health Record system.

Security check information

Information provided by the organisation’s representative must match the
details recorded on the Provider Participation Register (PPR).

Tier 2 Service Officers supporting the Healthcare Identifiers (HI)
Service and My Health Record system are usually the same staff.

Note: where a healthcare provider is reporting a serious or system
incident, the call must be escalated to Tier 3 regardless of whether or
not the provider or their representative has passed the security check.

The Resources page contains contact details for Healthcare Identifiers
(HI) service and My Health Record, and a link to a list of My Health
glossary terms.
