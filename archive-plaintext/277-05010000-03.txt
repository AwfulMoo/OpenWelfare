|                                   | the assessment. A CSP can only    |
|                                   | have a start date in the period   |
|                                   | between the assessment            |
|                                   | commencement date and the section |

|                                   | after 15 months. Cuba will create |
|                                   | the first CSP, and a later CSP if |
|                                   | the date the assessment starts is |
|                                   | more than 15 months before the    |

|                                   | would have created a new CSP if   |
|                                   | the assessment had been active,   |
|                                   | it is not possible to             |

|                                   |     declaration is processed      |
|                                   |     immediately determine if a    |
|                                   |     new prospective CSP should be |
|                                   |     created so that the most      |
|                                   |     recent incomes and basic      |
|                                   |     values are used. A new CSP    |
|                                   |     may be required if an event   |
|                                   |     occurred, such as receiving a |
|                                   |     customer’s tax assessment,    |
|                                   |     that would have triggered a   |
|                                   |     new CSP had the case been     |
|                                   |     active. The new CSP will have |
|                                   |     a future start date and       |
|                                   |     cannot be backdated           |

|                                   |     declaration is processed on   |
|                                   |     18 October 2016. The section  |
|                                   |     106A declaration starts the   |
|                                   |     assessment from 13            |
|                                   |     September 2014. The first CSP |
|                                   |     runs from 13 September 2014 - |
|                                   |     12 December 2015 using        |
|                                   |     incomes from the 2013/14      |
|                                   |     financial year. When this CSP |
|                                   |     expires, Cuba generates a CSP |
|                                   |     from 13 December 2015 to 12   |
|                                   |     March 2017 using incomes from |
|                                   |     the 2014/15 financial year.   |
|                                   |     In August 2016 the 2015/16    |
|                                   |     tax assessment for both       |
|                                   |     parties issued. This event    |
|                                   |     would have created a new CSP  |
|                                   |     if the case was active. On 18 |
|                                   |     October the Service Officer   |
|                                   |     processing the s106A          |
