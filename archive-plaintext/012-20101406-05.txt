| 4                                 | Question: Can the prescriber      |
|                                   | apply for an authority on the     |
|                                   | existing form (PB294) for opioid  |
|                                   | authorities for items on the      |
|                                   | palliative care schedule?         |

|                                   | Note: ‘palliative care’ is still  |
|                                   | part of the restriction for some  |
|                                   | general schedule opioid items,    |
|                                   | and therefore it is still part of |
|                                   | the existing form. SOs should not |
|                                   | reject applications simply        |
|                                   | because this option has been      |
|                                   | ticked, as it is may still a      |
|                                   | valid application. If the         |
|                                   | prescriber has provided all       |
|                                   | relevant information to process   |
|                                   | this application, SOs should      |
|                                   | approve this under a general      |
|                                   | schedule item.                    |

|                                   | when the prescriber submits the   |

|                                   | Answer: Service officers must     |
|                                   | approve items based on which form |
|                                   | the prescriber submits. The onus  |
|                                   | is on the prescriber to make the  |
|                                   | decision about which criteria     |
|                                   | their patient meets, and to use   |

|                                   | Answer: If the restrictions do    |
|                                   | not limit the maximum quantity, a |
|                                   | quantity of up to 1 month         |
|                                   | treatment can be approved, with   |

|                                   | months' supply. Some requests may |
|                                   | reject on OPA due to quantity     |
|                                   | and/or repeat (multiplier)        |

|                                   | e.g. Norspan® and fentanyl. These |
|                                   | patches are not applied daily,    |
|                                   | however, release the drug daily   |
|                                   | and continuously. If the          |
|                                   | prescriber did not state this or  |
|                                   | answered "no" to the question -   |

| 1                                 | Question: When processing a phone |
|                                   | request for opioids, the          |
|                                   | prescriber has stated it is less  |
|                                   | than 12 months. However, if it is |
|                                   | obvious that it is greater than   |
|                                   | 12 months, what do Services       |
|                                   | Officers do?                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: Service Officers should   |
|                                   | not check patient history and     |
|                                   | must accept the information the   |
|                                   | prescriber has provided.          |

| 2                                 | Question: If a prescriber does    |
|                                   | not know the length of opioid     |
|                                   | treatment for their patient, can  |
|                                   | a Service Officer check and       |
|                                   | provide the information?          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: No, the prescriber must   |
|                                   | state the length of opioid        |
|                                   | treatment. PBS restrictions refer |
|                                   | to the use of both PBS and        |
|                                   | non-PBS opioids and Services      |
|                                   | Australia does not have           |
|                                   | visibility of non PBS opioid      |
|                                   | treatment. The prescriber needs   |
|                                   | to determine this information     |
|                                   | from the patient or the patient's |
|                                   | previous prescriber.              |

| 3                                 | Question: If a patient has never  |
|                                   | had an authority for opioid       |
|                                   | treatment, is their treatment     |
|                                   | duration defined as “less than 12 |
|                                   | months"?                          |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | need to take into account the     |
|                                   | total duration of opioid          |
|                                   | treatment. This may include       |
|                                   | non-PBS treatment, PBS treatment  |
|                                   | with listed amounts and PBS       |
|                                   | treatment supplied under an       |
|                                   | authority for increased           |
|                                   | quantities and repeats. Medicines |
|                                   | such as tramadol and              |
|                                   | paracetamol+codeine combinations  |
|                                   | are considered opioid treatment   |
|                                   | and must be considered by the     |
|                                   | prescriber.                       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 4                                 | Question: If a prescriber states  |
|                                   | a patient is on long term         |
|                                   | methadone, is their opioid        |
|                                   | treatment duration defined as     |
|                                   | more than 12 months?              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: Methadone is not always   |
|                                   | prescribed to treat pain. If a    |
|                                   | patient is using methadone to     |
|                                   | treat pain, the period of         |
|                                   | treatment for pain management is  |
|                                   | all that should be taken into     |
|                                   | consideration when looking at the |
|                                   | patient’s duration of opioid      |
|                                   | treatment.                        |
