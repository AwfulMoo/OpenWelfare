Risks to a customer's privacy have been identified. See Separating
Safely - protecting personal details to make sure the customer's
personal details are safe before progressing.

Effective 16 December 2014, decisions cannot be made on Change of
Assessment (COA) applications where the COA application was made after
the case has ended.

This is a Family and Domestic Violence Interaction Point. If the
customer is with another person, on speaker phone, or already identified
with family and domestic violence concerns, continue with the current
business conversation. Otherwise, go to the Family and domestic violence
procedure to conduct the risk identification and referral process.

This document outlines Change of Assessment in special circumstances
applications in Child Support.

Change of Assessment

Customers can apply to have their assessment changed if their special
circumstances are not adequately reflected in their child support
assessment. A customer who applies for a Change of Assessment (COA) must
apply under 1 (or more) of the 10 reasons provided for by the Child
Support (Assessment) Act 1989, see the Child Support Guide 2.6.2: What
are the reasons for a change of assessment? Customers must lodge their
application on an approved COA application form, see Application to
Change your Assessment – Special Circumstances form (CS1970). Customers
can lodge their signed COA application by mail, fax or as a signed
electronic copy.

Decision Makers (DM) consider COA applications and decide if a change
should be made to the assessment. The decision making process involves
considering all circumstances of the case and satisfying 3 tests:

-   1 or more reasons have been established
-   it is fair to the children and both parents to change the assessment
    on the grounds of the established reason(s), and
-   it is fair to the community to change the assessment

If any 1 of these tests is not met, the DM cannot make a change to the
assessment.

This procedural instruction provides guidance in managing COA
applications including reviewing the application, the initial
discussions, finalising the COA application and post decision contact.

Note: the customer who makes the application is referred to as the
applicant and the person responding is referred to as the respondent.
