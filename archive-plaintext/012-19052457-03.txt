Assess MRI provider eligibility in Provider Directory System (PDS)

Table 1: This table describes how to check a provider’s details
(location and speciality codes) in PDS prior to linking the MRI provider
to an LSPN. This will enable MRI services to be provided at the same
location as the eligible MRI. Service Officers will need to use this
process to assess whether the provider can be added to the LSPN.

Add provider on LSPN Register in PDS

Table 2: This table describes how to link a provider on the LSPN
Register to the provider’s location record in PDS. This link will lock
the address details in PDS so that changes cannot be made. See Unlink
provider on LSPN register from PDS record table for a workaround.

Only link the provider once you have assessed MRI provider eligibility
as per the MRI provider eligibility in Provider Directory System (PDS)
table.

Unlink provider on LSPN Register from PDS Provider location to enable address update

If the provider location and LSPN location are an exact address match,
PDS will lock the provider location address so that it cannot be
amended. If the LSPN address is updated, the system will recognise that
the provider location address is no longer an exact match and will
unlock the address for amendment.

Table 5: This table describes how to unlink a provider in the LSPN
Register to the provider’s location record in PDS. This applies if the
provider location has been linked and is locked and needs to be updated.
This is a workaround that can be applied to PDS location records that
have been locked due to the MRI provider link to the LSPN register. To
unlink the records an end date is required on the LSPN provider record
(with yesterday’s date).
