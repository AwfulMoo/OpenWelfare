|                                   | a member of a couple for five     |
|                                   | months.                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Betty is applying for Youth       |
|                                   | Allowance (YA).                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Betty has worked full-time for    |
|                                   | the past 3 years since leaving    |
|                                   | school.                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Ron is still employed full-time.  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | In this case, Betty is already    |
|                                   | independent from her parents as   |
|                                   | she meets the workforce criteria. |
|                                   | Therefore, she is not subject to  |
|                                   | the Parental Means Tests. Betty's |
|                                   | rate of YA is, however, subject   |
|                                   | to the partner Income and Assets  |
|                                   | Tests. This is because the member |
|                                   | of a YA couple provisions relate  |
|                                   | to independence and the           |
|                                   | application of the Parental Means |
|                                   | Tests, and not to the application |
|                                   | of the Partner Income Test.       |

|                                   | criteria, Griselda's income will  |
|                                   | not affect his YA. The income     |
|                                   | will still be recorded but it     |
|                                   | will not change his rate of       |
