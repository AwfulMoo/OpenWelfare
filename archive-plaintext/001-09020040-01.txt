This document explains the mutual obligation requirements for Youth
Allowance (YA) job seekers under 22 years of age who have not completed
Year 12 or an equivalent level of education (Certificate III or higher)
qualification.

Definition of Early School Leaver (ESL)

Youth Allowance (YA) job seekers are identified as Early School Leavers
(ESL) if they:

-   are under 22 years of age, and
-   have not completed Year 12 or an equivalent level of education
    (Certificate III or higher)

Identifying ESLs

All YA job seeker claims will require verification action and coding on
the NES screen to specify if:

-   the job seeker has completed Year 12 or an equivalent level of
    education (Certificate III or higher) qualification, and
-   evidence of qualification is provided

The verification can only be actioned by a Services Australia Service
Officer.

If a customer transfers from YA (full-time student) to YA (job seeker)
and has not completed Year 12 or an equivalent level of education
(Certificate III or higher) qualification, they will be subject to the
ESL requirements from their date of transfer.

Job seekers who completed a Certificate II in 2015 or earlier

YA students will not be identified as an ESL if they:

-   completed a Certificate II in 2015 or earlier, and
-   are current and continue on payment when they transfer to YA job
    seeker

Job seekers will no longer be removed from the ESL cohort if:

-   there has been a break in payment for 13 weeks or more, and
-   they previously had a Certificate II keyed as Year 12 or an
    equivalent level of education (Certificate III or higher)
    qualification

Mutual obligation requirements for ESLs

ESLs must undertake approved requirements and/or job search or a
combination of these, to meet their mutual obligation requirements until
they turn 22 years of age, or attain Year 12 or an equivalent level of
education (Certificate III or higher) qualification. For provider
managed job seekers, this includes:

full-time education or training

a combination of part-time education or training and part-time work for
a total of 25 hours per week (15 hours for Principal Carer Parents and
those with a Partial Capacity to Work (PCW) of 15 to 29 hours per week)

other approved requirements for 25 hours per week (15 hours for
Principal Carer Parents and those with a PCW of 15 to 29 hours per week)

in Community Development Program (CDP) regions requirements such as
study and training are voluntary. For all CDP job seekers, including
ESLs:

-   CDP providers consider each job seeker's assessed capacity and
    individual circumstances when negotiating Job Plans
-   minimum hourly requirements do not apply, and
-   there are no specific requirements for CDP job seekers based on
    their age group or participation category

The Employment Services Provider is responsible for:

-   discussing mutual obligation requirements with the job seeker, and
-   negotiating an appropriate Job Plan

Requirements that result in an ESL being managed by Centrelink

ESLs who have one of the following approved requirements will be managed
by Centrelink (the agency):

-   Quarterly Participation Interview (QTI) (job seekers with Partial
    Capacity to Work (PCW) or Temporary Reduced Work Capacity (TRWC) of
    0-14 hours per week)
-   Job seekers with PCW or TRWC of 15-29 hours per week undertaking
    paid work, study or self-employment, or a combination of the 3, for
    at least 15 hours per week
-   Principal carers undertaking paid work, study or self-employment, or
    a combination of the 3, for at least 15 hours per week
-   Job seekers participating in Self-Employment Assistance whose
    Self-Employment allowance has ceased 39 weeks after commencing the
    programme
-   Job seekers participating in Youth Activities

Note: the Action Item 'Customer is Centrelink managed and has no current
Job Plan. Negotiate Job Plan with customer', may appear for ESL job
seekers who:

-   are participating full time in AMEP, and
-   are yet to be referred to an Employment Services Provider

These job seekers are not Centrelink managed and must be referred to a
Provider. Once referred, they will display as Provider managed.

Referrals to Employment Service Providers

ESLs are eligible for referral to either:

-   Workforce Australia - Transition to Work (TtW)
-   Disability Employment Services (DES), or
-   the Community Development Program (CDP) for job seekers who live in
    a Department of Employment and Workplace Relations designated remote
    area

Note: except for eligible job seekers in CDP regions, ESLs identified as
eligible must be referred to Workforce Australia - Transition to Work
(TtW) (where available).

Verification of Year 12 or an equivalent level of education (Certificate III or higher) qualification

Youth Allowance job seekers who advise that they have completed Year 12
or an equivalent level of education (Certificate III or higher)
qualification:

-   are required to provide evidence of their qualification to Services
    Australia
-   who do not provide evidence of their qualification, will be
    considered an ESL

Note: ensure qualifications are recorded correctly. Check if:

-   the job seeker has provided verification of completing Year 12 or an
    equivalent level of education (Certificate III or higher)
    qualification, and
-   the details are confirmed via the Customer Study Details (EDC)
    screen in Process Direct or the Education Course History (EDC)
    screen in Customer First

If so, ensure the appropriate code has been used to update the Newstart
Education Status (NES) screen, for example, OTH (other evidence as
appropriate) on the:

-   Verification Document Code field in Process Direct, or
-   Y12/Equiv Verified field in Customer First

Updating education level on the Job Seeker Snapshot

When the ESLs education qualification level has been updated via the Job
Seeker Snapshot to state that they have now completed Year 12 or an
equivalent level of education (Certificate III or higher) qualification,
the Employment Services Provider will notify the agency. A Manual
Follow-up (MFU) activity will be generated on the job seeker's record to
prompt a Service Officer to follow-up and obtain proof of the
qualification from the ESL in order for this to be keyed on the NES
screen.

Reminders to provide verification of Year 12 or an equivalent level of education (Certificate III or higher) qualification

A Short Message Service (SMS) and/or e-mail reminder will be sent to
ESLs advising them to provide their educational qualifications to the
agency for verification as soon as possible. A reminder will also be
sent if the ESL uses the self-service facilities.

Proof of qualification provided to Employment Services Provider

ESLs can provide original documentation that proves Year 12 or an
equivalent level of education (Certificate III or higher) qualification
to their provider. The provider will sight the original documentation
and fax a copy to the National Business Gateway (NBG). Upon receipt of
the fax, NBG staff will take appropriate action including updating the
NES screen.

The latest information relating to the Year 12 or an equivalent level of
education (Certificate III or higher) qualification verification on the
NES screen, will be automatically transmitted to the Employment Services
System.

Verification of Year 12 or an equivalent level of education (Certificate III or higher) qualification for new claims

After submitting a claim:

job seekers have 28 days to provide verification that they have
completed Year 12 or an equivalent level of education (Certificate III
or higher) qualification

if the job seeker has not provided verification by the end of the 28 day
period:

-   a Manual Follow-up (MFU) activity will be displayed on the job
    seeker's record on the Activity List (AL) screen, and
-   an Action Item will be displayed within the Participation Summary
    workflow in Process Direct

Both the MFU and Action Item are reminders to Service Officers to take
follow-up actions regarding the verification of the job seeker's
qualification. If verification is not provided at the next contact
(generally when the job seeker lodges their next Reporting Statement),
the Service Officer must:

-   tell the job seeker they will be identified as an ESL, and
-   update the Job Seeker Snapshot and NES screen

The Employment Services Provider will:

-   discuss mutual obligation requirements with the job seeker, and
-   negotiate a Job Plan with appropriate requirements

Referral to Employment Services Provider

Some YA job seekers may be exempt from RapidConnect at the initial claim
stage due to potential eligibility for Skills for Education and
Employment (SEE) or Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP). However, these
job seekers are still required to be referred immediately to an
Employment Services Provider with a note in the Online Diary that they
would benefit from participating in the relevant programme.

ESLs who are under 18 years of age

A study exemption must be keyed on the NES screen (system requirement)
to qualify for YA for all job seekers under 18 years of age:

-   who have not completed Year 12 or an equivalent level of education
    (Certificate III or higher)
-   even when they are undertaking approved requirements to satisfy
    mutual obligation requirements

YA will not be cancelled when the exemption expires. The exemption does
not have to be recorded again while the job seeker remains on payment.

The Resources page contains a list of study exemptions that can be
granted for YA job seekers under 18 years of age who have not completed
Year 12 or an equivalent level of education (Certificate III or higher)
qualification, as well as links to the Services Australia website.
