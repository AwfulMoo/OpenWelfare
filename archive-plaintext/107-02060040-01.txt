This document outlines the DMIS and how it interfaces with other
systems. DMIS is a national database used to record, raise and recover
debts.

System interface

DMIS interfaces with other systems. All of these involve the transfer of
data, and some trigger the creation of DMIS records.

These other systems include:

-   Assurance of Support (AoS)
-   Prosecutions
-   Batch Laser Advices (BLA) and Online Advices (OLA)
-   Integrated Review System (IRS), and
-   various benefit, allowance and pension systems
-   Process Direct

Access to DMIS is via the interface between DMIS and the ICT Security
Portal (ISP).
