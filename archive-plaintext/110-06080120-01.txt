This document outlines information about attributing an Other Review
Outcome (ORO) to a Service Update or Review in the Integrated Review
System (IRS).

Impact of OROs

Some reviews allow for recording of an ORO as part of a Service Update
or review. These outcomes can:

-   identify other updates to the customer's record which are not
    payment related; or
-   record a different savings methodology than the standard result
    calculation process which IRS applies to Review Results

Reviews which use OROs

Reviews which utilise OROs are:

-   'CRT' - Centrelink Academic Reassessment Transformation (CART)
    reviews to track changes to the customer's record actioned as part
    of the review such as changes between student and job seeker status.
-   'IDF' and 'IDM' - ID Fraud and Internal Data Matching reviews to
    capture debt outcomes and updates to a customer's record.
-   Department of Home Affairs Host Reviews to capture preventative
    savings triggered by automatic updates from the Department of Home
    Affairs system. Note: OROs for the Department of Home Affairs host
    reviews are automatically updated and cannot be manually added or
    amended in IRS.
-   'MCR' - Member of a couple reviews which captures the customer's
    relationship status as part of the review.

The Resources page contains a table of ORO codes.
