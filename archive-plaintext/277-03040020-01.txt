This document outlines how to investigate a change in care.

Customers experiencing vulnerability

Customers experiencing vulnerability may require additional support or
assistance to access payments and services

Anyone can be at risk of vulnerability. It is not linked to a specific
customer group or characteristic. Everyone experiences vulnerability
differently.

The Resources page in Identifying customer vulnerability and risk issues
contains referrals and support services to assist these customers.
