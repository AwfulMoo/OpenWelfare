|                                   | Payment will cease on 30 May. The |

|                                   | hospitalised. The doctor provided |
|                                   | a letter advising they expect him |
|                                   | to be released in 2 months and to |
|                                   | be able to travel 3 weeks later.  |
|                                   | A portability extension would be  |
|                                   | granted for 2 months and 3 weeks. |

|                                   | granted in this situation with    |

|                                   | are closed. The customer and      |
|                                   | child are unable to leave the     |
|                                   | country. A portability extension  |
|                                   | could be granted for a maximum of |
|                                   | 3 months. A review should be      |
|                                   | recorded to check if the          |
|                                   | situation has changed and the     |
|                                   | customer and child are able to    |
|                                   | return to Australia. If not, a    |
|                                   | further extension could be        |
|                                   | granted. Verification would not   |
|                                   | normally be required as the       |
|                                   | situation would generally be      |
|                                   | known through media channels.     |
|                                   | Media information could include   |
|                                   | which areas of the country were   |
|                                   | affected and which airport/s      |
|                                   | is/are closed. Websites that      |
|                                   | track flights could add           |

|                                   | Australia. After 5 weeks, the     |
|                                   | child is involved in an accident  |
|                                   | and is unable to return to        |
|                                   | Australia for 4 weeks. The        |
|                                   | customer applies for a            |
|                                   | portability extension for FTB to  |
|                                   | enable the child to recover       |
|                                   | sufficiently to return to         |
|                                   | Australia. A portability          |
|                                   | extension is granted under Family |
|                                   | Assistance Law and the customer's |
|                                   | normal rate of FTB continues      |
|                                   | until the end of the extension    |
|                                   | period.                           |

|                                   | not payable as the customer is    |

|                                   | Payment Partnered (PPP), which is |

|                                   | temporary absences. On 15         |

|                                   | shortly after PPP has stopped,    |
|                                   | the customer learns that their    |
|                                   | parent has unexpectedly died and  |
|                                   | they apply for a portability      |
|                                   | extension. The portability        |
|                                   | extension would not be granted as |
|                                   | the event occurred after payments |
|                                   | stopped. However, a portability   |
|                                   | extension may be granted should   |
|                                   | they be able to provide evidence  |
|                                   | their parent became seriously ill |
|                                   | whilst the customer was overseas  |
|                                   | and before the end of the         |
|                                   | portability period. In this case, |
|                                   | the portability extension may be  |
|                                   | granted even though the event     |
|                                   | (the parent's death) occurred     |
|                                   | after the end of the portability  |
|                                   | period.                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Example 3                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | An FTB customer went overseas on  |
|                                   | 3 January to look after their ill |
|                                   | mother. The mother is still       |
|                                   | unwell after 6 weeks absence from |
|                                   | Australia and the customer        |
|                                   | applies for an extension to their |
|                                   | portability to continue caring    |
|                                   | for their mother. A portability   |
|                                   | extension would not be granted as |
|                                   | the event occurred prior to the   |
|                                   | customer's departure from         |
|                                   | Australia. If however, the        |
|                                   | mother's health deteriorated      |
|                                   | causing them to be hospitalised   |
|                                   | prior to the customer's payment   |
|                                   | ceasing to be portable, a         |
|                                   | portability extension could be    |
|                                   | considered.                       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Example 4                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A PPS customer's only dependent   |
|                                   | child has travelled overseas on   |
|                                   | 10 December to be with relatives  |
|                                   | while the PPS customer remains in |
|                                   | Australia. After 6 weeks, the     |
|                                   | child becomes ill and is unable   |
|                                   | to return to Australia, so the    |
|                                   | customer applies for a            |
|                                   | portability extension. In this    |
|                                   | case, a portability extension     |
|                                   | cannot be granted, because under  |
|                                   | Social Security Law the customer  |
|                                   | ceases to be the principal carer  |
|                                   | of the child after 6 weeks.       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Example 5                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A Disability Support Pensioner    |
|                                   | (DSP) and their non-family carer  |
|                                   | (CP) travelled overseas. The DSP  |
|                                   | customer had 28 days general      |
|                                   | portability available. In the 4th |
|                                   | week of their trip, the DSP       |
|                                   | customer had a fall and was       |
|                                   | hospitalised with a broken leg    |
|                                   | and concussion. Suitable evidence |
|                                   | was provided and the DSP customer |
|                                   | was granted a portability         |
|                                   | extension for 2 months pending    |
|                                   | review of the medical condition.  |
|                                   | The CP customer still had 2 weeks |
|                                   | general portability remaining but |
|                                   | cannot be granted an extension,   |
|                                   | as they are not a family member   |
|                                   | of the DSP customer. The care     |
|                                   | relationship is not enough to     |
|                                   | allow an extension and is not     |
|                                   | covered in the legislation.       |

| 3                                 | Example of a situation where      |
|                                   | portability would be increased    |
|                                   | before considering a              |
|                                   | discretionary portability         |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A JobSeeker Payment (JSP)         |
|                                   | customer was granted 4 weeks      |
|                                   | payment while outside Australia   |
|                                   | due to an acute family crisis as  |
|                                   | the customer's parent was         |
|                                   | seriously ill. The customer       |
|                                   | contacted 3 weeks after departure |
|                                   | for a portability extension as    |
|                                   | the parent has just passed away.  |
|                                   | A portability extension would not |
|                                   | be applicable in this situation   |
|                                   | as the JSP payment would be       |
|                                   | extended under normal portability |
|                                   | rules for a further period        |
|                                   | required to attend to the funeral |
|                                   | up to a maximum of 6 weeks. If    |
|                                   | the customer was still required   |
|                                   | to be overseas after the end of   |
|                                   | their portability period, a       |
|                                   | portability extension could be    |
|                                   | considered.                       |
