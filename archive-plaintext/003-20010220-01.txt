an activated emergency event.

Emergency payments

The federal government has made a determination under the Social
Security Act that a major disaster has occurred. The following payments
have been activated for the Tasmanian Bushfires, December 2019:

-   Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment (AGDRP)
-   NZ Disaster Recovery Payment (DRP) - for New Zealand non-protected
    Special Category visa (subclass 444) holders, that is NZ equivalent
    of AGDRP
-   Disaster Recovery Allowance (DRA)
-   NZ DRA - for New Zealand non-protected Special Category visa
    (subclass 444) holders, that is NZ equivalent of DRA

Affected Local Government Areas (LGAs) for AGDRP and ex-gratia DRP

The determination specifies which LGAs are eligible for each emergency
payment.

The determination covers the affected LGAs of:

-   Break O'Day

Reasonably close to the bushfire (AGDRP/ex-gratia DRP only)

For the Tasmanian Bushfires, December 2019 the customer’s principal
place of residence must be:

-   within one of the designated LGAs, and
-   ‘reasonably close’ to the bushfires

Live maps can be used to help assess reasonably close. Live maps detail
the burn scar for each fire, and can be used to help determine the
likelihood that any major damage was a direct result of the designated
bushfire.

See the Resources page to access the live map links.

Assessing claims where a customer's principal residence is outside 10km burn scar radius

Customers located outside of the 10km radius of a bushfire burn scar may
require a greater degree of examination and customer questioning to
ensure the damage claimed was a direct result of the declared major
disaster.

Where the customer's principal place of residence is outside the 10km
burn scar radius, Service Officers can escalate the claim to the
Emergency Management Technical Peer Support once the following have been
completed and the investigation is documented on the customer's record:

-   All other eligibility criteria has been assessed as met
-   Major damage criteria has been established, the customer has clearly
    demonstrated how they have met the criteria. For information see the
    Process page when assessing 'major damage' and 'reasonably close'
-   If the Service Officer doubts the validity of the customer’s claim,
    evidence should be requested before escalating to the Emergency
    Management Technical Peer Support

The Emergency Management Technical Peer Support reviews the customer's
record to ensure all information has been provided/documented. If more
information is required, they advise the Service Officer to:

-   ask the customer to provide the information required, and
-   place the claim on hold with the relevant keyword

If all information has been provided, the Emergency Management Technical
Peer Support escalates the claim to the Emergency Management Level 2
Helpdesk/TPS.

If the customer’s principal place of residence is more than 15km from
the closest burn scar, evidence to support the major damage assessment
should be requested. Once evidence has been provided a referral is made
to the Emergency Management Technical Peer Support for escalation to
Emergency Management Level 2 Helpdesk.

For information on how a customer can claim, steps relating to initial
contact and Callback DOCs and ACTDOCs, see Claiming emergency payments.

Claim forms are available on the Services Australia website and on the
intranet, see the Resources page for a link.

Customers can:

-   call the Australian Government Emergency Information Line on 180 22
    66 to claim over the phone, or
-   post their form and supporting documents to:
    Emergency Processing Centre
    Reply Paid 7815

    centre, agent, access point or recovery centre (if available), or

Note: only staff trained in processing emergency payments can process
these claims.

Claims cannot be rejected until formal approval has been provided. Staff

Payment methods

There are a range of payment methods available for customers. These
include:

-   New Payments Platform (NPP)
-   Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) payments

Discuss the preferred method of payment for the customer. Use of NPP and
RTGS will help customers adversely affected by the major disaster
receive their payment/s faster.

Note: NPP is not available for all banks, however RTGS is available for
most banks. Check which payment methods are available before discussing
payment options with the customer.

NPP is capped at $3,000. Any attempt to transfer more than that amount
will result in no funds being transferred in that attempt.

Claims must be finalised before using the NPP. For further information
see Immediate payment by payment method New Payments Platform (NPP).

Additional Child Care Subsidy (ACCS) (Temporary Financial Hardship)

Customers may be able to get ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship) if they
have been impacted by a declared disaster and claiming AGDRP.

ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship) provides short-term support to
families experiencing significant financial stress due to circumstances
beyond their control. This additional financial assistance will help
ensure continuity of care for the child and support families when they
need it most.

To be eligible for ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship), customers must:

-   be eligible for Child Care Subsidy (CCS)
-   be assessed as experiencing temporary financial hardship for an
    event that occurred no more than six months before the application
    is made
-   have had a substantial reduction in their ability to pay child care
    fees as a direct result of the temporary financial hardship

To support an application for ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship)
customers must:

-   provide evidence that the event(s) occurred less than 6 months prior
    to the application
-   demonstrate a causal link between the event(s) and their financial
    hardship

Customers who are applying for ACCS Temporary Financial Hardship (as a
standalone application or a combined Child Care Subsidy claim) can
submit evidence that they or their partner have claimed for or received
AGDRP. No further evidence is required.

Customers still need to provide evidence the emergency event has caused
financial hardship and demonstrate the causal link between the event and
their reduced ability to pay child care fees.

If a customer wishes to apply for ACCS transfer the customer to 136 150.
