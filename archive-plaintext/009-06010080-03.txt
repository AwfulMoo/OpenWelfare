|                                   | Discuss the following with the    |
|                                   | carer:                            |

|                                   | -   Is the end date of the        |
|                                   |     absence after the date on     |
|                                   |     which the allowable absences  |
|                                   |     expire? If so, discuss the    |
|                                   |     circumstances for the absence |
|                                   |     with the carer, specifically  |
|                                   |     the reason the absence will   |
|                                   |     exceed the allowable absences |
|                                   |     of that type for the calendar |
|                                   |     year, with a view to          |
|                                   |     determining if the absence    |
|                                   |     should be extended            |
|                                   | -   If the total period of        |
|                                   |     temporary respite from care   |
|                                   |     is more than 63 days over the |
|                                   |     calendar year, payment can    |
|                                   |     continue if there is a        |
|                                   |     special reason. An APS 5      |
|                                   |     Service Officer determines a  |
|                                   |     special circumstance.         |
|                                   |     Generally a decision to       |
|                                   |     continue payment would only   |
|                                   |     be made if the reason for     |
|                                   |     ceasing care was outside the  |
|                                   |     control of the carer and      |
|                                   |     consistent with the need for, |
|                                   |     and provision of, personal    |
|                                   |     care and attention. For       |
|                                   |     example, a special            |
|                                   |     circumstance would not exist  |
|                                   |     where the carer simply chose  |
|                                   |     to extend a holiday beyond 63 |
|                                   |     days                          |
|                                   | -   Hospitalisation is limited to |
|                                   |     63 days except for care       |
|                                   |     receivers who qualify their   |

|                                   |     there is no limit to          |
|                                   |     hospitalisation days.         |
|                                   |     However, the 63 day respite   |
|                                   |     limit still applies, and all  |
|                                   |     absences must still be coded  |

|                                   | Note: if the absence is due to    |
|                                   | the CA care receiver undertaking  |
|                                   | Education, Training or Treatment, |
|                                   | the payment may continue at a     |

|                                   | receiver. See Carer Allowance     |
