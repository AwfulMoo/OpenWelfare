Lump Sum Assessment Results screen

The Lump Sum Assessment Results screen provides details of what the
system thinks has been determined to be the customer's correct
entitlement to the compensation affected payments (CAPs) received during
the estimated preclusion period.

The Lump Sum Assessment Results screen details should be correct if
there have been either:

-   no debts raised during the estimated debt period or
-   debts that have been raised automatically and recovered for the
    calculated amount

Starting a debt automatically reduces the determination file on which
the Lump Sum Assessment Results screen is based.

Check and adjust the Lump Sum Assessment Results screen:

-   If a debt has been automatically raised in the period and the
    estimated amount is different to the calculated amount, the Lump Sum
    Assessment Results screen will need adjustment by the difference
    between the two
-   If a debt has been finalised no debt, the estimated debt amount will
    need to be added back in
-   If a debt has been waived in the period, the debt remains waived
    unless it is a small debt waiver. The Lump Sum Assessment Results
    screen will need to be adjusted to add back in debts waived because
    they were less than $50
-   When a manual debt has been created and the determination file is
    not adjusted, the Lump Sum Assessment Results screen will need to be
    adjusted to take account of the manual debt
-   If manual payments have been issued via the Payment Adjustment
    (PAYJ) screen for reason system limitation (SYL), the Lump Sum
    Assessment Results screen must be corrected
-   If the debt is for older periods before 1998 when Newstart Common
    Platform commenced - add in any missing payments

Note: no adjustment is needed for debts due to internal transfers,
duplicate payments, advances and Family Tax Benefit (FTB) payments.

Adjust the Lump Sum Assessment Results screen where necessary. The
Payment Details Download Sheet (PS Tool) can be used as a tool to
reconcile payments received with the details in the Lump Sum on
Assessment Results screen if necessary.

It should be noted that the PS tool uses the payment history that is
different in nature to the Lump Sum Assessment Results screen data. For
further information, see Payment Details Download Sheet (PS Tool).

Explaining a lump sum preclusion period to the customer

-   "When a person receives a lump sum payment of compensation,
    Centrelink uses a formula to calculate a non-payment period,
    referred to as the ‘preclusion period’, during which there is no
    entitlement to most social security income support payments"
-   "During this period you are not able to receive income support from
    Centrelink"
-   "It is important to note that your partner does not have a
    preclusion period and may continue receiving an income support
    payments subject to the appropriate income and assets tests"
-   "It is important to note that you understand that you need to use
    some of the money you receive from your settlement to support you
    for the duration of your preclusion period and to cover all your
    living costs. Please refer to the back of your letter for more
    details"
-   "If you use some of your compensation settlement to buy assets (for
    example purchase or pay off a house or buy a car), you should make
    sure that you still leave enough aside to live on during the
    preclusion period. If you don’t do this and then ask Centrelink to
    review your preclusion period then you will be expected to use or
    sell the asset for income support throughout the preclusion period.
    Preclusion periods can only be shortened if you can show that there
    are unusual, uncommon, or exceptional circumstances that have caused
    your hardship. You will be expected to be able to support your
    claims with evidence"
-   "You may also be interested in talking with a Centrelink Financial
    Information Service Officer who can help you make decisions about
    your investment and financial situation. The service is free,
    independent and confidential. You can call 132 300 to make an
