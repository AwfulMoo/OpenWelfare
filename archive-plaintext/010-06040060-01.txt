This document outlines the assessment of the away from home rate of
Youth Allowance (YA) in cases where parents move frequently. This
criterion only applies to dependent YA customers undertaking secondary
study or an Australian Apprenticeship.

Parent/s move frequently

If a customer's parent/s move frequently (at least 5 times a year)
outside the geographic area resulting in excessive travel time by the
customer to attend their school or Australian Apprenticeship, the
customer may need to live away from home to continue their schooling or
apprenticeship.

Travel time is excessive where it would take the customer more than 90
minutes (1 way) to attend their current school or Australian
Apprenticeship.

If the parent/s move back to the area within 90 minutes of the
customer's educational institution or workplace (for Australian
Apprentices only), the away from home rate would no longer be payable
under this criterion. The customer may qualify for the away from home
rate under a different category.
