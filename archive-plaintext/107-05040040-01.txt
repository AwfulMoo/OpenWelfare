This document outlines how to action a broken discount recovery.

On this Page:

Follow up activities

If the customer does not pay the amount by the agreed date plus 7 days:

-   a Payment Not Received letter issues
-   the letter asks the customer to pay the amount within 7 days

If the customer does not pay the outstanding amount within 14 days from
the due date:

-   the arrangement status will change from current (CUR) to broken
    (BKN)
-   a DMN/RCV Broken Arrangement activity will generate
-   the activity will assign via Customer First Workload Manager (CFWLM)

Individual circumstances

Review a customer's record when actioning a broken arrangement. If a
previous discount arrangement was broken, do not consider another
discount arrangement for the same debt unless exceptional circumstances
exist.

When to cease a broken discount arrangement

Finalise the broken arrangement:

-   if there are no determined debts that need follow up action. For
    example, debts that have been referred to an External Collection
    Agent, or
-   reasonable effort to contact the customer has been made

Interest Charge (IC)

Interest Charge applies when a customer misses a payment under an agreed
payment arrangement. Interest is charged each day from the day after the
last expected repayment was due and will cease when:

-   total debt amount and any calculated interest is paid in full
-   the customer makes up the missed payment and continues to make
    agreed payments
-   we agree to skip the missed payment and the customer continues to
    make agreed payments
-   the customer enters into a new acceptable recovery arrangement and
    makes their first agreed payment
-   the customer has a reasonable excuse exemption applied, or
-   the customer has at least one debt temporarily written off or has a
    pause on debt recovery in place
