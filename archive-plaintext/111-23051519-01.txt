This document outlines the roles for staff in the Health Service
Delivery Division when disputing a quality checking result.

Quality checking disputes

Staff:

-   can initiate a quality checking dispute if they receive incorrect
    feedback or unwarranted error
-   must refer to their Quality Check (QC) feedback email and speak to
    their Team Leader

Note: face-to-face (F2F) Service Officers do not follow this process.

Quality Checkers have the right of reply if the original decision and/or
feedback provided is deemed incorrect. This includes where other errors
or actions were not initially identified from the check.
