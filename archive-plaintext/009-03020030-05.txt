+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | A carer provides daily care and   |
|                                   | attention to a care receiver as a |
|                                   | result of their illnesses and/or  |
|                                   | disabilities. Two mornings each   |
|                                   | week a professional nurse also    |
|                                   | provides specialised care to the  |
|                                   | care receiver.                    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This care would not affect the    |
|                                   | claimant's eligibility for CA as  |
|                                   | the claimant is meeting the daily |
|                                   | care and attention qualification. |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 2                                 | A carer provides care 4 days a    |
|                                   | week and a professional nurse     |
|                                   | provides care on the remaining 3  |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The carer would not qualify for   |
|                                   | CA as the carer is not providing  |
|                                   | daily care and attention.         |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 3                                 | A carer lives with the care       |
|                                   | receiver and is paid for          |
|                                   | providing daily care.             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the care being provided to the |
|                                   | care receiver is in a private     |
|                                   | home by a resident carer, it will |
|                                   | be considered no commercial       |
|                                   | arrangements exist and CA will be |
|                                   | payable.                          |
