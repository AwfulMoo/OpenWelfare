This document outlines Identity Review Periods. An Identity Review
Period is extra time in which customers can supply documents to meet
identity requirements.

Applying an Identity Review Period

Apply an Identity Review Period to grant a claim when the customer:

-   is in hardship
-   has provided some approved identity documents or is part of a
    Families record
-   is who they say they are (the identity is not suspicious), and
-   cannot lodge identity documents by the due date of claim but will
    within the Identity Review Period

Note: some payments or services do not require a customer to confirm
their identity. Payments or services that require identity confirmation.

If the customer cannot lodge the documents, consider applying
