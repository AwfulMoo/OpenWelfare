This document outlines information about the Accelerated Claimant
Matching (ACM) system. The ACM system is designed to check the
authenticity of new claims and change of circumstance notifications by
comparing new or changed information provided by customers against data
already held by Centrelink. Where inconsistencies are identified,
customers are selected for intervention.

ACM system checking of data held by Centrelink

The automated weekly checking of Centrelink applications and
notification of changed circumstances aims to advance commencement of
Centrelink's entitlement review process so that it starts when
applications are lodged rather than some time after lodgement date.

This is part of a strategy to prevent incorrect payments from starting
and is an essential component of the strategy of encouraging high levels
of voluntary compliance.
