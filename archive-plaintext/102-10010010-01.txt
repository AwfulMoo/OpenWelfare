This document outlines the codes used when cancelling, suspending or
rejecting ABSTUDY.

Requirement for a specific code

A specific code must be used when a decision is made to cancel, suspend
or reject a payment. The correct code must be used to ensure the reason
for the decision matches the activity and the correct letter is issued
to the customer.

When to use a code

Use a rejection code when:

-   processing a new claim and the student or Australian Apprentice is
    ineligible for ABSTUDY
-   a subsequent assessment identifies the claim should not have granted

A suspension code is used when ABSTUDY payments are current and
information is required to confirm the student or Australian
Apprentice's continuing ABSTUDY eligibility or payment rate.

Use a cancellation code when ABSTUDY payments are current and the
student or Australian Apprentice is no longer eligible for ABSTUDY.

The Process page contains a list of the cancellation, suspension and
rejection codes for ABSTUDY in alphabetical order. The list of codes is
not publicly available.
