Risks to a customer's privacy have been identified. See Separating
Safely - protecting personal details to make sure the customer's
personal details are safe before progressing.

This document outlines how Compliance Officers assess and finalise an
RSI.

Assessing an RSI

After gathering all the evidence, calculate the customer's entitlement
as soon as possible.

When making an unfavourable decision, speak to the customer:

-   explain the decision
-   give them a chance to provide more information or evidence relevant
    to the decision
-   advise their review rights, and record an application for a formal
    review of the decision if required

Make 2 genuine attempts to contact the customer. If contact is
unsuccessful, send a Pre-adverse decision letter to the customer and/or
the affected party to advise them how the outcome was determined.

Finalising an RSI

The intervention is finalised after:

-   the conversation with the customer
-   delivering the education message, and
-   calculating any changes to the customer's and/or the affected
    party’s entitlement

The outcome will be finalised if the customer does not respond to the
pre adverse decision letter or fails to give more information.

Before finalising, check that all activities completed as part of the
RSI are correctly attributed to the review in the Integrated Review
System (IRS).
