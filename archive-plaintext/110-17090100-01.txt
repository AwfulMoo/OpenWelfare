Employment Income Confirmation (EIC) and Check and Update Past Income
(CUPI) Operational Blueprint pages are under review. Compliance Officers
must seek advice from the Policy Engagement Team before actioning an EIC
or CUPI. Contact the team by the CADO Service Desk page.

This document outlines the registered mail process for compliance
interventions and how Compliance Officers (CO) process returned
correspondence.

Registered mail processing

The aim of the registered mail process is to ensure customers receive
correspondence in relation to their compliance intervention.

The following interventions issue correspondence via registered mail
processing:

-   Check and update past income (CUPI) service
-   Employment Income Confirmation (EIC)
-   Manual Income Confirmation (MIC)
-   Business Income and Bank Interest (BIBI)
-   Business and other income type (BOIT)

Where the initial contact letter has been 'Returned to Sender' or the
tracking status has expired, COs must check the delivery status of the
correspondence and the status of the intervention to determine the
action required.

COs are also able to record the initial contact letter as delivered in
order to populate the Initial Notification Receipt date and commence the
intervention count down.

The Resources page contains a link to the Australia Post portal, the
documentation requirements for Return to Sender processing and a link to
the suggested script for information from a third party data source.
