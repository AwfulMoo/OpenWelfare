This document outlines how Service Officers identify and capture
circumstances impacting capacity to comply with compulsory requirements
for job seekers or ParentsNext participants.

Personal responsibility

Job seekers and ParentsNext participants are expected to take personal
responsibility managing and ensuring they can meet their requirements.

This includes:

-   talking with their Employment Services Provider or ParentsNext
    provider about circumstances that may be impacting their ability to
    participate, so the activities in their Job/Participation Plan are
    appropriate and achievable
-   recording Personal Events on their dashboard to ensure their
    provider is aware of personal appointments/commitments
-   letting their provider know beforehand if unable to attend on a day,
    and
-   recording their own attendance at compulsory requirements

Circumstances that are likely to have ongoing impacts

If job seekers, including ParentsNext participants, have circumstances
that are likely to impact on their capacity to comply, Services
Australia and providers flag these. This ensures their personal
circumstances are considered when negotiating a Job Plan or if
non-compliance occurs.

Services Australia responsibilities

All Service Officers and specialists have responsibility for
identifying, recording and reviewing job seeker circumstances that are
ongoing in nature and are likely to have an impact on the job seeker's
capacity to comply with requirements. Job seekers who present with
family and domestic violence or have a current Family
relationship/Domestic violence circumstance recorded must have a
consultation with a PST-skilled social worker. See Accessing a
PST-skilled social worker.

When job seeker circumstances are recorded or reviewed, Service Officers
must remind job seekers of their personal responsibilities.

These responsibilities include:

-   talking to your provider about any circumstances that are likely to
    impact your ability to comply with requirements
-   fully participating in compulsory activities included in your Job
    Plan/Participation Plan
-   keeping the Job Seeker Account calendar up to date to make sure your
    provider is aware of personal commitments, such as school pick up
    times or work, when scheduling requirements

Recording circumstances impacting capacity to comply with compulsory requirements

The Circumstances Impacting Compliance screen displays all circumstances
that have been identified as potentially impacting the job seeker's
capacity to comply with compulsory requirements.

Before recording a job seeker circumstance impacting compliance, Service
Officers should consider the impact the circumstance is likely to have
on the job seeker's ongoing capacity to comply with compulsory
requirements. Circumstances that are unlikely to affect the job seeker's
capacity to comply should not be recorded and any existing circumstances
that is no longer impacting should be ended.

The Services Australia system will automatically create job seeker
circumstances when:

-   providers record circumstances in the Capability Management Tool in
    the Employment Services System (ESS)
-   Homelessness Indicators have been recorded
-   an Employment Services Assessment (ESAt)/Job Capacity Assessment
    (JCA) or Job Seeker Classification Instrument (JSCI) identifies
    factors likely to impact a job seekers capacity to comply

When job seeker circumstances have been automatically created, they
contain minimal information and need to be assessed as appropriate
during interactions with PST-skilled Service Officers.

When Services Australia identify new job seeker circumstances during any
contact, a circumstance can be created manually using the Circumstances
Impacting Compliance workflow.

Disclosing information to providers

Circumstances that are impacting compliance is information that
providers need to know:

-   to ensure compulsory requirements are reasonable
-   so they can identify appropriate support services
-   so they can undertake their roles and responsibilities in relation
    to administration of social security law

Section 202 of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 provides
Services Australia with the authority to disclose information to
providers, which is relevant to their servicing and assists the provider
to deliver an effective service to the job seeker.

By using the Circumstances Impacting Compliance screen, Services
Australia ensures that relevant information about a job seeker's
circumstances is made available to their provider. For certain
circumstances, as long as the appropriate minimum evidence has been
recorded, the information Services Australia record is shared
electronically with the provider as a Vulnerability Indicator. Providers
use the Capability Management tool in the Employment Services System
(ESS) to display a job seeker/ParentsNext participants existing
circumstances/Vulnerability Indicator.

The Resources page contains attachments describing when the various job
seeker circumstances categories can be added, updated or ended, and the
evidence required for different circumstances.
