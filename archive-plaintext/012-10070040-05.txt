Patient consent dates workaround

Note: this workaround only applies to processing actioned after 31
January of any year.

The PIP Online system does not allow some IHI patient registrations to
be processed. This happens when the patient consent date on the form is
between 1 November and 31 December of any year.

This approved workaround ensures that affected forms will be easily
identified at a later date.
