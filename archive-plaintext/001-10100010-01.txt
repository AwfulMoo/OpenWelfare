This document explains the process undertaken by Participation Solutions
Team (PST)-skilled Service Officers who are responsible for deciding
serious failures when a Community Development Program (CDP) job seeker
refuses, or fails to accept, a suitable job offer.

Serious failure for refusing or failing to accept a suitable job offer

A serious failure may require investigation when a CDP job seeker
refuses or fails to accept a suitable job offer.

These may be triggered when:

-   a Participation Report received from a CDP provider, or
-   an employer contacts Services Australia directly to advise a job
    offer has been refused by a CDP job seeker or a CDP job seeker
    failed to accept a job offer. In these cases Services Australia will
    generate the serious failure for investigation

Serious failure conditions

A serious failure has only occurred as a result of a CDP job seeker
refusing or failing to accept a suitable job offer if:

-   the CDP job seeker was receiving a payment subjected to mutual
    obligation requirements on the failure incident date
-   the position offered was suitable work based on the CDP job seeker's
    individual circumstances, and
-   the CDP job seeker did not have a reasonable excuse for refusing or
    failing to accept the offer or commence work as planned

Not commencing suitable job when relocation assistance paid

When a CDP job seeker accepted but did not commence a suitable
relocation job in the past 6 months, the incident is to be investigated
as a relocation UNPP and not a serious failure. When the serious failure
was generated by a Participation Report, Services Australia will reject
the serious failure and the provider will be responsible for submitting
a new report with the correct failure type.

Responsibilities of PST-skilled Service Officers with WNPPD security resource

PST-skilled Service Officers with WNPPD security resource are
responsible for:

-   Reviewing existing information on the CDP job seeker's record which
    may be relevant to the failure, including reviewing the
    Participation Report and provider comments
-   Determining the validity of the failure
-   Establishing contact with the CDP job seeker to discuss the failure
    and recording the CDP job seeker's explanation for the failure
-   Contacting third parties, which may include Employment Services
    Providers or employers, to gather further information about the
    position offered, how the offer was made, and/or the refusal/failure
    to accept or commence suitable employment
-   Determining whether personal factors or barriers impacted on the
    suitability of the employment or the CDP job seeker's capacity to
    accept the job offer. This may include consultation with a
    Centrelink specialist or Indigenous Cultural Consultant
-   Recording all elements of the investigation in the Compliance
    Investigation workflow
-   Determining whether a serious failure has occurred and notifying the
    CDP job seeker of this determination. Note: when the PST-skilled
    Service Officer (WNPPD) is not at the APS5 level consultation with a
    Service Officer (SO5) should occur before a decision is made to
    apply a serious failure for refusing or failing to accept a suitable
    job offer
-   Explaining the serious failure penalty and Compliance Activities and
    offering the CDP job seeker the opportunity to waive the serious
    failure penalty by participating in a Compliance Activity
-   Re-engaging CDP job seekers who agree to participate in a Compliance
    Activity with their provider
-   Determining if hardship provisions apply when the CDP job seeker
    does not have capacity to participate in a Compliance Activity

The Resources page contains a table outlining the different types of
serious failures relating to failing or refusing to accept a suitable
job offer.
