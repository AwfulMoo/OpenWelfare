Relationship parent - definition

The definition of 'Relationship parent' and 'relationship child', in the
Social Security Act 1991 refers to the interpretation of a child in the
Family Law Act 1975. These definitions intend to include as parents both
people in a same-sex or heterosexual relationship, where:

-   one of the people is the biological parent of the child
-   that person was in a relationship with the other person when an
    artificial conception procedure was carried out, and
-   the other person agreed to the procedure

In such cases, the child is a relationship child of the biological
parent and the other intended parent.

Parents of children born under surrogacy arrangements, where a court has
made an order that the child is their child, are also included in the
definition of relationship parent.

|                                   | receive UTLAH assessment work?    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The majority of O18 work comes    |
|                                   | via workload manager (WLM). O18   |
|                                   | Service Officers do not ‘own’     |
|                                   | assessments. A Service Officer    |
|                                   | assigned the work item takes      |
|                                   | action to progress an assessment, |
|                                   | taking this as far as possible,   |
|                                   | before returning the work item    |
|                                   | back to the WLM pool, until the   |
|                                   | next piece of information is      |
|                                   | received or the work item is due. |
|                                   | At that time a different O18      |
|                                   | Service Officer may be assigned   |
|                                   | the work item/assessment. For     |
|                                   | this reason, contacting the last  |
|                                   | Service Officer who was assigned  |
|                                   | the work item is not helpful,     |
|                                   | because they may no longer have   |
|                                   | the assessment.                   |

|                                   | parent is required if the parents |
