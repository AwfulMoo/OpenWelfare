This compensation has now been taken into account as income for the period that it was back paid.

You were no longer eligible for this payment. You will need to pay back the money you received from (date) to (date).                                                                                                                When you discontinued your study, you could no longer receive these payments.

This is because you commenced full time employment with (employer) on (date).
  Assets                                                                                                   This is because there are limits to how much your assets can be worth before they affect your payment. The correct value of your assets is different to the amount we used in the payments made to you from {debtStartDate} to {debtEndDate}.                                                     This is because an incorrect value of your assets was used to work out the payments made to you.
  Income and Assets                                                                                        N/A                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               This is because an incorrect amount of income and assets was used to work out the payments made to you.
  Earnings                                                                                                 The correct earnings for you and your partner were not taken into account in the payments made to you from (date) to (date). This means you have been overpaid. We are, therefore, required to recover this amount.                                                                               This is because an incorrect amount of employment income from (employer) was used to work out the payments made to you.
