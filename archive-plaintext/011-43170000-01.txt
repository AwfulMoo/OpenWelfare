This document outlines information about the Bank Reconciliation
Electronic Funds Transfer Enquiry (BREFTE) system for Medicare.

Changes to the BREFTE system

BREFTE is an enquiry system for electronic funds transfer (EFT) payments
processed by the Medicare payment systems. BREFTE:

-   records EFT payment status and text data associated with an EFT
    payment
-   reflects the actions performed in the claims processing transactions
    relating to EFT claims for paid accounts.

As part of the ‘Move all Medicare payments to Electronic Funds Transfer
(EFT)’ 2015/2016 budget initiative changes have been made to the BREFTE
system.

Changes to BREFTE for the Medicare patient claims allows payment of
claims to be held, where current valid EFT details are not available at
time of processing:

-   A Batch job will be run each night to search Consumer Directory
    Maintenance System (CDMS) and identify any new EFT details recorded
    in CDMS for a claimant that has a ‘HELD’ payment.
-   Where new details are found the system will insert these EFT details
    into the BREFTE Redirect table.
-   These details will be picked up and processed in the next payment
    run and the benefit will be paid.
