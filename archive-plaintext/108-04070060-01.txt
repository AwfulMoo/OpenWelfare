Sale of real estate

A separate procedure covers deferred sale or sale by instalment of
principal home.

The sale of a property, where the purchase price is paid over an agreed
period, may be treated as income depending on whether or not the sale
creates a loan, or a sale agreement.

Loan

If the sale creates a loan, the loan is subject to deeming.

Sale agreement

In a sale agreement, money moves from the purchaser to the seller
subject to the terms of the contract. If a sale agreement:

-   provides for interest to be paid on the outstanding purchase price
    balance, the interest payable is treated as income for social
    security purposes
-   does not provide for interest to be paid on the outstanding purchase
    price balance, it may be necessary to obtain an actuarial valuation
    of the payments due

Income from the sale of real estate which is deferred or paid by
instalments should be referred to a Complex Assessment Officer (CAO) for
assessment.

The Resources page contains examples of using the discount factor
formula to determine the estimated value of the property.
