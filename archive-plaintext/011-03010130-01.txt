Retire an IHI

The HI Service automatically retires an IHI when 1 of the below occurs:

-   the IHI status is verified and the IHI contains a date of death, and
-   the death has been confirmed by Fact of Death Data (FODD) and no
    activity has been recorded against the IHI in the previous 90 days,
    or
-   the individual's age recorded on their verified IHI reaches 130
    years

A retired IHI cannot be updated, amended or viewed, except where a
Service Officer can manually reinstate a retired IHI by removing the
date of death if it has been incorrectly applied.

A retired IHI is:

-   returned in a search by a Service Officer for the purposes of
    reinstating the IHI
-   not returned in a search by a Healthcare Provider

The System Log in connection with a retired IHI cannot be retrieved or
viewed, except in response to an approved request via:

-   release of information
-   freedom of information
