This document outlines how motor vehicle expenses, when received as
child support or as spousal maintenance, may be assessed as maintenance
income, which can affect the rate of Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A.

Motor vehicle expenses assessed as child support

Motor vehicle expenses can be assessed as child support if:

the vehicle is available for the payee to use, and

the expenses are:

-   running costs (petrol, registration, tyres, minor repairs)
-   costs of providing the vehicle as an asset for the payee (e.g. loan
    repayments, insurance premiums, modifications), but only if the
    vehicle is owned or jointly owned by the payee

If the payer and payee share ownership or use of the vehicle, only
assess the expenses that relate to the payee's share or use.

If ownership of the vehicle has been transferred to the payee, it may be
assessed as capitalised maintenance depending on the value.

Child Support agreements

Child Support agreements with a start date of 1 July 2008 or later are
no longer manually assessed or coded by Centrelink staff, they are
assessed by Child Support.

For agreements with a start date before 1 July 2008, any non-cash
maintenance must be manually recorded on the Centrelink system for the
period up to and including 30 June 2008. For agreements in place before
1 July 2008 that have been accepted by Child Support and transitioned
under the Child Support Scheme Reforms from 1 July 2008, non-cash
maintenance previously coded on the Centrelink system is maintained by
Centrelink.

The Resources page contains examples of how to assess the value of a
motor vehicle provided as child support.
