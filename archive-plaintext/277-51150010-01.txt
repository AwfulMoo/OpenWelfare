This document outlines information on how to confirm whether a person
liable to pay child support to a Family Tax Benefit (FTB) customer has a
Centrelink record. It also explains how to link the paying parent to the
customer's record if they do have a Centrelink record and how to unlink
the paying parent if an incorrect link has been made.

Centrelink records for child support paying parents

A link must be attempted before child support details can be updated for
a group where each child in the maintenance entitlement group is:

-   a stage one child and there is no Child Support case identifier
    displayed for the group, or
-   a pre-stage one child

A paying parent can only be linked if a Centrelink record already exists
for the person.

For a stage two child, or where the group includes a mixture of stage
one and stage two children, paying parent details are provided by Child
Support.

The activities will include one of the following explanations:

-   paying parent manual matching required (a mismatch has occurred)
-   parentage recorded as cannot be proven but paying parent provided by
    Child Support
-   parentage recorded as unknown but paying parent provided by Child
    Support
-   Child Support paying parent is recorded as current partner

Updating payer link

All cases requiring the linking or unlinking of a child support paying
parent, are to be referred to a Families override contact by Smart
Centre and Service Centre staff.

The Resources page contains a link to the Families override contacts.
