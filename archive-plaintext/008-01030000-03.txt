|                                   | An ABI is an injury to the brain  |
|                                   | that has occurred sometime after  |
|                                   | birth. Another term that can be   |
|                                   | used for brain injuries is        |
|                                   | acquired cerebral insult.         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The brain has 2 cerebral          |
|                                   | hemispheres – left and right.     |
|                                   | These are divided into lobes.     |
|                                   | Each lobe controls different      |
|                                   | functions.                        |

|                                   | The frontal lobe is at the front  |
|                                   | of the brain and controls:        |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | The occipital lobe is at the back |
|                                   | of the brain. It receives visual  |
|                                   | information and interprets        |
|                                   | colours, shapes and distances.    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The parietal lobe is towards the  |
|                                   | back of the brain and has the     |
|                                   | following functions:              |

|                                   | The temporal lobe is towards the  |
|                                   | side of the brain and controls:   |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | -   emotions                      |
|                                   | -   hearing and language,         |
|                                   |     including the rhythm and      |

|                                   | An ABI is not the same as an      |
|                                   | intellectual disability. People   |
|                                   | with an ABI usually retain their  |
|                                   | intellectual abilities but have   |
|                                   | cognitive problems such as        |
|                                   | difficulty controlling,           |
|                                   | coordinating and or communicating |
|                                   | their thoughts, emotions or       |
|                                   | actions. Customers with an ABI    |
|                                   | can experience a significant      |
|                                   | recovery with appropriate         |
|                                   | treatment and rehabilitation.     |

|                                   | The causes of an ABI include:     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Traumatic brain injury which can  |
|                                   | be caused by accidents such as a  |
|                                   | motor vehicle or a sporting       |
|                                   | accident, gunshot wound, fall,    |
|                                   | assault or violent shaking        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Stroke or Cerebral Vascular       |
|                                   | Accident (CVA). A stroke can      |
|                                   | cause brain damage when a blood   |
|                                   | vessel within the brain is        |
|                                   | ruptured or blocked, interrupting |
|                                   | its blood supply. A stroke can    |
|                                   | occur in many places in the       |
|                                   | brain, however, it usually        |
|                                   | affects specific areas of the     |
|                                   | brain and other areas continue to |
|                                   | function normally                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Tumours. The effects of the       |
|                                   | tumour will depend on its size,   |
|                                   | type and its location within the  |
|                                   | brain. There are three main types |
|                                   | of brain tumours:                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   malignant (primary) tumours – |
|                                   |     begin in the brain and        |
|                                   |     progressively invade the      |
|                                   |     surrounding area              |
|                                   | -   malignant (secondary) tumours |
|                                   |     – spread from the cells of    |
|                                   |     malignant tumours in other    |
|                                   |     parts of the body             |
|                                   | -   benign tumours – are usually  |
|                                   |     slow growing and may cause    |
|                                   |     symptoms due to pressure on   |
|                                   |     the brain                     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Infections. The brain has a       |
|                                   | protective barrier called the     |
|                                   | blood brain barrier. This can be  |
|                                   | broken by bacteria or viruses,    |
|                                   | which can result in meningitis or |
|                                   | encephalitis                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Poisoning. This is a physical     |
|                                   | damage to the brain as a result   |
|                                   | of substance misuse due to        |
|                                   | alcohol or drug related brain     |
|                                   | damage and can affect thinking,   |
|                                   | emotions, behaviour and movement  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Lack of oxygen. This can occur in |
|                                   | the case of a drowning or heart   |
|                                   | attack, where the heart ceases to |
|                                   | beat and the oxygen supply is     |
|                                   | affected. A lack of blood supply  |
|                                   | can cause brain damage. The       |
|                                   | longer the brain goes without a   |
|                                   | blood supply, the more severe the |
|                                   | injury will be                    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Epilepsy. Damage to the brain may |
|                                   | cause scarring and this may       |
|                                   | affect the brain’s electrical     |
|                                   | activity, which can cause a fit   |
|                                   | or seizure                        |

|                                   | Recovery from an ABI will vary    |
|                                   | from person to person and the     |

|                                   | predict. Recovery is usually      |
|                                   | rapid at first, with improvements |
|                                   | occurring rapidly as swelling and |
|                                   | bruising subsides. The most       |
|                                   | significant improvements usually  |
|                                   | occur within the first three to   |
|                                   | six months. After this, the       |

|                                   | There are generally three stages  |
|                                   | of recovery from an ABI:          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   acute stage – the period of   |
|                                   |     intense treatment where the   |
|                                   |     main priority is the survival |
|                                   |     and medical treatment of the  |
|                                   |     person                        |
|                                   | -   rehabilitation stage – this   |
|                                   |     involves intensive therapy    |
|                                   |     aimed at the natural process  |
|                                   |     of recovery which aims to     |
|                                   |     reduce the long term effects  |
|                                   |     of the disability. It focuses |
|                                   |     on regaining previous skills  |
|                                   |     and overcoming ongoing        |
|                                   |     problems. This stage may take |
|                                   |     between six to twelve months  |
|                                   | -   community re-entry stage –    |
|                                   |     this focuses on issues of     |
|                                   |     everyday living and returning |
|                                   |     to previous activities such   |
|                                   |     as work, study and leisure.   |
|                                   |     This will help the person and |
|                                   |     their family to adapt to any  |

|                                   |     injury. This stage of         |
|                                   |     recovery may go for a long    |
|                                   |     period of time                |

|                                   | Post traumatic amnesia (PTA) is a |
|                                   | state of acute confusion          |
|                                   | characterised by difficulty with  |

|                                   | PTA is the time between the       |
|                                   | injury and the recovery of        |
|                                   | continuous memory. The length of  |
|                                   | time of PTA may predict the       |
|                                   | severity and outcome of the brain |
|                                   | injury. A general assessment is   |

|                                   | Tinnitus is where the person      |
|                                   | hears a sound, a ringing, or a    |
|                                   | noise when no external noise is   |
|                                   | present. The noise can be         |
|                                   | intermittent or constant, mild or |
|                                   | severe and may vary from a low    |
|                                   | roar to a high-pitched sound.     |

|                                   | high frequency hearing loss that  |
|                                   | is associated with increasing     |
|                                   | age. It can be complicated not    |
|                                   | only by a decrease of the nerve   |
|                                   | cells in the inner ear available  |
|                                   | for transmission of auditory      |
|                                   | signals, but also the additional  |
|                                   | loss of hearing receptors in the  |
|                                   | brain in which results in poorer  |

|                                   | Outer/middle ear infections may   |
|                                   | be caused by the build-up of wax  |
|                                   | in the outer ear cancel, which    |
|                                   | can lead to a reduction in        |
|                                   | hearing acuity. Medical treatment |
|                                   | to remove the wax is usually all  |
|                                   | that is required. Middle ear      |
|                                   | infections can lead to permanent  |
|                                   | damage if not treated. These are  |
|                                   | common in young children. Chronic |
|                                   | ear infection may result in ‘glue |
|                                   | ear’, which affects the ability   |
|                                   | of the tiny bones of the middle   |
|                                   | ear to transmit sound to the      |
|                                   | inner ear.                        |

|                                   | AIDS. Not everyone who has HIV    |
|                                   | will develop AIDS.                |

|                                   | years. But today, there are many  |

|                                   | HIV, but do not cure HIV/AIDS.    |

|                                   | (PTSD) is a severe reaction to a  |
|                                   | traumatic event often involving   |
|                                   | actual or threatened death or     |
|                                   | serious injury to themselves or   |
|                                   | others. Post-traumatic stress     |
|                                   | disorder occurs where a person    |
|                                   | experiences persistent and        |
|                                   | intrusive recollections or dreams |
|                                   | about the event. They often try   |
|                                   | to avoid situations that are      |
|                                   | associated with the trauma.       |

|                                   | Bipolar affective disorder is a   |
|                                   | mood disorder characterised by a  |
|                                   | person experiencing both episodes |
|                                   | of depression and extreme elation |
|                                   | or mania. During a manic phase, a |
|                                   | person is often highly excited,   |
|                                   | over-active, over-confident,      |
|                                   | over-talkative and may lose touch |
|                                   | with reality. In the depressed    |
|                                   | phase, a person can become sad,   |
|                                   | pessimistic about the future,     |
|                                   | withdrawn, underactive or have    |
|                                   | feelings of guilt. In either      |
|                                   | mood, people may experience       |

|                                   | concentration, a short attention  |
|                                   | span, confused thinking, and mood |
|                                   | swings from a general hyperactive |
|                                   | state to a flattened mood.        |
