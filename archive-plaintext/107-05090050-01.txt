This document outlines recovery of debts on behalf of other government
departments (OGD).

Debt recovery on behalf of OGD

Recovery of OGD debts is by withholdings. The only exception is cash
payments for New Zealand Ministry of Social Development (MSD) debts.

The agency that sends the debt to Services Australia needs to answer
questions about:

-   how the debt occurred
-   the debt amount

The customer negotiates the rate of withholdings with Services
Australia.

The debt authority type for New Zealand debts is International Recovery
(INT). Other OGD processing still applies, such as:

-   reminder letters
-   automatic waiver and write offs

Centrelink International Services (CIS) manage recovery of New Zealand
debts, including customer inquiries and liaising with MSD. Staff can
process arrangements with customers repaying New Zealand debt by cash.
Customers can request a payment card if needed. All currency are in
Australian dollars.

Services Australia's responsibility ends when an arrangement ceases.
Recovery continues on debts raised under the Farm Household Support Act.
These debts have standard methods applied under the Social Security Act
1991 to recover them.

Non-standard withholdings on an OGD or INT debt will continue at that
rate on a new debt unless changed.

Debt Team protocols and Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA)

Debt teams are the point of contact for DVA staff. For contact details
for the appropriate Debt Recovery Team, see Office Locator.

DVA debts have a Unique Identifier Number (UIN). The UIN is in the XRN
field (under the CRN field) or on the Reference Numbers (NU) screen. The
Addtnl Reference No field must have the UIN recorded. The UIN contains
only numbers.

If there is no UIN, request a CRN/UIN link via email to the DFISA
helpdesk mailbox. The CRN/UIN link sends debt repayment details to the
DVA as they occur. The system creates an MFU If the link fails.

Customers are exempt from interest charge (IC) when receiving a pension
or allowance under the Veterans Entitlements Act 1986. The DVA advises
Services Australia of grants of a DVA payment to a debtor. The date of
effect used to cease accrual of IC is the Veterans entitlement date.

The Resources page contains links to the Centrelink International
Services (CIS) homepage and Office Locator to search for Debt Recovery
Teams.
