|                                   | imposed by the Court (with the    |

|                                   | offenders, sentencing them to     |

|                                   | considered to be in prison. A     |
|                                   | Community Services Order is a     |
|                                   | type of Community Based Order     |
|                                   | that can be imposed by a Court.   |
