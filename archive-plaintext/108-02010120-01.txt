For staff processing dependent Youth Allowance (YA) claims.

This document outlines when a claim for Youth Allowance (YA) is
finalised and it results in a status of pending (YAL/PSA) on the
customer's record. This is for staff processing Youth Allowance
apprentice, job seeker and student claims.

Change in family circumstance may impact entitlement

A change of circumstances for a dependent customer may have a
significant impact on the entitlement of their sibling(s) if they are
included in the family pool.

Some examples of change in circumstances include:

-   a customer's Rent Assistance increases or decreases
-   a customer becomes eligible for, or ceases to be eligible for, the
    away from home rate
-   a customer gains independence, or ceases to be independent following
    a review
-   a customer turns 18 years of age
-   a student ceases full-time study and no longer qualifies for payment
-   a job seeker finds full time work
-   a customer transfers to a payment other than YA, ABSTUDY or
    Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) Scheme

Note: Family Tax Benefit (FTB) and regular care children aged 0-15, and
16-19 in full-time secondary study may be considered a dependant sibling
for inclusion in the family pool. Changes in their circumstances may
also have a significant impact or ripple effect on the customer's
entitlement.

How customer and dependent sibling claims are assessed

When processing a claim for a dependent YA customer whose YA rate is
reduced to $0 by the income of the parent(s)/guardian(s), the claim
status will show as pending (YAL/PSA) for one day (until the end of the
next working day after the claim was processed) after finalisation,
unless the claim is manually rejected at the time of assessment.

At the end of the second day, an automatic reassessment will occur and
will change the pending status to rejected Parental Income Too High
(PIH).

If a sibling's claim is processed, or a sibling joins or returns to the
family pool within the Pending Status (PSA) review period and the
parental income is at a level where both the customer and sibling become
payable, then the claims will grant automatically. This includes where a
sibling is recorded as an FTB or regular care child.

If the parental income is at a level that requires 3 or more dependant
siblings for YA be payable, the PSA review period will be reset for the
customer, to expire at the same time as their siblings' PSA review.

After the PSA review period has elapsed, if parental income is too high
the claims will reject PIH. If a third sibling claims within 13 weeks,
all siblings' claims may be reassessed.

potential entitlement.
