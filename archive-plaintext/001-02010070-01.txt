This document outlines information on seasonal employment.

Benefits of seasonal employment

Seasonal employment can be useful in providing short term work for job
seekers. Job seekers gain experience, money and contacts by undertaking
such work.

Information regarding seasonal employment can be obtained from the job
seeking websites available on job search facilities in Service Centres
and Workforce Australia Employment Services Providers.

Harvest work

Harvest Labour Services (HLS) providers are contracted to provide labour
in regions that require a large number of out-of-area workers to harvest
crops.

If a job seeker enquires about harvest work, they should be referred to
a HLS provider. If there is not a provider in the area, the job seeker
should telephone the National Harvest Labour Information Service (NHLIS)
on 1800 062 332.

Any employer who approaches Centrelink seeking information about HLS or
to lodge a harvest labour vacancy is to be directed to the NHLIS phone
service or to its website.

Further information may also be obtained from the Harvest Trail link on
the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations website.

Jobseeker considerations

Job seekers should note that:

-   customers may fail the conditions of their mutual obligation
    requirements if they move to a new location and this involves moving
    to an area of lower employment prospects (MALEP)
-   if job seekers need to reclaim, a Seasonal Work Preclusion Period
    (SWPP) may apply

The Resources page contains further information about seasonal
employment.
