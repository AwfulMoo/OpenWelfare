|                                   | Milli works two casual jobs in    |
|                                   | the fast food industry. Milli's   |
|                                   | total hours can vary              |
|                                   | significantly across fortnights - |
|                                   | in some fortnights Milli is only  |
|                                   | assigned one 4 hour shift, while  |
|                                   | in others up to five 4 hour       |
|                                   | shifts could be assigned.         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Milli's working hours across six  |
|                                   | fortnights range from 4 hours to  |
|                                   | 16 hours per fortnight which      |
|                                   | would ordinarily give Milli an    |
|                                   | entitlement ranging from zero to  |
|                                   | up to 36 hours of subsidised      |
|                                   | child care per fortnight          |
|                                   | depending on hours worked each    |
|                                   | fortnight.                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | To support the maximum hours of   |
|                                   | paid work during a fortnight with |
|                                   | access to sufficient hours of     |
|                                   | child care, Milli would declare   |
|                                   | an estimate of 16 hours of paid   |
|                                   | work per fortnight and would be   |
|                                   | entitled to 36 hours of           |
|                                   | subsidised child care in each     |
|                                   | fortnight.                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Two months after advising the     |
|                                   | work hours, Milli's work shifts   |
|                                   | increase, ranging from 12 hours   |
|                                   | to 28 hours per fortnight. Milli  |
|                                   | updates the work hours from 16    |
|                                   | hours to 28 hours online,         |
|                                   | resulting in access to 72 hours   |
|                                   | of subsidised child care per      |
|                                   | fortnight.                        |

|                                   | ranges from 20 to 25 hours per    |
|                                   | fortnight, depending on the       |
|                                   | number of shifts worked.          |

|                                   | fortnight, which would give an    |

Automatic Activity Test results

If a customer's declared level of activity gives a higher Activity Test
result than their automatic result, the higher result will apply. For
partnered customers, even when one or both have an automatic Activity
Test result, the number of subsidised hours of child care is based on
the person with the lowest Activity Test result.

Note: this does not apply to grandparent principle carers not receiving
income support or individuals temporarily outside of Australia.

Preschool Activity test

This exemption only applies to a child who attends an early educational
program at a centre-based day care service (e.g. preschool or a
kindergarten) in the year that is 2 years before Grade 1 of school. For
example, if a child is due to start primary school in February 2021, the
child is considered a preschool aged child for 2020. The child will
attend Grade 1 in 2022.
