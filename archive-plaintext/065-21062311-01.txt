This document outlines eligibility and payment of the aged care
residential care support supplement.

Aged care residential care support supplement

An aged care residential care support payment is paid as a lump sum
amount determined from each service’s:

-   residential support supplement based on the Modified Monash
    Model (MMM) classification, and
-   residential and respite actual occupied beds for each day in
    February 2021

The aged care residential care support supplement is a one-time
supplement aimed at covering the additional costs of caring for the
health and wellbeing of care recipients.

Modified Monash Model (MMM)

The Modified Monash Model (MMM) Classification defines if a service
location is a:

-   city
-   rural
-   remote, or
-   very remote

The model uses census data based on the Australian Statistical Geography
Standard – Remoteness Areas (ASGS-RA) It then subdivides regional
Australia into additional categories based on distance from a town of a
particular size:

(a) major cities have an MMM classification of “MMM1”

(b) inner and outer regional suburbs or localities have an MMM
classification of between “MMM2” and “MMM5”, depending on the size of
the local population centre

(c) remote suburbs or localities that are not islands more than 5
kilometres offshore have an MMM classification of “MMM6”

(d) very remote suburbs or localities, and islands more than 5
kilometres offshore and Magnetic Island, have an MMM classification of
“MMM7”

Eligibility

All residential and respite services will receive the aged care
residential care support payment. Lump sum payments will be made from 1
April 2021 with the next claim. The payment is based on:

-   the approved permanent and respite residential care occupancy of
    each service’s February 2021 claim, and
-   their residential support supplement.

Services:

-   must have the February 2021 claim submitted and approved to receive
    the supplement
-   do not need to apply for the supplement. It will automatically occur
    with the next claim submitted from 1 April 2021 providing the
    February 2021 claim has been finalised

The aged care residential care support supplement does not impact a care
recipient’s means assessment and their ability to contribute towards
government funded aged care services.

Payment information

The System for the Payment of Aged Residential Care (SPARC) calculates
the aged care residential support payment. It uses:

-   the residential and respite actual occupied beds for each day in
    February 2021 (advised by the service), multiplied by
-   the residential care support supplement equivalent amount for the
    respective Modified Monash Model Classification

The residential care support supplement is:

MMM1(metro) = $27.25 per day, MMM2(non-metro) to MMM7 = $40.88 per day.

Note: the supplement amount:

-   includes retrospective adjustments made to occupied beds once the
    February 2021 claim has been submitted. This will appear on the next
    payment statement
-   is displayed on the summary page of the payment statement as an
    ‘other adjustment’
-   will have a note recorded in the provider notes section of the
    payment statement to advise what the supplement is for and the total
    amount of the supplement paid to the service
