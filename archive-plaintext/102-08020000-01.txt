This document outlines how to help customers who want to change the sex
and/or gender details on their record.

Helping a customer update their sex and/or gender details

Customers can ask to change their sex and/or gender details on their
record. A person may identify with a gender other than the sex they were
born with, or they may be non-binary.

Customers need to give the agency evidence of changed sex and/or gender
details to be recorded on their record. See the Resources page for links
to the Services Australia website for evidence standards, and for the
Australian Government Guidelines on Recognition of Sex and Gender.

The sex or gender recorded on a customer's birth certificate does not
need to be changed to identify the person's gender for Services
Australia.

A statement from a registered medical practitioner or a registered
psychologist certifying the person's affirmed gender is enough to
establish or update a person's gender classification.

Note: sex reassignment surgery or hormone therapy are not pre-requisites
for the recognition of a change of gender in Australian Government
records.

When helping customers update their gender details, be aware:

-   a person's sex and gender may not be the same
-   of the need to address the customer by their appropriate name and
    title. Staff must avoid misgendering (using incorrect personal
    pronouns) or 'deadnaming' (using previous names) as these actions
    can cause distress and offence to customers
-   payment eligibility may depend on a person's sex, for example Widow
    Allowance

Staff can refer a customer to a social worker if the customer is
distressed or needs extra help.
