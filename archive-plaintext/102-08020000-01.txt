This document outlines how to help customers who want to update the
gender details on their record, or their child’s record.

Note: if Centrelink staff get a call before completing Gender X Training
(POR00546 and POR00547) they must warm transfer the customer to Change
of Gender Enquiry.

Updating gender details - customer

Customers can ask to update gender details on their record. A person may
identify with a gender other than the sex they were born with, or they
may be non-binary.

The sex or gender recorded on a customer's birth certificate does not
need to be changed to identify the person's gender for Services
Australia.

When helping customers update their gender details, be aware:

-   a person's sex and gender may not be the same
-   of the need to address the customer by their appropriate name and
    title. Staff must avoid misgendering (using incorrect personal
    pronouns) or 'deadnaming' (using previous names) as these actions
    can cause distress and offence to customers
-   customers may use a diverse range of pronouns. While pronouns cannot
    be recorded on the system Service Officers should be mindful to use
    appropriate pronouns where the customer makes it known

Staff can refer a customer to a social worker if the customer is
distressed or needs extra help.

Customers must tell each service delivery brand if they want to make
changes to their record. Evidence requirements for updating gender are
different across the agency.

Centrelink may request evidence in circumstances where it is required to
supply verification under an international agreement or for a foreign
pension claim. Staff should refer to International Services (CIS) for
further information.

Updating gender details - child (Centrelink)

There may be cases where the gender of the child was incorrectly
recorded when the child was originally added to the customer’s record.
If it is clear that the gender of the child was coded incorrectly refer
to Change Child (CCH) screen. Staff must transfer all other child gender
enquiries and updates to the appropriate team. Refer to the Process
page.

A principal carer of a child can ask to change the gender details of
children. A child may identify with a gender other than the sex they
were born with, or they may be non-binary.

Note: staff can use the terms carer, primary carer, principal carer,
foster carer or grandparent for the purposes of this Operational
Blueprint. This is in circumstances where the person advising has
parental responsibility for the child.

The sex or gender recorded on a child's birth certificate does not need
to be changed to update the child's gender with Services Australia.

When discussing child gender enquiries with a customer, be aware:

-   a child’s sex and gender may not be the same
-   to address the child’s appropriate name and title. Staff must avoid
    misgendering (using incorrect personal pronouns) or 'deadnaming'
    (using previous names) as these actions can cause distress and
    offence to customers
-   customers may use a diverse range of pronouns. While pronouns cannot
    be recorded on the system Service Officers should be mindful to use
    appropriate pronouns where the customer makes it known
-   a child’s gender details cannot be updated online

Staff can refer a customer to a social worker if the customer is
distressed or needs extra help.
