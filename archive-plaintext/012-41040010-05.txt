Equipment type for updating purposes

Table 2: If the diagnostic imaging or radiation oncology practice
purchases new equipment that is different to what is listed on their
LSPN record, they must notify the agency. This must be done before the
equipment is used to perform Medicare funded services. Equipment must be
listed on the Register on the date of service before it is eligible to
perform Medicare funded services. The agency must be notified within 28
days if the diagnostic imaging or radiation oncology practice removes
any equipment.
