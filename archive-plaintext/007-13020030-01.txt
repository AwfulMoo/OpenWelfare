This document outlines information about the Mutual Customer
Identification (MCI) process when it results in a mismatch from the data
matching procedures carried out between Centrelink and the Australian
Taxation office (ATO) for Family Tax Benefit (FTB) and Child Care
Subsidy (CCS) customers.

MCI mismatches

During the MCI process, a mismatch may result, where a customer and/or
partner could not be identified by the ATO.

Two attempts at matching will be made. Where the first attempt is
unsuccessful, a letter will be sent to the customer requesting their
correct Tax File Number (TFN).

A second mismatch will result in a letter being automatically sent
requesting the customer provide verification of their TFN. If the
customer does not respond to either the first or second mismatch
letters, auto cancellation of FTB and a reduction of CCS to the zero
rate may occur. Payment can only be restored when the TFN is verified.
