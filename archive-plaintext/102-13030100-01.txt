This document provides information about the physical deletion process
for intertwined records. Intertwined records occur when updates or data
of one person are coded on the record of another person. All
intertwined, or suspected intertwined records, must be referred to the
DQU for assessment. It is for Data Quality Unit (DQU) staff only.

The Data Quality Unit (DQU)

Intertwined records are referred to DQU for analysis and correction of
errors.

DQU staff have access to transfer intertwined data using the Physically
Delete Data (PHYDEL) screen. Information that has been transferred is
viewable on the View Physically Deleted Data (VPHYDEL) screen.

Note: this process is known as 'physical deletion' and should not be
confused with 'deletion' of data completed by Information, Communication
and Technology (ICT) teams.

Physical deletion can be applied to the following fields on a customer
record:

-   name
-   date of birth
-   gender
-   address
-   telephone details
-   Tax File Number (TFN)
-   marital status and
-   email address

Internal links can also be deleted for:

-   multiple records (MLC)
-   parental income (PIT)
-   partner (PTR) and
-   child to parent (CHI/PAR)

Intertwined data must be logically deleted first before physical
deletion can occur.

A Display on Access (DOA) DOC is added to each intertwined record. This
displays the DQU intertwined case number, Case Officer and details of
the screens that have had information transferred. The Multiple and
Intertwined Control (!MIC) screen is also coded by DQU staff. This
enables the Multiple and Intertwined Warning (MIW) screen display.

To ensure privacy, details of the intertwined data should not be
released to the customer.

Service Officers who identify a new intertwined record must refer the
case to DQU using the 'Intertwined Referral Form'. A link is available
in the Resources tab.

Resources contains a link to the Intertwined Referral Form.
