This document outlines information relating to customers who are victims
of trauma and/or torture and the communication protocols for Service
Officers.

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)

Refugees, or former refugees may have suffered trauma and/or torture,
witnessed the torture of loved ones, been illegally imprisoned and
experienced extreme trauma as result of being forced to flee their homes
and countries.

For many refugees and special humanitarian entrants, the effects of
trauma and torture are ongoing and may lead to Post Traumatic Stress
Disorder (PTSD). The symptoms associated with PTSD are not always
obvious, or may take years to surface or be diagnosed. Sufferers of PTSD
may experience periods of long-term unemployment, difficulties in
learning English, problems with concentration, depression, alcoholism,
family dysfunction and physical incapacity.

Possible symptoms of PTSD

As a result of their experiences, customers who may have suffered trauma
and/or torture may exhibit the following types of behaviour:

-   an inability to concentrate
-   periods of lethargy and disinterest
-   poor memory, or memory loss
-   flashbacks and panic attacks
-   feelings of anger and hostility
-   feelings of guilt or shame
-   inability to sleep and the effects that sleep deprivation has
-   threats to their own life
-   high levels of anxiety and fear
-   headaches, pain and physical incapacity
-   suspicion or lack of trust
-   grief or concern for family and friends they were forced to leave
    behind

Referrals

Most refugees will be referred automatically for counselling with a
specialist torture and trauma service by their settlement case worker or
support person, so they will not require a referral from Services
Australia.

However, refugees who are sponsored by a family member are sometimes not
referred to counselling as the proposer may be a refugee themselves and
unaware of the services in Australia. Another group that may also need
to be referred are those customers whose symptoms manifest later.

The Resources page contains useful links to information about support
and assistance that can be provided to the survivors of trauma and/or
torture.
