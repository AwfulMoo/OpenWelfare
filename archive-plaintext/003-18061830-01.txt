If a child is in immediate danger or risk of harm you must act, and a
delegate must call 000. If you have concerns about a child’s safety,
conduct the risk and referral process.

This document outlines when and how to refer an individual to a social
worker who is linked to the National Redress Scheme (the Scheme)
administered by the Department of Social Services (DSS).

Social Work Services Offer for the Scheme

Social Work Services will provide support and help to all individuals
contacting about the Scheme when they are experiencing an acute crisis.
Individuals who can be referred to a social worker include:

-   applicants
-   nominees
-   carers
-   family members
-   survivors

A referral for an acute crisis occurs when the individual presents at:

-   imminent risk of suicide, self-harm or risk to others, or
-   immediate and significant risk to the health and wellbeing of
    themselves or another person

Social workers will:

-   provide immediate support and crisis intervention
-   liaise with and provide referrals to appropriate support services
    including Redress Support Services

The Resources page has a link to the National Redress Scheme website,
which lists these services.

Social workers do not:

-   assess eligibility for the Scheme
-   provide advocacy or information about applications, or
-   help individuals complete applications

Note: refer individuals to the National Redress Scheme if they need
advice about eligibility or their application.

The Resources page has links to the Services Australia Workspace Quick
Reference Guide and information about threats of suicide and/or to harm
others. It also has a link to the National Redress Scheme, the Release
of Information form and useful contact information.
