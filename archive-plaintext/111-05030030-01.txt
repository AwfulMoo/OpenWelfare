This document outlines information on appropriate reasons for
transferring calls, or referring them using Online Document Recording
(ODR), to a specialist officer or to a manager.

Answer calls and resolve issues at first contact

Whenever possible, enquiries should be answered and issues resolved at
first contact. If a call cannot be completed it may be necessary to
transfer or refer it elsewhere.

General principles

Observe the following principles:

-   if a call is not urgent or the customer does not insist on having
    their call transferred, use ODR to refer the call to an off-site
    specialist officer
-   callers seeking a Services Australia speaker on behalf of a
    community group are transferred to the relevant specialist officer
    group or, if the request is for a general speaker, to the manager of
    the relevant service centre
-   if an answering machine is used, the customer should be given a
    choice of leaving their own message, having the Smart Centre staff
    member leave a message, being transferred to another number in the
    same section/unit, or being referred for a callback
