Assess MRI provider eligibility in Provider Directory System (PDS)

Table 9: this table describes how to check a provider’s details
(location and speciality codes) in PDS prior to linking the MRI provider
to an LSPN. This will enable MRI services to be provided at the same
location as the eligible MRI. Service Officers will need to use this
process to assess whether the provider can be added to the LSPN.

Unlink provider on LSPN Register from PDS Provider location to enable address update

Table 13: this table describes how to unlink a provider in the LSPN
Register to the provider’s location record in PDS. This applies if the
provider location has been linked and is locked and needs to be updated.
Note: if the provider location and LSPN location are an exact address
match, PDS will lock the provider location address so that it cannot be
amended.
