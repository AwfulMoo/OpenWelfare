For Tier 3 staff only.

This document outlines how to create an Unverified IHI in the HI Service
and is a Tier 3 procedure only. All enquiries and processing
requirements must be transferred to Tier 3.

Create an Unverified IHI

An Unverified IHI:

is an IHI where the identity of the individual has not been verified
through the established evidence of identity process

can only be created after a search of the HI Service ensures no previous
record exists for the individual

cannot be created with exactly the same details as another unverified or
verified IHI. The below fields are used in the duplicate matching
process:

-   Family Name (Preferred Name)
-   Given Name (Preferred Name)
-   Sex
-   Date of Birth
-   Address

Unverified IHI - features and restrictions

An Unverified IHI:

-   cannot have a consumer online account associated with the individual
-   is cross checked against Fact of Death Data
-   can be created containing a date of death (the IHI status
    automatically sets to deceased)
-   automatically expires when the individual reaches 130 years of age
-   an expired unverified IHI cannot be reinstated
-   is unable to have an associated My Health Record created
