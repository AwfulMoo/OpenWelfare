This document contains information regarding the scrutiny and
registration of overseas maintenance liabilities.

Overview of overseas maintenance registration

This is the process used when an application to register an overseas
maintenance liability, not already registered by Child Support, is made
by:

-   an overseas authority
-   a parent or non-parent carer
-   a child who is entitled to receive child support, or
-   a person who is entitled to receive or liable to pay spousal
    maintenance

Registering an overseas maintenance liability may be necessary so Child
Support can give effect to international agreements and arrangements
relating to maintenance obligations.

A registrable overseas maintenance liability arises from:

-   a maintenance order made by a judicial authority of a reciprocating
    jurisdiction
-   a maintenance agreement registered by a judicial or administrative
    authority of a reciprocating jurisdiction
-   a maintenance assessment issued by an administrative authority of a
    reciprocating jurisdiction
-   arrears in relation to any of the above liabilities
-   an agency reimbursement liability (the overseas authority seeks
    reimbursement from the payer because they paid an amount to the
    payee)

This process excludes maintenance liabilities made in New Zealand and
variations to overseas liabilities already registered. For the
registration of:

-   administrative assessments and maintenance orders from New Zealand,
    see New Zealand 'In' case management - Registrations between NZIR
    and Child Support
-   an order, agreement or assessment that varies a maintenance
    liability already registered by Child Support, see Variations to
    registered overseas maintenance liabilities (excluding New Zealand)

Applying for an Australian child support assessment instead of seeking registration of overseas liability

-   An application for an Australian child support assessment can be
    made as an alternative to seeking registration of an overseas child
    maintenance liability if all other eligibility requirements are met
-   If the payee is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction, their
    application for assessment must be made via their relevant overseas
    authority

See Applications for a child support assessment.

Enforcement orders

-   An overseas enforcement order is not an overseas maintenance
    liability and cannot be registered
-   Enforcement orders are made by some overseas courts to enable
    enforcement of an Australian assessment if voluntary payments are
    not made
-   They deal with the manner in which the Australian assessment is
    collected. They do not create a new liability

Periodic and non-periodic amounts

To be registrable, an overseas maintenance order, agreement or
assessment must require a person to pay:

-   a periodic amount (or arrears of a periodic amount) for the
    maintenance of their child or step-child, or
-   a periodic amount (or arrears of a periodic amount) of spousal
    maintenance

A payee of an overseas maintenance liability, that has a non-registrable
amount can apply for the non-periodic amounts to be entered into the
Child Support Register. This includes:

-   lump sum spousal or child maintenance orders, and
-   non-periodic maintenance liabilities such as insurance, dental costs
    etc.

When non-periodic liabilities are entered into the Register, they become
a debt due to the payee, not the Commonwealth. The payee can:

-   start their own enforcement proceedings in court, or
-   ask the Attorney-General's Department to initiate court proceedings
    on their behalf

Provisional overseas orders

A provisional maintenance order made in a court of a reciprocating
jurisdiction cannot be registered until it is confirmed in an Australian
court. However, a provisional order cannot be confirmed in an Australian
court if an application for an Australian administrative child support
assessment can be made.

Child Support will refer a copy of the provisional order to the
Attorney-General’s Department (AGD) if:

-   a provisional order is received, and
-   an application for a child support assessment cannot be made. For
    example, when the child is over 18 years of age

The AGD is responsible for making an application to an Australian court
to have the provisional order confirmed. See Referring overseas
maintenance and paternity matters to the Attorney-General’s Department.

Decision timeframe

Child Support must make a decision to accept or refuse an application
for child support within 28 days. Where the payee or payer is a resident
of a reciprocating jurisdiction, Child Support must accept or refuse the
application for registration within 90 days of receiving it.

Staff may also need to apply the following processes:

-   Residency decisions for Child Support Customers
-   Applications for a child support assessment
-   Central Authority Address Listing for International customers
-   Referring overseas maintenance and paternity matters to the Attorney
    General’s Department

Staff are to follow the process in Customer location (tracing) when they
need to locate the current address and contact details or customers in
Australia and overseas.
