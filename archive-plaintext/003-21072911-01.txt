This document explains the process to follow when a customer was
incorrectly paid or was not eligible for a COVID-19 Disaster Payment due
to the incorrect workflow being used by staff. It also explains the
process for staff when they are allocated a manual follow up (MFU) as a
payment has been returned because of incorrect bank details.

Do not follow this process if a customer's payment rate needs to change
following an explanation of a decision (review) process.
