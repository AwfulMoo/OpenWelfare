This document outlines information on calculating a debt affected by an
International Agreement.

Rate of Australian pension

A customer's rate of Australian pension may be affected when they are:

-   paid under an International Agreement, or
-   living in an Agreement Country

The rate calculated for Agreement customers can be more complex than
under normal rules. This procedure helps International Services (CIS)
staff manually calculate debts that occur before 1 July 2002.

Change in circumstances

A debt can occur when a customer advises of a change in circumstances
outside the notification period. In most cases, these debts are
calculated automatically. However, there are times when the automatic
calculations will be incorrect. There are a number of calculators
available to help assess debts. These tools do not cater for the effect
of an Agreement on a customer's rate.

Verification of qualification and payability

Service Officers raising debts must:

-   verify both qualification and payability
-   apply legislation
-   understand the rate calculations, including the impact of the
    International Agreement

The Resources page contains a link to the Intranet A-Z index for access
to calculators and tools. It also contains information about other tools
available to CIS staff.
