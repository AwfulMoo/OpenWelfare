This document outlines how to process a Low Income Health Care Card
(LIC) claim in Process Direct and Customer First, including online
claims, assisted customer claims and paper claims.

Claim submission exemptions for vulnerable customers

Customers in vulnerable circumstances who have a genuine difficulty
providing documents with the claim can lodge a claim and provide the
documents later.

The actual claim date will be the lodgement date and the deemed claim
date (under sections 13 and 14 of the Social Security (Administration)
Act 1999) will be the contact date where applicable.

Examples of vulnerable circumstances include (but are not limited to)
where the customer is:

-   in a crisis situations and is unable to fully complete a claim due
    to being homeless
-   affected by a major disaster
-   impacted by family and domestic violence
-   a recent humanitarian entrant
-   recently released from prison or psychiatric confinement
-   a young person who is unable to live at home (ongoing situation)

Straight through processing

Straight through processing is where a claim for a social security
payment or service is assessed using criteria to identify if it is
suitable for an automated grant outcome.

The system may process LIC claims automatically if they meet certain
criteria.

If a claim meets the criteria for an automated assessment, DOCs or
Display Notes on the customer's record will show that ROXY has created
these.

Customer contact

If a customer asks for an explanation or applies for a formal review of
the decision, the Service Officer must enter their own logon as the
Decision Maker and the customer's local service centre when running the
script.

If the claim was incorrectly granted, give feedback via ROXY.

The Resources page has an example of backdating provisions, contact
details, the Details of your child's care arrangements form (FA012) and
the Services Australia website.
