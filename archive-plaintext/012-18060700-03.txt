Removing 3GA placement from a medical practitioner’s provider number location for 19AA only medical practitioners

Table 3

Note: where a removal request lists a specific location/s to be removed,
Service Officers should only remove the 3GA placement from this
location - any other placements should remain as is. A request to close
a location does not remove a 3GA placement from that location.
