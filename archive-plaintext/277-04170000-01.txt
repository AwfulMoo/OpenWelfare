This document outlines the processing of employer withholding
reconciliation and top up.

Reconciliation and top up

Where a payer is linked to an employer for Employer Withholding (EW),
the employer is required to:

-   deduct a fixed amount of child support from the payer’s salary each
    payday
-   remit all money deducted by the 7th of each following month to Child
    Support
-   notify Child Support of the amounts deducted for each employee

EW reconciliation is the process where Child Support compares the actual
deduction received from the employer with the expected employer
deductions each month. See Employer Withholding (linking) for Child
Support customers.

Cuba will:

-   automatically reconcile employer accounts except where the payments
    received do not match the expected deduction amounts in Cuba
-   not auto reconcile when amounts received do not match the expected
    amounts or outstanding issues exist on Cuba for example, employer
    debt

Parts of the reconciliation process may need manual completion by an
Employer Services Officer (ESO), which may include manual reconciliation
of payments or the application of top up.
