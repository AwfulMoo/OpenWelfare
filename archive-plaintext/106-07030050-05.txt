Example - reusing claim information

Bob is 24 years old and has submitted a claim for Youth Allowance (YA)
online on 24 January. Bob is turning 25 years old on 26 January and will
be starting full time study on 2 February.

When the Service Officer assesses the claim they realise Bob should have
lodged a claim for Austudy (AUS). The Service Officer can change the
benefit type of the claim from YA to AUS by selecting [More Options] >
Change Benefit in Process Direct.

If the claim was rejected, this action can be completed once the claim
has been re-indexed.

Bob does not need to complete a new claim (paper or online) as the
information already supplied is enough for the Austudy claim. The
Service Officer should check what other information Bob was asked to
provide for the online claim, as it may no longer be required.
