This document outlines when it may be beneficial for a family to claim
Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) for a student rather than for the
student to continue receiving another payment.

Means testing

Most AIC allowances are non-means tested. Only the AIC Additional
Boarding Allowance is subject to the Parental Means Test. A student
transferring from ABSTUDY or Youth Allowance may still be eligible for
the Basic Boarding Allowance if the Parental Means test prevents them
from receiving the Additional Boarding Allowance.

The parent/guardian may also be eligible for Family Tax Benefit for
student in addition to AIC.

AIC claims

AIC claims and forms are processed by AIC Smart Centre staff. If a
student wishes to transfer from another payment to AIC, the
parent/guardian will need to complete a Claim for Assistance for
Isolated Children (AIC) (SY040). Claims should be lodged with the
required supporting documentation as listed in the Notes section of the
SY040 as soon as possible and by the closing date.

The form can be forwarded directly to the AIC Smart Centre as advised on
the SY040 or lodged at any Service Centre.

Note: there is no Identity Confirmation requirement for AIC.
