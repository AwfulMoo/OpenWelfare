This document outlines the digitisation of Medicare information to align
with Services Australia's Reducing Paper Initiative (RPI). Digitised
information includes incoming customer and third party paper forms,
letters and other correspondence.

Digitisation

Digitising Medicare documentation is part of the RPI which aims to
dramatically reduce the agency's dependency on the use of paper forms
and correspondence.

Documentation is digitised at the point of receipt, or as close as
possible to it. Most documents are scanned where they are received. This
may include at the agency’s scanning provider, smart centres and service
centres.

Allocation

Processing and National Demand Allocation (PaNDA) is a workload
management tool that can access digitised Medicare work items in FileNet
(the agency’s archiving system).

Work types are associated to skill tags. Staff member acquired skill
tag/s are recorded in ESSentials. PaNDA will match work items
(categorised by work type) to the skill tag of the user.
