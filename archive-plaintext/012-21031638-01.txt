This document outlines AHECS Medical Indemnity (MI) information about
eligibility, applications and payments.

Purpose of AHECS

The AHECS is a fully funded scheme of the Australian Government to cover
allied health professionals for 100% of the cost of claims that exceed
the limit of their MI contracts of insurance, providing the contract
limit satisfies the threshold. This ensures that health professionals
are not personally liable for these claims. It covers incidents that
occurred on or after 1 July 2020.

A claim can be for a single incident or for a series of related
incidents and can be made up of both paid and unpaid liabilities under
the claim.

The AHECS is detailed in Part 2 Division 2D and Division 3 section 37A
of the Medical Indemnity Act 2002 (the Act) and in Part 2 Division 6 of
the Medical Indemnity Rules 2020.

Difference from the Allied Health High Cost Claim Indemnity Scheme (AHHCCS)

The main differences between AHECS and AHHCCS are that:

-   the AHECS allows for payments directly to practitioners, whereas the
    AHHCCS assists eligible Medical Indemnity Insurers (MII) with the
    cost of claims they manage
-   for AHECS there are requirements for a legal practitioner to assess
    the reasonableness of a settlement amount
