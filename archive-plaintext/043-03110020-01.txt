This document outlines information about the documents required to
assess the income and assets from a sole trader business for services
from Services Australia.

On this Page:

Financial documents

All necessary financial documents should be requested by Service
Officers and forms issued at first contact with a customer. The Service
Officer should explain why these documents are required.

Documents that may be required

The following documents may be required:

Business Details (MOD F)

MOD F is a Services Australia form to be completed by the customer,
which:

-   enables identification of the type of business the customer is
    involved in
-   assists in determining eligibility for activity tested payments and
    payments with mutual obligation requirements
-   advises whether the business is continuing to operate

Real Estate Details (MOD R) and local council rates notice for each
property owned by the sole trader

MOD R is a Services Australia form which asks questions relating to the
type, ownership and value of real estate assets. The rates notice has
the relevant details of the property identification, for example, Lot
and DP numbers required for a valuation. Note: if the property is larger
than 2 hectares a rural property questionnaire needs to be completed for
additional information

The MOD R is required to:

-   gather information necessary for the assessment of the value of a
    property
-   show if any income is derived from the property (that is, is it
    rented)

Profit and loss statement

Balance sheet

Depreciation schedule

Livestock Trading Account

Income tax returns (ITRs) and the taxation notice of assessment (NOA)

Documents in respect to mortgages and loans

-   Documentation verifying mortgages and loans may be required to
    confirm the liabilities of the sole trader. These documents should
    show what security is provided for business loans and allows
    assessment of what liabilities can be deducted from the assets of
    the business when calculating the value of the business.

Any Notes to the Accounts

-   Any Notes to the Accounts, if prepared, or any other financial
    statements prepared need to be provided. These are used to add extra
    information or to explain a particular item on the financial
    statements. The additional information provided will give a better
    understanding of the business and will assist in the asset and
    income determination of the sole trader

When documents are not required

Not all documents are required in all cases, for example:

If a customer advises of the commencement of a business, it is important
to take into account the nature of the business and the likely impact
under the Income and Assets Tests

A balance sheet is not always prepared by accountants for small business
enterprises conducted by a sole trader. Some factors to take into
account are:

-   If a customer advises they have a small service type enterprise (for
    example, gardening, cleaning, home maintenance) conducted as a sole
    trader, they may not prepare a balance sheet
-   Where no balance sheet is prepared, the customer should provide a
    list of the type and value of the assets and the type and balance of
    the liabilities of the business
-   The customer should also be advised to notify immediately if the
    financial position of the business changes

Not all businesses, particularly those conducting a service type
enterprise, will claim a depreciation expense. A depreciation schedule
will not be prepared unless depreciation is claimed as an expense

Not all businesses will prepare a separate profit and loss statement, it
may be incorporated into the customer's personal income tax return on
the Business and Professional Items Schedule

Rural properties and sole trader businesses

If the customer has a rural property, Service Officer should issue a
Rural property questionnaire (Q454) letter for completion.

Assessments of sole trader businesses are done by a Service Officer in a
service centre or referred to a Complex Assessment Officer (CAO).
