This document outlines information about the Profiling CSO Identified
Circumstances (PQCIC) screen. The PQCIC screen allows the Service
Officer to record the reason why the Service Officer believes the
customer is at risk of failing to achieve desired program outcomes and
is used in the predicting process of Service Profiling. The information
recorded creates a 'CSO Identified Circumstances Predicator' that is
mapped to the relevant profile.

Profiles

Customers are placed in profiles, based on the predictors that exist on
the customer's record. This is information that may already exist on a
customer's record, for example:

-   the length of time on payment
-   address history
-   any overpayments
-   relationship status
-   children in care, etc.

Service Profiling automates the process of going through a customer's
record to identify this information.

After recording a Service Officer identified circumstance on a
customer's record, a Service Update may not always appear as Service
Profiling considers all of the information on a customer's record. This
includes any previous Service Updates and the date it was completed.
