Non-Medicare claiming documents submitted using digital self service channels

Occasionally customers will submit non–claims-related documents via the
Medicare online account (MOA) for processing. Note: do not process
documents for anyone other than the MOA account holder. If such
documents are received, contact the MOA account holder and tell them the
documents have to be lodged by the person themselves.

Table 1: this table explains what to do if a non-claimable or random
document is received.

Examples of amendments when processing claims with a minor discrepancy

Acceptable

The following are examples of minor discrepancies between the claim
details in Mainframe and the evidence in FileNet where Service Officers
can correct the error and pay the claim:

-   Charge is displayed as $3.75 instead of $37.50
-   The date of service is 21/01/17 instead of 2/11/17
-   The provider number is 12354AB instead of 12345AB
-   Payee and servicing provider details or servicing and referring
    provider details have been transposed
-   Referring information not submitted
-   PayP line not entered
-   Additional lines can only be keyed when the service/s claimed are
    for the same provider
-   Additional items on invoice/receipt need to be added to the claim
-   Realignment of items numbers to allow for payment, that is
    Anaesthetic accounts
-   Assistant Surgeon items submitted on Surgeons invoice
-   Notional Charge invoices, where grouping of items for assessment is
    required
-   Amendment of out-patient invoices to in-patient
-   Invoices where the charge for an item or notional charge is
    $10,000.00 or greater and the claimant has entered a different
    amount (see Processing issues for claims submitted using digital
    self service channels table)
-   The in hospital indicator on the invoice is different to the claim
-   The date of service can be changed if the customer has picked an
    incorrect date that is displayed in the supporting information

Not acceptable

The below are examples of discrepancies between the claim details in
Mainframe and the evidence in FileNet where Service Officers should not
correct the error and should reject the claim with the relevant reason
code:

-   An entirely different charge is keyed, for example $100 instead of
    $64.75, unless the item or notional charge on the invoice or receipt
    is $10,000.00 or greater, see Processing issues for claims submitted
    using digital self service channels table
-   An entirely different date of service has been keyed, for example
    21/12/17 instead of 30/04/18
-   An entirely different provider number to any listed on the invoice
    has been keyed, for example 987654ZY instead of 12345AB
-   An entirely different patient, for example a newborn that is not yet
    enrolled on the Medicare card
-   If customer’s claim states that the service has been paid but the
    uploaded image indicates that claim has not been paid or fails to
    confirm payment has been made (or vice versa), the Service Officer
    is to reject every service in claim with reason code 455
