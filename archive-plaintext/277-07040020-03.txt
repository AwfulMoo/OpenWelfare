|                                   | Generally, the ATI is the         |
|                                   | customer's gross income less      |
|                                   | allowable deductions. For         |
|                                   | example, not all countries allow  |

|                                   | investments. Before determining a |
|                                   | parent's ATI, check the Residency |
|                                   | window to ensure the residency of |

|                                   | confirm with the customer if the  |
