This document outlines how to recover various types of debts and how to
recover debts from customers who have moved overseas.

Debt recovery agreements

Services Australia and DVA have a debt recovery agreement in place. A
link between the 2 agencies:

-   identifies mutual customers
-   shares debt balances, and
-   recovery details

If a Services Australia customer with a debt is receiving payments from
DVA, it is possible to arrange for DVA to recover the debt from DVA
payments. The repayments automatically update via an overnight data
exchange.

There are also options available for customers residing overseas to
repay their debts. These include BPAY and maintaining repayment
arrangements through Australia Post's POST Billpay.
