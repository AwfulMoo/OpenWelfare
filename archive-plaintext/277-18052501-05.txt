levels from 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2018 (3 March 2011 to 14 May 2019).

Authorisations and delegations

APS 3 or above

An APS 3 or above is authorised to:

-   determine a care percentage where a parent has had, or is likely to
    have, no pattern of care for a child (0% care) (s49)
-   determine a care percentage where a parent has had or is likely to
    have a pattern of care for a child (more than 0% care) (s50)
-   revoke an existing care percentage determination where a new care
    percentage determination under s49 or s50 would affect the cost
    percentage (s54F)
-   revoke an existing percentage care determination where a new care
    percentage determination under s49 or s50 does not affect the cost
    percentage but would affect the care percentage (s54H)

except where:

-   the care percentage is to be determined for a period where one
    parent unexpectedly gains 100% care of the child for a specific
    period (one-off block of 100% care)
-   determine a care percentage where the care percentage is worked out
    other than on the basis of the number of nights a child is in the
    care of a person during a care period (hours in care)

APS 4 or above

An APS 4 or above is authorised to:

-   make any of the decisions authorised at the APS 3 level
-   determine a care percentage for a period where a parent unexpectedly
    gains 100% care of the child for a specific period (one-off block of
    100% care)
-   make a decision that the care that is actually occurring for a child
    does not comply with an existing care arrangement that is in force
    for that child and the person who has reduced care of the child has
    taken reasonable action to ensure that the care arrangement is
    complied with (s51)
-   revoke an existing care determination where a person was previously
    determined under s50 to have at least regular care of a child and,
    despite the child being made available, the person has had no care
    or a pattern of care that is less than regular care (s54G)

Note: most revocation decisions where care falls below regular care will
actually be made under section s54F.

except where:

-   the care that is actually occurring for a child does not comply with
    an existing care arrangement that is in force for that child, and
    the parent who has reduced care of the child is seeking a new care
    arrangement that provides more care than the person is actually
    having but less than the care provided by the existing care
    arrangement, and special circumstances exist (s52)
-   determine a care percentage where the care percentage is worked out
    other than on the basis of the number of nights a child is in the
    care of a person during a care period (daytime care)

APS 5 or above

An APS 5 or above is authorised to:

-   make any of the decisions authorised at the APS 3 and APS 4 levels
-   make a decision that the care that is actually occurring for a child
    does not comply with an existing care arrangement that is in force
    for that child, and the person who has reduced care of the child is
    seeking a new care arrangement that provides more care than the
    person is actually having but less than the care provided by the
    existing care arrangement and special circumstances exist (s52)
-   determine an interim care period where the care period is between 14
    and 26 weeks (i.e. special circumstances apply) (s54C(4))
-   make a decision that a section 51 or 52 determination can be made
    despite the change of care day occurring more than 14 weeks ago, due
    to special circumstances. (i.e. extend the notification period up to
    26 weeks in special circumstances)
-   determine a care percentage where the care percentage is worked out
    other than on the basis of the number of nights a child is in the
    care of a person during a care period (hours in daytime care)

Note: sections 54F, 54G, and 54H apply only where a new determination of
a responsible person’s care percentage has been made under sections 49
and 50. The decision maker must be authorised under sections 49 and 50
to make a new care determination even where the authorisation to revoke
the existing care determination is at a lower level.

An officer at a lower level may still carry out the preliminary steps in
making care decisions with the support of their team leader, as long as
an officer with the appropriate level of authority makes the final
decision.
