This document outlines the application of the Income Test for single
allowance customers.

Effect of Income Test

The personal Income Test for JobSeeker Payment (JSP) and Youth Allowance
(YA) (job seeker) customers is designed so it does not affect a
customer's payment if their total ordinary income in the fortnight is
below $150.

However, total ordinary income above $150 a fortnight will reduce the
customer's payment by:

-   50 cents for each $1 of income between $150 and $256 a fortnight, or
    between $150 and $250 for YA (job seeker) a fortnight, and
-   60 cents for each $1 of income above $256/$250 a fortnight

Note: for single principal carers receiving JSP, their payment reduces
by 40 cents for each $1 above $150.

These amounts apply from 1 April 2021.

Application of the Income Test

The Income Test has different applications for the following customers:

-   single customers
-   partnered customers
-   partnered customers where the partner is receiving a social security
    pension or social security benefit

Working Credit

Customers may have accrued a Working Credit which can reduce the effect
of income on their rate of payment during periods of employment.

National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS)

NDIS funds received from the National Disability Insurance Agency
(NDIA), whether received periodically or as a lump sum, including
interest accrued, which are deposited into an account specifically for
the purpose of managing the customer's NDIS plan, are exempt from the
Income and Assets Test and deeming. They are not required to be reported
or if reported should not be taken into account in the income and asset
assessment.

Payments from New Zealand

If a person receives any New Zealand Superannuation (NZS), Veterans
Pension (NZVP) or Invalids Benefit (NZIB), their payments will be
calculated differently. The combined amount of Australian and New
Zealand (NZ) payments will be comparable to the amount the person would
have received if the person did not receive any NZ payment.
