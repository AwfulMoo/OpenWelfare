|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | To consider the objection, it is  |
|                                   | important to understand the       |
|                                   | customer’s concerns. If the       |
|                                   | customer’s grounds are unclear,   |
|                                   | contact the customer to clarify   |
|                                   | their reasons for wanting the     |
|                                   | original decision reviewed. See   |
|                                   | Contact with Child Support        |
|                                   | customers.                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | An objection decision must still  |
|                                   | be made if the customer does not  |
|                                   | provide grounds for their         |
|                                   | objection or if further           |
|                                   | information cannot be obtained.   |

|                                   | disallowed + Read more            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Where there is no reasonable      |
|                                   | basis to conclude that the        |
|                                   | original decision may be wrong,   |
|                                   | contact the customer to manage    |
|                                   | their expectations and to seek    |
|                                   | further information about the     |
|                                   | reasons for their objection.      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This approach should only be      |
|                                   | taken where the original decision |
|                                   | does not involve the application  |
|                                   | of discretion and there is no     |
|                                   | reason to doubt the facts upon    |
|                                   | which the decision was made. For  |
|                                   | example, where a customer objects |
