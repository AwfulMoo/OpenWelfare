This document outlines the process for identifying and actioning
obsolete Child Support entries.

Obsolete Child Support entries

Where the Child Support Registrar is satisfied that an entry in relation
to an enforceable maintenance liability is obsolete, the entry can be
deleted from the Child Support Register in accordance with section 41 of
the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988. In practical
terms, this means deleting a case from the Register and removing the
debt.

The decision that an entry is obsolete can only be made in limited
circumstances for some:

-   overseas maintenance liabilities, and
-   cases where the payer is deceased

Only a case registered for collection by Child Support can be deemed
obsolete and such a decision must not be made unless all available
collection avenues have been exhausted and there is no prospect of
collecting outstanding child support.
