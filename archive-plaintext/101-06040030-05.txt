|                                   | Therefore, Jeff's claim for LIC   |
|                                   | lodged on 2 November 2020 would   |
|                                   | be rejected income/compensation.  |

|                                   | Jeff would not be eligible for a  |
|                                   | LIC until 7 weeks after 2 October |
|                                   | 2020 that is, Jeff would be       |

|                                   | and this would be dependent on    |
|                                   | any 'other income' to be          |
|                                   | considered i.e. bank interest,    |
