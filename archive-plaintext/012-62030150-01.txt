This document outlines information about Special Medicare numbers for
pharmacists.

Special Medicare numbers

There are 6 special numbers available for pharmacists to use in their
Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) claim, in certain circumstances
where eligible people are unable to produce a card or number, for
example, emergency situations.

These special numbers are listed on the Medicare and PBS patient
databases to enable payment of a pharmacist's PBS claim. They must not
appear on a patient refund receipt and never be accepted by patient
refund processing as a valid Medicare number.

Special numbers cannot be used to process an authority approval via
mainframe.

Under National Health Act 1953, an approved pharmacist, approved medical
practitioner (dispensing doctor) or hospital pharmacy may request
Special Medicare numbers except 25437766611. A doctor may request
25437766611 to obtain an authority approval via the PBS Authorities
system.

The Resources page contains explanations of Special Medicare numbers and
which numbers to use to obtain an authority approval via the Online PBS
Authorities system.
