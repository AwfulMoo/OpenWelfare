|                                   | FTB is calculated as an annual    |
|                                   | rate based on the family's        |
|                                   | circumstances during the          |
|                                   | financial year.                   |

|                                   | The daily rate of FTB is          |
|                                   | calculated by dividing the annual |
|                                   | FTB rate by 365 and rounding to   |
|                                   | the nearest cent (rounding 0.5    |
|                                   | cents upwards). If the result is  |
|                                   | less than half a cent, it is      |
|                                   | rounded up to 1 cent.             |

|                                   | The fortnightly rate is obtained  |
|                                   | by multiplying the daily rate by  |
|                                   | 14.                               |

|                                   | If the Energy Supplement Part A   |
|                                   | or the Energy Supplement Part B   |
|                                   | are paid quarterly, the daily     |
|                                   | rate is paid for each day in the  |
|                                   | quarter that the Energy           |
|                                   | Supplement is payable.            |
