Government intent

Services Australia has an obligation to ensure customers are paid
correctly. This requirement is in accordance with the Bilateral
Management Arrangements (BMAs) between the agency and individual
departments. In order to satisfy this requirement, the agency undertakes
Service Updates and periodic reviews of customer's circumstances and
entitlement.

Reviews and Service Updates

Depending on the customer's circumstances, the reviews and Service
Updates may include:

-   the targeting of services based on the customer's needs
-   one-off assessment of entitlement for a change in circumstances or
    at the end of a student's course
-   a quarterly review of the customer's home circumstances
-   an end of year process to verify entitlement for dependent customers
    for the current year and to determine payability for the following
    year

Note: the reviews discussed here are not reviews of decisions associated
with appeals which are dealt with separately.

Notification obligations

Customers have an obligation to notify Services Australia of any changes
in their circumstances (generally within 14 days), and the department
must reassess these changes accurately and in a timely manner to ensure
the customer is correctly paid.
