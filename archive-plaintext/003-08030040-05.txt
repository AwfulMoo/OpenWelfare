|                                   | would place the customer into     |

|                                   | for deeming funds as 'committed'  |
|                                   | and the excluded amount.          |

|                                   | The customer has made it clear    |
|                                   | they intend to use $2,000 of      |
|                                   | their $6,000 to pay their rent    |
|                                   | arrears and avoid possible        |
|                                   | eviction.                         |

|                                   | It would be acceptable to deem    |
|                                   | the rental arrears of $2,000 as   |
|                                   | ‘committed’ funds and exclude     |
|                                   | them from the long-term available |

|                                   | A customer has $6,000 in          |
|                                   | available or liquid funds at the  |
|                                   | date of claim or review but then  |
|                                   | used $2,000 of those funds to pay |
|                                   | off the balance of a credit card. |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | However, if the customer met      |
|                                   | minimum repayments of $80 per     |
|                                   | month, this would not have placed |
|                                   | them in any immediate further     |
|                                   | hardship.                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | So it is reasonable to consider   |
|                                   | just $80 as ‘committed’. The      |
|                                   | remaining $1,920 should still be  |
|                                   | included in the calculation of    |
|                                   | liquid funds.                     |

|                                   | was an arrears payment of income  |
|                                   | support to one member of the      |
|                                   | couple.                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | However, it was recently          |
|                                   | determined that they were not     |
|                                   | entitled to the arrears and they  |
|                                   | should not have been paid. They   |
|                                   | have been informed that a debt    |
|                                   | will be raised for the $10,000.   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | At the time of assessment, there  |
|                                   | is a debt for $10,000 on the      |
|                                   | customer’s record but it is yet   |
|                                   | to be determined. The customer    |
|                                   | states they were advised to       |
|                                   | retain the $10,000 so they could  |
|                                   | repay the debt in full as soon as |
|                                   | it was determined.                |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Therefore, it would be reasonable |
|                                   | to deem $10,000 of the couple’s   |
|                                   | $11,000 in liquid funds as        |
|                                   | ‘committed’ to repaying the debt. |
|                                   | Failure to repay the debt could   |
|                                   | place the customer or couple in   |
|                                   | hardship, e.g. in terms of        |
|                                   | eligibility for an advance.       |
