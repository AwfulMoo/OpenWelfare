|                                   | studying a school-based           |
|                                   | apprenticeship in plumbing. He is |
|                                   | not entitled to any income        |
|                                   | support payments. Wednesday and   |
|                                   | Friday are spent on secondary     |

|                                   | studies, he is regarded a         |
|                                   | secondary student and therefore   |
|                                   | not entitled to a LIC. If his     |
|                                   | parents have a Health Care Card,  |
