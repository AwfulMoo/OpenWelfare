Examples of vulnerable circumstances

Table 1:
Note: if the customer has a pre-claim circumstance displayed on PRECLM
with a start date that is more than 8 weeks ago, consider if the
pre-claim vulnerable circumstance still exists.

Where the vulnerable circumstance is no longer active, consider end
dating the vulnerable circumstance from the PRECLM screen and regenerate
the claim. Annotate the POC DOC with the reason for end dating the
pre-claim vulnerable circumstance/s.

Some circumstances can remain current on a customer's record
indefinitely, such as:

-   an exemption from seeking child support due to family and domestic
    violence

In these cases, do not end date the exemption. Manually update the claim
start date to the date of submission if required.

Determining the 14 day period to submit a claim

Customers have a 14 day period in which to submit their claim after
contacting Services Australia, (the 14 day period can be extended in
some circumstances but no more than 13 weeks).

The 14 day period generally begins the day after the customer contacts
Services Australia. For example, if a customer contacts on Tuesday 4
January, the 14 day period starts from Wednesday 5 January and includes
Tuesday 18 January.

The last day in which a customer has to submit a claim (within the 14
days) is usually the same day of the week as the day they registered
their intention to claim (or the day the 14 day period was re-started).

However, if the customer's 14 day period ends on a weekend or a public
holiday, they can lodge their claim on the next working day. For
example, if a customer contacts on Saturday 7 May, they will be required
to lodge the claim by Monday 23 May. Similarly if a customer contacts on
Tuesday 12 January, they will be required to lodge the claim by
Wednesday 27 January (26 January being Australia Day).
