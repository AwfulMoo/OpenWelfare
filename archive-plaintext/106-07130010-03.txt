|                                   |     a claimant will be required   |
|                                   |     to supply additional          |
|                                   |     information before an ABSTUDY |
|                                   |     claim can be determined.      |
|                                   |     Under the ABSTUDY Policy      |
|                                   |     Manual, there is no closing   |
|                                   |     date for the provision of     |
|                                   |     additional information        |
|                                   |     relating to a claim, and      |
|                                   |     accordingly, no restriction   |
|                                   |     on back payment of            |
|                                   |     entitlements, provided that   |
|                                   |     the original claim was lodged |
|                                   |     prior to the specified        |
|                                   |     closing dates. Where a        |
|                                   |     claimant does not provide the |
|                                   |     required information within a |
|                                   |     specified time, the claim may |
|                                   |     be rejected. However, the     |
|                                   |     rejection of the claim is     |
|                                   |     simply an administrative      |
|                                   |     measure to manage workload.   |
|                                   |     There is no impact on later   |
|                                   |     assessment and grant of the   |
|                                   |     original claim once the       |
|                                   |     required information is       |
|                                   |     provided. If the claimant     |
|                                   |     subsequently supplies the     |
|                                   |     requested information, the    |
|                                   |     original claim should be      |
|                                   |     reinstated. The source        |

|                                   | Allowance is not payable due to   |

|                                   | test limits. These claims should  |
|                                   | be finalised. The recipient's     |

|                                   | rate of $0.00. The reason for not |
|                                   | manually rejecting the claim is   |
|                                   | because although they will not    |

|                                   | Allowance, they may still be      |
