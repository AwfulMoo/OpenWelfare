This document outlines entitlement to Partner Allowance (PA) when
partner loses qualification. When PA has been granted, a customer may
remain eligible for PA, even after their partner's eligibility for
payment ceases. The PA partner's eligibility may have ceased because
they returned to work, went overseas, or commenced study and they do not
qualify for Austudy. This includes partners of Disability Support
Pension (DSP) customers.
