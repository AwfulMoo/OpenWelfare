This document outlines the preliminary checks needed for aged care means
assessments for home care and permanent residential care.

Historical SPARC process

The System for the Payment of Aged Residential Care (SPARC) is the
legacy aged care payment system for residential care. SPARC is a view
only system from 20 August 2022.

To view the legacy SPARC process, see the historical version.

Aged care means assessment validity period - 120 days

Home care - post 1 July 2014 assessment scheme

A means assessment:

is valid for 120 days from the date it is completed

expires and is no longer valid if it is:

-   completed before entry to care, and
-   the care recipient does not start home care within 120 days of the
    means assessment completion date

cancels when a care recipient is discharged from care (if the assessment
is completed after entry to care)

can be re-instated if the care recipient leaves and re-enters home care
within 120 days of the means assessment completion date, even if the
break in care is more than 28 days

Home care - pre 1 July 2014 assessment schemes

Home care packages under this scheme are not subject to means testing.
Pre July 2014 care recipients can request an assessment to estimate
their home care fees if they are considering changing home care
providers and opting in to the post 1 July 2014 assessment scheme.

Residential care - post 1 July 2014 assessment schemes

A means assessment:

is valid for 120 days from the date it is completed

expires and is no longer valid if it is:

-   completed before entry to care, and
-   the care recipient does not enter residential care within 120 days
    of the means assessment completion date

completed after entry to care:

-   sets the resident status (low means or not low means) for the length
    of entry in a particular service. See Aged care means assessment for
    information regarding low means and not low means status
-   cancels when the care recipient is discharged from care (this
    includes resident status)
-   can be re-instated if the care recipient leaves and re-enters care
    within 120 days of the calculation of your cost of care completion
    date (even if the break in care is more than 28 days). Note: the
    resident status may change if the assessable income and assets
    change. The resident status is always determined at date of entry to
    care and can change for subsequent entries where changes to the
    income and assets have occurred

Residential care - pre 1 July 2014 assessment schemes

The 120 day validity period does not apply.

Means assessment validity period - discharge and breaks in care (28 day rule)

A break in care:

-   occurs when a care recipient has been discharged from care and
    re-enters care with the same or new service
-   does not include approved leave. For example, hospital or social
    leave

Home care - post 1 July 2014 assessment scheme

A means assessment is valid while a care recipient is in home care
unless they have a break of more than 28 days. This includes where the
care recipient changes services.

Break in care is 28 days or less:

-   The means assessment is valid
-   Transferable between services where a care recipient moves to a new
    home care service

Break in care is more than 28 days:

-   The means assessment cancels from the date of discharge
-   A new means assessment is needed for a new entry into home care

If the care recipient leaves home care and commences residential care:

-   a new assessment will be required for residential care
-   a new means assessment is not needed if a care recipient returns to
    home care within 28 days

Residential care - post 1 July 2014 assessment schemes

Break in care is 28 days or less:

-   The care recipient remains assessed under their original post 1 July
    2014 scheme, however a new means assessment is needed from the new
    date of entry

Break in care is more than 28 days:

-   A new means assessment is needed
-   The means assessment is assessed under the most recent post 1 July
    2014 assessment rules

If the care recipient leaves residential care and commences home care:

-   a new assessment for home care is needed
-   they will remain assessed under their original assessment rules if
    they return to residential care within 28 days from the date of
    leaving residential care

Residential care - pre 1 July 2014 assessment schemes

Break in care is 28 days or less:

-   The care recipient is grandparented and remains assessed under their
    original scheme
-   The original assets assessment is valid unless the care recipient
    asks for a new assets assessment from their new date of entry into
    care
-   The income assessment is valid (as it would have been continually
    updated during the time in care)

Break in care is more than 28 days:

-   A new means assessment is needed
-   The new means assessment is assessed under post 1 July 2014
    assessment rules

If the care recipient leaves residential care and commences home care:

-   A new assessment is needed for home care and is assessed under post
    1 July 2014 assessment rules
-   The care recipient retains their grandparented status for
    residential care if they return to residential care within 28 days

Care recipient discharged before means assessment completed

Home care

If a care recipient is discharged before a means assessment is
completed:

care subsidy reduction (CSR) to zero automatically applies and the care
recipient is not liable for any income tested fees (ITF) or income
tested care fees (ITCF)

-   however the care recipient is liable to pay the basic daily care fee
    and all other agreed fees

the service provider is paid full subsidies for the care recipient's
time in care

Residential care

If a care recipient is discharged before a means assessment is
completed:

-   CSR to zero automatically applies and the care recipient is not
    liable for an income tested fee (ITF) or means tested fee (MTCF)
-   low means care recipients may still be liable for an accommodation
    contribution
-   no fees are set or fee letters automatically sent
-   the service provider is automatically paid full care subsidies for a
    discharged care recipient

A means assessment may be requested following discharge to determine
resident status. Low means, concessional, assisted or supported care
recipients may require a manual assessment to determine their liability
for an accommodation contribution. See Aged care means assessment -
manual means assessment for more information.

If a death action has been completed in Customer First:

the RCA/NCL activity is not able to be finalised

the estate of the deceased care recipient may request a means assessment
and manual letters to be issued

-   See Aged care means assessment - manual means assessment for more
    information

Initial assessments

Means assessments lodged prior to entry into care will be rejected where
the care recipient fails to provide any requested documents.

If the requested documents are:

-   lodged within 13 weeks of the rejection, the means assessment will
    be re-indexed from the original date of lodgement
-   lodged outside of 13 weeks, a new pre entry assessment can be
    completed from the date of receipt of the documents, providing all
    other information in the means assessment is still valid

Reassessments

Means assessments that have already been finalised as MND will require a
reassessment activity where:

-   subsequent lodgement of a means assessment form occurs, or
-   requested documents that were not provided are returned

Reassessments can be backdated to the date of entry into care, where
applicable. However, the date of receipt will be the most recent
contact/lodgement date.

Another claim type preventing updates

When more than one claim has been started, this may cause 'task
locking'. Provisional updates in an existing new claim conflict with
updates being made in the new activity.

Sometimes a claim activity must be cancelled to process other updates on
the customer's record. However, not all NCL activities need to be
cancelled. If means assessment is ready to be finalised and another
claim is preventing completion – see Cancelling claim activities and
re-indexing claims.
