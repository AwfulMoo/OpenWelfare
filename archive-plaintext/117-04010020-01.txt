This document outlines the process for monitoring and pursuing recovery
of outstanding social security charges and if unsuccessful, referring
charges to legal service providers for legal recovery action.

Recovery of charges

Compensation Recovery Teams (CRT) use the Compensation Management System
(CMS) to monitor and pursue recovery from insurance companies and
compensation payers.

Refer unsuccessful social security charge refunds to legal service
providers for legal recovery action.

Before referring a case to the legal service provider, the CRT must
consider:

-   whether a preliminary and/or recovery notice was correctly sent to
    the compensation payer prior to the compensation being released to
    the claimant
-   if the amount of the charge is considered cost effective in relation
    to the amount of the charge
-   if the manager of the compensation payer is refusing to pay the
    social security charge, or is not aware of their obligations in
    paying the charge
