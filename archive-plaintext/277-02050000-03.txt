|                                   | The CSI is based on the change in |

|                                   | updated by 1 January each year.   |

|                                   | amount. For example, a court      |
|                                   | order may state that the          |
|                                   | assessment is to be increased by  |

|                                   | year. This type of adjustment     |
|                                   | will be recorded on Cuba as OTH   |
