| 1                                 | What are special circumstances?   |

|                                   | their very nature incapable of    |
|                                   | precise or exhaustive definition. |
|                                   | 'Special circumstances' relates   |
|                                   | to circumstances that are         |
|                                   | unusual, uncommon or exceptional. |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | In order for a circumstance to be |
|                                   | considered special it needs to be |
|                                   | 'different from the usual run of  |
|                                   | cases'. It is not necessary that  |
|                                   | the circumstances of the customer |
|                                   | be unique, however they 'must be  |
|                                   | out of the ordinary' and have 'a  |
|                                   | particular quality of unusualness |
|                                   | that permits them to be described |
|                                   | as special'.                      |

|                                   | case by case basis.               |

|                                   | April 2020. Services Australia    |
|                                   | advised that Bernadette and       |
|                                   | partner Howard, would need to     |
|                                   | lodge tax returns by 30 June 2020 |
|                                   | or they would not be entitled to  |

|                                   | Bernadette contacted the agency   |
|                                   | in May 2020 to advise they were   |
|                                   | not able to lodge tax returns by  |
|                                   | 30 June 2020, because their       |
|                                   | accountant was recently involved  |
|                                   | in a serious accident shortly     |
|                                   | after the appointment at the      |
|                                   | accountants' firm in March.       |
|                                   | Bernadette has just been advised  |
|                                   | of this and was told that the     |
|                                   | accountant will be off work for a |
|                                   | further 6 weeks.                  |

|                                   | Bernadette advised that the       |
|                                   | accountant has only been able to  |
|                                   | employ a person to assist the     |
|                                   | firm in a part time capacity and  |
|                                   | there will be a delay in having   |
|                                   | tax returns prepared and          |
|                                   | submitted.                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Bernadette has spoken with the    |
|                                   | relieving accountant who advised  |
|                                   | that they should be able to lodge |
|                                   | their tax returns by mid July     |
|                                   | 2020.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The circumstances leading to the  |
|                                   | lodgement of the tax returns are  |
|                                   | not in Bernadette's sole control. |
|                                   | Bernadette has ensured relevant   |
|                                   | documentation is available to the |
|                                   | accountant and is waiting for     |
|                                   | this to be prepared and submitted |
|                                   | to the Australian Taxation Office |
|                                   | (ATO).                            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Bernadette has already lodged a   |
|                                   | lump sum FTB claim for the        |
|                                   | relevant financial year. This     |
|                                   | allows for a special              |
|                                   | circumstances assessment to be    |
|                                   | undertaken. In this instance a    |
|                                   | special circumstances extension   |
|                                   | for income confirmation could be  |
|                                   | granted. Although seeking a 2     |
|                                   | week extension, it would be       |
|                                   | reasonable to consider an         |
|                                   | extension period of 4 to 6 weeks. |

|                                   | for the 2018-19 financial year by |
|                                   | Services Australia due to their   |
|                                   | accountant being involved in a    |
|                                   | serious car accident delaying the |
|                                   | lodgement of the processing of    |
|                                   | the tax returns. The extension    |
|                                   | date of 5 August 2020 is          |

|                                   | Office (ATO) advises the agency   |
|                                   | that tax returns were lodged on   |
|                                   | 15 August 2020. Bernadette's      |
|                                   | Family Tax Benefit (FTB) lump sum |
|                                   | claim is made not effective due   |
|                                   | to the late lodgement of income.  |

|                                   | payable because of the late       |
|                                   | lodgement of tax returns.         |
|                                   | Bernadette advises that there was |
|                                   | a further delay in lodging tax    |
|                                   | returns because the accountant    |
|                                   | had only recently returned to     |
|                                   | work in a part time capacity and  |
|                                   | had an outstanding work load.     |

|                                   | In this instance a further        |

|                                   | may be considered to coincide     |
|                                   | with the date the tax return was  |
|                                   | lodged with the ATO. This would   |
|                                   | allow the claim to be effective,  |

|                                   | July, after the end of the        |
