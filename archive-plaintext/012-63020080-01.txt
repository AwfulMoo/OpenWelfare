Requesting emergency Authority prescriptions

Policy 12

Medical practitioners can request an emergency authority prescription to
obtain extra quantity and repeats that may not otherwise be approved. In
all cases these requests must be referred to a Pharmaceutical Adviser
(PA) for a decision.

Excessive emergency Authority prescriptions

Excessive numbers of prescriptions marked with 'emergency authorised by
Services Australia' in a claim, must be referred to a supervisor, the
Pharmaceutical Adviser or National Compliance Operations (NCO) for
follow-up or investigation.
