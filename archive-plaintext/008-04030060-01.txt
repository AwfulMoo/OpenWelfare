This document outlines information on the Disabled Australian
Apprenticeship Wage Support that provides financial assistance to
employers who have Australian Apprentices with disability.

Types of assistance

Assistance can include:

-   a wage support payment or an amount equivalent to the award wage
    (whichever is the lesser) for apprentices with disability
-   assistance for tutorial, interpreter and mentor services for
    apprentices with disability
-   assistance for leasing or purchasing essential equipment or
    modifying the workplace to accommodate an apprentice or trainee with
    disability

Services Australia has no role in Disabled Australian Apprenticeship
Wage Support. Customers and employers enquiring about the program should
be referred to their local Australian Apprenticeship Centre.
