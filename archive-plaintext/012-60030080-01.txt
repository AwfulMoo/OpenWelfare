This document outlines the stages of the pharmacy produced
Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) prescription model - Cabrini.

Pharmacist role

The pharmacy produced PBS prescription model is internally referred to
as the Cabrini model. Under this model, the pharmacist:

-   prepares the prescription from the medical practitioner’s
    instructions on the medication chart
-   prints the prescription on PBS stationery for the medical
    practitioner to check and sign
-   sends the prescription to Services Australia for claiming purposes
    (from 1 April 2015, under the streamlined claiming initiative this
    step is no longer required)

Prescriptions generated under this model are clearly marked that it is
for claiming purposes only.

Regulatory requirements and Cabrini approval

All regulatory requirements concerning preparation of prescriptions and
the supply of medication must still be met. Note: authority
prescriptions cannot be generated under this model.

Only the Chief Executive Officer (or equivalent) can request approval
from Services Australia to use this model. They must write a letter of
request and also provide an outline of their proposal for consideration.
Note: the hospital pharmacist cannot make this request.

See the Resources page for a list of Cabrini model approved hospitals,
and associated pharmacies.
