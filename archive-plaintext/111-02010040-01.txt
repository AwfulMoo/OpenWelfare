This document outlines the process of accessing archived Activity
Management History (AMHS) data using the Archiving and Culling Engine
(ACE) application.

History and business rules

Activities in the AMHS files have been archived to ACE since 15 July
2006. This replaced the regular archive of activities to Customer
Archive Retrieval (CAR) in the Centrelink system.

Business rules determine which activities for a Customer Reference
Number (CRN) are archived to ACE, and are based on the attributes of a
CRN, the attributes of an activity and the number of activities
available to be archived per CRN. The rules can be summarised as
follows:

Activities are not archived from duplicate or logically deleted CRNs

For a CRN:

-   a finalised activity with a family assistance task must be 2 years
    old before it can be archived
-   a finalised activity with a Pension (PEN) task must be 180 days old
    before it can be archived
-   a finalised activity with an activity code of DOC must be 180 days
    old before it can be archived
-   a finalised Debt (DMN) activity must be 180 days old before it can
    be archived
-   any other activity must be 90 days old before it can be archived

A CRN must have a total of 10 or more activities that can be archived
before any activities are archived to ACE

Activities previously archived in Customer Archive Retrieval (CAR) will
not be made available in ACE, therefore it may be necessary to search in
both CAR and ACE.
