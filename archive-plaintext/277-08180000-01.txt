This document outlines information about the process used by officers in

their behalf.

Maintenance arrangements between Australia/New Zealand

The international maintenance arrangements between Australia and Inland
Revenue, New Zealand (NZIR) state that a child support liability should
be issued and administered in the jurisdiction where the payee resides.

If the payee lives in New Zealand they can lodge an application with
NZIR. Where the payer lives in Australia and does not enter into a
satisfactory payment arrangement with Inland Revenue (IR), then NZIR may
forward the case to Child Support for collection.

NZIR can only make this request after Child Support confirm the payer is
habitually resident in Australia.

For information about processing Reverse Cases, see System processing
for reverse child support cases, both cases ended after payee election
to end.

NZIR forwards registrations to Child Support including:

-   ongoing child support liabilities
-   arrears only cases - there is no ongoing liability however a debt is
    still owed, and
-   spousal maintenance cases

Note: a parent or carer cannot apply directly to Child Support for an
NZIR case to be registered in Australia. A referral for collection can
only be made by NZIR. Advise parents or carers who request registration
of a New Zealand case to call NZIR on 1800 504 042 (free call from
Australia unless calling from a mobile) or visit the NZIR website.
