|                                   | mismatch. A further letter is     |
|                                   | sent to the customer asking them  |
|                                   | to provide verification of the    |
|                                   | TFN.                              |

|                                   | -   If it is different from the   |
|                                   |     one Centrelink has recorded,  |
|                                   |     change the TFN on the Tax     |
|                                   |     File Number (TFN) screen and  |

|                                   | -   If the TFN is the same as     |
|                                   |     what Centrelink already has,  |
|                                   |     request the customer provides |
|                                   |     proof of their TFN, such as a |
|                                   |     Notice of Assessment from the |
|                                   |     ATO. There is no need to      |
|                                   |     update the TFN screen if the  |
|                                   |     TFN is verified and is the    |
|                                   |     same as the one previously    |
|                                   |     provided, instead code 'SIT'  |
|                                   |     on the Request Action: field  |
|                                   |     on the MCI screen. If the     |
|                                   |     customer provides proof of    |
|                                   |     their TFN and it is different |
|                                   |     from what is on the system,   |
|                                   |     refer to the first dot point  |

|                                   | If the customer does not comply   |
|                                   | with a Mismatch 2 request their   |
|                                   | FTB will be cancelled as the TFN  |
|                                   | is non-compliant.                 |
