Evidence to support ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship) applications

These are examples only. It is not intended that customers need to
provide all forms of evidence listed within each category.

-   Evidence on a customer's record (for example, Employment Separation
    Certificate, Medical Certificate) can be evidence to support the
    application
-   Evidence must demonstrate the link between the event and a
    substantial reduction in the ability to pay for child care fees
-   Commonwealth statutory declarations cannot be the sole source of
    evidence for the application. But they can serve as complementary
    evidence to explain how an event has affected their financial
    situation
-   Note: It is expected that supporting evidence is provided on a
    business letterhead with contact details. If this is not the case,
    staff should request further evidence to validate the details.
