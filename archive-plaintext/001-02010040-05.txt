| 3                                 | Do organisations need to keep     |
|                                   | records of job seeker's           |
|                                   | attendance?                       |

|                                   | Yes. Services Australia may ask   |
|                                   | an organisation to confirm if a   |
|                                   | job seeker is doing voluntary     |
|                                   | work. It is recommended they keep |
|                                   | a record of who volunteers, when  |
|                                   | and for how long.                 |

|                                   | Services Australia never asks an  |
|                                   | organisation to collect proof     |
|                                   | explaining why a job seeker did   |
|                                   | not attend voluntary work. If     |
|                                   | proof is needed, the job seeker   |
|                                   | must give this to Services        |
|                                   | Australia directly.               |

|                                   | to take?                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | No, organisations decide the type |
|                                   | of work and the number of         |
