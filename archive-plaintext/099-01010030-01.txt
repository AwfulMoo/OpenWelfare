This document outlines when Services Australia can offer help to a
person after the death of their partner where the surviving partner
receives payments from the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA).

DVA contact information

Customers should call the DVA general enquiries line, see Department of
Veterans' Affairs (DVA) for contact details.

Bereavement assistance

In most instances, Services Australia is unable to offer initial
assistance because DVA has similar bereavement arrangements for their
recipients. However, if the deceased partner was also a customer of
Services Australia, some bereavement assistance may be payable through
Services Australia, depending on the type of payments received by each
member of the couple at the time of the death.

Customers should be advised that information used for their Centrelink,
Child Support and Medicare payments and services is not routinely
transferred within Services Australia. The customer may need to contact
Centrelink, Child Support and Medicare separately, to update relevant
information.

The Resources page contains links to contact details for the Department
of Veterans' Affairs (DVA), links to the publication 'Needing help after
someone has died?' (HD001), the Services Australia website with
information on death and bereavement and to the DVA website.
