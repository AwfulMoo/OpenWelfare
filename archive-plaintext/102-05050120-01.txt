This document outlines how to link a child to a customer's record for a
new claim or for an existing customer. It also explains how to assess
the child as a dependent for social security and family assistance
payments. A child's record will link to the record of each person
claiming for the child. This is so the assessment of entitlements and
concessions is correct.

Child record

If a child has an existing Customer Reference Number (CRN):

-   only create a new record when the child has been adopted
-   the new record will link to the adoptive parent

This protects the privacy of the:

-   adoptive parent
-   the birth parent, and
-   the child

Record the child as 'Newborn' if the claim is lodged before the newborn
has a name.

This procedure explains recording requirements to finalise the claim.

Legal first name

For an unnamed child, do not use words such as:

-   'baby'
-   'girl'
-   'boy'

These words are legitimate legal first names, notably in Indian, Persian
and Burmese ethnic groups.

Contact the customer (if in doubt), to confirm if they are intended as a
child's legitimate first name. This procedure explains how to:

-   link a child if the child has no Centrelink record
-   link a child who has a Centrelink child record, for example when
    changing care or coding shared care details
-   link a child who is a customer, for example receiving Youth
    Allowance (YA)
-   link a child to a customer where the child record is in a different
    environment

The Resources page contains a link to the Families level 2 helpdesk
request form and examples of when a child cannot be linked to a
customer's record.
