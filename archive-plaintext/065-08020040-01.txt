This document outlines the role of staff in Service centres in the
recovery process for Home Equity Access Scheme (the Scheme).

Role of Smart Centre and service centre staff

Smart Centre and service centre staff must:

let customers know about their repayment options and support access to
electronic payments

give the Home Equity Access Scheme National team mailing address to
customers to send payment by:

-   cheque, and/or
-   money order

scan cheques or money orders to customer records

When customers lodge cheques or money orders at a service centre, staff
must:

-   document the lodgement on the customers record, and
-   scan the cheque or money order to the customer record

Administration of the Scheme

The Home Equity Access Scheme National team Complex Assessment Officers
(CAO):

-   administer all Scheme repayments
-   are responsible for electronic banking reconciliation
-   issue receipts for cheques and money order repayments
-   issue refunds for over recovered monies
-   update the loan balance on customer records

Loan repayment

The Scheme loans must be repaid to the Commonwealth, including legal
costs and accrued interest

A customer or nominee can choose to repay all or part of their loan at
any time, either by instalments or in a lump sum amount. There is no
requirement for the customer to make voluntarily repayments during the
life of the loan

If the customer would like to repay their loan in full and have the
secured property released, see Settlement of Home Equity Access Scheme
loan amounts for more details

Recovery of the loan is sought if:

-   the customer is deceased and there is no surviving partner over Age
    Pension age, or
-   the property used to secure the loan is sold during the life of the
    loan

If a customer intends to sell the real estate which currently secures an
outstanding loan amount, they must contact the agency before settlement
to arrange for repayment upon the settlement of the property. See
Settlement of Home Equity Access Scheme loan amounts for more details

If a customer or nominee wishes to know the balance of their current
loan information, see the FAQ’s on the Resources page of the Home Equity
Access Scheme

Loan repayment options

Customers or nominees have the choice of repaying via:

-   BPAY®
-   credit/debit card through the Home Equity Access Scheme Summary page
    in the customers Centrelink online account
-   bank cheque or money order via mail
-   in some circumstances, a customer may lodge the initial repayment
    via cheque or money order at their local service centre

Note:

-   electronic payments is the preferred repayment option, encourage
    customers to use this option instead of cheque or money order
-   cash payments are not allowed

The Process page has details about the different payment options.

Loan balance composition

Outstanding loan balances may include:

-   Principal: fortnightly payments made to a customer under the terms
    of the loan
-   Interest: a compound interest rate is applied to the outstanding
    loan balance each fortnight
-   Legal costs: the costs associated with registering, changing or
    removing a secured charge or caveat are payable by the customer

Customers can pay the initial registration costs up front, but generally
they are added to the loan balance, and attract interest until repaid

When a customer is settling the loan, there are costs to remove the
charge or caveat that must be repaid
