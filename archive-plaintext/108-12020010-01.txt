This document outlines the procedure to assist Service Officers to
manually key a rate of payment for customers who are being paid in the
NSS system.

Manually code rate of payment

Generally, the system automatically calculates the correct rate for a
recipient to be paid. In some cases, this does not occur and the rate
has to be manually keyed into the system for the correct rate of payment
to occur.
