This document outlines how to calculate the start day for payment for a
customer soon after the birth of a child.

Overview

If a person makes a claim for a Social Security payment and the person
is qualified for the payment on the day on which the claim is made, the
person's start day for that payment is the day the claim is made.

However, in some circumstances, a person's start day may be earlier and
different rules apply to different circumstances. If a claim for a
social security payment is made by the birth mother within four weeks
after the birth of a child, the start day in relation to the payment is
the first day on which the customer is qualified for the payment. In
most cases, the start day for payments will be determined by the general
Start Day rules.

Where a claim for Parenting Payment (PP) is made by someone who is not
the birth mother, the start day can be backdated to the first day of
qualification if the person claims within four weeks after the child
becomes a PP child of that person. For example, the father of the PP
child lodges the claim for Parenting Payment instead of the birth
mother.

Exclusion periods

The start day of a claim will be delayed if the customer is required to
serve a waiting, preclusion or non-payment period or time in prison or a
psychiatric institution (for committing an offence). All these waiting
and non-payment periods are referred to as exclusion periods.

The Resources page contains an example of calculating the start day for
payment for a customer soon after the birth of a child.
