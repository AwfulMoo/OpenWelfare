Profiles in the Centrelink Appointment System

It provides instructions on how to:

-   add new positions and profiles, including the interpreter profile
-   delete times, profiles, and positions permanently
-   block existing appointment profiles temporarily
-   make changes to existing interview positions (for example, public
    holidays)
-   monitor appointment profiles

The Centrelink Appointment System allows management of appointment
profiles within Customer First.

Note: a separate procedure explains the Front of House (FOH) app which
includes queue management for walk-in appointments and the Virtual
Waitroom (VWR).

The Resources page contains a complete list of appointment types and
parameters, and information about time display issues to consider when
booking and reviewing appointments.
