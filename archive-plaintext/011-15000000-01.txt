Government intent

The Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995 (HOSC Act) was
introduced to recover Medicare benefits, nursing home benefits,
residential care or home care government subsidies paid to a claimant as
a result of their compensable injury or illness.

The compensation payer (usually the insurer) must notify the agency of a
judgment, settlement or reimbursement arrangement made in respect of an
injury or illness, where:

-   an injured person receives a compensation payment amount of more
    than $5,000 or
-   reimbursement arrangement is made 6 months after the compensation
    claim was lodged

The claimant may have to pay these costs back to the Australian
Government before they receive their compensation payment.

Benefits paid on their behalf through Commonwealth programs (in part or
full), include:

-   Medicare benefits
-   Nursing home benefits
-   Residential care subsidies
-   Home care subsidies

Services Australia (the agency) administers the Medicare Compensation
Recovery programme under the HOSC Act.
