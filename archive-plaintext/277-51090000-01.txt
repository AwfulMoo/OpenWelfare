This document outlines child support agreements that have been accepted
by Child Support and explains assessment for Family Tax Benefit (FTB).
These agreements are different to agreements lodged with a court or
informal agreements between parents.

Child Support agreements before and after 1 July 2008

Customers can choose to register a child support agreement with Child
Support.

If the agreement has a start date:

-   Before 1 July 2008 and the customer is claiming more than base rate
    FTB Part A, Centrelink is responsible for determining whether the
    agreement satisfies Maintenance Action Test requirements. For FTB
    instalment customers, child support income is assessed according to
    their full child support entitlement (private collect) or the amount
    collected (Child Support collect), according to details transferred
    by Child Support (as for customers with a child support assessment).
    If the agreement includes non-cash or capitalised child support,
    this must be manually recorded on the customer's record
-   On or after 1 July 2008, Child Support is responsible for assessing
    the agreement. Child support details are not manually assessed or
    recorded as the assessment is automatic based on the notional
    assessment (NA) advised by Child Support. In some cases the
    Administrative Assessment is used, for example for a lump sum
    agreement

Customers with a child support agreement may choose to collect child
support privately or via Child Support.
