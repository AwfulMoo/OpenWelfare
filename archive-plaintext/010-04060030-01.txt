This document outlines the process of issuing an Application for Fares
Allowance - Tertiary Students Only form (SY005) to a deceased estate and
then assessing eligibility for payment once the claim is received.

Fares Allowance (FAA) after a customer has died

The Youth Allowance Consolidation Bill 2000 allows fares to be
reimbursed after the death of a student. To be eligible, an application
for Fares Allowance (FAA) must be lodged within the normal time limits,
that is before 1 April in the year after the year of study and the claim
must be lodged within 26 weeks (6 months) of the student's death.

General information and eligibility regarding FAA

FAA is paid for eligible tertiary students to reimburse travel costs
associated with their study if they need to live away from home. Only
eligible journeys are reimbursed which are based on the type and length
of the course of study.

The amount of FAA payable depends on the mode of transport that was
available to the student. Generally, fares are reimbursed at the rate of
the cheapest and most practicable mode of transport available for that
journey.
