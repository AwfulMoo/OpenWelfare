|                                   | This criterion only applies to    |

|                                   | If the YA customer is:            |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | Some courses have a compulsory    |
|                                   | requirement for the student to    |
|                                   | reside on campus. In these cases, |
|                                   | the student cannot do the course  |
|                                   | without leaving home. As the      |
|                                   | student must live away from home  |
|                                   | the away from home rate of YA may |
|                                   | be payable.                       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The residency must be compulsory  |
|                                   | and not just 'suggested' or       |
|                                   | 'recommended', and evidence is    |
|                                   | required. Sufficient evidence may |
|                                   | be a letter from the institution  |
|                                   | confirming the requirement or a   |
|                                   | copy of relevant pages from the   |
|                                   | institution’s handbook outlining  |
|                                   | the requirement.                  |

|                                   | The best known example of this    |
|                                   | requirement would be nursing      |
|                                   | students where the students are   |
|                                   | normally required to stay in the  |
|                                   | nurse's quarters. Other examples  |
|                                   | are possible.                     |

|                                   | Note: the location of the         |
|                                   | customer's parental home is not   |
|                                   | an issue when there is compulsory |
|                                   | residence. Even if it were next   |
|                                   | door, the away from home rate of  |
|                                   | YA would still be paid.           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Does the course have a compulsory |
|                                   | residence requirement?            |

|                                   | -   Yes, go to Step 3             |
|                                   | -   No, the customer is not       |
|                                   |     eligible for the away from    |
|                                   |     home rate under this          |
