This document outlines the process for conducting a capacity to pay
(CTP) investigation.

Overview of the CTP process

Child Support has the authority to initiate a change of assessment
application for customers in certain circumstances. Financial
Investigators make recommendations to initiate a change of assessment
application if a parent’s income, property or financial resources are
not fairly represented in their child support assessment. Decision
Makers (DM) have the authority to change the assessment if they are
satisfied the assessment is unfair because of any of these factors. A
range of alternative remedies are considered throughout the process.
Once a CTP process has begun, both customers’ financial circumstances
are investigated equally to determine if a change to the assessment is
recommended.

Special consideration for identified customers

CTP has been identified as a function that may assist Services Australia
reach the goals set out in the Family and Domestic Violence Strategy.

An identified customer/case may be referred to CTP through the referral
guidelines if the customer has grounds under reason 8A and are not
willing to make a Change of Assessment (COA) Application themselves for
fear of family and domestic violence (FDV). Cases referred to case
selection are assessed on merit before proceeding to CTP for a full
review. While the standard CTP process applies to these cases, a
Financial Investigator will be mindful and sensitive to the
circumstances of the customers and discuss any concerns with the team
leader. Customers who proceed through the CTP process will have their
financial situation reviewed and if an application is made by the
registrar to COA, normal COA processes will apply, including open
exchange of information (OEI)
