|                                   | Melbourne University have lodged  |
|                                   | an SY034 for assistance for a 4   |
|                                   | day testing activity. The testing |
|                                   | activities show day 1 and 2       |
|                                   | contain literacy, numeracy and    |
|                                   | comprehension testing.            |

|                                   | advised days 3 and 4 are          |
|                                   | justified because entry into      |
|                                   | tertiary education requires       |
|                                   | students to feel comfortable with |

|                                   | be justified to extend across 4   |
|                                   | days. Two of the days do not      |
|                                   | involve testing the academic      |

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Example of the assessment of      | Southern Cross University         |
| reasonable length for a           | requires its external Masters and |
| residential school                | Doctorate students attend a total |
|                                   | of 30 days on-campus residential  |
|                                   | schools each calendar year.       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Previously, they ran 3            |
|                                   | residential blocks of 10 days     |
|                                   | each. However, the travel costs   |
|                                   | with the 3 blocks was using a     |
|                                   | significant portion of the $2080  |
|                                   | limit for Away from Base          |
|                                   | assistance.                       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The university decided it is more |
|                                   | efficient to have 2 blocks of 15  |
|                                   | days each, due to less travel     |
|                                   | costs for students over the year. |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The 2 residential blocks of 15    |
|                                   | days each are assessed as         |
|                                   | reasonable length. Although each  |
|                                   | residential school is over 2      |
|                                   | weeks, the decision to increase   |
|                                   | the duration of each block is     |
|                                   | justifiable. Overall, the         |
|                                   | students spend the same number of |
|                                   | days at residential school for    |
|                                   | the year, but they have less      |
|                                   | travel costs for the year.        |
