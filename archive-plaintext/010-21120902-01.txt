This document outlines the process for creating a Q021 letter advising
the customer of their Fares Allowance claim decision.

Circumstances where a Q021 letter is required

Issue a Q021 letter to a customer when:

-   approving, amending or rejecting their Fares Allowance (FAA)
    reimbursement claim
-   rejecting their claim for Fares Allowance (FAA) paid in advance of
    travel for Youth Allowance (YA), Austudy or Pensioner Education
    Supplement (PES). Do not issue a Q021 if approving the claim

Nominees

Only address a manual Q021 letter to one person.

If the customer has a correspondence nominee, issue a separate,
identical Q021 to the correspondence nominee.

The Resources page contains approved free text when rejecting FAA claims
for reasons not included in the Pre-set letter options text and links to
User Guides to assist with writing letters.
