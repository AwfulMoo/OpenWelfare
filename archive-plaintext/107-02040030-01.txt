This document outlines information on investigating a debt caused by an
administrative or computer error.

Recoverable debts

An excess payment is only legally recoverable if allowed under one of
the debt creation provisions, contained in either:

-   the Social Security Act 1991, or
-   another Act

Legislation inter-relationship

Check the interrelationship between section 1223(1) and subsections
1223(1AC), (1AD) and (1AE) of the Social Security Act 1991.

The References page contains specific examples of the types of
considerations that need to be taken into account.

Overpayment due to computer/administrative error

Administrative error occurs where a person complies with social security
law and a debt is created. For example, where a person has:

-   provided detail(s) that affects their qualification and
-   that detail is not processed

'Computer error' occurs where the Services Australia's computer program
makes a payment, or part of a payment, that should not have been made.

Consider Administrative error waiver in these cases.
