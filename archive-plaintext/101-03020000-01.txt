This document outlines information about the Teen Dental Plan that
commenced from 1 July 2008. It targeted teenagers from 12 years to 17
years of age inclusive who satisfied the eligibility requirements to
receive a voucher for a preventative dental check each calendar year.

Closure of the Medicare Teen Dental Plan

The Medicare Teen Dental Plan (MTDP) was closed on 31 December 2013.
Benefits continue to be paid for services provided to eligible teenagers
before the date of closure. Vouchers will not be issued from 1 January
2014.

If Service Officers receive calls for assistance with a late claim or
other MTDP enquiry direct the query to Child Dental Benefits Schedule
(CDBS).

For customers contacting Centrelink about the Child Dental Benefits
Schedule (CDBS) which replaced MTDP from 1 January 2014, see Centrelink
enquiries for Child Dental Benefits Schedule (CDBS).

Role of Centrelink/Medicare

The Centrelink system automatically checked to see if a customer had met
eligibility requirements for the Medicare Teen Dental Plan voucher and
then transferred details to the Medicare system in annual and monthly
listings.

Medicare used this information to determine Medicare eligibility and
then issued vouchers as required. Medicare was also responsible for the
reissue of vouchers to customers if the voucher had been lost or not
received.
