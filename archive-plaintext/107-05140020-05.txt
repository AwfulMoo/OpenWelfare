Using the Transfer Rules Tables

The tables identifies how the repayments display on the Repayment
History (OPRH) screen and whether they can be transferred to another
debt.

The other debt may be a debt raised under:

-   Family Assistance (Administration Act) Act 1999
-   Social Security Act 1991
-   Student Assistance Act 1973
-   Paid Parental Leave Act 2010
-   Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013

Note: the below table does not provide instruction for transferring to
PGPA debts. Consult with your leader. It is likely that the debt is an
NNR debt and requires referral to the Status Resolution Support Services
(SRSS) Team as advised in Step 1 of Table 1.

To locate the relevant rule:

-   locate the repayment in the far left column
-   follow that line to the destination debt type
-   the content in that cell will advise Yes or No to transfer the
    repayment (or an alternate action)

Note: refer Bankruptcy and Debt Agreement Repayments to a Bankruptcy
Officer. Repayments made via an External Collection Agency, Australia
Post, BPAY, cash, cheque, EFTpos, credit card and direct debit can be
transferred to any FAO, SSA, SAA and PPL debt. View the repository to
identify how these repayments display on OPRH.
