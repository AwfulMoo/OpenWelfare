For Services Australia social workers only.

This document outlines the different categories and fields used by
Services Australia social workers to record SME referrals in the SWIS.

Child safe framework

If a staff member observes behaviour that raises concerns about a
child's safety they should follow the agency's Risk Identification and
Reporting model. This is in line with a zero tolerance approach to harm
of children.

For more details about this model, see:

-   Risk identification and management of threats to the safety and
    welfare of a child, and,
-   the agency's commitment to child safety

Recording referrals and contacts

All SME referrals and contacts must be recorded in SWIS and a report
completed.

The completion of a report is important for the:

-   customer if they want to appeal further, and
-   original decision maker if the decision is set aside

SME roles and responsibilities

The SME is an experienced social worker in a team who is independent of
the original decision. SME explanations of social work decisions are
completed by:

-   APS6 social workers who are chosen as SMEs or,
-   by EL1 Social Work Support Managers

The role of the SME cannot be performed by:

-   the social worker who made the decision, or
-   a social worker who has been involved in the process at any stage

For more details about the SME role, see SME explanations, ARO referrals
and implementing ARO decisions.

The Resources page has a link to the agency's Child Safe Framework.
