|                                   | locally' is based on excessive    |
|                                   | travelling time. A daily journey  |
|                                   | is considered to take excessive   |
|                                   | time if it exceeds 90 minutes 1   |

|                                   | times). The customer may be       |
|                                   | required to provide proof of the  |
|                                   | duration of the journey. If       |
|                                   | travel time to the activity is    |
|                                   | not excessive then the activity   |
|                                   | is considered local.              |
