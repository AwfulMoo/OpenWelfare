This document outlines how to manage a United Nations Convention on the
Recovery Abroad of Maintenance (UNCRAM) application to establish an
overseas maintenance liability.

UNCRAM

UNCRAM was signed in New York on 20 June 1956. It aimed to overcome the
legal and practical difficulties involved in establishing claims for
maintenance abroad. Australia is a contracting party to the convention.

UNCRAM countries are listed in United Nations Treaty Collection. The
Resources page has a link to the United Nations Treaty Collection.

A payee in an UNCRAM country can apply to an UNCRAM country where the
payer resides. The application can be made via the relevant overseas
authority. That country can establish a maintenance liability on the
payee’s behalf. See References for a link to The Child Support Guide -
International Agreements & Conventions.

Application to establish an overseas maintenance liability

Where the payer resides in an UNCRAM country a payee in Australia has
two options for child support:

-   an Australian child support assessment, or
-   apply to an overseas court or relevant body, including via an
    overseas authority

Generally the payee chooses to apply for an Australian child support
assessment. Child Support asks the reciprocating jurisdiction (RJ) to
collect the liability if:

-   the payee applies for the assessment to be transmitted, or
-   Child Support determines it is appropriate to do so

Alternatively, a payee in Australia may choose to apply to an overseas
jurisdiction to establish a child support liability in that
jurisdiction. This may be because:

-   the jurisdiction is unable or unwilling to recognise an Australian
    administrative child support assessment, or
-   the payee is not eligible for an Australian child support
    assessment. For example, the child is over 18, or
-   they prefer to have an overseas order

Where the payer resides in an UNCRAM country, a payee in Australia has
two options for spousal maintenance:

-   apply to an Australian court
-   apply to an overseas court, including via an overseas authority

A payee can ask Child Support to forward their UNCRAM application to the
overseas authority in the payer's jurisdiction. The matter will usually
be determined in a court in that jurisdiction. They will decide the
level of maintenance payable under their relevant laws.

Child Support’s role in this process is to:

-   check the payee’s application is complete
-   forward the application to the relevant overseas authority, and
-   provide advice if an application for assessment may be an option for
    the payee

Child Support can register an overseas maintenance order made in
response to an UNCRAM application.

Payees should seek legal advice before making an UNCRAM application.
Child Support cannot provide advice about overseas maintenance laws and
court procedures. UNCRAM applications received by Child Support are
usually prepared by the payee’s lawyer.
