|                                   | The onus to provide evidence does |
|                                   | rest with the customer however    |
|                                   | Service Officers are required to  |
|                                   | provide reasonable assistance     |
|                                   | when a customer is having         |
|                                   | difficulty substantiating periods |
|                                   | of residence                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The datalink with the Department  |
|                                   | of Home Affairs will attempt to   |
|                                   | match the department's data with  |
|                                   | an Immigration record and, if the |
|                                   | match is successful, immigration  |
|                                   | data may be automatically applied |
|                                   | to the residence fields. If the   |
|                                   | information is not automatically  |
|                                   | updated, the Service Officer will |
|                                   | need to code the relevant fields  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | It is not necessary for every     |
|                                   | period of residence to be         |
|                                   | verified by documentary evidence. |
|                                   | Service Officers should use       |
|                                   | discretion in establishing a      |
|                                   | picture of residence and simply   |
|                                   | need to be satisfied that the     |
|                                   | customer was a resident during    |
|                                   | the period claimed                |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | It may not always be possible to  |
|                                   | verify a claimant's legal         |
|                                   | residence status due to the       |
|                                   | limitations of Department of Home |
|                                   | Affairs records, particularly     |
|                                   | prior to 1973. In these cases the |
|                                   | Service Officer must determine    |
|                                   | the residence status from the     |
|                                   | evidence available                |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Assume that customers are telling |
|                                   | the truth unless there are        |
|                                   | reasonable grounds for not doing  |
|                                   | so                                |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Accept all evidence provided as a |
|                                   | valid contribution to the overall |
|                                   | picture of residence, For         |
|                                   | example, family certificates from |
|                                   | Italian authorities verifying the |
|                                   | birth of children in Australia,   |
|                                   | photos, boarding passes,          |
|                                   | newspaper cuttings and statements |
|                                   | by customers                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Don't ignore conflicting          |
|                                   | evidence. Further enquiries must  |
|                                   | be made in these instances to     |
|                                   | verify the true situation to      |
|                                   | ensure decisions are based on     |
|                                   | evidence                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Use periods of contributions to   |
|                                   | form a picture of residence. For  |
|                                   | example, if a customer has a      |
|                                   | contribution record in another    |
|                                   | country which ended shortly       |
|                                   | before they advised they arrived  |
|                                   | in Australia, or a contribution   |
|                                   | record that began shortly after   |
|                                   | they advised they left Australia, |
|                                   | it would indicate their dates     |
|                                   | were accurate. Where              |
|                                   | contributions periods overlap,    |
|                                   | further information would need to |
|                                   | be obtained                       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Contact the customer by phone.    |
|                                   | Talking about the customer's      |
|                                   | residence often helps more than   |
|                                   | documents                         |

|                                   | If the dates offered by the       |
|                                   | customer are vague, prompt the    |
|                                   | customer for further details. For |
|                                   | example, the season when the      |
|                                   | customer left their home or       |
|                                   | arrived in Australia, any         |
|                                   | significant events which occurred |
|                                   | shortly after their arrival or    |
|                                   | before departure                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Check similar sounding names. For |
|                                   | example, the customer may think   |
|                                   | they arrived on the Fairsea       |
|                                   | instead of the Fairsky            |

|                                   | The customer may have arrived on  |
|                                   | a maiden name rather than their   |
|                                   | married name and have forgotten   |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | who arrived prior to about 1973   |
|                                   | may have handwritten records of   |
|                                   | their arrival in National         |
|                                   | Archives. These records are not   |
|                                   | yet available online, however,    |
|                                   | there is an index to which        |

|                                   | can help to establish the general |

|                                   | -   Firstly, work out where the   |

|                                   |     residence, add the years      |

|                                   |     30 and add one to the months  |
|                                   | -   Multiply the years by 12 and  |
|                                   |     add this to the total number  |
|                                   |     of months. Add one more month |
|                                   |     to the total for the odd days |
