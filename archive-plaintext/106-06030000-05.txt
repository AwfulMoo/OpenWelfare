|                                   | -   The onus to provide evidence  |
|                                   |     does rest with the customer.  |
|                                   |     Service Officers are required |
|                                   |     to provide reasonable         |
|                                   |     assistance when a customer is |
|                                   |     having difficulty             |
|                                   |     substantiating periods of     |
|                                   |     residence                     |
|                                   | -   The Immigration Datalink will |
|                                   |     attempt to match the          |
|                                   |     Centrelink data with an       |
|                                   |     immigration record and, if    |
|                                   |     the match is successful,      |
|                                   |     immigration data may be       |
|                                   |     automatically applied to the  |
|                                   |     residence fields. If the      |
|                                   |     information is not            |
|                                   |     automatically updated, the    |
|                                   |     Service Officer will need to  |
|                                   |     code the relevant fields      |
|                                   | -   It is not necessary for every |
|                                   |     period of residence to be     |
|                                   |     verified by documentary       |
|                                   |     evidence. Service Officers    |
|                                   |     should use discretion in      |
|                                   |     establishing a picture of     |
|                                   |     residence and simply need to  |
|                                   |     be satisfied that the         |
|                                   |     customer was a resident       |
|                                   |     during the period claimed     |
|                                   | -   It may not always be possible |
|                                   |     to verify a claimant's legal  |
|                                   |     residence status due to the   |
|                                   |     limitations of Department of  |
|                                   |     Home Affairs records,         |
|                                   |     particularly prior to 1973.   |
|                                   |     In these cases the Service    |
|                                   |     Officer must determine the    |
|                                   |     residence status from the     |
|                                   |     evidence available            |
|                                   | -   Assume that customers are     |
|                                   |     telling the truth unless      |
|                                   |     there are reasonable grounds  |
|                                   |     for not doing so              |
|                                   | -   Accept all evidence provided  |
|                                   |     as a valid contribution to    |
|                                   |     the overall picture of        |
|                                   |     residence. For example,       |
|                                   |     family certificates from      |
|                                   |     Italian authorities verifying |
|                                   |     the birth of children in      |
|                                   |     Australia, photos, boarding   |
|                                   |     passes, newspaper cuttings    |
|                                   |     and statements by customers   |
|                                   | -   Don't ignore conflicting      |
|                                   |     evidence. More enquiries must |
|                                   |     be made in these instances to |
|                                   |     verify the true situation to  |
|                                   |     make sure decisions are based |
|                                   |     on evidence                   |
|                                   | -   Use periods of contributions  |
|                                   |     to form a picture of          |
|                                   |     residence. For example, if a  |
|                                   |     customer has a contribution   |
|                                   |     record in another country     |
|                                   |     which ended shortly before    |
|                                   |     they advised they arrived in  |
|                                   |     Australia, or a contribution  |
|                                   |     record that began shortly     |
|                                   |     after they advised they left  |
|                                   |     Australia, it would indicate  |
|                                   |     their dates were accurate.    |
|                                   |     Where contributions periods   |
|                                   |     overlap, more information     |
|                                   |     would need to be obtained     |
|                                   | -   Contact the customer by       |
|                                   |     phone. Talking about the      |
|                                   |     customer's residence often    |
|                                   |     helps more than documents     |
|                                   | -   If the dates offered by the   |
|                                   |     customer are vague, prompt    |
|                                   |     the customer for more         |
|                                   |     details. For example, the     |
|                                   |     season when the customer left |
|                                   |     their home or arrived in      |
|                                   |     Australia, any significant    |
|                                   |     events which occurred shortly |
|                                   |     after their arrival or before |
|                                   |     departure                     |
|                                   | -   Check similar sounding names  |
|                                   | -   The customer may have arrived |
|                                   |     on a maiden name rather than  |
|                                   |     their married name and have   |
|                                   |     forgotten                     |
|                                   | -   Old Arrival Records -         |
|                                   |     migrants who arrived prior to |
|                                   |     about 1973 may have           |
|                                   |     handwritten records of their  |
|                                   |     arrival in National Archives. |
|                                   |     These records are not yet     |
|                                   |     available online, but there   |
|                                   |     is an index to which records  |
|                                   |     are actually held. This can   |
|                                   |     help to establish the general |
|                                   |     picture supporting a person's |
|                                   |     statement about when they     |
|                                   |     started residing in Australia |
|                                   |     (along with any other         |
|                                   |     documents, such as tax        |
|                                   |     returns, children's birth     |
|                                   |     certificates or any other     |

|                                   | -   Sometimes WLR will need to be |
|                                   |     manually calculated. For      |
|                                   |     example, if the customer may  |
|                                   |     use the late partner's WLR    |
|                                   | -   Firstly, work out where the   |
|                                   |     WLR begins and ends (16th     |
|                                   |     birthday and Age Pension age  |
|                                   |     (or date of death if          |
|                                   |     earlier)). WLR must be        |
|                                   |     between these 2 dates         |
|                                   | -   Verify the late partner's     |
|                                   |     date of arrival in Australia  |
|                                   | -   Verify any other permanent    |
|                                   |     absences which may have       |
|                                   |     occurred                      |
|                                   | -   Calculate each period of      |
|                                   |     residence as years, months    |
|                                   |     and days. Make sure each      |
|                                   |     period falls between the 16th |
|                                   |     birthday and Age Pension age  |
|                                   |     (or date of death if earlier) |
|                                   | -   If multiple periods of        |
|                                   |     residence, add the years      |
|                                   |     together, the months together |
|                                   |     and the days together. If the |
|                                   |     days are more than 30, deduct |
|                                   |     30 and add 1 to the months    |
|                                   | -   Multiply the years by 12 and  |
|                                   |     add this to the total number  |
|                                   |     of months. Add 1 more month   |
|                                   |     to the total for the odd days |
|                                   |     (including zero days)         |
|                                   | -   The total months result is    |
|                                   |     the WLR                       |
