|                                   | Answer: PP job seekers, as        |
|                                   | principal carers, can fully       |
|                                   | satisfy their mutual obligation   |
|                                   | requirements through approved     |
|                                   | study of at least 15 hours per    |
|                                   | week, or 30 hours per fortnight.  |
|                                   | There is no minimum number of     |
|                                   | contact (classroom or otherwise   |
|                                   | directed) hours.                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The study can be approved by the  |
|                                   | agency regardless of whether the  |
|                                   | institution regards the course as |
|                                   | full-time or part-time. The study |
|                                   | can also be approved regardless   |
|                                   | of the duration of the course. In |
|                                   | other words, PP job seekers with  |
|                                   | mutual obligation requirements    |
|                                   | aren't subject to short course    |
|                                   | approval rules, so being in       |
|                                   | full-time study doesn't mean they |
|                                   | lose qualification for payment.   |

|                                   | Answer: It will depend on who is  |

|                                   | course application. This means    |
|                                   | that the DM could be either the   |
|                                   | provider or a Service Officer.    |

|                                   | long as they continue to study in |
|                                   | the same course when they         |
|                                   | transitioned to JSP/YA (job       |

|                                   | means that those PPS job seekers  |

|                                   | principal carer) will continue to |
|                                   | be able to qualify for PES at any |
|                                   | point in time (where all other    |
|                                   | qualifications are met) and will  |
|                                   | no longer be required to be       |
