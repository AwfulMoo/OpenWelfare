| Why does the period end date on   | This is because the customer's    |
| my Centrelink Payment Summary end | fortnight spans the tax years     |
| before June 30?                   | with the EPED falling in the next |

|                                   | In these cases this payment will  |
|                                   | be reported in the next EOFY      |
|                                   | period. This often affects        |
|                                   | Pension systems customers whose   |

|                                   | For example, customer's payment   |
|                                   | summary states customer was paid  |
|                                   | for the period                    |
