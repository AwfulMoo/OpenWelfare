This document outlines the process for all Services Australia staff to
record feedback in the Staff Feedback Tool.

Privacy for customers and staff

Do not include customer-identifying information in the Notes field of
the Staff Feedback Tool. The only exception is if it is reasonably
necessary to improve the agency's service delivery by:

-   providing useful feedback
-   allowing appropriate follow-up action to the feedback

Examples of identifying information include

-   name, address, phone number and date of birth
-   agency reference numbers (CRN, Medicare number, or CSRN)

Only staff with Manager access can view a feedback item submitted by
another staff member in the Staff Feedback Tool. This is to maintain
privacy when handling staff and customer information.

For more detail about manager roles and responsibilities in the tool,
see Management of the Staff Feedback Tool.

Completing the Your Office, Receiving Office, and Manager fields

The Staff Feedback Tool will automatically fill in the following fields:

-   Your Office, which will show the office of the feedback creator
-   Receiving Office, which is the office of the staff member entered
    into the Officer field
-   Manager, which is the receiving officer’s line manager

These details come from information in ESSentials.

The fields may not be filled in automatically if there has been a
recent:

-   change of position
-   organisational restructure
-   onboarding of staff

The Resources page contains links to the Staff Feedback Tool, Office
Locator, Master plan and the SFT Org Unit Lookup Tool.
