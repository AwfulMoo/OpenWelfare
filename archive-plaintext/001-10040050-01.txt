This document explains how job seeker’s contact Services Australia to
discuss an outstanding non-compliance event or Capability Assessment.

Where ‘job seeker’ is referenced, this includes Community Development
Program (CDP) participants.

Reasons for contact

Job seekers managed under the Targeted Compliance Framework (TCF) may
contact Services Australia when:

-   they need to complete a Capability Assessment, or
-   a work refusal failure, unemployment failure or mutual obligation
    failure has been reported, to determine if a financial penalty or
    payment cancellation will be applied

Job seekers managed under the Job Seeker Compliance Framework (Community
Development Program (CDP) participants), may contact the agency in
response to a:

-   Non-Attendance Report (NAR)
-   compliance action, or
-   Comprehensive Compliance Assessment (CCA)

Contact from a CDP participant is prompted by:

-   a letter and/or SMS being issued requesting they contact as soon as
    possible, or
-   their provider telling the CDP participant they are required to
    contact us

Capability Assessments - Targeted Compliance Framework (TCF)

Under the Targeted Compliance Framework, providers notify job seekers
when they are required to contact Services Australia for a Capability
Assessment. The Capability Assessment is a reconnection requirement. A
suspension will remain in place until the job seeker has met this
requirement.

Job seekers who contact about a Capability Assessment must be referred
to the Participation Solutions Team (PST).

Mutual obligation, unemployment, and work refusal failures - Targeted Compliance Framework

When an Employment Services Provider identifies a job seeker has failed
to meet their mutual obligation requirements, they issue the job seeker
with a notice advising:

-   it appears they have missed a requirement, and
-   they must contact their provider within 2 business days to avoid
    having their payment suspended

If their payment is suspended, it will remain suspended until the job
seeker:

-   contacts their provider, and
-   meets any reconnection requirements issued

Job seekers may contact Services Australia due to a Targeted Compliance
Framework payment suspension should be referred to their provider. For
further information, see Re-engaging job seekers - Targeted Compliance
Framework.

Note: work refusal failures submitted by a provider will immediately
suspend a job seeker’s payment.

Any outstanding unemployment or work refusal failures will prevent a job
seeker from finalising their fortnightly reporting until contact with
the Participation Solution Team (PST) occurs.

Outstanding mutual obligation failures, for job seekers in the penalty
zone, will prevent them from finalising their fortnightly reporting.

As part of reporting, job seekers can choose to accept the financial
penalty for some types of mutual obligation failures without a
compliance investigation being conducted by the PST. These failures
include:

-   a first or second mutual obligation failure in the penalty zone for
    non-attendance at provider appointments, third party appointments,
    job interviews, mandatory activities, or
-   failing to comply with another compulsory requirement (for example,
    not meeting their monthly points target)

Contact with the PST must occur when a job seeker has an outstanding
mutual obligation failure and:

-   the job seeker has a Language Literacy Numeracy (LLN) circumstance
    recorded
-   the job seeker chooses to discuss the failure with the PST, or
-   the failure cannot be accepted by the job seeker until they talk to
    PST, or
-   the penalty for the failure may result in payment cancellation

Non-Attendance Reports (NAR) - Job Seeker Compliance Framework

When a CDP participant contacts Services Australia and the only
outstanding compliance action is a NAR, Service Officers should advise
the CDP participant to contact their provider so payment can be
restored.

When other compliance action is outstanding, the CDP participant should
be referred to the PST who will advise the CDP participant to contact
their provider after the other compliance action has been resolved.

Provider Appointment Reports (PAR) - Job Seeker Compliance Framework

Community Development Program (CDP) providers can submit a PAR to
initiate a compliance investigation following a CDP job seeker’s
non-attendance at a provider appointment.

The PAR is a type of non-compliance report used when the CDP provider
believes the CDP participant did not have a reasonable excuse for their
non-attendance. A PAR may only be submitted by a CDP provider:

-   after a NAR has already been submitted for the same non-attendance
    event, and
-   once they have spoken to the CDP participant about their reasons for
    non-attendance at a compulsory appointment

The PAR will include all relevant information from the CDP provider for
a Participation Solutions Team (PST)-skilled staff (with PFDEC or WNPPD
security resource) to investigate. A submitted PAR will also place a
contact trigger onto the record.

Participation Reports - Job Seeker Compliance Framework

When a Participation Report is received from a Community Development
Program (CDP) provider, the CDP participant’s payment may be suspended,
or a contact trigger may be added to the CDP participant’s record.

As part of the failure investigation, the Service Officer is required to
establish contact with the CDP participant. The purpose of this contact
is to:

-   advise the CDP participant a failure is under investigation, and
-   provide the CDP participant with an opportunity to explain the
    circumstances that led to the failure, and
-   re-engage the CDP participant with their requirements if appropriate

Until contact with the CDP participant is established, a decision
regarding the failure cannot be made.

If a payment suspension (participation) has been imposed, the CDP
participant’s payment will be restored when they agree to re-engage or
the Service Officer determines re-engagement is not required.

Job seekers with barriers

When a job seeker has a language barrier and/or vulnerability impacting
their ability to discuss their non-compliance with PST-skilled staff,
consider what servicing approaches are appropriate for their
circumstances. This may include using an interpreter, or consulting with
a specialist, such as a social worker, who may assist PST-skilled staff
to determine appropriate servicing.

Job seekers with barriers may also have a third party such as a
correspondence nominee or an authorised person (such as a partner,
social worker, or friend) to help them. Unless there is a barrier
preventing the job seeker discussing the non-compliance with PST-skilled
staff, they are expected to be involved along with their third party
acting as a support person.

Finalising Reporting Requirements

When a job seeker contacts following an unsuccessful attempt to complete
their reporting, PST-skilled staff stimulate the report once the
outstanding compliance action is finalised.

The Resources page contains information on contact and servicing
approaches when a job seeker has barriers and/or vulnerabilities, as
well as contact details for the Participation Solutions Team (PST).
