A guide is now available to help staff when a customer contacts about
the progress of their AGDRP or NZ DRP claim. See the Training & Support
page for a link to Telephony contact guides (inbound and outbound) >
Progress of claim - inbound contact guide.

For the New South Wales Floods – July 2022, customers granted NZ DRP may
receive a letter telling them they are eligible for the AGDRP (Special
Supplement). The AGDRP (Special Supplement) has not been activated for
the New South Wales Floods - July 2022. See New South Wales Floods -
July 2022.

For the New South Wales Floods - February 2022, 3 new Local Government
Areas (LGAs), Lake Macquarie, Strathfield and Waverley, were declared on
27 June 2022. Any claims previously rejected for these LGAs - customers
must lodge a new claim. Customers do not need to request an explanation
of the initial decision and these claims must not be re-indexed.
