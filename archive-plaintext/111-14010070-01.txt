This document outlines the process to follow when a customer requests
details to be provided in writing and a Q999 letter is being considered.

Creating a Q999 letter

In general, a Q999 letter should only be created when:

-   the requested details are not covered by a form letter
-   the requested details were not included in a letter previously sent
    to the customer
-   there is a directive through Network News Update for a Q999 to be
    produced
-   the customer is unable to access the information via Self Service
-   the request is not classified as a formal or informal Freedom of
    Information (FOI) request, and
-   the requested details are able to be confirmed by Services Australia

Note: staff should not provide a Q999 letter as confirmation of details
such as the customer's marital status, address history or other
information that is not collected by the agency.
