Primary Use in Community (PUiC)

A user must have passed online or submitted a HW080 form with at least
one CoI document. If the user has not passed or provided a CoI document,
the user needs to be advised a CoI document is required to finalise the
application.

If the user has passed 2 CoI documents they only require 1 other
document from either PUiC or an SUiC

|                                   | names being stored as preferred   |
|                                   | names). These drivers licences    |
|                                   | will not pass DVS. If a drivers   |
|                                   | licence is in a preferred name    |
|                                   | the user can contact the roads    |

Secondary Use in Community (SUiC)

A user must have passed online, or submitted the HW080 form, with at
least one CoI document. If the user has not passed or provided a CoI
document, the user needs to be advised a CoI document is required for
Services Australia to finalise the application.

If the user has passed 2 CoI documents or 1 CoI and 1 PUiC, they only
require 1 other document from either PUiC or an SUiC.

If the users name differs across the documents due to a change of name,
an official change of name certificate, amended birth certificate or an
official marriage certificate needs to be provided with the HW080 form.

If the account is known and the user provides their official Change of
Name (CoN) documents, it may be that the service they are linking to is
in another name and is required for linking purposes. Service Officers
are to code the CoN documents even if the Evidence of Identity documents
are all in the same name.

Note: if the change of name certificate is prior to the Document
Verification Service (DVS) coverage but the user has passed a CoI
document, the change of name can be manually overridden following the
peer review process.
