Example - Actioning a Tax MFU when 2 or more benefits have been paid in the same benefit transfer period

Note: the Tax Payment Summary (TXGS) screen must reflect the negative
adjustment amount for each benefit type. Unless specified, different
payments must be recorded separately.

System limitation

Benefit transfers occur when customers transfer between payments. A
manual tax MFU may generate. When 2 or more (losing) benefits were paid
in the benefit transfer period, the system only reduces 1 benefit type
on the customers’ Payment Summary and TXGS screens. This results in a
negative adjustment for 1 payment and a positive adjustment for any
subsequent payment(s). The Payment Summary Information below highlights
this type of scenario. A negative adjustment to TXGS is required for
both NSA and JSP.

Table 1: This table describes the Payment Summary Information.

Working out the benefit transfer period and negative adjustment amount

Example 1: NSA and JSP (including Coronavirus supplement (CVS)) transfer
to DSP

The customer was in receipt of NSA from 20 February 2020 to 19 March
2020. They transferred to JSP, receiving payment from 20 March 2020 to
24 June 2020. On 27 April 2020, the customer commenced receiving CVS.

In late June 2020, the customer transfers to DSP with payment
retrospectively from 20 February 2020.

The benefit transfer periods and negative adjustment amounts
respectively for NSA and JSP/CVS are:

-   20 February 2020 to 19 March 2020 - all NSA paid, and
-   20 March 2020 to 24 June 2020 - all JSP and CVS paid

Example 2: YAL and YDS (Youth Disability Supplement) transfer to DSP

The customer was in receipt of YAL from 20 February 2020 to 24 June
2020. The customer commenced receiving YDS on 1 April 2020 until 24 June
2020.

In late June 2020, the customer transfers to DSP with payment
retrospectively from 20 February 2020.

The benefit transfer periods and negative adjustment amounts
respectively for YAL and YDS are:

-   20 February 2020 to 24 June 2020 - all YAL paid, and
-   1 April 2020 to 24 June 2020 - all YDS paid

See the Resources page of Taxable and non-taxable (tax exempt) payments
for Centrelink Payment Summary for a list of payments reportable to the
ATO. The component amount will be included with the main payment in the
'Taxable' amount column on the Centrelink payment summary, unless
specified.
