Indigenous languages

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture is diverse:

Numerous language groups exist across Australia:

-   Traditionally there were over 500 different languages
-   Not one common language spoken by Indigenous Australians
-   Each group has their own distinctive cultural beliefs, language and
    dialects

Approximately 150 Indigenous languages spoken in Australia today

Indigenous Australians speak up to 4 or more different Indigenous
languages and/or dialects, with English often the least spoken

Indigenous interpreting

Language can be one of the many barriers multilingual Indigenous
Australians face when contacting Services Australia. Providing access to
an Indigenous interpreter improves communication, engagement, mutual
understanding and respect.

The agency is committed to using Indigenous interpreters for customers
where English is not their primary language. The use of a customer's
friend or relative as the interpreter is actively discouraged. This
avoids potential problems with language competency, impartiality,
content integrity and confidentiality.

Note: it is never appropriate to use a child as an interpreter.

The agency provides customers with free access to Indigenous
interpreters. Indigenous language services are delivered through the
following arrangements:
