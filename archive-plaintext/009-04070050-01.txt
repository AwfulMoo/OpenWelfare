This document outlines information for Service Officers about the
exchanged care provisions for customers claiming Carer Payment (CP)
(child).

On this Page:

Exchanged care

For exchanged care, the term 'parent' applies to carers who are adoptive
parents or legal guardians and who are party to 1 or more 'parenting
plans', 'registered parenting plans' or 'parenting orders'.

Parenting plans will set out the length or percentage of care that each
separated parent will provide care to each qualifying child.

The exchanged care provisions apply when 2 separated or divorced
parents:

-   care for 2 or more children under 16 years of age who require
    constant care
-   provide the care under a 'parenting plan', 'registered parenting
    plan' or 'parenting order'
-   exchange the care of each child

Separated or divorced parents

The parents may each qualify for CP (child) exchanged care where care is
provided to any of the following:

-   children who each individually qualify for CP (child)
-   2 or more children each with a disability or medical condition who
    qualify a person for CP (child), and/or
-   a disabled adult and 1 or more children each with a disability or
    medical condition who qualify for CP (child) or (adult)

Additional provisions

In addition to the above, to be eligible for CP (child) under the
exchanged care provisions:

-   the carer must personally provide constant care to the care receiver
-   the care provided to the care receiver attains a qualifying rating
    of 'intense' under the Disability Care Load Assessment (child)
    Determination (DCLAD) (2020)
-   the provision of the care must severely restrict the person's
    capacity to undertake paid employment
-   the carer must complete the usual carer assessment process

Note: exchanged care cases with more than 1 former spouse may be of a
complexity that requires specialist assessment.

Carer Allowance (CA) (auto)

CA (auto) is available to all recipients of (CP) (child).

If CP (child) cancels, CA (auto) will cancel automatically at the same
time. The customer will need to lodge a new claim for CA (child) if the
child still requires and receives additional daily care due to their
disability or medical condition.
