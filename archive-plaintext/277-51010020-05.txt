parentage.

Proof of parentage

From 1 July 2008, when registering a new child support case or adding a
child, Child Support must obtain proof of parentage for both parents
(payee or payer) if other evidence of parentage such as the child's
birth certificate is not available.

Forms

Child Support Statutory Declaration – the person named in the form is
named on the birth certificate for the child(ren) (CS4648)

Child Support Statutory Declaration – you are a parent of the child(ren)
named (CS4649)

Note: the CS4649 can be completed and printed from the website but
cannot be submitted online.
