|                                   | In New Zealand, social security   |
|                                   | is similar to Australia in that   |
|                                   | entitlement to payments is based  |
|                                   | on residence in New Zealand.      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Like Australia, New Zealand also  |
|                                   | has private pension               |
|                                   | superannuation-like schemes       |
|                                   | through deductions from paid      |
|                                   | employment. However, New Zealand  |
|                                   | Superannuation is actually the    |
|                                   | equivalent of Australian Age      |
|                                   | Pension and not to be confused    |
|                                   | with superannuation-like payments |
|                                   | in Australia. New Zealand         |
|                                   | Superannuation is not income      |
|                                   | tested in New Zealand.            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | New Zealand has a general direct  |
|                                   | deduction policy for any pensions |
|                                   | from other countries, including   |
|                                   | from Australia. New Zealand's     |
|                                   | social security agreements with   |
|                                   | other countries may modify this   |
|                                   | in some circumstances. New        |
|                                   | Zealand therefore has similar     |
|                                   | provisions to Australia requiring |
|                                   | a person to claim any entitlement |
|                                   | to a pension from another         |
|                                   | country. This direct deduction    |
|                                   | policy is reflected in the        |
|                                   | Agreement and means that          |
|                                   | Australia will direct deduct      |
|                                   | pensions from third countries in  |
|                                   | some circumstances. See Rate      |

|                                   | New Zealand has a general         |
|                                   | portability scheme based on       |
|                                   | residence. Special arrangements   |
|                                   | apply for some Pacific island     |
|                                   | countries and provisions of New   |

|                                   | agreements still apply.           |

|                                   | Like the Department of Veterans'  |

|                                   | military. New Zealand Veterans'   |
|                                   | Pension can be paid instead of    |
|                                   | New Zealand Superannuation but is |
|                                   | not a VANZ payment and not to be  |
|                                   | confused with other payments such |

|                                   | by VANZ. For further information, |

|                                   | This version of the Agreement was |
|                                   | host country style, meaning that  |

|                                   | person was resident paid the      |

|                                   | had to be met however this could  |

|                                   | Agreement is that customers       |
|                                   | affected by the 2002 Agreement    |
|                                   | were paid the NZ proportional     |
|                                   | rate based on their Working Age   |
|                                   | Residence if they were long-term  |

|                                   | New Zealand. The direct deduction |
|                                   | rate was paid inside Australia    |
|                                   | unless they were paid the NZ      |
|                                   | proportional rate and were not    |
|                                   | long term inside Australia.       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This led to anomalies where a     |
|                                   | customer would 'pass-through'     |
|                                   | either Australia or New Zealand   |
|                                   | and become affected by the        |

|                                   | the customer went to a third      |
|                                   | country from Australia.           |

|                                   | Australia. It is used to adjust   |

|                                   | recognition of the fact that the  |
|                                   | rate of NZ pension will reduce,   |
|                                   | ensuring the customer receives    |

|                                   | entitlement. The ASR must be      |
|                                   | coded in a new claim if the       |
|                                   | customer is in Australia and      |
|                                   | receiving NZS. This is to ensure  |
|                                   | the arrears issued from the new   |
|                                   | claim are calculated using the    |

|                                   | That is in recognition of the     |
|                                   | fact that the rate of NZ pension  |

|                                   | because of the grant of the third |

|                                   | The reason for this is that if a  |
|                                   | customer has lived in New Zealand |
|                                   | for less than 10 years, they      |
|                                   | cannot qualify for NZ pension     |
|                                   | without the Agreement, so         |
|                                   | Australia takes responsibility    |
