This document outlines content relevant to Court Orders for Child
Support assessments.

Government intent

The child support scheme was formed to assist separated parents to take
responsibility for the financial support of their children. The Child
Support Registrar administers the child support scheme which was
introduced by government in 1988.

On 1 July 2011, the Australian Government Department of Human Services
began delivering the services and payments provided previously by the
Child Support Agency, Medicare Australia, Centrelink and the then Family
Assistance Office. Child Support is now a service delivery brand within
Services Australia.

The child support scheme involves the assessment of child support in
accordance with a formula as well as the collection and enforcement of
court orders, child support agreements and child support assessments.
