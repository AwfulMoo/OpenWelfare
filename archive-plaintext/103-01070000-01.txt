This document outlines reviews and appeals for customers who are subject
to Income Management (IM) and enhanced Income Management (enhanced IM).
It sets out details for each measure.

Review and appeal options

A customer who does not understand or does not agree with a decision
relating to their status under any IM or enhanced IM measure may:

-   request an explanation of the decision by a Subject Matter Expert
    (SME)
-   apply for a formal review by an Authorised Review Officer (ARO)
-   request a review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) (first
    review)
-   request a review by the AAT (second review)
-   appeal to the Federal or High Court

If a customer does not agree with a decision to be placed on IM or
enhanced IM by one of the following referring authorities, the referring
authority is responsible for reviewing the decision:

-   the Family Responsibilities Commission
-   a State or Territory Child Protection Authority, or
-   a Supporting People at Risk approved referring authority

If a decision about IM or enhanced IM is being reviewed under social
security law, IM or enhanced IM continues to apply until the review is
finalised, unless otherwise directed by the AAT or court.

Decisions affecting social security payments and not related to IM or
enhanced IM are reviewable in accordance with social security law or
family assistance law.
