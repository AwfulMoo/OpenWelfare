This document outlines an overview of Voluntary Income Management.

Requesting Income Management

A customer may request to have their payments income managed because
they need assistance to meet financial responsibilities for themselves,
their children and/or families.

If the customer is eligible for any other form of Income Management,
this would take precedence over Voluntary Income Management. Voluntary
Income Management is ranked the lowest in the hierarchy of Income
Management measures.

Eligibility to enter into a Voluntary Income Management Agreement

To be eligible to enter into a Voluntary Income Management Agreement,
customers must meet all of the following:

-   be in receipt of a category H welfare payment
-   live in a declared Income Management area
-   not have an excluded payment nominee for Income Management purposes
-   not terminated a previous agreement in the last 21 days
-   not had more than 4 terminations of an agreement in the preceding 12
    months

Duration of Income Management

A compulsory period of 13 weeks applies when a customer enters into a
Voluntary Income Management Agreement.

Customers may terminate the Voluntary Agreement at any time after
completing the mandatory 13 week period, by contacting the agency.

Services Australia can also terminate the Voluntary Income Management
Agreement if certain events occur.

Restoration of a Voluntary Income Management customer

Customers whose payments are restored will automatically be placed back
onto Voluntary Income Management where they have not completed the
mandatory 13 week period.

Customers who have had their Agreement in place for more than 13 weeks
will be given the option to continue or terminate Voluntary Income
Management at the time of restoration.

Percentage of payments income managed

The following payments are income managed under this measure:

-   50% of a customer's regular fortnightly Category I welfare payments
    (which includes Category H welfare payments)
-   100% of ABSTUDY (with Living Allowance or Pensioner Education
    Supplement (PES)) payments, and
-   100% of lump sum payments are income managed

There are specific payments not income managed.

Voluntary Income Management and the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) Payments

DVA administers payments which are eligible for Income Management. In
particular they have payments that are 'Category H' payments used as
triggers for Voluntary Income Management.

The DVA Category H trigger payments are:

-   Service Pension
-   Income Support Supplement
-   Defence Force Income Support Allowance (DFISA)
-   Age Pension paid by DVA
-   Veteran Payment

DVA customers are subject to the same Income Management rules as
Services Australia customers. The task of providing this service to
these customers is controlled by the Memorandum of Understanding between
DVA and Services Australia.

Before commencing Voluntary Income Management, the agency will confirm
the customer receives one of the DVA eligible payments, and that they
reside in an area where Voluntary Income Management is available. An
Income Management Contact Officer (IMCO) handles all DVA cases.

The Resources page contains further information about declared Income
Management areas, and contact information for customers who are
receiving a DVA Category H payment and want to be income managed.
