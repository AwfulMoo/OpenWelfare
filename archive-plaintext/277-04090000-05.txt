    are paid
-   we will continue to issue assessment notices advising of how much
    should be transferred
-   you will continue to notify us of any changes in income, care
    arrangements or other circumstances that may change the child
    support payable

    unable to collect any amounts that may be raised during a period you
    are collecting privately

    child support again in the future, including any unpaid amounts for
    up to 3 months

    are entitled to when determining this amount

    owe, now or in the future
-   we will confirm your election in writing, and you will have a
    limited time to withdraw the instruction not to recover the amount
    if you change your mind
-   after this time, you will no longer be able to ask Services
    Australia to recover this amount
