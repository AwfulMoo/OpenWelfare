This document outlines information about when Youth Allowance (YA)
students who have reached their allowable time in a course still require
assistance to complete this course.

Students requiring assistance when their allowable time is reached

When a Youth Allowance (student) reaches their allowable time in their
current course, their payment will stop.

If these customers wish to test their eligibility for a job seeker
payment, they must:

-   be referred to an Employment Services Provider (for example,
    Workforce Australia), and
-   meet their mutual obligation requirements

If they are continuing to study, their study must be:

-   approved by their provider, and
-   included on the Activity and Exemption Summary (AEX) screen

These customers may benefit from discussions with their Employment
Services Provider before making changes to their study.

Job Seekers aged under 22

Job seekers under 22 years of age are normally referred to an employment
services provider.

Students under 22 years of age who have reached the allowable time for
their course may test their eligibility for YA as a jobseeker. They:

-   must meet mutual obligation requirements by undertaking job search,
    and
-   may have full-time or part-time study included as an approved
    activity via the AEX screen, in limited circumstances

Job seekers under 22 years of age who have not completed Year 12 (or
equivalent) or Certificate III or higher are identified as Early School
Leavers. They must be referred to an Employment Services Provider.
Completion of Year 12 (or equivalent), or Certificate III or higher must
be verified by Services Australia.

Job seekers aged 22 and over

Job seekers aged 22 and over cease to be eligible for YA. They may test
their eligibility for JobSeeker Payment (JSP). They:

-   must meet mutual obligation requirements, and
-   may have full-time or part-time study included as an approved
    activity on the AEX screen by their Employment Services Provider

Activities in the Points Activation System (PBAS) dashboard

From 1 July 2022, the New Employment Services Model (NESM) will no
longer hold detailed activity information in Job Plans for YAL (JSK),
JSP, PPP and SpB customers. Any self-declared study completed as part of
their requirements may be found on the PBAS Dashboard in Process Direct.

Customers can self-declare study via their Workforce Australia Online
services. This is available for viewing on the PBAS dashboard in Process
Direct. For study to be approved, it must be recorded as an approved
activity by their provider on the AEX screen.
