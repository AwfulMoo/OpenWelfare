CSP organisation record deactivation

This table describes how to deactivate a CSP organisation that has a
status of 'Active'. Note: if acting on behalf of another person known to
the HI Service (for example, a Responsible Officer, Organisation
Maintenance Officer or CSP Officer), a search for the individual in the
eHealth Program (EHP) must be conducted prior to searching for the
organisation.
