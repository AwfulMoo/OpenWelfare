This document explains Relocation Allowance for ABSTUDY Masters and
Doctorate study. It is paid to full-time students who need to move to
another location to take up Masters or Doctorate studies. It is to cover
the removal costs of transporting the student, the student's partner and
dependent child(ren) belongings via a removalist or hire truck.

Eligibility

The student must:

meet the eligibility criteria for the Masters and Doctorate Award, and

be receiving or have received at least $1.00 of entitlement (during the
academic period they are claiming) of one of the following:

-   Living Allowance
-   ABSTUDY Pensioner Education Supplement (PES)
-   Before 1 January 2022, a Defence Force Income Support-like payment
    under the Veterans Entitlements Act 1986

This allowance is paid as an alternative to Fares Allowance. Once
relocated, there is no further travel entitlement to return to the
former home location.

The student should also test their eligibility for the Relocation
Scholarship (RS).

Claiming

Students can claim verbally.

Rate

Students can claim up to the maximum allowable payment for removal costs
only. It does not cover the cost of establishing a new home.

See ABSTUDY - Relocation Allowance.

Payment

Payment can be made:

-   to the removal/hire truck company on receipt of their invoice, or
-   to the student when they supply original receipts
