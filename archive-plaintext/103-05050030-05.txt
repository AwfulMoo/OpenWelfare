|                                   | qualify for a standard advance of |

|                                   | payment rather than the SEA,      |
|                                   | however providing a standard      |
|                                   | advance may not always be the     |
|                                   | best solution for a customer and  |
|                                   | could limit the availability of   |
|                                   | future standard advances. Service |
|                                   | Officers are to assess the        |
|                                   | customer's eligibility for the    |
|                                   | SEA and discuss this option with  |
|                                   | the customer.                     |

|                                   | If a customer is likely to go off |
|                                   | payment, the outstanding balance  |
|                                   | of the advance is converted to a  |
|                                   | debt and the appropriate recovery |
|                                   | action is taken. If the customer  |
|                                   | is likely to continue on payment, |
|                                   | processing a SEA might allow them |
|                                   | to keep the standard advance 'in  |
|                                   | reserve'. A standard advance can  |
|                                   | be offered as an alternative to   |
|                                   | an SEA if this is unavailable or  |
|                                   | the customer prefers. It is not   |

  REJ Code   Literal                                                     Reason
  CNR        Cannot afford repayments                                    Not eligible because repayments could likely cause financial hardship
