This document outlines the process for completing an estimate review
post 1 July 2010.

Estimate reviews

Where a customer's income varies significantly from that used in the
child support assessment the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 allows
the customer to elect to have their assessment based on an estimate of
income in some circumstances. Customers are required to keep their
estimates of income accurate. If the estimate is no longer accurate, it
may be necessary to review it. An estimate review may update the income,
used in the child support assessment to more accurately reflect the
customer’s actual income.

If the customer is able to make a subsequent estimate for the financial
year this is the preferred option. See Child support estimates.

The content in this file does not apply to:

-   WA ex nuptial customers whose first estimate of the child support
    period was lodged prior to 3 March 2011, or
-   any child support period which has an estimate lodged before 1 July
    2010 under the previous legislation

If either of these circumstances apply, see Child support estimates
review (pre 1 July 2010)

For more information about WA ex nuptial customers, see WA child support
ex-nuptial cases.
