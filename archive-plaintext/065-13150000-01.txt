This document outlines the STRC Programme.

About the STRC programme

STRC is aimed at reversing and/or slowing 'functional decline' in care
recipients without the need for a hospital admission. This is a package
of care designed for, and approved by, the care recipient.

STRC is goal-oriented, time-limited and multi-disciplinary. STRC can be
provided in a home setting, residential care setting or a combination of
both. A care recipient has up to 6 months and 1 day to commence STRC or
their approval lapses.

Eligibility

To be eligible for STRC, a care recipient must be:

-   at risk of losing independence
-   able to improve their independence with STRC

A person is not eligible to receive STRC if they:

-   are receiving (or on leave from) permanent residential care
-   are receiving home care
-   are receiving transition care
-   have received transition care in the 6 months before assessment
-   have been hospitalised in the previous 3 months for a condition
    related to their current STRC needs
-   are receiving end of life care
-   have received more than 2 episodes of STRC in a 12 month period (an
    episode is 8 weeks)

Note:

-   pre-entry cannot be claimed in respect of care recipients receiving
    STRC
-   See Aged care leave for more information on leave types and how to
    manage leave events in the Aged Care Staff Portal (ACSP) and ACMPS

Lapsing of STRC approval

An STRC approval is valid on the approval date for 6 months and 1 day
after the date of My Aged Care signing the approval. To receive STRC,
the care recipient must enter STRC within the 6 month entry period.

STRC approvals lapse if the care recipient:

-   does not commence STRC within the entry period or
-   departs an episode of care

If an STRC approval lapses, to commence another episode of STRC, a care
recipient needs a reassessment and a new STRC approval from My Aged
Care.

Note: if STRC commences on the last day of the approval period, the STRC
is deemed valid.
