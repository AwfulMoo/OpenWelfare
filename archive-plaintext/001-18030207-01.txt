This document outlines the policy and procedures that apply when a job
seeker has refused, failed to accept or start suitable work under the
Targeted Compliance Framework (TCF).

Refusing, failing to accept or start suitable work

A job seeker commits a work refusal failure if they fail to accept a
confirmed offer of suitable work without a reasonable excuse, including
when a job seeker accepts suitable work but fails to start.

Work refusal failures do not apply to ParentsNext participants.

When a work refusal failure is applied this will:

-   cancel the job seeker's payment, and
-   impose a 4 week post cancellation non-payment period

Job seekers who reclaim payment:

-   may be subject to RapidConnect provisions, and
-   must serve the 4 week post-cancellation non-payment period before
    their payment re-starts, and
-   will return to the TCF Penalty Zone they were in prior to the
    non-compliance cancellation

Job seekers who are principle carers or have partial capacity to work do
not commit a work refusal failure if the work refused is for more than
15 hours per week.

Note: there are no waiver provisions for job seekers in financial
hardship during the post-cancellation non-payment period; however, they
will maintain eligibility for a concession card and the benefit rate
Family Tax Benefit (FTB).

Work refusal failures identified by Employment Services Providers

Providers who become aware a job seeker has refused work, or accepted
work but failed to start, will:

contact the job seeker to discuss their reasons for refusing or failing
to start suitable work

-   If contact is unsuccessful, the provider will submit a Work Refusal
    Report. This triggers a notice to the job seeker to advise that
    their payment has stopped and they must contact their provider to
    discuss a possible work refusal failure
-   When contact is successful, the provider will assess the suitability
    of the work based on the job seekers circumstances, and consider the
    reasons why they refused work or failed to start work

finalise the Work Refusal Report if the job seeker has a valid reason or
they determine the work was not suitable for the job seeker, or

update the Work Refusal Report with the job seekers reasons and advise
them to contact the Participation Solutions Team (PST)

Job seekers transitioning between job seeker compliance systems

Job seekers will transition between job seeker compliance systems if
they change residential address and either start or cease to participate
in the Community Development Program (CDP).

Where job seeker transfers to a CDP provider:

-   an outstanding work refusal failures may still be investigated and
    applied
-   any non-compliance cancellation due to a work refusal failure or
    post-cancellation non-payment period will remain in place
