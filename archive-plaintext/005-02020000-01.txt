This document outlines which payments and concession cards are generally
subject to a Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Period (NARWP) and/or a
Qualifying Residence Period.

Qualifying Periods of Residence prior to Grant

For most payments to qualify and be paid, a person must:

-   Meet a minimum accumulated qualifying residence period, or
-   Serve a NARWP, or
-   Have an exemption from 1 or both of the qualifying residence periods

Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Period (NARWP)

Customers who have recently arrived to live in Australia and are
claiming a payment or concession are required to have been an Australian
resident and physically in Australia for the required duration of the
NARWP, either in 1 period, or in a number of periods before the payment
or concession is payable.
Note: the period of residence required for the NARWP does not need to
have occurred immediately before claiming.

Temporary absences from Australia in the waiting period do not restart
the NARWP but the days that a customer is overseas do not count towards
meeting the NARWP requirements. For example, a customer claiming
JobSeeker Payment may have a 2 or 4 year NARWP. If they leave Australia
temporarily for 3 weeks the NARWP period does not recommence, but the
absence extends the NARWP end date by 3 weeks.

The requirement to have been in Australia for a period or periods
totalling the required duration of the NARWP, allows for broken periods
of residence in Australia to count if the person continued to be an
Australian resident. For example, a customer who has returned to live in
Australia after several years living overseas may have previously lived
in Australia as an Australian resident. The period of former Australian
residence would count towards any current NARWP requirements.

Note: the NARWP only needs to be served once for the applicable payment.

Payments subject to and length of the NARWP

The NARWP rules changed on 1 January 2019. Whether a customer is subject
to NARWP and the length of the waiting period is subject to the
following:

-   the payment or concession they are claiming
-   what visa subclass they hold (or have held)
-   visa grant date

See the Resources page for a table that sets out the NARWP rules that
apply to each payment/concession, based on the grant date of the
customer’s first qualifying visa.

Start date for the NARWP

The NARWP generally starts on the day the person:

-   first became an Australian resident; and
-   was present in Australia

For Special Benefit, Family Tax Benefit, Parental Leave Pay, Dad and
Partner Pay and Low Income Health Care Card claimed by a person who
holds a 309 or 820 Partner Provisional visa, the NARWP starts on the day
the person:

-   lodges an application for the relevant visa; and
-   is present in Australia

Exemptions from the NARWP

There are a number of exemptions from the NARWP. There are also payments
and concession cards available to a person serving a NARWP.

Some exemptions from the NARWP are common across all affected payments
and concessions. For example, when the person is an Australian citizen.
However, some payments and concessions have specific exemptions, for
example certain visa holders can have an exemption to the Carer Payment
(CP) or Carer Allowance (CA) NARWP, but would have to serve the NARWP
for any other payment or concession.

Some temporary visas are NARWP exempt for specific payments only. For
example, visa subclass 060 and 070 holders would qualify for Low Income
Card and Special Benefit but would need to be granted a permanent visa
and meet relevant NARWP requirements, or qualifying residence periods
for any other payment or concession.

Customers whose affected payment was claimed within 2 years prior to 1
January 2017 and who were entitled to either of the following exemptions
are entitled to the 2017 NARWP Exemption grandfathered status:

-   NARWP exemption as a family member of an Australian citizen or
    permanent resident of Australia, or
-   Qualifying Residence exemption as the holder of a visa subclass 100,
    110, 801, 814, 832 or 833

This status is displayed on the Grandfathering Summary (GFS) screen.
Updates, if required for reasons of 'Appeal', 'Policy Decision' or
'System error or omission', can be made by authorised staff in
International Services on the Grandfathering Override (GFD) screen.

For more information about exemptions from the NARWP, see Newly Arrived
Resident's Waiting Period and Qualifying Residence Exemptions.

NARWP rules for New Zealand citizens

A New Zealand citizen arriving in Australia using a New Zealand passport
is generally issued a Special Category Visa (SCV). For more information
on the residence status, see Australian Residence Rules for New Zealand
citizens.

Protected SCV holders qualify as Australian residents and can access the
full range of Centrelink payments provided they are currently living in
Australia and satisfy the relevant qualification criteria and waiting
periods such as the NARWP. Past periods of presence as an Australian
resident count towards the applicable waiting period.

Non-protected SCV holders do not qualify as an Australian resident and
will need to apply for and be granted a permanent resident visa before
any periods of presence as an Australian resident can be counted towards
the NARWP for all payments and concessions except Commonwealth Seniors
Health Care Card (CSHC) and Low Income Health Care Card (LIC). Periods
of presence as an Australian resident prior to 26 February 2001 can be
counted towards the NARWP if the customer now has a permanent visa.

Non-protected SCV holders do not require a permanent visa in the
following situations:

-   One-off payment of either JobSeeker Payment or Youth Allowance (YA)
    for a non-protected SCV holder under the New Zealand 10 year
    residence exemption
-   Parental leave payments, family assistance and concession cards
    (excluding Ex Carer Allowance Health Care Card (EHC).

Qualifying Residence Period

A qualifying residence period is a period of accumulated qualifying
Australian residence required to qualify for some payments. The period
may be 2 or 10 years depending on the payment.

Payments subject to a qualifying residence period

-   Age Pension
-   Disability Support Pension (DSP)
-   Parenting Payment (PP)

Note: Parenting Payment only is subject to a qualifying residence period
and is for claimants granted their first permanent visa on or after 1
January 2019. This means the claimant needs to serve the 2 year
qualifying period of residence concurrently with the 4 year NARWP for
PPP and PPS.

Start date for qualifying residence

The qualifying residence period commences when the customer is present
in Australia as an Australian resident. The length of the qualifying
residence period is either 2 years (104 weeks) or 10 years depending on
the payment/allowance.

Serving the qualifying residence period

To satisfy the residence criteria generally the customer needs to have
been an Australian resident physically present in Australia for the
prescribed period of time, depending on the claim lodged. Temporary
absences from Australia during the period of residence are treated
differently depending on the payment. For a 2 year qualifying residence
period, periods outside Australia will not count towards satisfying the
requirements. For a 10 year qualifying Australian residence period,
short periods outside Australia can be included as long as the customer
continued to be an Australian resident during the absence.

Exemptions from the qualifying residence period

There are a number of exemptions from the qualifying residence
requirements. Exemptions for the qualifying residence period are not
necessarily the same as the exemptions from the NARWP. The qualifying
residence exemptions are also different depending on the payment being
claimed.

For more information about exemptions from the qualifying residence
period, see Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Period and Qualifying
Residence Exemptions.

The Resources page contains contact details, NARWP waiting periods, visa
payment rules and scenarios showing application of the 1 year, 2 year or
4 year NARWP.
