This document outlines restoring a customer's entitlement to Pensioner
Education Supplement (PES) or ABSTUDY PES.

PES and ABSTUDY PES payability

When a PES qualifying income support payment is cancelled, the PES or
ABSTUDY PES will also stop.

PES or ABSTUDY PES cannot be restored unless the customer's qualifying
payment is:

-   restorable, and
-   has no gap in entitlement

If there is a gap in continuing eligibility of their qualifying income
support payment, the customer will need to submit a new claim for PES.

Restoration

When a student has a continuing eligibility or entitlement to payment of
PES or ABSTUDY PES and their qualifying income support payment is
current, their particular PES payment may be restored.
