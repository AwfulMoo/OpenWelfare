This document outlines information about the review that is
automatically created by the family assistance computer system, known as
the FAO system. The review is when a customer has been granted an
exemption from supplying direct credit details and it is later
considered appropriate to pay the customer's fortnightly instalments of
Family Tax Benefit (FTB) into a bank account.

Checks completed when review matures

On the date the review matures, the FAO system will perform a series of
checks on the customer's record and action a reassessment based on the
status of the record, as follows:

-   if the customer has been recorded as deceased, the review will close
    without any further action
-   if there are direct credit details or a new FTB acceptable exemption
    is recorded, the review will close without any further action
-   If there are no direct credit details and no new exemption reason is
    recorded, the record will be reassessed. The reassessment will
    result in FTB being cancelled
