This document outlines the effect on a student's entitlement to
Pensioner Education Supplement (PES), ABSTUDY PES or Assistance for
Isolated Children (AIC) PES payment when the customer commences or
returns to work.

Retaining entitlement to PES payments

Customers who start or return to work may retain their entitlement to
PES or ABSTUDY PES as long as they retain eligibility for their
qualifying income support payment, and they continue to undertake
qualifying study for PES or ABSTUDY PES.

For AIC PES, the parent or guardian of the student eligible for AIC PES
is the applicant (that is, the customer). Eligibility for AIC PES can be
retained if the student starts or returns to work and they are still
undertaking qualifying study. However, due to the circumstances of the
AIC PES student (they must be undertaking full-time primary or
equivalent ungraded study and most eligible students board away from
home) it would be unusual for them to be working.

Qualifying study

Rules for qualifying study will depend on whether the customer is
receiving:

-   ABSTUDY PES
-   AIC Scheme PES
-   PES
