The claiming period has closed. Late claims will not be accepted.

For claiming periods that start on or after 18 January 2022

As the Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment was re-instated and can be
claimed again from 20 July 2022, there are different claiming periods,
depending on the 7 day self-isolation, quarantine or caring period
claimed.

The payment re-instatement has been backdated to 1 July 2022.

This means customers can claim for a self-isolation, quarantine or
caring period that started:

between 1 and 20 July 2022 (inclusive) - claims must be lodged by 11:59
pm Eastern Standard Time on 2 August 2022

on or after 21 July 2022 by lodging their claim within 14 days from the
start date of the 7 day period they are claiming

-   A customer’s period of self-isolation, quarantine or caring period
    must start on or before 30 September 2022
-   For a 7 day claiming period that starts on 30 September 2022, claims
    must be lodged by 11:59 pm Eastern Standard Time on 13 October 2022
-   Customers cannot claim for a self-isolation, quarantine or caring
    period that starts on or after 1 October 2022

The online claim will not allow late claims to be lodged.

Late claims:

-   can only be lodged
    over the phone, and
-   will only be considered under 6 special reasons

Staff must not tell customers what these reasons are.

For more details about late claims, see the Process page in Pandemic
Leave Disaster Payment - Assisted Customer Claims.

Key policy differences

Staff must check the period of self-isolation, quarantine or caring a
customer is claiming.

Different eligibility criteria apply depending on the period the
customer is claiming.
