|                                   | $500. Franklin is on weekly       |
|                                   | payments due to a history of      |
|                                   | requesting urgent payments for    |
|                                   | food, medication or               |

|                                   | Franklin's weekly net rate of     |
|                                   | payment is $248.50 as there are   |
|                                   | no deductions. Franklin advises   |
|                                   | that at the end of each fortnight |
|                                   | there is $380.00 left.            |

|                                   | The Service Officer should ask    |

|                                   | As Franklin has a history of      |
|                                   | needing urgent payments, it is    |
|                                   | unlikely the amount stated would  |
|                                   | be available at the end of each   |
|                                   | fortnight. Franklin considers the |
|                                   | declared amount would qualify for |
|                                   | receiving an advance payment.     |
|                                   | However, by granting Franklin an  |
|                                   | advance of $500, it may cause     |
|                                   | further financial hardship.       |

| 1                                 | Question: What is the tax status  |
|                                   | of an advance payment?            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: For tax purposes, advance |
|                                   | payments are treated as a 'loan   |
|                                   | of money'. This applies           |
|                                   | irrespective of when the advance  |
|                                   | payment was paid during the       |
|                                   | financial year. Advance payments  |
|                                   | do not attract any additional tax |
|                                   | liability, as they are not an     |
|                                   | extra payment but a lump sum      |
|                                   | payment of the customer's ongoing |

|                                   | Answer: All advances can be paid  |

| 3                                 | Question: Should a Service        |
|                                   | Officer grant a customer an       |
|                                   | advance when they apply with an   |
|                                   | outstanding debt balance of less  |
|                                   | than 5 cents?                     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: Yes. When a customer pays |
|                                   | an outstanding balance of a debt  |
|                                   | but a rounding amount remains     |
|                                   | outstanding, any advance payment  |
|                                   | application will automatically    |
|                                   | reject. Service Officers are      |
|                                   | allowed in these instances to     |
|                                   | override the rejection using the  |
|                                   | advance payment workflow where    |
|                                   | the customer has an outstanding   |
|                                   | debt balance of less than 5       |
|                                   | cents. This is so the             |
|                                   | administrative process, which     |
|                                   | occurs, as the remaining rounding |
|                                   | amount will not clear until after |
|                                   | the customer’s next pay day, does |
|                                   | not disadvantage the customer.    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Example: Customer has a debt for  |
|                                   | $234.67, they attend a Post       |
|                                   | Office or service centre to pay   |
|                                   | the full amount but due to        |
|                                   | rounding can only pay $234.65     |
|                                   | (the customer cannot pay more     |
|                                   | than the amount due). The 0.02    |
|                                   | cents outstanding will not clear  |
|                                   | until the customer's next payday. |
|                                   | A Service Officer can manually    |
|                                   | override the application          |
|                                   | rejection and process the next    |
|                                   | advance if the customer meets all |
|                                   | the other qualification criteria. |

| 4                                 | Question: If the customer has a   |
|                                   | Compensation Insurer debt that    |
|                                   | has not been repaid, can they     |
|                                   | receive an advance payment?       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: This type of debt does    |
|                                   | not meet the qualification        |
|                                   | requirements. It should not stop  |
|                                   | the customer from receiving an    |
|                                   | advance. The debt is owed to the  |
|                                   | Commonwealth by the insurer, not  |
|                                   | the customer.                     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | As the system is unable to        |
|                                   | identify this type of debt from   |
|                                   | other debts, the workflow will    |
|                                   | automatically reject the          |
|                                   | application. In these cases, the  |
|                                   | rejection should be overridden.   |

|                                   | outstanding debt to qualify for   |
|                                   | an advance payment?               |

|                                   | Answer: [] Customers can make a   |
|                                   | debt repayment via their          |
|                                   | Centrelink online account using   |

|                                   | or credit card, the repayment     |
|                                   | will be recognised immediately as |
|                                   | 'paid' and the customer may apply |
|                                   | for a new advance.                |

| 2                                 | Question: How are repayments      |
|                                   | calculated?                       |

|                                   | Answer: The system will generate  |
|                                   | a repayment amount spread over    |
|                                   | the next 13 fortnight period.     |

|                                   | equal to or greater than the      |
|                                   | system generated amount, this     |
|                                   | amount is accepted and updated on |
|                                   | the customer's record when the    |
|                                   | advance payment is being granted. |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the amount of repayment        |
|                                   | requested by the customer is less |
|                                   | than the system generated amount, |
|                                   | the customer's advance payment    |
|                                   | will be rejected, as the customer |
|                                   | is unable to afford the           |
|                                   | repayment.                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | For customers who may have more   |
|                                   | than one advance payment in place |
|                                   | at a time, each advance payment   |
|                                   | is recovered separately. If the   |
|                                   | customer is granted a second or   |
|                                   | third advance payment while still |
|                                   | repaying an earlier one, the      |
|                                   | amount deducted from their        |
|                                   | fortnightly payment will          |
|                                   | increase.                         |

|                                   | transferred to another payment.   |
|                                   | Why have their repayments         |
|                                   | stopped?                          |

|                                   | Payment to Youth Allowance, a     |
|                                   | Manual Follow-up (MFU) will       |
|                                   | trigger the recovery of their     |

|                                   | 3 weeks. The repayment rate       |

|                                   | transfers from Carer Payment to   |
|                                   | Special Benefit and there is an   |
|                                   | outstanding advance balance, the  |
|                                   | balance becomes a debt to the     |
|                                   | Commonwealth.                     |

|                                   | increased?                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: Yes. Customers may        |
|                                   | request their rate of repayment   |

|                                   | the repayment amount without      |
|                                   | being placed in hardship.         |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | repayment should only be          |
|                                   | considered if:                    |
