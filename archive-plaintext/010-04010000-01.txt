This document outlines the process for Service Officers to follow when a
student or Australian Apprentice initially contacts regarding a claim
for Austudy.

Initial contact

A customer, or a third party on their behalf, may contact to claim for
payment of Austudy. Service Officers should identify if Austudy is the
most beneficial payment. See Identifying the most beneficial payment for
students or Australian Apprentices.

[] Students or Australian Apprentices who contact to claim Austudy can
make an online claim for Austudy using their Centrelink online account.
Customers should be advised payments may only commence from the date
they submit a claim, unless they are identified as a vulnerable
customer. See Intent to claim and vulnerable customers.

Qualifying for Austudy

To qualify for Austudy, a customer must meet all of the following
criteria:

-   be of Austudy payment age, and
-   satisfy the residence requirements, and
-   for students, satisfy the Activity test for Austudy, or
-   for Australian Apprentices, undertake a full-time Australian
    Apprenticeship and have a current Commonwealth registration number.
    Note: an Activity Test does not apply to Australian Apprentices

For more information see Eligibility for Austudy.

How to claim

[] Students and Australian Apprentices are required to claim using an
online account. If a customer contacts in relation to making a new claim
for Austudy they must be referred to submit their claim online, unless:

-   self-service channels are currently unavailable (confirmed by
    NNU/Stop Press), or
-   the Service Officer determines the transaction is not appropriate to
    be self-managed by the customer in that instance

Note: for customers in vulnerable circumstances, record an intent to
claim. See Intent to claim and vulnerable customers before returning to
this process.

A paper Claim for Austudy (SY002) should only be issued where the
Service Officer determines the transaction is not appropriate, that is,
a customer is unable to submit a claim using their online account or
Assisted Customer Claim (ACC) cannot be used.

Correspondence nominees do not have the required access to submit an
Austudy claim online on behalf of their principal. Therefore, they
should be encouraged to have the ACC completed at first point of
contact. If ACC is declined, then a paper claim form will need to be
issued.

When claiming online, a customer may be selected for a reduced question
set if they are receiving;

-   Youth Allowance (YAL), where customer (over 22 years or already have
    a non-reviewable independence reason) with a status of cancel next
    pay (CNP) or cancelled (CAN) within the last 52 weeks, or
-   JobSeeker Payment (JSP), Parenting Payment Partnered/Single
    (PPP/PPS), Sickness Allowance (SKA) or Widow Allowance (WDA), or was
    receiving 1 of these payments within the last 52 weeks

See Transfer to Austudy or Youth Allowance (YA) (student) from another
payment and Youth Allowance and Austudy students and Australian
Apprentices online claims and Assisted Customer Claims.

Early claim

A claim for Austudy can be made up to 13 weeks before the student or
Australian Apprentice becomes qualified for payment under the early
claim provisions. Some claims submitted early may not be able to be
assessed until the customer becomes qualified for Austudy (for example,
not an intending or continuing student, and study starts in the future
or where their apprenticeship start date is in the future).

The student or Australian Apprentice will be advised of when to submit
the claim to ensure full entitlement and of other
documentation/information that will be required when lodging the claim.
This may include:

-   Identity Confirmation
-   tax file number(s) (TFN)
-   other supporting documentation

Note: customers should be advised that before submitting their claim,
all required documents must be provided. Exceptions are made to
customers identified as vulnerable. See Circumstance Change Monitor.
