This document outlines the procedures for determining the nature of
employment for customers who are involved in contracting businesses or
receive commission income.

Determining if a contract or commission sales person is self-employed or an employee

In most cases, it will be quite straightforward to determine if a person
is running a business (for example, owner of a corner store) or is an
employee (for example, shop assistant).

It is more difficult to characterise the employment relationship for
independent contractors (for example, carpenters) and commission sales
persons. This can be difficult as obvious differences between being
self-employed or an employee are not always evident. Each employment
situation should be looked at on its merit using the guidelines in the
following procedures before a decision is made.
