This document outlines how to determine whether a student is eligible
for the 66% concessional study load for the purpose of receiving
Pensioner Education Supplement (PES).

Pensioner Education Supplement (PES) purpose

PES aims to assist qualified customers with the ongoing costs associated
with study and is available to those who are undertaking qualifying
study either as a full-time student (that is, at least 75% of the normal
amount of full-time study) or as a concessional study load student (that
is, 25 or 66% concessional study loads).

Study load requirements

To be considered a 66% concessional study load student, the student must
have a study load of at least 66% but less than 75% of a full-time study
load. The reason for a reduced study load must be one of the following:

-   conflicts with the institution’s normal requirements for the course
    (for example, timetable clashes, subject prerequisites not satisfied
    because of failure or other reasons, subject cancelled or
    over-enrolled, or reduced study needed to complete the course)
-   there is a specific direction in writing from the academic registrar
    or equivalent officer
-   a recommendation in writing from the academic registrar or
    equivalent officer for academic or vocational reasons, regardless of
    whether the reason is given with the recommendation or not

Note: while general advice based on information provided by the customer
can be given over the phone, the customer should be encouraged to test
their eligibility, particularly in cases of discretionary decisions.
