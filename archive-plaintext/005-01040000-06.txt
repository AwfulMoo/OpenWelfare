Training of citizenship test administrators

The Citizenship Testing team conduct initial training of Services
Australia staff. During initial set up, all service centres are provided
with facilitated training (face-to-face, or virtual) as well as
equipment such as, a camera, tripod, iPad/s, a copy of the training
modules, and resource material. All additional staff are offered
training via blended learning, which involves completing an e-learning
package in combination with mentoring. Trained test administrators at
each location are considered mentors and can train additional staff as
required.
