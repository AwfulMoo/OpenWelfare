+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Customer unable to attend classes |
|                                   | due to incapacity for a short     |
|                                   | period of time and who is able to |
|                                   | catch up on the missed study +    |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Barwon has flu and will be unable |
|                                   | to attend classes for the rest of |
|                                   | the week but is able to catch up  |
|                                   | on the missed study.              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   As Barwon should be able to   |
|                                   |     catch up on the study that    |
|                                   |     was missed, therefore Austudy |
|                                   |     is unaffected                 |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 2                                 | Customer unable to attend classes |
|                                   | due to incapacity who is able to  |
|                                   | maintain their study workload +   |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Asmara has a broken leg and will  |
|                                   | be unable to attend lectures for  |
|                                   | 3 weeks. A friend is taking notes |
|                                   | for her, however, and Asmara will |
|                                   | continue to hand in the required  |
|                                   | work over this period.            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   Austudy entitlement is        |
|                                   |     unaffected as the required    |
|                                   |     workload is maintained        |

| 3                                 | Customer unable to study for an   |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Anneke, a Dance student, is       |
|                                   | suffering from a viral infection  |
|                                   | and is expected to be             |
|                                   | incapacitated for 2 weeks.        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Anneke would be told that Austudy |
|                                   | payments would continue for that  |
|                                   | fortnight.                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | However, after a week if the      |
|                                   | prognosis has worsened and Anneke |
|                                   | is unable to study for an         |
|                                   | extended period. It is also       |
|                                   | unlikely that Anneke will be able |
|                                   | to resume dancing due to the long |
|                                   | term consequences of the virus.   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The Austudy eligibility would     |
|                                   | cease as of that day, even though |
|                                   | the fortnight Anneke was          |
|                                   | originally allowed has not yet    |
|                                   | elapsed. This is because Anneke   |
|                                   | no longer meets the requirement   |
|                                   | of expecting to return to study   |
|                                   | after the original 14 days. An    |
|                                   | alternative form of assistance    |
|                                   | would have to be considered.      |
