This document outlines details of the screen used during the Service
Profiling process, which is a way of selectively targeting Centrelink
services and assistance to customers. Service Profiling identifies which
customers need a more focused/targeted level of service to assist them
in meeting program outcomes, for example, declaring their income and
assets.

Predictors

Customers are placed in Profiles, based on the Predictors that already
exist on the customer’s record. It is important to note that this is
information that already exists on a customer’s record (for example, the
length of time on payment, address history, any overpayments,
relationship status, children in care etc.). Service Profiling simply
automates the process of going through a customer’s record to determine
this information.

The Predictors can be viewed on the Predictor Details (PQPD) screen in
Process.
