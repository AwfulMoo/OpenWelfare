Printing a confirmation form in a service centre

Service Officers are able to confirm a Medicare Safety Net family when a
member of a registered Safety Net family is present in a service centre.

The confirmation form is printed via CDMS and presented to the family
member who will then provide either an update on the family or
confirmation by signing the form. Once signed, the family details can be
updated and confirmed via CDMS.

For the purposes of Safety Net confirmation (also for registration and
amendments) the printed confirmation form is recognised as an approved
form meeting legislative requirements.

Table 4: this table describes how Service Officers print a confirmation
form in a service centre.
