This document outlines the two financial assistance packages available
for interstate shippers and drivers of eligible passenger vehicles
travelling across Bass Strait by ferry.

Government intent

Tasmanian Transport Schemes are federally funded subsidies that assist
Tasmanian individuals and businesses with the additional costs
associated with shipping goods and vehicles across Bass Strait.

The Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme (TFES)

The TFES has been in operation since 1976 and is designed to assist in
alleviating the high freight costs incurred by interstate shippers of
eligible domestic goods to and from Tasmania and goods being transhipped
to destinations beyond the Australian mainland by sea. The TFES operates
under a set of Ministerial Directions approved by the Minister for
Infrastructure and Regional Development.

The Bass Strait Passenger Vehicle Equalisation Scheme (BSPVES)

The BSPVES was introduced on 1 September 1996. The aim of the Scheme is
to provide a direct cost reduction in sea-going travel for the driver of
an eligible passenger vehicle travelling across Bass Strait by ferry.
The direct cost reduction is a significant step towards removing the
transport disadvantage posed by Bass Strait and is intended to provide
an incentive for more passengers to travel between the mainland and
Tasmania with direct benefits flowing to Tasmanian tourism, growth in
jobs and investment.
