This document outlines how to record the death of dependent child of a
JobSeeker Payment (JSP) or Youth Allowance (YA) customer to ensure final
payments are made correctly when the death is confirmed. JSP/YA
customers who have been assessed as a single principal carer are
entitled to the 'with child' rate when they have a dependent child in
their care. Customers are entitled to continue receiving this rate for
14 weeks after the death of their last qualifying child.

Death confirmation and eligibility for other payments

Before any action can be taken, the death must be confirmed.

The customer should be offered a referral to a social worker if
necessary.

Note: the customer may also be entitled to family assistance and Paid
Parental Leave scheme assistance after the death of a child.

If, during the 14 week bereavement payment, the deceased child would
have turned 16 and the customer would no longer qualify for JSP or YA as
a principal carer, the bereavement payment ends on the date the child
would have turned 16.
