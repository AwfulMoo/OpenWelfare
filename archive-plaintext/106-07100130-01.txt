This document explains when a Real estate details (MOD R) is required
and what information it obtains.

Real estate as an asset

The current market value of any real estate, excluding the principal
home, is taken into account as an asset including:

-   self-contained flat or other dwelling on the same title as the
    principal home that is rented to person(s) other than a near
    relative
-   part of the principal home used primarily or solely for business
    purposes. This portion of the customer's home should be assessed as
    an asset of the business and included and coded as part of the
    customer's business assessment
-   house, unit, or flat (other than the principal home)
-   vacant land
-   land not allowed as curtilage. For all new claims from 1 January
    2007, the assets test assessment for the principal home and
    curtilage has been restricted to the customer's house and the
    adjacent land on the same title document. This is known as the
    single title rule. The term curtilage means the land surrounding the
    home. There are 2 curtilage tests used to determine a customer's
    allowable house and curtilage concession, a 'private land use test'
    and an 'extended land use test'. A grandfathered savings provision
    for real estate will grandfather concessions for real estate for 2
    groups of existing customers on payments before 1 January 2007 who
    would otherwise be disadvantaged by the application of the new one
    title rules. The saving provision will cease when the customer's
    payment is cancelled, for any reason, or if they leave the property
    after 1 January 2007

Where the customer owns their land via a single title document, even
where there are multiple lots included, the whole of the land on that
title document may be exempted under the extended land use test. This
procedure does not cover house and curtilage assessments for property
types:

-   shop or factory
-   commercial premises
-   retail premises
-   shop and dwelling
-   home office/business

Information about valuation of real estate and other assets, is
contained in the procedure, Valuation of real estate and other assets.

Customers receiving income from real estate

Services Australia needs to know if the customer is receiving any income
from the real estate. This may be from letting, leasing or rental of a
house, shop or land.

When assessing income from real estate, expenses related to that income
(such as interest payments, rates and maintenance costs) are deducted
from the gross income to work out the current net income. The customer
is required to provide their latest tax return for the agency to
determine the net income the customer receives from their real estate.

If a tax return is not available, the 'one third rule' is used as an
interim measure until either the following are available:

-   the income tax return for the person or business that owns the
    property (including the rental property schedule showing rental
    income and deductions), or
-   financial statements such as a profit and loss statement

If the customer did not lodge an income tax return, as their income was
too low, a profit and loss type statement must be provided.

Assessing real estate as an asset

Real estate is assessed as primary production assets or a non-primary
production asset. This allows negative net primary production assets to
be offset against other primary production assets under the primary
production aggregation rules. The Real Estate Update script should be
used to update the customer's real estate assets.

Assessing overseas real estate

The asset value and net income of overseas real estate is coded on the
Foreign Income and Assets (FID) screen. See Process for more
information.

The Resources page contains links to Services Australia website, online
forms and an example of how to assess rental income and house and
curtilage assessment.
