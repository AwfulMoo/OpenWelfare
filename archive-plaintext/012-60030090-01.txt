Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) Hospital Medication Chart (HMC)

The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) Hospital Medication Chart (HMC)
initiative was introduced as a 2014-15 Budget Measure. The PBS HMC is a
national standard PBS-compliant hospital medication chart to be used in
public and private hospitals. The PBS HMC can be used to prescribe,
dispense, supply and claim PBS medicines directly, without the need for
a separate paper prescription. The PBS HMC provides an alternate option
for prescribers in the hospital setting.

The PBS HMC was developed by the Australian Commission on Safety and
Quality in Health Care (ACSQHC) from the National Inpatient Medication
Chart (NIMC). It retains the safety elements of the NIMC and
incorporates additional fields for PBS prescribing and supply.

This change aims to:

-   reduce the regulatory and administrative burden for health
    professionals
-   improve hospital efficiency by providing an alternate option for
    prescribing, dispensing, supplying and claiming of PBS medicines,
    and
-   improve the quality and safety of medication management
