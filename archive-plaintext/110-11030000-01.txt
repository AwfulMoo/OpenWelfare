This document outlines various sources and methods for gathering
information and evidence for fraud investigations.

Undertaking an investigation

When planning to gather information and evidence, all critical decisions
must be recorded and approved by the Senior Investigator/Approver of
Investigations or Regional Investigations Operations Meeting (RIOM) as
appropriate before the proposed action is undertaken.

While undertaking an investigation, it is important to obtain and record
the best evidence available to maximise the possibility of a successful
outcome for the investigation. All evidence collected must be reliable
and relevant to the aims of the investigation.

The Australian Government Investigations Standards (AGIS) state that the
primary purpose of an investigation is to gather admissible evidence for
any subsequent action, whether under criminal, civil penalty, civil,
disciplinary or administrative sanctions. The AGIS establishes the
recommended minimum standards to be followed.

Information and evidence

Sources for information and evidence include:

-   internal evidence (customer records and search tools for
    interrogating internal and limited external data, self service
    evidence, CCTV footage)
-   information from other government agencies
-   information from the customer (and their partner), including
    customer interviews
-   information from third parties
-   witness statements
-   expert witness/statements
-   forensic evidence/technical evidence provided by the Australian
    Federal Police (AFP)
-   search warrants
-   optical surveillance
