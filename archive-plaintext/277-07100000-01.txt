This document outlines information about Child Support parents (either
the payee or payer) who can apply to have additional income earned
following separation excluded from their child support assessment.

Definition of post separation income (PSI)

PSI is income earned by a parent:

-   after they separated from the other parent
-   not have been earned in the ordinary course of events and
-   is of a type that is reasonable to expect would not have been earned
    prior to separation

A customer can apply to have some of their PSI excluded from the child
support assessment. The exclusion of PSI reduces the adjusted taxable
income for that parent.

There are several requirements that must be met to have income earned
post separation excluded. This includes how long ago the parents
separated and the type of income earned.

There is no requirement for the customer to show or incur the actual
costs due to the separation or re-establishment.
