|                                   | Bruce arrived in Australia from   |
|                                   | South Africa at age 66 years, and |
|                                   | was granted Age Pension at age    |
|                                   | 76. Bruce is departing Australia  |
|                                   | for 12 months from early October  |
|                                   | for a holiday in South Africa to  |
|                                   | spend time with family. Bruce     |
|                                   | receives the maximum rate of      |
|                                   | pension payment.                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Bruce's Age Pension is portable   |
|                                   | indefinitely and will continue to |
|                                   | receive the full rate of pension  |
|                                   | for the first 26 weeks of absence |
|                                   | from Australia.                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The full pension rate will        |
|                                   | include the Pension Supplement    |
|                                   | for the first 6 weeks of Bruce's  |
|                                   | absence. After 6 weeks, the basic |
|                                   | pension rate and only the Pension |
|                                   | Supplement Basic Amount is        |
|                                   | payable.                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | After 26 weeks, the Age Pension   |
|                                   | will be proportionalised based on |
|                                   | Bruce's working life residence    |
|                                   | (WLR). As Bruce has no WLR        |
|                                   | because of the arrival in         |
|                                   | Australia after already turning   |
|                                   | pension age, the payment will     |
|                                   | stop.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Bruce will have to reapply for    |
|                                   | Age Pension and again provide     |
|                                   | proof of Australian residence on  |
|                                   | return to Australia.              |

|                                   | Sarah, who was born in Australia  |
|                                   | and always lived here, decided to |
|                                   | go on a world trip after turning  |
|                                   | Age Pension age. Sarah is leaving |
|                                   | Australia in February for a       |
|                                   | holiday of around 12 months.      |
|                                   | Sarah is receiving the maximum    |
|                                   | rate of Age Pension.              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Sarah's Age Pension is portable   |
|                                   | indefinitely and will continue to |
|                                   | be paid at the normal rate of     |
|                                   | pension for the first 6 weeks of  |
|                                   | the absence. After 6 weeks, the   |
|                                   | normal basic rate of Age Pension  |
|                                   | will continue but the Pension     |
|                                   | Supplement will reduce to the     |
|                                   | Pension Supplement Basic Amount.  |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | (WLR). As Sarah has always lived  |
|                                   | in Australia, the WLR is the      |
|                                   | maximum 420/420.                  |

|                                   | Sarah is also continuing to pay   |
|                                   | rent and will continue to qualify |
|                                   | for Rent Assistance for 26 weeks  |
