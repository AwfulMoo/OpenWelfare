Bulk billing

Bulk billing is when a Medicare card holder assigns their Medicare
Benefit Scheme (MBS) payments to the health professional. The health
professional claims the Medicare benefit directly on behalf of the
patient for medical or allied health services.

Debt can result from:

incorrect claiming by:

-   health professionals
-   pharmacists
-   members of the public

processing errors by Services Australia

The Medicare Assessing and Benefits team process the adjustment in the
Medicare system. They then advise Medicare Recovery to invoice and
follow up recovery.

The Resources page contains links to contact details, mainframe search
commands, SAP Assignment field values and an example of the Debt Advice
Notice (DAN) – Bulk bill overpayment form.
