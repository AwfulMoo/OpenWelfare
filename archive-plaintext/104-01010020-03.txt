Disclosing information about collection and enforcement action

Customer information is generally protected under child support law,
unless an exception to the law applies. Staff are prohibited from
disclosing collection information to a customer under the agency's
secrecy obligations

Section 113(2) Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988
allows the Registrar to take steps considered appropriate to keep
customers informed of action taken to recover debts due to the
Commonwealth under the Act in relation to the liability.

Staff need to consider whether disclosure is appropriate before
discussing with the customer:

-   any collection actions that may have been taken by Child Support, or
-   how Child Support obtained information that resulted in collection
    action
