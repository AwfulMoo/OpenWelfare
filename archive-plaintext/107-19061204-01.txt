This document outlines information on processing Manual Follow-up (MFU)
tax activities generated as a result of negative amounts on payment
summaries due to compensation debts.

On this Page:

Correcting Compensation debts

Compensation Recovery Teams (CRT) need to:

investigate the error

correct the debt component amount for a debt raised on the:

-   customer entitlement
-   customer and partner entitlement as separate debts, or
-   customer and partner entitlement raised as a single debt

CRT may refer the debt to the Decision Maker (DM) for investigation and
correction.

Actioning MFU tax activities

Where there is a negative amount, a MFU tax activity appears on the
customer record. This prevents the issue of the payment summary.
