This document outlines a summary for Service Officers for when a
recipient requests payment to be directed to a third party such as
educational institutions, secondary boarding schools, hostels, or group
schedule payments made to an organisation.

Re-direct recipients' payments

Recipients may elect to have another person or organisation (a payment
nominee) receive their payments from Services Australia on their behalf.

Particular care should be exercised when dealing with requests to
re-direct recipients' payments to third parties.

Circumstances where payment can be made to another person

Payment to another person/party should only occur if:

-   there is a group payment arrangement
-   a payment nominee has been appointed
-   the recipient is incapable of managing their financial affairs and
    there is a formal guardianship arrangement, (including court
    appointed arrangements)
-   payment to an institution
-   it is necessary to alleviate the recipient's immediate hardship by
    making an urgent payment to a third party on a one-off basis
-   the ABSTUDY student is aged 16 to 17 years the payment goes to the
    parent unless the parent authorises it to go to the dependent
    student
-   the ABSTUDY student is under 16 years of age the payment will
    normally go to the parent
-   payments for a secondary school boarding student made directly to
    the boarding school or hostel
-   School Fees Allowance made direct to the school, or
-   payment of course fees or Student Contribution (previously Higher
    Education Contribution Scheme (HECS)) for Masters and Doctorate
    students made directly to the University or to the Australian
    Taxation Office (ATO)

Note: see ABSTUDY customer in state care to determine the correct payee
