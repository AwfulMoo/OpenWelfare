This procedure outlines how to action a cancellation, restoration or
suspension for payments using Customer First SAP native technology - the
term used globally relating to software designed specifically for the
platform on which it is running (SAP HANA). Any decision to cancel,
restore or suspend payments must be made in accordance with legislation
and only after appropriate process has been complied with.

Change Processes

Once a decision has been made to manually suspend, cancel or restore the
customer's payment, on the customer's record:

-   select the approved Social Service Plan (SSP)
-   select Change Processes in the header (next to Planned Payments)
-   select the action required
-   record the date of effect and other details as appropriate
-   execute the update

Once the update is applied to the customer record, a follow up SSP will
be generated. This SSP must be approved for the customer's payment to be
reassessed.

See the relevant procedure for payment specific assessment and protocol
information.

Note: Change Processes cannot be actioned if there is an outstanding or
incomplete SSP requiring approval.
