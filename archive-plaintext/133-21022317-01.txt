This document outlines how to help customers manage their Child Support
messages and notifications online.

Self service and EM

Self service is the preferred way for customers to do business with
Services Australia. Encourage customers to use self service as online
services are private and secure.

EM enables the agency to contact customers by SMS, email or myGov
messages about things that are important. If appropriate, customers may
receive messages instead of letters.

Messages for Child Support customers currently include SMS desktop
messages - such as pre call notifications, general notifications,
requests and reminders.

Note: Only use SMS messages. Do not use myGov messages as although they
are visible in Pluto, they are not yet approved.

Customers will be automatically subscribed to EM if they provide a
mobile phone number or email address. If a customer wants to
unsubscribe, Service Officers can opt the customer out of SMS messaging.
See Products and services Cuba Process Help.

SMS messages cannot be sent to Restricted Access Customers (RAC),
customers using an overseas mobile number or employers at this time.

The Resources page contains a table detailing the EM available for
desktop messaging, contact details of the Specialised Assessment
Services (SAS) Team, a link to the myGov website and a link to mySupport
to report issues with messages.
