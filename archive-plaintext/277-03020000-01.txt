This document outlines information about how to identify and manage
reverse Child Support cases.

Reverse child support cases

A reverse case occurs when both parents are (or have been) assessed to
pay child support for a child. Cuba generates two linked cases to show
each parent’s liability reflected in a single assessment. The References
page contains a link to policy information about applications.

Non-parent carer cases are a type of reverse case and as such the
procedures relating to reverse child support cases also apply to
non-parent carer cases.

Note: prior to 1 July 2008, reverse cases referred to parents having
dual roles as both payer and payee where each parent was assessed
independently.

Other types of cases referenced in this document include:

-   Formula departure – a change of assessment, court order or agreement
    varies the administrative assessment and applies to all children of
    the case
-   Mixed assessment – an administrative assessment applies to some
    children of the case and a change of assessment decision, court
    order or agreement applies to other child/ren of the same case
-   Multi-case - payer is assessed for the cost of the children in
    separate cases and either a multi-case allowance or multi-case cap
    applies
-   Non parent carer - an eligible carer of the child who is not a
    parent of the child
-   Assessments that do not automatically generate in Cuba and require
    manual processing

The Resources page contains a range of tools that will assist Service
Officers when managing reverse child support cases.
