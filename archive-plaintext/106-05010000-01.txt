This document outlines information for calculating the start day of a
social security payment or coverage of the Commonwealth Seniors Health
Card (CSHC) or Low Income Health Care Card (LIC).

Start day definition

The start day is the first day a social security payment is payable to a
person and the day from which the customer is paid.

The start day of a payment or concession card is calculated based on the
day a claim is made. In some circumstances the start day may be earlier
or later than the date a claim is made depending on factors such as
backdating provisions and waiting periods.
