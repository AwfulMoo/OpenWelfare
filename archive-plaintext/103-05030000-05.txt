Exceptions to alignment of entitlement periods for couples

Some couples are not required to have their entitlement periods aligned
due to these recipient groups having relatively few changes in
circumstances.

For example, where one member of the couple is:

-   Being paid through group payments, or
-   Being paid via International Services (CIS) as customer is living
    overseas.
