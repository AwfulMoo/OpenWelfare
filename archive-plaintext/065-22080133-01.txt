This document outlines the process to resolve aged care enquiries for
Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA) customers.

DVA aged care enquiries

Services Australia and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA) both
process aged care means assessments. The care recipient’s circumstances
determines if Services Australia or DVA is responsible for the means
assessment.

Aged care recipients or their nominees may contact Services Australia or
DVA with enquiries about their aged care.

In some instances, Services Australia cannot resolve the enquiry because
the person is a DVA ‘customer’, or because there is insufficient
information on the person’s aged care records.

Services Australia may contact DVA when investigating quarterly review
refunds or instances when fees have not been set, to request means
assessment data is sent again.

DVA cannot assist with requests to:

-   fix data in the Aged Care Management Payment System (ACMPS) or the
    Aged Care Staff Portal (ACSP);
-   recalculate fees
-   reprint or reissue letters;
-   retransmit data that appears in ACMPS as a way of updating SPARC
    with data; and
-   liaise with service providers regarding care recipient’s fees

DVA responsibility

DVA is responsible for aged care means assessments for its aged care
recipients. For more information about which assessments DVA is
responsible for see Aged care DVA – responsible departments on the
Resources page.
