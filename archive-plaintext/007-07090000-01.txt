This document outlines information on cancelling and restoring Family
Tax Benefit (FTB) and rejecting a claim for FTB.

FTB processing

Cancellation of FTB usually occurs when a reassessment due to a change
of circumstances results in a loss of entitlement, for example when a
child leaves care. Payment can cancel automatically when the change of
circumstance is recorded on the system or be manually cancelled using
the appropriate cancellation code.

To restore FTB instalments the reason for the cancellation needs to be
taken into account. FTB must also have been cancelled in the current or
previous financial year and the customer must have remained eligible for
all of the period since cancellation.

Rejection of FTB claims

The process for rejecting an FTB claim is part of assessing the claim.
The claim can be automatically rejected based on information coded on
the system such as income or manually rejected using one of the FTB
rejection codes.
