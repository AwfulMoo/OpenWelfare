Definition of Level 2 complaint

A Level 2 complaint is a complaint that cannot be resolved at Level 1 or
meets the Complaint Escalation Reasons. All complaints are managed in
accordance with the Services Australia Customer Complaints and Feedback
Policy.

Level 2 complaints are managed by Complaints Officers who receive
complaints via:

-   warm phone transfer escalation
-   the Customer Feedback Tool as an escalated complaint
-   written complaints, including online
-   the Parliamentary Document Management System (PDMS)
-   internal sources, such as Centrelink Customer Liaison Officers or
    Digital Media Section
-   external agencies, such as the Ombudsman or a Member of Parliament

A customer may use multiple avenues to lodge a complaint about the same
or different issues

When a complaint is received it is immediately prioritised and then
escalated in specific circumstances.

Role of the Level 2 Complaints Officer

A Level 2 Complaints Officer uses knowledge and understanding of a
subject area to provide services to customers with multiple complex
needs or facing significant disadvantage.

A Complaints Officer's role is to investigate, analyse and assess
complex, sensitive and contentious customer issues that meet 1 or more
of the complaints escalation reasons. Complaints Officers should take a
holistic approach and collaborate with a wide range of internal and
external stakeholders to gather information, resolve customer issues and
make referrals.

Complaints Officers are expected to manage complaints from start to
finish, exercise both initiative and judgement in the interpretation of
policy and in the application of practices and procedures.

A Complaints Officer manages and organises their own work in the context
of competing priorities, including contributing to business planning,
changes in workplace practices and business improvement strategies.

Complaints officers must uphold and promote the principles of fairness
from the Commonwealth Ombudsman's Better Practice Guide to Complaint
Handling:

Impartiality - impartial investigation is vital to the credibility and
success of a complaint handling system

Confidentiality - complainants have a right to expect that their privacy
will be respected and their complaint will be investigated in private

Transparency - a complainant is entitled to know how a complaint will be
handled and the outcome of the investigation. Complaints Officers should
ensure that:

-   at the time of making a complaint, complainants are advised of the
    steps in the complaint process and expected timeliness standards for
    handling the complaint
-   a contact number is given to each complainant, preferably with the
    name of a contact person
-   a report on progress is provided if a complaint is not resolved
    promptly, with an explanation for the delay
-   the outcome of an investigation is explained and reasons are
    provided if the evidence presented by the complainant is not
    accepted
-   the complainant is given an opportunity to respond or to seek
    internal review if they are not satisfied with the decision made
    about their complaint

Better Practice Guide to Complaint Handling.

Positive Complaint Culture

Complaints Officers are expected to promote a positive and transparent
complaint and feedback culture and actively support staff to prioritise
complaint resolution and record complaints, compliments and suggestions.

To build and maintain a positive complaint culture, it is essential that
Complaints Officers:

-   provide business feedback or feedback about behavioural complaints
    in a timely manner and ensure it is evaluated by managers
-   encourage staff and managers to be actively involved in the ongoing
    review and evaluation of the complaint management process, applying
    their knowledge, skills and experience to enhance service delivery
    by escalating potential systemic issues and opportunities for
    improvement
-   promote the value of complaints and encourage people to complain if
    they are dissatisfied or feel aggrieved. Complaints help improve
    policies, systems and service delivery
-   treat complaints confidentially, and ensure there are no adverse
    repercussions for a complainant

Staff and customer safety

If a customer making a complaint is aggressive or making threats staff
and customer safety is the top priority. Complaints Officers should talk
to a manager or team leader, report the incident and access the support
that is available to staff and customers. If a customer threatens to
harm themselves or another person, respond immediately.

Many customers contact the agency at times when they are vulnerable and
in crisis. Support for customers and staff is available:

-   Customer aggression
-   Customers talking about suicide or self-harm
-   Family and Domestic Violence
-   referral of customers to a Social Worker
-   Escalation Coordination Team, link available on the Resources page

Managing unreasonable complainant behaviour

Unreasonable complainant behaviour is when the complainant displays
behaviour that requires more intensive management in order to progress
and resolve the complaint. It includes:

-   unreasonable persistence
-   unreasonable demands
-   unreasonable lack of cooperation
-   unreasonable arguments
-   unreasonable behaviour

Complaints Officers should attempt to take control of interactions with
complainants, managing complainant behaviour separately from managing
the issue. Complaints Officers must remain calm in response to
unreasonable behaviour, be impartial and treat the complainant with
fairness and respect. When investigating a complaint it is critical to
separate the behaviour from the issue, so that the issue can be
effectively addressed without it being clouded by behavioural problems.

Complainants are expected to show respect for and cooperate with
Complaints Officers as a prerequisite to further contact and
communication. It is important that Complaints Officers set boundaries
for the customer including that continued aggression may result in
ending a call. The Complaints Officer should advise they are trying to
help and details are required to investigate the customer's complaint,
but that aggression makes it difficult for the Complaints Officer to get
the information required to help the customer.

It is critical that complaints staff show respect for all complainants.
Where unreasonable complainant conduct is involved, limiting the
complainant's contact with the agency may need to be considered and/or a
referral to Personalised Services.

Complaints officers should make it clear to complainants that:

-   the agency owns the complaint - the agency decides whether the
    complaint will be dealt with and if so, who by, how quickly, with
    what priority, what resources will be given to it and what the
    outcome will be
-   complainants own their issue - they are free to raise it through
    other available avenues

Value of complaints and business improvement

Compliments, suggestions and complaints provide the agency with a
valuable source of information to:

-   assess performance
-   identify systemic issues
-   assist in training, development and support for staff
-   recognise the value of good service through staff compliments
-   assist in building individual and organisational capability and
    improvements to customer service
-   identify complaint trends impacting on service
-   provide evidence of a service or policy affecting customers

After a complaint is finalised the Level 2 Complaints Officer may take
additional follow up action such as:

-   recording a compliment or suggestion from the customer
-   providing feedback to individual staff or business teams
-   reporting systemic issues
-   escalating a matter to the Media Section, or
-   making a report to the Fraud Prevention team

Responding to a complaint in writing

The agencyâ€™s Customer Complaints and Feedback Policy states that when
appropriate and available, customers and complainants will be
communicated with about their complaint or feedback over the phone.
However written responses can apply in certain scenarios such as:

-   a complaint acknowledgement letter following receipt of an Ombudsman
    warm transfer
-   the customer has requested a written response only
-   a verbal response was provided however the customer has additionally
    requested written confirmation of the complaint response
-   the Level 2 Complaints Officer in consultation with their leadership
    team makes a decision that it is the most appropriate way to respond
    to a customer
-   a manager chooses to write to a customer to address their behaviour
    where the customer has displayed unacceptable behaviours towards a
    Complaints Officer
-   feedback is required to be written in a language other than English
-   the customer is a Restricted Servicing Arrangement write only
    customer. Consideration must be applied to any current servicing
    arrangement requirements that a customer has in place and these must
    be adhered to
