Temporary cessation of care and portability provisions

Table 2: this table describes how to determine when to record
portability details or a temporary cessation of care (respite) or both,
depending on the circumstances.

|                                   | Portability must be coded. See    |

|                                   | However, the situation may also   |
|                                   | be an absence for example:        |
|                                   | respite or hospitalisation. If    |
|                                   | so, that absence must be coded as |

|                                   | person's payment before the       |
