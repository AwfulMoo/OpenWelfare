| 1                                 | Imputation credits for companies  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A company is a taxpayer in its    |
|                                   | own right. This means that any    |
|                                   | dividend which it receives from   |
|                                   | its investments - both from       |
|                                   | shares in other companies and     |
|                                   | from managed investments - may    |
|                                   | have imputation credits attached  |
|                                   | to them. These imputation credits |
|                                   | are income in the 'hands' of the  |
|                                   | company, but will not show up in  |
|                                   | the profit and loss statements of |
|                                   | the company because they may be   |
|                                   | offset against any tax payable by |
|                                   | the company. Therefore, the       |
|                                   | imputation credits attached to    |
|                                   | dividends received by a company   |
|                                   | have to be added to the           |
|                                   | accounting profit of the company. |
|                                   | The basic rules of imputation     |
|                                   | are:                              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   for a company (private or     |
|                                   |     public) the amount of franked |
|                                   |     dividend declared does not    |
|                                   |     include the imputation credit |
|                                   |     and the two need to be added  |
|                                   |     together                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | For example, if $700 franked      |
|                                   | dividend is declared as income,   |
|                                   | and a $300 imputation credit,     |
|                                   | then the income to be assessed is |
|                                   | $700 + $300 = $1,000.             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | For a controlled private company  |
|                                   | the income may include amounts    |
|                                   | from other public companies and   |
|                                   | CAOs should include in the income |
|                                   | of the entity the imputation      |
|                                   | credits as outlined above for the |
|                                   | controllers (that is, add them on |
|                                   | for companies).                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | For non-controllers assessed only |
|                                   | on distribution income or         |
|                                   | controllers who receive income    |
|                                   | greater than their attributed     |
|                                   | amount then for a private company |
|                                   | dividend the imputation credit    |
|                                   | will have to be added on to the   |
|                                   | dividend.                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Note: be careful here because     |
|                                   | it's possible the client received |
|                                   | more than their share because     |
|                                   | they received a payment from      |
|                                   | prior year profits.               |

| 2                                 | Imputation credits for trusts     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A trust does not pay tax in its   |
|                                   | own right, but can be assessed    |
|                                   | separately on income which it     |
|                                   | does not distribute. This means   |
|                                   | that the profit and loss          |
|                                   | statement of a trust will include |
|                                   | the imputation credits attached   |
|                                   | to dividends which it receives    |
|                                   | because, usually, they are        |
|                                   | distributed to the beneficiaries  |
|                                   | and the beneficiaries are the     |
|                                   | ones who take advantage of the    |
|                                   | imputation credits. The basic     |
|                                   | rules of imputation are:          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   for a trust (private and      |
|                                   |     managed fund) the             |
|                                   |     distribution amount on the    |
|                                   |     trust's tax return and the    |
|                                   |     client's tax return are       |
|                                   |     already grossed up to include |
|                                   |     the imputation credit, that   |
|                                   |     is the imputation credit is   |
|                                   |     already included in the       |
|                                   |     distribution amount declared  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | For example, if $1,000 is         |
|                                   | declared as a distribution and a  |
|                                   | $300 imputation credit, then the  |
|                                   | income to be assessed is $1,000.  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | For a controlled private trust    |
|                                   | the income may include amounts    |
|                                   | from other public trusts and CAOs |
|                                   | should include in the income of   |

|                                   | as outlined above for the         |

|                                   | Instructions state that franking  |
