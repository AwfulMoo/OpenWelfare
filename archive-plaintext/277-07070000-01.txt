This document outlines the procedures to follow where a parent elects to
have their assessment based on an estimate of income pre July 2010.

Overview

Where a parent's income varies significantly from that used in the
current child support assessment, the Child Support (Assessment) Act
1989 allows the parent to elect to have their assessment based on an
estimate of income in some circumstances.

This document applies to:

-   WA ex nuptial customers who have an existing estimate that was
    lodged before 3 March 2011. If these customers lodge a subsequent
    estimate within the same child support period, the pre-1 July 2010
    legislation will continue to apply until the end of that child
    support period. Once a new child support period begins the post
    1-July 2010 legislation will apply to any future estimates. For
    further information see Child support estimates (post 1 July 2010).
-   customers that have an estimate lodged before 1 July 2010 for a
    child support period which has not ended

For all other customers, see Child support estimates (post 1 July 2010).

For more information about WA ex nuptial customers, see WA Child Support
ex-nuptial cases.

For details on reviewing or reconciling an estimate, see:

-   Child support estimates (post 1 July 2010).
-   Child support estimates - Reconcile (pre 1 July 2011)
