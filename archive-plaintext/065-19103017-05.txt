| 2                                 | How do I calculate the daily      |
|                                   | means tested care fee (MTCF)?     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The daily MTCF is determined by   |
|                                   | comparing the MTCF daily amount   |
|                                   | in excess of the maximum          |
|                                   | accommodation supplement ($54.39  |
|                                   | as at 20 September 2016) up to    |
|                                   | the cost of care subsidy per day. |

|                                   | For example, if the MTCF daily    |
|                                   | amount is $80.00 and the maximum  |
|                                   | accommodation supplement is       |
|                                   | $54.39 and the care subsidy is    |
|                                   | $30.00 the fee calculation is:    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | $80.00 - $54.39 = $25.61          |

|                                   | As $25.61 is less than the        |
|                                   | subsidised cost of care ($30.00)  |
|                                   | the daily MTCF the care recipient |
|                                   | pays is $25.61.                   |

|                                   | Note: the MTCF amount can vary    |
|                                   | after entering residential care   |
|                                   | if the care recipient's           |
