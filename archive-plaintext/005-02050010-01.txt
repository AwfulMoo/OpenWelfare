This document explains the process to obtain a Tax File Number (TFN)
from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) for a newly arrived refugee
customer.

TFN and new claims

Legislation does not allow a customer an exemption from providing their
TFN under any circumstances. However, in limited circumstances, a
customer may be exempted from providing their partner's TFN details, see
Provision of Tax File Number for family assistance and Paid Parental
Leave scheme payments.

Family Tax Benefit (FTB) is not payable without a TFN. This requirement
impacts newly arrived refugees and can cause delays in their access to
payments and services.

To provide assistance as quickly as possible, Services Australia and the
ATO have an agreement to process and provide fast access to a TFN.

Note: the fast track process applies where the customer is claiming FTB.
If the customer is claiming an income support payment only, it is not
necessary to fast track the TFN process as those payments may be granted
with an exemption code. The ATO then have up to 28 days to provide the
TFN.

Privacy requirements

To ensure this process meets privacy and other requirements of both
agencies, it is necessary for a:

-   TFN application to be lodged online in the name of the customer
    through the ATO's Online Individual Auto Registration (IAR) tool. If
    the customer has a Department of Home Affairs issued ImmiCard, see
    the Process page for further coding information
-   Letter of Authority - for person granted a Humanitarian/Refugee Visa
    (SS435) form to be faxed to the ATO allowing Centrelink to receive
    the TFN on behalf of the customer

The Resources page contains links to the:

-   Letter of Authority - for person granted a Humanitarian/Refugee visa
    (SS435) form
-   ATO's Online Individual auto registration (IAR) tool
-   Australian Taxation Office website
