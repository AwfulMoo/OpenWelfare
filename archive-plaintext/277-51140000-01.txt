This document outlines general information about forms used by family
assistance and Child Support in relation to child support. It contains
separate procedures that give detailed information about completing the
various forms.

Customer contact with Child Support

Customers are to contact Child Support directly, either [] online or by
phone, to apply for a child support assessment, and to advise a change
in circumstances that could affect their child support arrangements.
This allows the Child Support Officer to check that all necessary
details are obtained and that the customer is given advice about their
child support options. Refer the customer to Child Support. For contact
details, see Child Support.

Advice on completing forms

Many customers who claim child support payments through Child Support
are also Centrelink customers. Their efforts to receive child support
and the amount of child support they receive can affect their rate of
Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A. Centrelink has a duty to ensure that
these customers are given accurate advice about how to complete forms to
claim child support and advise details of their circumstances in
relation to child support/maintenance.

Centrelink delivers services on behalf of Child Support. Centrelink
accepts Child Support forms from customers and forwards them to Child
Support for processing. Family assistance customers may need to lodge
the forms with Centrelink to show they are taking reasonable action to
receive child support.

The Resources page contains contact details for Child Support.
