|                                   | provider must be specific with    |
|                                   | the condition being treated. DVA  |
|                                   | Clients with eligibility for PAMT |

|                                   | It is expected they provide this  |

|                                   | ensure the treatment is for the   |
|                                   | condition they have claimed for.  |
|                                   | The provider has visibility of    |

| 7                                 | Question: How can Service         |
|                                   | Officers check whether a patient  |
|                                   | is currently PAMT approved or not |
|                                   | approved?                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: DVA VIEW screen will      |
|                                   | display most current PAMT         |
|                                   | eligibility. When Service         |
|                                   | Officers come across PAMT under   |
|                                   | VEXI, refer the claim to either a |
|                                   | PSO or staff member with DVA VIEW |
|                                   | access to determine whether the   |
|                                   | patient is currently approved or  |
|                                   | not approved for PAMT. If ‘not    |
|                                   | approved’ appears on VIEW and the |
|                                   | patient does not have any         |
|                                   | matching accepted white card      |
|                                   | disabilities for the condition    |
|                                   | treated by the provider –reject   |
|                                   | with relevant reason code. If the |
|                                   | patient is approved, check one of |
|                                   | the 20 PAMT conditions has been   |
|                                   | treated - override and pay the    |
|                                   | service(s). No PAMT condition     |
|                                   | specified – reject with relevant  |
|                                   | reason code.                      |
