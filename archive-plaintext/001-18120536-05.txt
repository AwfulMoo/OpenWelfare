|                                   | of an extended lodgement period   |
|                                   | and fails to do so, the job       |
|                                   | seeker's record will cancel (14   |
|                                   | days after the due to lodge date) |

|                                   | adjustments to the debt.          |

|                                   | restoration equal the debt amount |

|                                   | history will be incorrect.        |

|                                   | This processing will only FND an  |
|                                   | undetermined debt. If the debt    |
|                                   | has already been raised, and then |
|                                   | the job seeker reports, the DMIS  |
|                                   | debt will not be automatically    |

|                                   | restored. In this case, the debt  |
|                                   | will need to be FND manually. The |

|                                   | responsible for making            |
|                                   | adjustments to the debt.          |

|                                   | the restoration is less than the  |
|                                   | debt amount calculated by the     |
|                                   | cancellation (for example, due to |

|                                   | working credit (if any), the      |
|                                   | arrears will be used to reduce    |
|                                   | the undetermined (or waived) debt |
|                                   | balance. If there are             |
|                                   | insufficient arrears to FND the   |
|                                   | debt, the remaining amount should |
|                                   | be raised as per normal debt      |

|                                   | If the job seeker has returned to |
|                                   | work (RTW), when the record is    |

|                                   | income and the system will adjust |
|                                   | any working credit (if            |
|                                   | applicable) and cancel the job    |
|                                   | seeker from the appropriate date  |
|                                   | and with the appropriate reason.  |
|                                   | An historical Reporting Statement |
|                                   | cannot be coded if the job        |
|                                   | seeker's record was CAN/DNL, and  |
|                                   | later regranted. The Reporting    |
|                                   | Statement can only be coded if    |
|                                   | the record was restored. In this  |
|                                   | case, if the job seeker was       |
|                                   | entitled during the period of the |
|                                   | Reporting Statement, the debt     |
|                                   | will need to be manually FND.     |

|                                   | still have to report?             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: Yes. If a job seeker      |
|                                   | returns to full-time work during  |
|                                   | a variable reporting cycle,       |
|                                   | advise to still report to avoid a |
|                                   | debt being raised for the period  |
|                                   | already paid. This ensures        |
|                                   | payment is made for any eligible  |
|                                   | period within that fortnight.     |

| 4                                 | Question: If a customer has a     |
|                                   | change in circumstances during a  |
|                                   | variable reporting cycle, do they |
|                                   | still have to lodge their         |
|                                   | Reporting Statement?              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: Yes. Job seekers on a     |
|                                   | variable reporting cycle are      |
|                                   | required to report changes in     |
|                                   | their circumstances by the end of |
|                                   | the fortnight entitlement period  |
|                                   | when the change occurred, and not |
|                                   | wait until the variable report    |
|                                   | due date. Failure to report in a  |
|                                   | timely manner may result in a     |
|                                   | debt.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | In addition, the change in        |
|                                   | circumstances may result in a     |
|                                   | change in the variable reporting  |
|                                   | frequency being reverted to 2     |
|                                   | weekly. For example, job seeker   |
|                                   | commenced employment and declare  |
|                                   | employment income that is above   |
|                                   | the Income Free Area (IFA) will   |
|                                   | result in reporting frequency     |
|                                   | changing to 2 weekly.             |
