This document explains details about how an Organisation record can be
created and updated in Customer First for ABSTUDY purposes.

ABSTUDY payments to third parties

Certain ABSTUDY payments are made directly to institutions, such as
schools or hostels. In some cases, if the qualification for a payment
has stopped, an institution may be regarded as a debtor. In both of
these scenarios, an Organisation record is needed.
