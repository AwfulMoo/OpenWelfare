This document explains details about how an Organisation record can be
created and updated in Customer First for ABSTUDY purposes and the
escalation procedure for Assistance for Isolated Children Organisational
record creation or updates.

ABSTUDY payments to third parties

Certain ABSTUDY and Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) payments are
made directly to institutions, such as schools or hostels. In some
cases, if the qualification for a payment has stopped, an institution
may be regarded as a debtor. In both of these scenarios, an Organisation
record is needed.
