|                                   | CCB, Service Officers are to      |
|                                   | complete an Assisted Customer     |
|                                   | Claim (ACC) for CCB. The ACC will |
|                                   | have the additional CCS question  |
|                                   | set to ensure the new child is    |
|                                   | assessed for CCS. The CCF New     |
|                                   | Claim guided procedure must not   |
|                                   | be used in these circumstances as |
|                                   | it does not include the CCS       |
|                                   | questions and there is no trigger |
|                                   | for the child to be assessed for  |
|                                   | CCS once the claim is processed.  |
|                                   | If the CCF New Claim guided       |
|                                   | procedure was used, customers     |
|                                   | will need to lodge a new claim    |
|                                   | for CCS for the additional child  |
