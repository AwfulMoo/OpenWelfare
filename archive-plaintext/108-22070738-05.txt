|                                   | 4567 891 and realises that Kitty  |

|                                   | were incorrect, as the customer   |
|                                   | felt their ‘taxable’ income to be |
|                                   | assessed should be $694.80 per    |

|                                   | answers no. If it did include     |
|                                   | free or discounted accommodation, |
|                                   | the customer would be asked the   |
