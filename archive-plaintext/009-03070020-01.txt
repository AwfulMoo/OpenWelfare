This document outlines the process when a carer or care receiver advises
of a change of address and the carer is in receipt of CP and/or CA.

Change of details

All carers must notify Services Australia of a change of address within
14 days of moving.

A home address change for the carer or carer receiver, may generate a
manual follow-up (MFU) on the record the update has occurred. Service
Officers must investigate the MFU to check continuing eligibility to
receive CP and/or CA and if any further action or information is
required.

If a carer's mail is returned from an address held on the agency's
records, contact the carer or their Correspondence nominee by phone.

If the carer’s correct address details cannot be obtained:

-   record the contact attempts to the carer on their record, and
-   suspend their payments(s) as whereabouts unknown

Change of address via Centrelink online account or Express Plus mobile app

A carer's eligibility to continue to receive CA is re-assessed when
they:

-   update their address using Centrelink online account or via the
    Centrelink Express Plus mobile app, and
-   advise they no longer live with the care receiver aged 16 years or
    over

The change of address creates an ‘Update your caring details’ online
task. The carer completes the task using their Centrelink online account
or Centrelink Express Plus mobile app. Do not issue a 'Carer Allowance
Questionnaire (SA381). While updating their address, the carer is
advised to tell the care receiver to update their address with
Centrelink.

Care situations - principal home exemptions

A carer or care receiver who vacates their principal home to enter a
care situation may be entitled to a 2 year asset test exemption on their
former principal home. This 2 year exemption may apply if the:

-   care receiver has left their principal home to receive care in a
    care situation in a private home for at least 14 consecutive days
-   carer has left their principal home to provide a substantial level
    of care to a person in a private home for at least 14 consecutive
    days

CP

The CP qualifications require that the care must be provided in a
private residence (the home of the carer or care receiver).

It is not necessary for the carer and the care receiver to live in the
same home for CP qualification. However, a review must be carried out if
either person notifies a change of address, to ensure the carer
continues to provide constant care.

If the carer and care receiver are not living together, consider the
time taken for the carer to travel to the care receiver's home. The
distance between the carer and care receiver's residences may make it
difficult for the carer to provide constant care to remain eligible for
CP. The accessibility of the carer to the care receiver, must be
considered to ensure qualifications continue to be met. See Actions to
establish eligibility for CP information on the Process page for more
details.

Note: constant care does not apply to CP (XWP) - Carer Payment (CP) that
is paid under grandfathering provisions for ceased Wife Pension carers.
Care requirements apply to CA as normal. See CA information below. If CA
care requirements are not met and the carer’s only or last payment level
CA is suspended or cancelled, CP (XWP) will auto-cancel. See Transfer
from Wife Pension (WP) to Carer Payment (CP).

CA under 16 years

When CA is paid to the carer of a child (under section 953 of the Social
Security Act), care and attention must be also provided in a private
home that is the residence of the carer and the care receiver.

Note: carers paid CA (auto) through qualification for CP (child)
including a child who has a terminal condition, are not subject to
standard provisions under CA (child). For instance, the child is not a
dependent child of the carer. See Eligibility for CA (auto) when a carer
is also receiving CP (child).

CA 16 years or over

If the carer notifies the agency they are no longer residing with the
care receiver in person or by phone, issue a ‘Carer Allowance
Questionnaire’ to the carer. This is because CA can be paid to carers
under 2 different provisions of the Social Security Act:

-   under section 954, care and attention must be provided in a private
    home that is the residence of the carer and the care receiver
-   under section 954A, CA may be paid if the care is provided in the
    private home of either the carer or care receiver. See Eligibility
    for CA (adult) when caring in a private home not shared by the adult
    and carer

Private residence

A private home can be any residence that a person regards as their home
if:

-   the person (either the carer, care receiver or sharing carer)
    actually lives in that residence, and
-   the person carries out their main domestic functions there, and
-   there are no commercial arrangements in place for the provision of
    personal care (such as those arrangements that may be found in a
    nursing home)

In general, for grants of CA under sections 953 or 954, the carer and
care receiver must reside together, unless certain exceptions are met.

considering constant care when the carer and care receiver are not
living together.
