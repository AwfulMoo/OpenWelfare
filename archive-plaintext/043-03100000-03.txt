|                                   | If a customer advises their       |
|                                   | activities are only a hobby (for  |
|                                   | example, hobby farm) the first    |
|                                   | decision to be made is whether    |
|                                   | the customer has undertaken       |
|                                   | activities for the purposes of    |
|                                   | making income - even in a small   |
|                                   | way. If the intention is to make  |
|                                   | income, then the net income and   |
|                                   | assets should be assessed as a    |
|                                   | business. If an activity is the   |
|                                   | main source of a customer’s       |
|                                   | income then it indicates that     |
|                                   | this activity is more than a      |
|                                   | hobby.                            |

|                                   | can make when determining whether |
|                                   | a customer has hobby income:      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   The customer is actually      |
|                                   |     running a business and the    |
|                                   |     income should be assessed as  |
|                                   |     part of their business        |
|                                   |     income. Generally previous    |
|                                   |     years financial statements    |
|                                   |     are used to make the income   |
|                                   |     assessment and it is coded on |
|                                   |     the Business Detail (BUS)     |
|                                   |     screen                        |

|                                   |     amounts received are ordinary |
|                                   |     income. No expenses can be    |
|                                   |     deducted from the income      |
|                                   |     because the customer is not   |
|                                   |     carrying on a business. These |
|                                   |     would be assessed as          |
|                                   |     non-remunerative lump sums    |
|                                   |     for a period of 52 weeks on   |
|                                   |     the Other Income (OIN) screen |
|                                   | -   No business exists and the    |
|                                   |     amounts received are not      |
|                                   |     ordinary income. This would   |
|                                   |     be the case when the thing    |
|                                   |     being sold is already         |
|                                   |     assessed as part of the       |
|                                   |     customer's assets, for        |
|                                   |     example, when a customer owns |
|                                   |     a small number of cattle on   |
|                                   |     land surrounding the family   |
|                                   |     home and the value of the     |
|                                   |     cattle are already included   |
|                                   |     in the customer's assets. If  |
|                                   |     the customer occasionally     |
|                                   |     sells one or more cattle, the |
|                                   |     money received for the sale   |
|                                   |     is not considered to be       |
|                                   |     income. An adjustment to the  |
|                                   |     customer’s assets may be      |
|                                   |     required due to the sale      |
