Examples of suggested text for Q999 sent in Customer First for
primary/secondary claimants when a primary claimant is transferring
their PPL entitlement to their partner:

Q999 - Primary claimant only has lodged a claim - customer is
transferring their full PPL entitlement and has returned to work before
lodging PPL claim.

'In your claim you indicated that you have returned to work and intend
to transfer your full Parental Leave Pay entitlement to another person.
Before we finalise your claim for Parental Leave Pay, the person you
intend to transfer your payment to, must lodge their claim. If they do
not lodge their claim within 14 days of this notice being issued,
Parental Leave Pay may not be payable for <child's name>.'

Q999 - Invite primary/secondary claimant to lodge a PPL claim

'We are writing to invite you to claim Paid Parental Leave for <child's
name>. You can lodge your claim by either accessing your Centrelink
online account through myGov and selecting 'Make a claim', or if you are
unable to use our online services, contact us on 136 150. You must lodge
your claim within 14 days of this notice being issued or Parental Leave
Pay may not be payable for <child's name>.'

Q999 NEF text to secondary claimant - primary claimant did not submit an
effective PPL claim

'We cannot pay you Parental Leave Pay because <your partner><the person
who is transferring their Parental Leave Pay entitlement to you> has not
submitted a claim for Paid Parental Leave. To be paid Parental Leave Pay
for <CHILD NAME> you will need to contact us once <your partner><the
person who is transferring their Parental Leave Pay entitlement to you>
has submitted their claim.'

Q999 NEF text to primary claimant - secondary claimant did not submit an
effective PPL claim

'We cannot pay you Parental Leave Pay because <your partner><the person
you are transferring your Parental Leave Pay entitlement to> has not
submitted a claim for Paid Parental Leave. To be paid Parental Leave Pay
for <CHILD NAME> you will need to contact us once <your partner><the
person you are transferring your Parental Leave Pay entitlement to > has
submitted their claim.'

Q999 text to secondary claimant when claim cannot be finalised until
closer to the PPL nominated start date

'As the nominated start for your Parental Leave Pay is not until <date>,
we cannot finalise your claim until <Nominated Start Date>. If <your
partner><the person who is transferring their Parental Leave Pay
entitlement to you> changes their nominated start date for the Paid
Parental Leave to an earlier date, you will need to contact us on 136
150 so we can assess your claim sooner.'

|                                   | is capable of doing so,           |

|                                   | mother but John has claimed       |
|                                   | because Julie is still in         |
|                                   | hospital and John has taken time  |
|                                   | off work to care for the family.  |

|                                   | considered the primary claimant.  |

|                                   | On 21 August, Julie submits an    |

|                                   | for example, because of the work  |
|                                   | or income tests, John will not be |
|                                   | eligible as a secondary claimant. |
|                                   | Julie or John should be invited   |
