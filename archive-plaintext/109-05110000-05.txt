|                                   | Chris and Sam are Lee’s parents   |
|                                   | and are customers of both         |
|                                   | Centrelink and Child Support.     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Sam provided a new parenting      |
|                                   | agreement to Centrelink about the |
|                                   | care of Lee. On 1 January         |
|                                   | Centrelink updated the care       |
|                                   | percentages so that Chris has 65% |
|                                   | care of Lee and Sam has 35% care  |
|                                   | of Lee. This was transmitted to   |
|                                   | Child Support. On 5 January,      |
|                                   | Chris and Sam both received       |
|                                   | notification of the change to     |
|                                   | their Family Tax Benefit (FTB)    |
|                                   | rate based on the care decision.  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Sam contacted Centrelink on 31    |
|                                   | January to query the decision and |
|                                   | spoke to Riley, a Centrelink      |
|                                   | Service Officer. Riley could not  |
|                                   | explain why Sam was receiving     |
|                                   | that specific rate of FTB. Riley  |
|                                   | advised Sam of their review and   |
|                                   | appeal rights, including the need |
|                                   | to apply for a formal review      |
|                                   | within 28 days of being notified  |
|                                   | of the decision.                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Sam requested an explanation of   |
|                                   | the decision to change the rate   |
|                                   | of FTB as they do not understand. |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | When investigating the decision   |
|                                   | on 5 February, Terry the SME      |
|                                   | found a coding error. The         |
|                                   | parenting agreement showed that   |
|                                   | Chris has 35% care of Lee and Sam |
|                                   | has 65% care of Lee.              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Correcting the error will affect  |
|                                   | the FTB and Child Support         |
|                                   | assessment for both customers. As |
|                                   | it has been more than 28 days     |
|                                   | since Sam and Chris were notified |
|                                   | of the decision, Terry needs to   |
|                                   | attempt to contact them as a      |
|                                   | priority before any changes are   |
|                                   | made, so they are aware of the    |
|                                   | impact of not applying for a      |
|                                   | formal review (as outlined on the |
|                                   | Background page).                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Either Sam or Chris can choose to |
|                                   | apply for a formal review after   |
|                                   | being advised of the impact. If   |
|                                   | so, Terry will finalise the       |
|                                   | explanation on Sam’s record       |
|                                   | without changing the decision and |
|                                   | record the application for a      |
|                                   | formal review for the person who  |
|                                   | requested it.                     |

|                                   | Anne and Joseph are Sally's       |

|                                   | care of Sally and this was        |
|                                   | transmitted to Centrelink.        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Both parent's records were        |
|                                   | reassessed based on the decision  |
|                                   | and each parent was advised       |
|                                   | accordingly.                      |

|                                   | Anne contacted Centrelink to ask  |
|                                   | for a review of the care          |
|                                   | percentage decision and was warm  |
|                                   | transferred to Child Support as   |
|                                   | the care decision was made by     |
|                                   | Child Support. An objection was   |
|                                   | recorded.                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Joseph also disagreed with the    |
|                                   | care percentage decision and      |
|                                   | requested a review by Centrelink. |
|                                   | As Anne lodged her objection with |
|                                   | Child Support before Joseph       |
|                                   | requested a review, the Child     |
|                                   | Support objection had to be       |
|                                   | finalised first.                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The Objection Officer’s decision  |
|                                   | was in favour of Anne, who was    |
|                                   | found to have a higher level of   |
|                                   | care of Sally than had previously |
|                                   | been assessed. This resulted in a |
|                                   | new child support assessment and  |
|                                   | also resulted in a reduction in   |
|                                   | Joseph’s FTB rate and an FTB      |
|                                   | debt.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The new care percentage           |
|                                   | determined by the Objections      |
|                                   | Officer cannot be changed as part |
|                                   | of the ARO review. However, as    |
|                                   | part of the review process, the   |
|                                   | ARO may examine the date the      |
|                                   | Objection Officer decision        |
|                                   | affected Joseph’s rate of FTB     |
|                                   | from and review the FTB debt. If  |
|                                   | either parent disagrees with the  |
|                                   | care percentage determined by the |
|                                   | internal review, they may apply   |
|                                   | to the Administrative Appeals     |
|                                   | Tribunal (AAT) for an AAT first   |
