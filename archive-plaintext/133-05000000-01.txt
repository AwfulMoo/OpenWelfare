This document outlines how to help customers manage their Centrelink
letters, messages and notifications online.

Government intent

Self service is the preferred way for customers to do business with
Services Australia. Encourage customers to use self service as online
services are private and secure.

Letters online

Customers can view most of their Centrelink letters electronically in
their myGov Inbox or Express Plus Centrelink mobile app, instead of
receiving them through the post.

Electronic Messaging (EM)

EM enables the agency to contact customers by SMS or email about things
that are important. If appropriate, customers may receive messages
instead of letters.

Messages include:

-   requests and reminders to report, attend appointments, or to provide
    information
-   notification of payments and decisions
-   desktop messages, such as 'pre-call' notifications
-   claim progress and outcome

Customers will be automatically subscribed to EM if they:

-   provide a new or updated mobile phone number or email address, or
-   opt in to the Push Notification service, or
-   claim a payment or service and have a mobile phone number or email
    address on their contact details, and
-   they are not subscribed to the service and do not have a duplicate
    Customer Reference Number (CRN)

A 'Welcome to Electronic Messaging' message is sent to customers within
one working day of their subscription. Customers may withdraw from the
service at any time.

The Resources page has links to more information and support. It also
has information to help customers fix issues viewing online letters.
