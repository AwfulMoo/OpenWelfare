manage a privacy incident.

Privacy

Personal and private information collected by Services Australia must be
managed in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs).

There are 13 Australian Privacy Principles which govern standards,
rights and the agency's obligations around:

-   the collection, use and disclosure of personal information
-   an organisation or agency's governance and accountability
-   integrity and correction of personal information
-   the rights of individuals to access their personal information

Staff must abide by the Operational Privacy Policy and report any
potential privacy incident. The Resources page has a link to the Privacy
and Secrecy intranet page which contains further information about
reporting privacy incidents.

If customer personal and private information is not managed correctly a
potential privacy breach can occur. A potential privacy breach can be
reported by a customer or a staff member.

The Resources page contains a link to the Services Australia intranet
site for information about privacy and secrecy.
