This document outlines the assessment of relationship status where one
member of a couple is under the age of consent, and they have a child in
their care.

On this Page:

Member of a Couple (MoC)

Under social security law, a person is a member of a couple if they are
not living separately and apart on a permanent or indefinite basis, both
people are over the age of consent (applicable to the relevant state or
territory) and are not in a prohibited relationship, and are:

-   legally married
-   in a registered relationship, or
-   in a de facto relationship

See the References page for a link to the Guide to Social Security Law
for the full definition of a MoC and the applicable age of consent per
state/territory.

MoC - customer and/or partner under age of consent

If a customer in receipt of income support payment is living in a member
of a couple relationship with a person and one or both partners are
under the age of consent where they live, they are not considered a
member of a couple under social security law.

Although the customer and their partner are not considered a member of a
couple, their rate of income support payment is not to exceed the rate
payable if they were a member of a couple (partnered rate). Even though
social security law does not recognise the customer and their partner as
a member of a couple, they are still paid at the partnered rate.

The income and assets test is to apply as though they were a member of a
couple and a manual ‘partnered’ rate is to be paid to the customer and
their partner.

Parenting Payment (PP)

As a customer under the age of consent cannot be considered a member of
a couple, they also cannot be linked to a partner and must be assessed
under general qualification requirements for PP as a single person
instead of as a partnered person. They will be paid a manual partnered
rate but still qualify for any relevant add-ons under the single rate,
for example, Pharmaceutical Allowance. The partnered income and assets
test will still be applied to the recipient in this circumstance when
calculating the manual rate of entitlement.

The age of consent differs for each state and territory. See the
References page for a link to the Guide to Social Security Law,
3.2.5.20, De Facto Relationships (YA & DSP) to identify the applicable
age of consent per state/territory.

Family assistance

The customer is treated as single under family assistance law as the
same definition of a member of a couple applies. The rate of Family Tax
Benefit (FTB) Part A and Child Care Subsidy (CCS) is based on the
adjusted taxable income circumstances of the customer only.

FTB Part B is not income tested if the customer is assessed as single
and receiving an income support payment. If the customer is not
receiving an income support payment, FTB Part B is only payable if the
customer's adjusted taxable income does not exceed the Part B primary
earner income limit.

Child support/maintenance action

While there is no minimum age for claiming child support, if either
member of the couple are under the age of consent and living with the
parent of their child, they are not required to take reasonable action
to obtain child support against that person.

The customer will need to have their maintenance action for the
applicable child/ren manually coded to show they are passing the
Maintenance Action Test (MAT). Maintenance action will need to be
reviewed when the youngest partner reaches the age of consent, or when
the parents separate if this occurs first.
