This document outlines how Service Officers dispute Quality On Line
(QOL) and Quality Management Application (QMA) checking results, the
review process and the right of reply. Service Officers may dispute a
quality checking outcome if they think it is incorrect or inappropriate.

Service Officer responsibility

Service Officers disputing a result must research the errors and make
sure the dispute is supported by an appropriate business rule. This can
include Operational Blueprint references or SharePoint task cards that
are current at the time of processing.

Service Officers must complete all actions on the customer's record
correctly as the first priority. Service Officers must not HOLD or leave
a NOT or STA activity on the customer's record pending the outcome of a
dispute. If Service Officers are unsure of the correct action to take
pending the outcome this should be discussed with their team leader or
Service Support Officer.

Dispute reviewer (as per QOL/QMA escalation dispute policy)

The dispute reviewer should be a Service Support Officer (SSO) or, where
directed, an independent reviewer with the suitable technical expertise
in determining the correctness of the activity type.

The SSO will determine if the outcome of the dispute is:

-   Upheld (agree with original check result)
-   Upheld for different reason (checking outcome is correct but for
    different reason to the original, for example different error)
-   Overturned (agree with dispute)
