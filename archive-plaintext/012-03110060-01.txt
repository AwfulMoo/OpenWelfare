This document outlines how to merge network organisations in the
Healthcare Identifiers (HI) Service.

Conditions for merging network organisations

Organisations can have multiple network organisations in their
hierarchy. An Organisation Maintenance Officer (OMO) can request to
merge a network organisation within the same organisation hierarchy. A
network organisation cannot be merged outside its existing network
structure.

If an organisational merge outside the existing network structure is
required, see Process organisation change of ownership in Healthcare
Identifiers (HI) Service. For this merge, both network organisations
must have Active records.

An OMO must have authority to represent both organisations being merged.
That is, the OMO must be linked to an organisation being merged or be
linked to an organisation at a higher level in the organisation
hierarchy.

Note: it is acceptable for the gaining organisation to be a seed
organisation, but if the organisation to be merged is a seed
organisation, complete Process organisation change of ownership in the
Healthcare Identifiers (HI) Service.

A Service Officer then makes the changes based on a request from the OMO
with responsibility for both records.

Note:

-   the system log for the merged organisation is not merged to the
    gaining organisation
-   amended details are updated in the Healthcare Provider Directory (HI
    HPD), as requested by the OMO

The Resources page contains information on what happens to the various
entities and records as a result of merging network organisations.
