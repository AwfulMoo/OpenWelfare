Multiple same day consultation restrictions

In many allied health categories, subsequent consultation items will
restrict if claimed more than once per day, per veteran, by the same

than 1 consultation per patient per day. Prior approval must be arranged
with the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA).

be paid without prior approval.
