This document outlines information about Indigenous Employment Programs.

The Indigenous Employment Program (IEP)

The IEP ceased on 30 June 2014. The IEP was a component of the
Commonwealth government's Indigenous Employment Policy administered by
the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C).

Indigenous Advancement Strategy (IAS)

From 1 July 2014, the IEP was superseded by the Indigenous Advancement
Strategy (IAS) which replaced more than 150 individual programs and
activities with 5 flexible, broad-based programs:

-   Jobs, land and economy – getting adults into work, fostering
    Indigenous business and assisting Indigenous people to generate
    economic and social benefits from the effective use of their land
-   Children and schooling – getting children to school, improving
    education outcomes and supporting families to give children a good
    start in life
-   Safety and wellbeing – ensuring that Indigenous people are healthy
    and enjoy the emotional and social wellbeing experienced by other
    Australians
-   Culture and capability – supporting Indigenous Australians to
    maintain their culture, participate in the economic and social life
    of the nation and ensure that organisations are capable of
    delivering quality services to their clients
-   Remote Australia strategies – addressing the social and economic
    disadvantage in remote Australia and supporting solutions based on
    community and government priorities

The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) has program
responsibility for the IAS.

of the Prime Minister and Cabinet website.
