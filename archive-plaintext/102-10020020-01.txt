This document outlines the reasons ABSTUDY may be cancelled. Payments
can be cancelled automatically by the system, or manually by a Service
Officer.

Reasons for cancellation

A student or an Australian Apprentice may have their ABSTUDY payments
cancelled if:

-   they have a change in their circumstances
-   they fail to comply with the requirements for payment
-   another type of payment is more beneficial, or
-   they voluntarily cease payments

Automatic cancellation

Automatic cancellation can occur after reassessments where no continuing
entitlement exists. For example, where an ABSTUDY student advises they
have discontinued study or an Australian Apprentice advises they have
discontinued or ceased their Australian Apprenticeship, the coding on
the system of this change in circumstances will result in payments being
automatically cancelled.

Manual cancellation

Manual cancellation occurs when a Service Officer makes the decision to
cancel a student's payment, based on ABSTUDY or ABSTUDY Pensioner
Education Supplement (PES) policy.
