General assessing information

The Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) is made up of both general and
category specific information. General information is located at the
beginning of the MBS and is referred to as the General Explanatory
notes. General explanatory notes include information such as:

-   provider and public eligibility for the Medicare scheme
-   billing procedures and services which do not attract a Medicare
    benefit

Category specific information is found at the beginning of each MBS
category.

Note: there are additional Medicare Benefits Schedules for Dental
Services and Optometrical Services.

When searching the MBS Online for general explanatory note information
it is best to use the Search MBS function and type a specific word or
phrase.

Medicare Benefits Schedule

The Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) is a publication that is maintained
and updated by the Department of Health and Aged Care. Each professional
services contained in the MBS has been allocated a unique item number.
Located with the item number and description for each service is the
Schedule fee and Medicare benefit, together with a reference to an
explanatory note relating to the item (if applicable).

Services listed in the MBS must be rendered according to the provisions
of the relevant Commonwealth, State and Territory laws. The day-to-day
administration and payment of benefits under the Medicare arrangements
is the responsibility of Services Australia. To view the MBS, see MBS
Online on the Department of Health and Aged Care website. Inquiries
concerning matters of interpretation of MBS items should be directed to
Services Australia.

Principles of MBS interpretation

Each medical service listed in the Schedule is a complete medical
service in itself. However, there are circumstances where a separate
benefit is not payable for a particular service when rendered in
conjunction with another more comprehensive service or, when rendered
under particular circumstances. Such limitations are often easily
identified by the item description.

Only 1 amount of benefit is payable for each listed medical service
whether the service is rendered:

-   by the 1 practitioner
-   partly by 1 practitioner and completed by another practitioner. For
    example, after care provided other than by the operating
    practitioner or radiographic examination

When a practitioner renders a comprehensive service listed in an item
and components of that service are separately listed under individual
items, benefits are payable under the comprehensive item

See also MBS online - general explanatory notes.

Services eligible for Medicare benefits

Services which are eligible for Medicare benefits include professional
services rendered by:

-   registered medical practitioners
-   optometrical consultations by participating optometrists
-   prescribed dental services by approved dental practitioners
-   prescribed dental services by accredited dental practitioners in the
    treatment of cleft lip and cleft palate conditions
-   eligible services provided by Nurses, Midwives, Allied Health and

All services that are eligible for benefits are listed in 1 of the
following:

-   Medicare Benefits Schedule
-   Schedule of Medicare Benefits Optometrical Services Schedule
-   Medicare Benefits Schedule Dental Services

Services which do not attract Medicare benefits

There are situations where professional services rendered by approved
providers do not attract a Medicare benefit. Below are some
circumstances where services do not attract a Medicare benefit. For
additional information on services which do not attract Medicare
benefits, see MBS Online.

Telephone consultations

Issue of repeat prescriptions when the patient does not attend the
surgery in person

Group attendances (unless otherwise specified in the item, for example
item 170) such as group counselling, health education, weight reduction
or fitness classes

Non-therapeutic cosmetic surgery, see Cosmetic and plastic surgery
assessing rules in Medicare

Where the medical expenses for the service are paid or payable to a
recognised (public) hospital

Where the medical expenses for the services are in relation to a
compensable injury or illness for which the patient's insurer or
compensation payer has accepted liability. However, if medical expenses
relate to a compensable injury or illness and the insurer or
compensation payer is disputing liability Medicare benefits are payable
until liability is accepted

Medical examination which is required for the purposes of:

-   Life insurance
-   Superannuation
-   Provident account schemes
-   Admission to membership of a friendly society

Mass immunisation

Health screening services

Pre-employment screening services

Professional services which are employment related and the expenses are
incurred by the employer or relate to an industrial undertaking (unless
otherwise directed by the Minister)

Services that have been rendered by or on behalf of, or under
arrangement with the Commonwealth, State or local governing body or
authority similarly established

Chelation therapy (that is, the intravenous administration of ethylene
diamine tetra-acetic acid or any of its salts) other than for the
treatment of heavy-metal poisoning

The injection of Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) in the management of
obesity

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy in the treatment of multiple sclerosis

The removal of tattoos

The transplantation of a thoracic or abdominal organ, other than a
kidney, or a part of an organ of that kind

Transplantation of a kidney in conjunction with the transplantation of a
thoracic or other abdominal organ, or part of an organ of that kind

The administration of microwave (UHF radio wave) cancer therapy,
including the intravenous injection of drugs used in the therapy

For services rendered to a doctor's dependants, practice partners or
partner's dependants

Additional charges or fees

-   Consumables that would be reasonably necessary to perform the
    service, including bandages and dressings
-   Record keeping fees
-   Booking fee to be paid before each service
-   Annual administration or registration fee
-   Administration costs associated with providing duplicate invoices or
    transfer of records

Services related to deceased person/s

The services listed below do not attract Medicare benefits:

-   post mortem examinations
-   euthanasia and any service directly related to the procedure.
    However, services rendered for counselling/assessment about
    euthanasia will attract benefits
-   the removal from a cadaver of kidneys for transplantation purposes
-   attending a deceased person for the issue of a death or cremation
    certificate or where a doctor attends a deceased person to certify
    that life is extinct for the purposes of removing a body

Although Medicare benefits are not payable for the issue of a death
certificate, a Medicare benefit is payable where a health professional:

-   attends a patient who dies in their presence, with or without
    resuscitation attempts
-   attends a person who may or may not be dead and they have to either
    verify death or institute treatment if the person is alive. The
    following interpretation applies to this situation - legally, only a
    medical practitioner can verify that life is extinct and, until a
    statement of death or death certificate is issued, the patient is
    still regarded as an eligible patient for Medicare benefit purposes.
    Situations may arise where the medical practitioner is aware, prior
    to the attendance, that the patient is still not alive (for example,
    through nursing staff). Such an attendance to verify death would
    attract a Medicare benefit even if the practitioner subsequently
    issues a death certificate or statement of death. Only the time
    taken to examine the patient and verify death attracts benefit.
    Other non-clinical tasks, for example, issuing a death certificate
    are not eligible for benefits and should not be considered in
    determining the appropriate attendance item

Services performed on cadavers or stillborn babies

Medicare benefits are payable for professional services which are
considered clinically relevant services for the appropriate management
of a patientâ€™s condition. Services carried out on cadavers or stillborn
babies do not come within the definition of a professional service.
Services or tests, for example, medical research, forensic evidence or
other legal requirements (issue of death certificate) do not attract a
Medicare benefit. Enquiries of this nature need to be handled with
sensitivity.

Health screening services

Unless the Minister otherwise directs, Medicare benefits are not payable
for health screening services. The Health Insurance Act 1973 defines a
health screening service as a medical examination or test which is not
reasonably required for the management of a medical condition of the
patient.

The Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) General Explanatory notes advise
health screening services which the Minister has directed Medicare
benefits be paid for, see MBS online - general explanatory notes -
services which do not attract Medicare benefits.

Professional services

A professional service is defined as a clinically relevant, service
rendered by a medical or dental practitioner, an optometrist or an
eligible allied health professional.

A clinically relevant services is defined as a service that is generally
accepted in the medical, dental, optometric or allied health profession,
as being necessary for the appropriate treatment of the patient to whom
it is rendered.

Personal performances

With the exception of services advised in the Medicare Benefits Schedule
(MBS) General Explanatory notes, services must be personally performed
by the practitioner on not more than 1 patient on the 1 occasion to
attract Medicare benefits.

The requirement of physical performance is met whether or not assistance
is rendered in the performance of the service according to accepted
medical standards.

Services rendered on behalf of medical practitioners

Professional services which attract Medicare benefits include medical
services rendered by or on behalf of a medical practitioner. On behalf
of a medical practitioner includes services where parts of the services
are performed by a technician employed by or, in accordance with
accepted medical practice, acting under the supervision of the medical
practitioner.

In defining the term supervision in accordance with accepted medical
practice, the supervision requirements are deemed to be satisfied where
the medical practitioner has both:

established consistent quality assurance procedures for the data
acquisition

personally analysed the data and written the report

pathology services can be rendered by:

-   an Approved Pathology Practitioner (APP)
-   a medical practitioner on behalf of and under the supervision of an
    APP
-   a person, other than a medical practitioner, on behalf of and under
    the supervision of an APP

services provided by a practice nurse on behalf of a medical
practitioner are provided under the supervision of a general
practitioner (GP) and the GP retains responsibility for the health,
safety and clinical outcomes of the patient. This does not mean that the
GP has to be present while the practice nurse is providing the service

Benefits are not payable for these services when a medical practitioner
refers patients to self-employed paramedical personnel, such as
radiographers and audiologists who either bill the patient or the
practitioner requesting the service.

Split services

Situations can arise when benefits payable for services combine elements
for which both Medicare and the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA),
or Medicare and in part by compensation.

Medicare and Veterans' Affairs

Situations can arise when benefits payable for services combine elements
for which both Medicare and the DVA are responsible.

Where the:

-   medical practitioner determines that a patient may be eligible to
    benefit under either DVA or Medicare
-   patient has 2 conditions, 1 of which is coverable by DVA and the
    practitioner has treated both conditions at the 1 attendance

The medical practitioner can choose to bill either organisation but
cannot claim half the fee from either source, that is, benefit is not
payable from both sources.

A benefit would be payable from each source where a patient has 2
distinct and separate attendances with the practitioner for the
treatment of separate conditions, 1 of which is coverable by DVA, see
Multiple attendances on same day (Professional Attendance).

Medicare and compensation

Situations can arise where services rendered to a patient is covered in
part by Medicare and in part by compensation.

Medicare benefits are not payable in respect of a professional service
where the medical expenses for the services are in relation to a
compensable injury or illness for which the patient's insurer or
compensation payer has accepted liability. However, if medical expenses
relate to a compensable injury or illness and the insurer or
compensation payer is disputing liability, Medicare benefits are payable
until liability is accepted.

Information required for itemised accounts

In order for Medicare benefits to be paid, a properly itemised account
or receipt must be issued.

Section 19(6) of the Health Insurance Act 1973 and Regulation 13 of the
Health Insurance Regulations 2018 require the following particulars to
be shown on the account or receipt or direct billing form:

the patient's name

the date the service was rendered

the amount charged in respect of the service

the total amount paid in respect of the service

any amount outstanding in respect of the service

a description of service sufficient to identify the item that relates to
the service and, when rendered to a patient classified as an admitted
patient, the words admitted patient preceding the service description or
an * immediately after the item number where used

the name and practice address or name and provider number of the
provider who actually rendered the service

the name and practice address or name and provider number of the
practitioner receiving or claiming payment of (assignment of) benefits:

-   tor services in Group A1-A14, D1, T1, T4-T9, Groups O1-O7 and Group
    P9 - where the person claiming benefit is not the person who
    rendered the service
-   tor services in Groups D2, T2, T3, I2 to I5 - every service
-   where the practitioner receiving or claiming benefits is not the
    practitioner who provided the service, that is, locum situations,
    the words 'PAY P' must be included together with the name and
    practice address or the name and provider number of the practitioner
    claiming the benefit

if the service was a specified simple basic pathology test that was
determined necessary by a practitioner who is another member of the same
group medical practice, the surname and initials of that other
practitioner

if a practitioner has rendered more than 1 professional attendance to
the same patient on the same day and a Category 1 item relates to each
attendance - the time at which each attendance commenced

where the service rendered relates to a consultant or specialist in the
practice of their specialty and the patient has been referred:

-   the name and either practice address or provider number of the
    referring practitioner
-   the date of the referral
-   the period of the referral (where other than for 12 months), that
    is, 3, 6, 18 months or indefinitely. Referrals for longer than 12
    months should only be used where the patientâ€™s clinical condition
    requires continuing care and management of a specialist or a
    consultant physician for a specific condition or conditions
-   additional information is required for diagnostic imaging and
    pathology accounts, see 5 Diagnostic imaging assessing rules in
    Medicare and 6 Pathology assessing rules in Medicare

Note: if information recorded on accounts or receipts or assignment
forms is done by an employee of the practitioner, the practitioner
claiming for the service bears responsibility for the accuracy and
completeness of the information.

Medicare Claims Review Panel (MCRP)

The MCRP was created to oversee the assessment of applications for
Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) items that required approval prior to
payment of a Medicare benefit.

The MCRP was an expert panel of medical advisors from the Department of
Health and Aged Care who assessed clinical evidence submitted by the
servicing provider, to determine if the clinical requirements were met
for the 26 designated MCRP MBS items.

Health professionals are no longer required to seek prior approval to
claim MCRP items for services performed after 1 November 2018.

Practitioners must still apply to the MCRP for services performed before
1 November 2018.

Medicare Services Advisory Committee (MSAC)

The Medicare Services Advisory Committee (MSAC) was established in April
1998 and advise the Minister for Health on the strength of evidence
relating to the safety, effectiveness and cost effectiveness of new and
emerging medical services and technologies and under what circumstances
public funding, including listing on the Medicare Benefits Schedule
(MBS), should be supported.

Further information on the MSAC can be found under the General
Explanatory Notes of the MBS or alternatively on the MSAC website.
