This document outlines the Community Development Program (CDP). CDP
provides an integrated and flexible approach to participation and
employment services for people living in 60 Department of Education,
Skills and Employment designated remote servicing regions in Australia.

Aim of Community Development Program (CDP)

The CDP is the Government’s remote employment and community development
service. CDP supports job seekers in remote Australia to build skills,
address barriers to employment and contribute to their communities
through a range of flexible activities.

For eligible job seekers living in one of 60 remote servicing regions,
CDP is the only Employment Services Provider type available. These job
seekers cannot be referred to:

-   jobactive
-   Transition to Work (TTW), or
-   Disability Employment Services (DES)

Key elements of the CDP

The key elements of the CDP are:

-   CDP providers deliver a range of services based on the needs of both
    the community and the individuals in that community
-   Each CDP region will generally have only 1 or 2 CDP service
    providers
-   Community development to support economic and employment
    development - Indigenous and community organisations in partnership
    with local leaders will have a say in the design and implementation
    of community projects and voluntary activities
-   'Jobs first' employment services - job seekers will be provided with
    personalised support and case management, including access to job
    opportunities, skills development and training

Eligibility for participation in CDP

There are two types of eligibility for CDP participants:

-   fully eligible job seekers, and
-   community volunteers

Fully eligible job seekers are those who live in a designated remote
area and meet one of the following criteria:

are in receipt of or are claiming:

-   JobSeeker Payment (JSP), Youth Allowance (other), Parenting Payment
    (PP) or Special Benefit, who are subject to mutual obligation
    requirements, or
-   Disability Support Pension (DSP), Parenting Payment Single (PPS),
    Parenting Payment Partnered (PPP) or Carer Payment who do not have
    compulsory participation requirements, but who volunteer for
    participation

are young people aged 15-21 years who:

-   are not on an income support payment and are not employed for more
    than 15 hours per week or in full-time education, or
-   are vulnerable young people who are full-time students

are pre-released prisoners not on income support, on approved day or
partial release and referred by their correctional institution to engage
in paid work through a work-release program

A community volunteer is a person who lives in a CDP remote region who
is not a fully eligible job seeker, but who volunteers to participate in
CDP activities. Community volunteers are directly registered by the CDP
provider and cannot be referred by Services Australia.

Department of Education, Skills and Employment will determine the job
seeker's CDP employment services eligibility and therefore job seeker
registration type:

-   Remote Community Volunteer (RCV)
-   Remote Fully Eligible (RFE)
-   No Remote Referral Required (NRRR)

CDP Approved Program of Work Supplement (APWS)

Job seekers participating in CDP may be eligible to receive the APWS if
they are participating in approved activities such as Work for the Dole.

Mutual obligation requirements

CDP providers are responsible for managing mutual obligation
requirements for provider managed job seekers in remote servicing
regions.

From 12 May 2021, CDP activities which were previously compulsory
requirements are now voluntary. This includes:

-   Work for the Dole;
-   training; and
-   work experience

CDP job seekers are not penalised for failing to attend these
activities. If they disengage from these activities, their Approved
Program of Work Supplement (APWS) of $20.80 pf may stop.

CDP job seekers still need to meet other compulsory mutual obligation
requirements such as:

-   agreeing to a Job Plan
-   attending provider and third party appointments when notified
-   attending job interviews
-   meeting job search requirements if appropriate
-   accepting suitable paid work

Job Plans in CDP

Job seekers who are provider managed will have a Job Plan negotiated
with their CDP provider.

In negotiating Job Plans with CDP job seekers, providers consider each
job seeker’s assessed capacity and individual circumstances.

For 'assessed capacity' see Job seekers with a partial capacity to work
or a temporary reduced work capacity.

There are no specific requirements for CDP job seekers according to
their age group or job seeker category, e.g. for principal carer parents
or job seekers aged over 55.

Minimum hourly requirements do not apply for CDP job seekers. If a CDP
job seeker elects to participate in an activity such as Work for the
Dole, the provider records in the Job Plan the number of hours the job
seeker has volunteered to undertake. If the job seeker does not
participate in the activity for the elected number of hours, penalties
will not apply, as their participation is voluntary.

If a job seeker does not elect to participate in an activity, the hourly
requirements in their Job Plan are zero.

Job seekers who are Centrelink managed will have a Job Plan negotiated
by Services Australia. The type of plan to be negotiated will be
determined automatically by the system, based on information sent by the
Department of Education, Skills and Employment IT system, and will
depend on whether a CDP provider referral is in place or not.

Work for the Dole (WFD) in CDP

The key aim of Work for the Dole in CDP regions is providing real
pathways to long-term employment. Eligible job seekers will also have
access to support services and activities such as basic literacy and
numeracy training, driver's license training, and other training that is
linked directly to a job.

Work for the Dole (WFD) activities in CDP

Under the CDP, WFD activities:

-   are based on a job seeker's needs
-   can provide a combination of work like experiences and
    vocational/non-vocational training linked to a job
-   can be individual or group based
-   can be delivered by the CDP provider or through the providers
    arranging a Host to undertake them
-   will not be added as a compulsory activity within a Job Plan
-   are voluntary for any CDP job seekers who elect to undertake Work
    for the Dole
-   will not be subject to the job seeker compliance framework

Note: CDP providers may approve flexible participation hours for some
CDP participants, which may include activities outside of standard
business hours, or variation in the number of days per week. CDP
participants can discuss this in more detail with their CDP provider.

Payments, supplement and services during Work for the Dole in CDP

Participants remain entitled to their income support payment (that is,
JobSeeker Payment (JSP), Special Benefit (SpB), Youth Allowance (YA),
Disability Support Pension (DSP) or Parenting Payment (PP)) and a
supplement of $20.80 per fortnight, to assist with the costs of their
placement. Job seekers are not able to be in receipt of the WFD
supplement and the Pensioner Education Supplement (PES) at the same
time.

Additional Child Care Subsidy (ACCS) (Transition to Work) may also be
available to participants.

Community Participation Activities

Community Participation Activities aim to support and increase job
seekers' participation while supporting community advancement. CDP
providers are expected to work with the communities in their region/s to
identify community activities, community development opportunities, and
employment opportunities that that will contribute to the communities'
well-being and development towards sustainability. The Community
Participation Activities will be linked to the Community Action Plan.

Breakdown in relationship between a job seeker and their CDP provider

Job seekers who approach Services Australia about a breakdown in their
relationship with their CDP provider organisation should be advised to
discuss their situation with their provider in the first instance. In
situations when a job seeker feels they can't talk to their provider, or
are not happy with the provider's response to their issue, job seekers
should be advised to contact the Department of Education, Skills and
Employment.

Changing provider after change of address

If the job seeker has moved to a new region, but remains linked to the
provider in their previous region, advise the job seeker to contact
their provider or to call the Department of Education, Skills and
Employment Customer Service Line. For further information see Job seeker
change of address.
