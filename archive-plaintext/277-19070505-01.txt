This document outlines the process for issuing a manual letter in Pluto.

Letters

Child Support uses letters as a means of contact only when there is a
legislative or administrative requirement to provide a written notice.
This includes when:

-   making a decision
-   confirming a step in a process
-   sending a formal notice

The preference is to use a system generated letter where possible.
