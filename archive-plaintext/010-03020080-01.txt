This document outlines how AIC Smart Centre staff assess the SY067.

Organisations claiming AIC

A non-government organisation can apply for AIC for a student.

The organisation must complete both the:

-   SY067, and
-   Claim for Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) (SY040)

The SY067 ask for details of the organisation and why the student is in
their care. The SY040 asks for details of the student.

A chief officer (or other officer with power to act on behalf of the
organisation) must sign the SY067 and SY040. The signing officer
accepts, on behalf of the organisation:

-   the applicant notification responsibilities and
-   responsibility for any debt which may occur

The organisation must have full responsibility for the upkeep of the
student and:

the student has been placed in their care by a state/territory authority
or court, or

the student's parents:

-   are not involved in decisions about the care of the student,
-   do not provide any financial support for the student, and
-   are either unable to be contacted to complete the form or are
    unwilling to do so

does not receive a foster care or similar allowance for the student
