This document outlines the ways to search for a Centrepay business. A
Centrepay business is an individual or organisation that has an
agreement with Centrepay for an approved Centrepay service reason. This
enables customers to have deductions made from eligible Centrelink
payments directly to Centrepay businesses.

The Resources page contains a link to the Services Australia website for
the Centrepay Procedural Guide for businesses and the Find a business or
organisation application.
