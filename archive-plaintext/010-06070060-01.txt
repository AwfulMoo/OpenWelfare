This document outlines information on assessing satisfactory progress
for YA secondary students.

Satisfactory progress

Students must be making satisfactory progress with their studies to
satisfy the activity test for YA. For YA, this refers to the time spent
to complete a course and the number of times a student attempts to
complete a course.

As part of the requirement to make satisfactory progress, students must
complete a course within the period set out in the Youth Allowance
(Satisfactory Study Progress Guidelines) Determination 2014. This is
usually based on the minimum time it normally takes to complete the
course, plus an additional period.

Secondary students

For secondary students the only progress rule that applies is that they
cannot have more than 2 attempts at Year 12 and still be considered a
full-time student.

However, a previous attempt at Year 12 can be disregarded if the student
was affected by circumstances beyond their control, such as:

-   the person is, or has been, disabled by an illness or other medical
    condition (permanently or temporary)
-   the person has suffered family trauma
-   the person has experienced a natural disaster
-   the person is obliged to relocate, necessitating repeating part of a
    course of study, or starting a course again (because of the
    requirements of the educational institution concerned)
-   the person has caring responsibilities for another member of their
    family
-   another exceptional circumstance that interferes with the person's
    ability to complete a course of education or study within the
    standard minimum length of time

Under exceptional circumstances, students who have failed with 2
attempts at Year 12 for other reasons may be able to study Year 12
subjects at a tertiary institution such as TAFE as an approved activity
as a YA job seeker. The activity will be recorded in their Job Plan.
