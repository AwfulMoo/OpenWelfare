This document explains the Job Seeker Snapshot factors for job seekers
who have experienced torture and trauma face severe barriers to finding
employment. To accurately assess this barrier, these job seekers need to
be identified during the Job Seeker Snapshot interview so they can be
referred to an Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) Assessor for
further assessment and the allocation of additional points to their Job
Seeker Snapshot score.

Possible indicators of torture and trauma

The following situations can be indicators to help identify if a job
seeker may have experienced torture or trauma:

-   Job seekers who have entered Australia on a refugee or humanitarian
    visa or been granted refugee status on-shore. These visas can be
    used as an indicator to identify job seekers who may have
    experienced torture and trauma
-   Newly arrived refugee or Humanitarian Programme customers may have
    an Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Strategy (IHSS) service
    provider, friends, or relatives come to their initial interview and
    registration with Services Australia. They may also visit a Services
    Australia office alone, with the assistance of an interpreter. This
    may facilitate early identification of torture and trauma victims
-   Job seekers who have suffered childhood sexual abuse or violence, or
    sexual abuse or family and domestic violence as an adult may be
    harder to identify. It is possible, that while these underlying
    causes are not identified, other observable characteristics may be
    obvious. Further assessment by a Job Capacity Assessor may identify
    the underlying cause of these observed characteristics

Job seekers with refugee or humanitarian visa status

The Job Seeker Snapshot specifically asks questions to identify a job
seeker with a refugee or humanitarian visa status, and who comes from
one of the countries where a person is likely to have experienced
torture or trauma as identified by Department of Home Affairs.

This will trigger a Job Seeker Snapshot initiated Employment Services
Assessment (ESAt).

Job seekers with refugee or humanitarian visa status who disclose
torture and trauma experience but do not come from one of the source
countries identified by Department of Home Affairs should also be
referred for an ESAt. This will be done if the job seeker answers 'yes'
to having Other Factors which have not yet been disclosed.

ESAt referral

Referral for an ESAt should also be manually triggered where a flag is
not automatically raised, if a job seeker's responses to the Job Seeker
Snapshot or observed behaviour indicates that:

-   professional or specialist judgement or advice is appropriate and
    the job seeker requires an ESAt, or
-   referral to Disability Employment Services may more appropriately
    meet the job seeker's needs for employment assistance than referral
    to Workforce Australia

people who have experienced torture and trauma.
