support assessment is received. It includes contacting the other party

Ending assessments

A payee can elect to end a child support assessment for a child from a
specified future date.

If a payee or their current partner is receiving/entitled to receive,
more than the base rate of Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A, ending the
assessment may:

-   reduce their rate to the base rate if they do not have a Centrelink
    exemption, and
-   impact their eligibility for other Centrelink payments

In limited circumstances, any party to a child support agreement can
elect to end an assessment when their agreement initiated the child
support case. The election to end must be made on a day when the
agreement is suspended.
