|                                   | A title document may have more    |
|                                   | than one parcel of land on it.    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | For most suburban real estate the |
|                                   | certificate of title will usually |
|                                   | be made up of one parcel of land  |
|                                   | or lot for example, 41 Smith St,  |
|                                   | Jonesville has a certificate of   |
|                                   | title of DP126543 lot 12.         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | For rural properties there may be |
|                                   | one or more parcels of land on a  |
|                                   | title document. It is common for  |
|                                   | rural title documents to include  |
|                                   | more than one lot or parcel of    |
|                                   | land. Rural land can be held in   |
|                                   | single titles that include        |
|                                   | multiple lots, crown allotments,  |
|                                   | parcels, etc. These may be        |
|                                   | referred to as parent titles and  |
|                                   | are not deemed multiple title     |
|                                   | properties as they are on one     |
|                                   | title deed or certificate of      |
|                                   | title. To create separate title   |
|                                   | documents for each of these lots, |
|                                   | that would allow them to be sold  |
|                                   | off, involves additional costs to |
|                                   | the owner of the land.            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Where the customer owns their     |
|                                   | land via a single title document, |
|                                   | even where there are multiple     |
|                                   | lots included, the whole of the   |
|                                   | land on that title document may   |
|                                   | be exempted under the extended    |
|                                   | land use test. This applies even  |
|                                   | if the customer is able to sell   |
|                                   | off one of the lots or parcels by |
|                                   | subdividing and having to seek    |
|                                   | approval from the land titles     |
|                                   | office or local council.          |

|                                   | The approved valuer will value    |
|                                   | real estate as one single         |
|                                   | property where there is one title |
|                                   | document, even if there are       |
|                                   | multiple lots within that title.  |
