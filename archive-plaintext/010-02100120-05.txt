| 1                                 | Eligible for ABSTUDY and FAA -    |

|                                   | ...                               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Tim is eligible for ABSTUDY and   |
|                                   | FAA for a 3 year course. Tim has  |
|                                   | already travelled home several    |
|                                   | times this year, once for         |
|                                   | compassionate reasons, once for   |
|                                   | the Easter break and once during  |
|                                   | the mid-year holidays. There is a |
|                                   | long weekend coming up and Tim    |
|                                   | feels like going home so applies  |
|                                   | for FAA.                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | As Tim's course is greater than 1 |
|                                   | semester in length, Tim is        |
|                                   | entitled to 1 mid-year return     |
|                                   | journey between home and the      |
|                                   | place of study. While Tim         |
|                                   | received FAA for the              |
|                                   | compassionate travel, this does   |
|                                   | not affect the entitlement to     |
|                                   | vacation travel. As Tim did not   |
|                                   | request FAA for the other 2       |
|                                   | trips, Tim is entitled to receive |
|                                   | it for the long weekend. There is |
|                                   | no requirement for 'vacation'     |
|                                   | travel to be taken during a       |
|                                   | vacation. There is no limit to    |
|                                   | the number of times travel can be |
|                                   | undertaken, but Tim may only      |
|                                   | claim FAA for 1 of the trips.     |

|                                   | Jan has completed a course for    |
|                                   | the year that was commenced in    |
|                                   | February. Jan wants to return     |
|                                   | home to see family for Christmas  |
|                                   | but spend New Year's Eve with     |
|                                   | friends near the study location.  |
|                                   | Jan claims vacation travel to go  |
|                                   | home after the exams have         |
|                                   | finished and to return to the     |
|                                   | term address on 29 December.      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | FAA is not payable for the return |
|                                   | journey. Vacation travel must be  |
|                                   | taken during the period of study  |
|                                   | in the year. It cannot be used    |
|                                   | outside of this period, nor can   |
|                                   | it be saved for next year. Jan    |
|                                   | could claim FAA for the journey   |
|                                   | to go home as an end of study     |
|                                   | journey, but the return journey   |
|                                   | would not meet the FAA            |
|                                   | guidelines.                       |

|                                   | Cedric is enrolled in a 2 year    |
|                                   | Diploma and is eligible for FAA.  |
|                                   | Cedric claims and is paid FAA to  |
|                                   | go home during the mid-semester   |
|                                   | holidays in first semester. On    |
|                                   | coming back to study Cedric       |
|                                   | realises the course is not        |
|                                   | suitable and discontinues study   |
|                                   | in May. Cedric lodges a claim for |
|                                   | FAA for the journey home and for  |
|                                   | reimbursement of the journey      |
|                                   | taken to commence study (which    |
|                                   | had not previously been claimed). |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Cedric is entitled to all the FAA |
|                                   | claimed. Although Cedric did not  |
|                                   | study for more than 1 semester,   |
|                                   | the entitlement is not affected.  |
|                                   | Cedrick will not have a debt      |
|                                   | raised for the vacation travel,   |
|                                   | nor will the claim for            |
|                                   | commencement and end of study     |
|                                   | travel be rejected.               |
