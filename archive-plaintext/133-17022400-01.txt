About Payment and Service Finder

Payment and Service Finder is a service that combines:

-   Payment Finder
-   Service Finder, and
-   the online rate estimator

Customers need to answer questions about their circumstances. The
service then provides possible payments and assistance from Services
Australia. This may include assistance from community service providers.

The service consists of 3 parts:

-   payment discovery
-   service discovery
-   estimation of payment rates

Customers can use the online estimator options to:

-   calculate potential payment amounts, or
-   see how a change in their circumstances will affect their Centrelink
    payments

The following estimators are not available in Payment and Service
Finder:

-   Compensation impacts
-   Child support estimator
-   Child support care estimator

There is an authenticated and unauthenticated version. They both have
the same look and feel. The unauthenticated version is on the Services
Australia website. The authenticated version is in Centrelink online
account and may prefill certain, known customer details.

Payment and Service Finder is available to use in Simplified Chinese.

The Resources page contains a link to the unauthenticated Payment and
Service Finder and Frequently Asked Questions about the service.
