This document outlines the notification provisions that relate to the
period of time that a customer has in which to notify Services Australia
of a change in their circumstances, and still be considered to have
notified in time.

Notification requirements

For the majority of cases the customer is obligated to comply with the
general notification provisions - which is to notify of a change within
14 days starting from the day after the date of the change (date of
event).

International Services (CIS) customers and customers notifying of a
bereavement event have a 28 day notification period. ABSTUDY customers
also have different notification provisions.

Note: with the introduction of the Working Credit initiative from 20
September 2003, customers eligible for Working Credit may have other
reporting requirements.
