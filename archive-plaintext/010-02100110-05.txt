|                                   | To be well prepared, Jason        |

|                                   | second week of January and        |
|                                   | applies for FAA.                  |

|                                   | -   FAA is rejected, as the       |
|                                   |     travel was not within a       |
|                                   |     reasonable period of classes  |
|                                   |     commencing. A student would   |
|                                   |     not normally be expected to   |
|                                   |     need to move to the place of  |
|                                   |     study more than a month       |
|                                   |     before the start of study     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | As is Eloise's right, a request   |
|                                   | for this decision to be reviewed  |
|                                   | is submitted. Eloise explains     |
|                                   | that there has been an offer of   |
|                                   | part-time work at the university  |
|                                   | as a lab assistant, commencing    |
|                                   | early January. This lab work,     |
|                                   | even though it does not count as  |
|                                   | part of the course, will give     |
|                                   | valuable experience.              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The decision to reject FAA is     |
|                                   | overturned. Eloise has justified  |
|                                   | the early travel and FAA is       |
|                                   | approved.                         |
