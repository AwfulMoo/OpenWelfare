|                                   | It is critical to obtain evidence |
|                                   | to support all the relevant facts |
|                                   | of the decision. Making findings  |
|                                   | of facts which are unsupported by |
|                                   | evidence may constitute an error  |
|                                   | of law. Requesting evidence from  |
|                                   | customers as early as possible    |
|                                   | within the 60 day timeframe (120  |

|                                   | the evidence before making a      |

|                                   | consider the following:           |

|                                   | -   Have the customers provided   |
|                                   |     more up to date evidence with |
|                                   |     their application or          |

|                                   | -   Can more up to date           |

|                                   | -   Is there evidence to support  |
|                                   |     all the relevant facts of the |
|                                   |     decision?                     |
|                                   | -   Which facts in dispute will   |
|                                   |     require additional evidence   |
|                                   |     in order to make a finding?   |
