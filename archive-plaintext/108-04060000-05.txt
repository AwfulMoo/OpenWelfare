| Item                              | Example                           |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Customer is providing child care  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Scenario: Jane has only started   |
|                                   | operating her child care business |
|                                   | in the current financial year and |
|                                   | is not able to provide a profit   |
|                                   | and loss statement due to extreme |
|                                   | personal circumstances. Jane      |
|                                   | provides child care for 140 days  |
|                                   | of the year, 12 hours per day.    |
|                                   | Jane uses 75% of the home to      |
|                                   | provide child care. Jane's annual |
|                                   | household costs total $3,000.     |
|                                   | Jane receives a total gross       |
|                                   | income of $5,600 per year from    |
|                                   | providing child care.             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Calculate using formula, A x B x  |
|                                   | C = D where:                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   A = days worked in a year /   |
|                                   |     365                           |
|                                   | -   B = hours worked in a day /   |
|                                   |     24                            |
|                                   | -   C = percentage of home used   |
|                                   |     for child care                |
|                                   | -   D = business percentage to be |
|                                   |     applied to total annual       |
|                                   |     household costs               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | For Jane, D = 140/ 365 x 12/ 24 x |
|                                   | 75/ 100 = 14.4%.                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Result: Jane's total household    |
|                                   | costs are $3,000 per year, so     |
|                                   | costs attributable to the         |
|                                   | provision of child care are 14.4% |
|                                   | x $3,000 = $432 per year.         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This amount is deducted from the  |
|                                   | gross income from child care      |
|                                   | provision.                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | As Jane received $5,600 for       |
|                                   | providing child care over the     |
|                                   | year, the income for social       |
|                                   | security purposes is $5,600 less  |
|                                   | $432 = $5,168.                    |
