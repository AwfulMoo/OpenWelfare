This document outlines information on genuine investors in private
trusts and companies. Where genuine injections of capital have been made
to a company or unit trust, a concession will be allowed that recognises
those genuine injections.

On this Page:

Genuine injection of capital

A genuine injection of capital has occurred where a person:

-   has made a genuine injection of capital
-   receives commensurate shares in the company or commensurate units in
    the unit trust, in return for the capital
-   has a right to capital on wind-up
-   has a right to dividends or distributions
-   is over 18 years old

The customer who genuinely injected capital will have the historical
value of the injection of capital assessed as an asset. However, the
amount of the investment is subject to the following conditions:

-   it is limited to the percentage shareholding or unit holding
    purchased
-   it must be less than 50% of the present capital value of the entity
-   if the value of the entity falls, the investment amount may be
    subject to reduction, based on information from the customer, and
    taking into account the current and past circumstances of the entity

Entity asset value reduced

Where the entity asset value has reduced, the genuine investor's amount
should be recalculated to their net asset-backed share of the entity
assets. This is what they could reasonably expect to get if the company
were wound up or the unit trust vested. This amount could be adjusted
from year to year if the value of the entity fluctuates, but will not
rise above the actual amount of money initially invested by the genuine
investor.

Using the historical value reflects the actual contribution made by the
investor, but this method also recognises:

-   the reality that a non controller relies entirely on the goodwill of
    the controller
-   that the investor may never regain access to his or her investment,
    let alone any appreciation
-   that until such time as a capital distribution is made, the
    controller has the enjoyment of the funds injected, including any
    appreciation
-   that attribution is not reduced by a dilution of equity/control,
    without a genuine resignation

Note: it is not possible to obtain equity in a discretionary trust.

Genuine investors are recorded on the Trust and Company Attribution
(TRA) and Trust and Company Distribution (TRD) screens. See Coding the
Trust/Company Attribution (TRA) and Assessing and recording distribution
income for coding help.

The Resources page contains examples of the treatment of investments in
a private trust or private company.
