About the Royal Commission into Robodebt

As outlined by the Chief Executive Officer on Thursday 25 August 2022,
the government has announced a Royal Commission into Robodebt.

Robodebt is a commonly used term to refer to the operation of the Income
Compliance Program, a debt assessment and recovery scheme. The program
began operating as a pilot in early 2015. It progressed through various
iterations under different names until late 2019, including:

-   PAYG Manual Intervention Process
-   Online Compliance Intervention (OCI)
-   Employment Income Confirmation (EIC)
-   Check and Update Past Income (CUPI).

Under the Income Compliance Program, the agency calculated some debts
using averaged Australian Taxation Office (ATO) income information.

When there were unexplained differences between a recipient’s reported
income and the ATO’s data, the agency used averaging to calculate those
debts.

See Income Compliance Program for more information.

What a Royal Commission does

A Royal Commission is an investigation into a matter of public
importance. It is independent of the government.

Each Royal Commission has broad powers to:

-   gather information and documents
-   compel witnesses to give evidence
-   hold public hearings.

The Royal Commission determines who will be called as a witness, based
on how their knowledge or expertise can help inform the inquiry.
