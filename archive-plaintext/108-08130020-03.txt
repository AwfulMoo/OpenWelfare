This page contains the process for varying Rent Deduction Scheme (RDS)
deductions. Service Officers in service centres and Smart Centre Call
are only able to check whether a variation has already been processed.
Go to the Payment Instruction Summary (PINS) screen to check if a change
has been made to the existing deduction. If there is no change on the
PINS screen, the customer needs to contact their Housing Authority (HA)
to check the progress of their variation.
