Extension of 13 Week NEIS Pre-Training and development

There may be occasions where the job seeker needs more than 13 weeks of
NEIS Pre-Training approved activity because they are still seeking
council approval or are requiring some business licensing before they
can commence their business under Department of Education, Skills and
Employment NEIS/Self-Employment Assistance Agreement.

For these job seekers, an extension of the 13 weeks NEIS Pre-Training
activity can be arranged until they are able to commence in
NEIS/Self-Employment Assistance.

The NEIS/Self-Employment Assistance Panel Members updates the expected
end date of the NEIS/Self-Employment Assistance training in Department
of Education, Skills and Employment systems and this information is then
reflected on the Activity and Exemption (AEX) screen.

The job seeker has to advise their Workforce Australia or Disability
Employment Services provider in person of the extension and the provider
is required to update their Job Plan.

Services Australia links

The Department of Education, Skills and Employment Workforce Australia
helpline will assist with general NEIS/Self-Employment Assistance
enquiries and advise the job seeker of any local NEIS/Self-Employment
Assistance providers near them. This phone number is located in
Department of Education, Skills and Employment.

Job seekers wishing to participate in NEIS/Self-Employment Assistance
are to be referred by Workforce Australia or Disability Employment
Services providers. Services Australia staff are not to refer customers
directly to a NEIS/Self-Employment Assistance provider.
