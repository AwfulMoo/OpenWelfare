Extension of 13 Week NEIS pre-training and development

There may be occasions where the job seeker needs more than 13 weeks of
NEIS pre-training approved activity because they are still seeking
council approval or are requiring some business licensing before they
can commence their business under Department of Education, Skills and
Employment NEIS Agreement.

For these job seekers, an extension of the 13 weeks NEIS pre-training
activity can be arranged until they are able to commence in NEIS
assistance.

The NEIS Panel Members (NPM) updates the expected end date of the NEIS
training activity in Department of Education, Skills and Employment
systems and this information is then reflected on the Activity and
Exemption (AEX) screen.

The job seeker has to advise their jobactive or Disability Employment
Services provider in person of the extension and the provider is
required to update their Job Plan.

The Department of Education, Skills and Employment jobactive helpline
will assist with general NEIS enquiries and advise the job seeker of any
local NEIS providers near them. This phone number is located in
Department of Education, Skills and Employment.

Job seekers wishing to participate in NEIS are to be referred by
jobactive or Disability Employment Services providers. Staff are not to
refer customers directly to a NEIS Panel Member (NPM).
