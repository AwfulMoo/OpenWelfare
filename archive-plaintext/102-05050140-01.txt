This document outlines how the Child Override/Claim (CHOC) screen is
used to insert, correct or delete claim details for a child for correct
assessment of a customer's entitlement to payments and services in
relation to the child.

Recording information on the CHOC screen

Details may need to be recorded on the CHOC screen for each child
included in the customer's claim to ensure that:

-   the child is included in the assessment of the customer's
    entitlement for the payment. This can affect qualification for
    payment, for example, Parenting Payment Partnered (PPP) customers
    must have at least one PP child in their care, or rate of payment,
    for example, family assistance payments, some social security
    benefits can be paid at a higher 'with child' rate
-   the customer's principal carer status is assessed correctly. This
    can affect qualification for PPP, the rate of payment for JobSeeker
    Payment (JSP), Youth Allowance (YA) and Special Benefit (SpB), as
    well as mutual obligation requirements
-   the customer's additional income free area will be correct for
    single pensioners (excluding single PP customers)
-   the child will appear on the customer's Health Care Card (HCC) or
    Pensioner Concession Card (PCC)

Recording claim details on the CHOC screen will not necessarily mean
that the customer will be eligible for the child. This depends on other
child circumstances recorded, including shared care, age of child, and
student details.

A CLAIM line on the CHOC screen should not be coded for Parenting
Payment Single.

The CHOC screen may also be used to override child eligibility.
