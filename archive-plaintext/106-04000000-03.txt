|                                   | international treaties.           |

|                                   | Under the Constitution, the       |
|                                   | government has the power to       |
|                                   | decide on policy, sign and ratify |
|                                   | treaties and pass legislation     |
|                                   | through the parliament to give    |
|                                   | the treaty force in Australian    |
|                                   | law.                              |

|                                   | However, general practice is to   |
|                                   | table agreements in both houses   |
|                                   | of parliament prior to            |
|                                   | ratification with a National      |
|                                   | Interest Analysis (NIA) outlining |
|                                   | the reasons why Australia should  |
|                                   | become a party to the agreement.  |
|                                   | Treaties are considered by the    |
|                                   | Joint Standing Committee on       |
|                                   | Treaties (JSCOT).                 |

|                                   | Social security agreements are    |
|                                   | added as a schedule in the Social |
|                                   | Security (International           |
|                                   | Agreements) Act 1999, however,    |
|                                   | the commencement of an agreement, |
|                                   | or entry into force, is           |
|                                   | determined by an exchange of      |
|                                   | diplomatic notes between the      |
|                                   | countries (ratification).         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This usually occurs once all      |
|                                   | processes have been completed and |
|                                   | legislation is in place.          |
|                                   | Agreements usually specify that   |
|                                   | they will enter into force on the |
|                                   | first day of a specified number   |
|                                   | of months after the exchange of   |
|                                   | notes occurs.                     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Agreements are indefinite but may |
|                                   | be revised or modified by new     |
|                                   | agreement. Provisions to          |
|                                   | terminate the agreement are       |
|                                   | included, generally after a       |
|                                   | specified period if either        |
|                                   | country officially notifies the   |
|                                   | other through the diplomatic      |
|                                   | channels.                         |

|                                   | Transitional provisions are also  |
|                                   | included to preserve the rights   |
|                                   | of customers who are paid under   |
|                                   | the agreement or have lodged a    |
|                                   | claim prior to any revision or    |
|                                   | termination.                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Agreements generally provide for  |
|                                   | a separate administrative         |
|                                   | arrangement which details agreed  |
|                                   | processes including lodgement of  |
|                                   | claims and exchange of            |
|                                   | information.                      |

|                                   | The Agreements Act is not the     |
|                                   | enabling legislation. This means  |

|                                   | the Social Security Act 1991 and  |

|                                   | (Administration) Act 1999 still   |

|                                   | For example, under the Social     |
|                                   | Security (Administration) Act     |
|                                   | 1999, a person must generally be  |
|                                   | an Australian resident and in     |
|                                   | Australia to lodge a claim. If an |
|                                   | agreement provides that a person  |
|                                   | may claim when resident and       |
|                                   | present in the agreement country, |
|                                   | then that agreement provision     |
|                                   | applies regardless of the         |
|                                   | requirement in the Administration |
|                                   | Act.                              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A person may only need to use a   |
|                                   | certain provision of an agreement |
|                                   | to be entitled and not the whole  |
|                                   | agreement. However, when a person |
|                                   | uses a provision of an agreement  |
|                                   | to be eligible, such as, claims   |
|                                   | under agreements or transfers to  |
|                                   | agreements, they are considered   |
|                                   | to be paid 'by virtue' of the     |
|                                   | agreement and any other           |
|                                   | provisions of the agreement also  |
|                                   | apply, such as, specific          |
|                                   | portability conditions or         |
|                                   | calculation of the rate of        |
|                                   | payment.                          |

|                                   | A person may not need to totalise |
|                                   | and may only need an agreement to |
|                                   | lodge their claim outside         |
|                                   | Australia. For example, they have |

|                                   | residence, have a qualifying      |
|                                   | residence exemption or were an    |
|                                   | Australian resident when they met |

|                                   | (DSP) but in an agreement country |
|                                   | when they lodge a claim.          |

|                                   | Where it is specified in an       |
|                                   | agreement, certain provisions may |
|                                   | also affect autonomous customers  |
|                                   | without the need to be paid under |
|                                   | the agreement. These are normally |
|                                   | favourable provisions, such as,   |
|                                   | some foreign pensions being       |
|                                   | exempt from the income test or    |

|                                   | Agreements usually allow a person |
|                                   | to claim a payment covered by the |

|                                   | present in the agreement country. |
|                                   | Some agreements also allow a      |

|                                   | The customer can only use the     |

|                                   | As the agreement with Germany     |
|                                   | allows claims to be lodged while  |

|                                   | agreement with Austria accepts    |
|                                   | claims under other agreements,    |
|                                   | the claim can be lodged           |

|                                   | The customer must also satisfy    |
|                                   | any other rules under the other   |
|                                   | agreement and other social        |
|                                   | security law provisions,          |
|                                   | including portability. For        |
|                                   | example, Disability Support       |
|                                   | Pension (DSP) can be claimed in a |
|                                   | third country but has an ongoing  |
|                                   | residence requirement. Therefore, |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   living in the other country,  |
|                                   |     DSP cannot be paid            |
|                                   | -   temporarily in the other      |
|                                   |     country, DSP may generally be |
|                                   |     paid for the period it is     |
|                                   |     portable under domestic       |
|                                   |     legislation                   |

|                                   | Some agreement countries limit    |
|                                   | claims to people in that country  |
|                                   | or may have limitations based on  |
|                                   | citizenship. Many European        |
|                                   | countries may also be bound by    |
|                                   | various European conventions.     |
|                                   | Agreements generally overcome any |
|                                   | restrictions and allow Australian |
|                                   | residents or citizens to claim    |
|                                   | and receive payments on the same  |
|                                   | basis as resident or citizens of  |
|                                   | the other country.                |

|                                   | Note: the agreement with India    |
|                                   | contains unique lodgement rules.  |

|                                   | Agreements generally provide that |
|                                   | the date of lodgement of a claim, |
|                                   | notice or appeal in one country   |
|                                   | may be taken to be the date of    |
|                                   | lodgement for the purposes of     |
|                                   | other country. This means that    |

|                                   | delays. For example, the date a   |
|                                   | claim for a foreign pension from  |
|                                   | an agreement country is received  |
|                                   | by Services Australia, will be    |
|                                   | used by the foreign pension       |
|                                   | authority in the agreement        |
|                                   | country to decide from what date  |
|                                   | the customer can be paid the      |
|                                   | foreign pension.                  |

|                                   | Many agreements also allow a      |
|                                   | claim for payment from one        |
|                                   | country to be accepted as a claim |
|                                   | for the corresponding payment in  |
|                                   | the other country. This is        |
|                                   | referred to as 'claim for one =   |
|                                   | claim for the other'. For         |
|                                   | example, the date of lodgement of |
|                                   | a foreign 'retirement' pension    |
|                                   | with an agreement country         |
|                                   | authority may be taken to be the  |
|                                   | date of lodgement of a claim for  |
|                                   | Australian Age Pension. In most   |
|                                   | cases, conditions are applied     |
|                                   | before this may take effect, for  |
|                                   | example, the Australian pension   |
|                                   | claim must be received in         |
|                                   | Australia within 12 months of the |
|                                   | date of lodgement of the foreign  |
|                                   | 'retirement' pension.             |

|                                   | Agreements usually state that     |
|                                   | payments covered are payable      |
|                                   | indefinitely in either country.   |
|                                   | This includes those payments that |

|                                   | ceases to reside in Australia,    |

|                                   | and may impose specific           |

|                                   | according to how long the person  |
|                                   | has lived in Australia during     |

|                                   | rate of payment would apply to    |

|                                   | That is, all payments within the  |
|                                   | scope of the agreement are not    |

|                                   | However, many agreements allow    |
|                                   | one country to ask the other to   |

|                                   | amounts to be used to recover     |

|                                   | Direct embargo means the entire   |

|                                   | other country. That country then  |

|                                   | arrears amount and sends the      |

|                                   | Indirect embargo means a country  |
|                                   | must first specify the amount of  |
|                                   | the debt. The country that holds  |
|                                   | the arrears then sends only that  |
|                                   | amount to the other country and   |
|                                   | the remainder, if any, to the     |
|                                   | customer.                         |

|                                   | Each country uses their own       |
|                                   | exchange rates to convert amounts |
|                                   | to their currency. This can lead  |
|                                   | to small differences between      |
|                                   | amounts requested and amounts     |
|                                   | received.                         |

|                                   | For example, Australia requests   |
|                                   | an embargo of AUD$1,000 from an   |
|                                   | agreement country. That agreement |
|                                   | country converts the Australian   |
|                                   | dollar (AUD) amount to their      |
|                                   | currency and sends that amount of |
|                                   | foreign currency. When received,  |
|                                   | Australia converts the foreign    |
|                                   | currency back to AUD, which is    |
|                                   | then AUD$900.                     |

|                                   | Policy advice is that, provided a |
|                                   | country sends the amount          |
|                                   | requested as converted using      |
|                                   | their exchange rates, the         |
