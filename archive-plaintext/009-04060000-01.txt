This document outlines information to help Service Officers with issues
which may arise when Carer Payment (CP) is claimed by 2 or more carers
for one care receiver.

On this Page:

Qualifying for CP

Normally, a carer does not qualify for CP unless they are considered to
be the primary carer and are personally providing constant care.

If another person assists in providing care, details of the amount and
frequency of this other care must be provided to determine whether each
person personally provides constant care

In situations where the care is shared equally, and neither carer
provides a sufficient degree of care to meet the requirements, neither
carer qualifies for CP.

Child care receivers

A child care receiver (under 16 years) with a severe medical condition
or severe disability may qualify 2 or more carers for separate CP each
if:

-   each carer achieves a qualifying rating of 'intense'
-   to achieve a rating of 'intense', the total score for the Care Needs
    Assessment (ACL) questionnaire completed by the carer is 85 or more
-   the score on the Treating Health Professional (THP) questionnaire is
    a qualifying score of greater than zero, and
-   the THP certifies in writing that care is to be provided by 2 or
    more carers

A child care receiver (under 16 years) with a severe medical condition
or severe disability may qualify 2 or more carers for a separate CP each
if:

-   the care load is so high that 2 or more carers need to provide daily
    care
-   a medical practitioner has certified the child care receiver has a
    'terminal condition’, and
-   the THP certifies in writing that care is to be provided by 2 or
    more carers

Note: the medical report will identify the number of carers required to
care for the child. If there is any doubt about the number of carers
required to care for the child, further investigation may be
appropriate, for example a social worker assessment or discussion with
the THP.

Adult care receivers

An adult care receiver (16 years or over) who is likely to suffer from
their disability permanently or for an extended period may qualify 2 or
more carers for separate Carer Payments if:

-   Each carer personally provides constant care for the care receiver -
    such as care required for a significant period each day (at least
    the equivalent of a normal working day). This care can overlap and
    does not necessarily have to be in separate periods
-   Each person can fully satisfy the qualification criteria.
-   The care receiver's Adult Disability Assessment Tool (ADAT) score is
    80 or more, including a Treating Health Professional (THP) score of
    32 or more. Such a high score indicates the care receiver's needs
    are high

Note: if an adult care receiver is certified as being in the final phase
of a terminal illness only that part of the Carer Payment and/or Carer
Allowance Medical Report for a person 16 years or over (SA332a) needs to
be completed. The care receiver is automatically assessed as having a
qualifying ADAT score of 30. However, if 2 or more carers wish to claim
CP the care receiver will need to be reassessed using another SA332a and
have an ADAT score of 80 or more (and 32 or more from the THP).

Re-use and re-claim provisions

Child - Re-use and re-claim provisions allow eligible Treating Health
Professional (THP) Medical Reports and/or Care Needs Assessments (CNA)
previously supplied to be used for a subsequent claim. The online claim
and First Contact Service Offer (FCSO) will identify the option to
re-use this existing data for the child care receiver if the most recent
reports meet the re-use provisions.

Adult - Re-claim and re-use provisions allow information previously
gathered under the Adult Disability Assessment Determination (ADAD 1999)
or terminal condition assessment for Carer Payment (adult) and/or Carer
Allowance (adult) to be used for a subsequent claim. Re-claim provisions
are automatically assessed when a customer claims online or FCSO is run.

The Resources page contains an example of when constant care
requirements are met, Q134 letter text, a link to the Level 2 Policy
Help Desk Online Query Form and Processing Service details.
