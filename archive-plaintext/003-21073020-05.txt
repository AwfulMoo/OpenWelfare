All Other Areas in NSW

Due to changes in relevant areas deemed a COVID-19 hotspot since August
2021, staff must carefully check which of the 3 impact reasons and
relevant area a customer is claiming under.

Customers claiming the COVID-19 Disaster Payment can claim under 1 of 3
impact reasons

-   L - live or work in a relevant area subject to a state public health
    order for restricted movement that is a deemed a COVID-19 hotspot by
    the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer, or
-   P - were present in a COVID-19 hotspot at the time the restricted
    movement was declared and are now subject to a second public health
    order that restricts their movement in the state or territory they
    are currently in, or
-   I - live or work in a state or territory that has an area subject to
    a state public health order for restricted movement by the
    Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer

Note: for online claims, this shows as â€˜I am impacted by a COVID-19
restricted movement/lockdown, but do not live, work and was not present
in a COVID-19 hotspot

All relevant areas in All Other Areas of NSW stopped being a COVID-19
hotspot from 19 October 2021. The impact reasons a customer was able to
apply under for any relevant period is outlined in tables 3 to 5.

For relevant period 13, customers will only be able to apply if they
received payment ($200) for relevant period 12 and continue to meet the
eligibility criteria.

For relevant period 13, customers will only be able to apply under one
impact reason

-   F - received the final payment that was released in the relevant
    period in which the 80% target was met. Note: while this is not 1 of
    the 3 impact reasons a customer can claim under for earlier relevant
    periods, for the final relevant period, it is the only option a
    customer can claim under. The customer must have previously received
    a payment for 1 of the 3 impact reasons to receive a payment for the
    final relevant period

Table 3: shows the impact reasons a customer can claim, depending on the
relevant period (RP) claimed for RP 1-5

Geospatial tool

Due to changes in the relevant areas deemed a COVID-19 hotspot for
different parts of New South Wales since August 2021, staff must use
this tool to carefully check the relevant area a customer is claiming
under to determine if they live, work or were present in a COVID-19
hotspot area for the relevant period.

Note: for customers outside a COVID-19 hotspot, staff need to check the
residential and/or employer addresses provided for the relevant period
are in New South Wales.

To assess if a customer lives, works or was present in a COVID-19
hotspot area:

-   Open the NSW Live Feed App
-   Place the address given by the customer in the search box.
    Residential and employer addresses may need to be checked
-   Select the correct address that populates in the drop down

Before all of New South Wales was deemed a COVID-19 hotspot and was
subject to restricted movement, for any claim relating to relevant
period 1 and 2:

Select COVID-19 Disaster Payment NSW in the Layers menu

To be eligible for living or working in, or present in, an area deemed a
COVID-19 hotspot:

-   a relevant area in Sydney, the address must lie in the red shaded
    area to be eligible
-   a relevant area in Greater Sydney, the address must lie in the blue
    shaded area to be eligible
-   a relevant area in Greater Hunter (from 5 August 2021) for All Other
    Areas in NSW, the address must lie in the brown shaded area to be
    eligible
-   Blayney, Cabonne and Orange (for 21-28 July 2021), for All Other
    Areas in NSW, the address must lie in the purple shaded area
-   Armidale, Ballina, Byron, Lismore, Richmond Valley and Tamworth
    (from 9 August 2021), for All Other Areas in NSW, the address must
    lie in the green shaded area
-   Bathurst, Bogan, Bourke, Brewarrina, Dubbo, Gilgandra, Narromine,
    Walget and Warren (from 11 August 2021), for All Other Areas in NSW,
    the address must lie in the yellow shaded area

From 15 August 2021, all of New South Wales is deemed a COVID-19
hotspot. For any claim relating to relevant period 3 onwards:

The following maps will be automatically selected in the layers menu -
staff do not need to unselect a map:

-   COVID-19 Disaster Payment NSW - August 2021 and
-   Jervis Bay - COVID-19 - Disaster Payment NSW

the address must lie in the blue shaded area to be eligible

From 19 October 2021, all of New South Wales is no longer deemed a
COVID-19 hotspot. For any claim relating to relevant period 13 onwards:

The following maps will be automatically selected in the layers menu -
staff do not need to unselect a map:

-   COVID-19 Disaster Payment NSW - August 2021 and
-   Jervis Bay - COVID-19 - Disaster Payment NSW

the address must lie in the blue shaded area to be eligible

Check the relevant area so the correct workflow is run

Staff must check the relevant area by selecting:

-   the small bright blue box, then
-   in the pop up box, the white triangle arrow that points to the right

The relevant area will show in bold at the top of the pop up box as
follows:

-   Relevant Area: Greater Sydney, or
-   Relevant Area: Sydney, or
-   August 2021 map - Relevant Area: Other NSW (for All Other Areas in
    NSW)
-   Not the August 2021 map - Relevant Area: All Other Areas in NSW or
    for the Greater Hunter, Hunter Valley & All Other Areas of NSW

The Local Government Area (LGA) where the address is located will show
below the Relevant Area

To make sure the correct workflow is selected, check the relevant area
(Greater Sydney, Sydney or Other NSW/All Other Areas in NSW) that shows
in the pop up box

For Other NSW/All Other Areas in NSW select the workflow with outside
relevant area
