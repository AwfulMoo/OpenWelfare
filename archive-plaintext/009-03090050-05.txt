What to do following a death

System does not pay correct CA lump sum bereavement payment

The system is not paying Carer Allowance (CA) bereavement payments
correctly when the death of a CA child is actioned.

-   The system is paying a bereavement payment equivalent to 14 weeks of
    CA but not taking into account any payments made after the death
-   Payments paid after the death are showing as a debt on the
    Assessment Results (AR) screen but when the activity is finalised
    the system auto waives the debt

This table shows how to calculate a CA bereavement payment:

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Step                              | Action                            |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Work out the rate at which Carer  |
|                                   | Allowance was payable to the      |
|                                   | person immediately before the     |
|                                   | child died.                       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 2                                 | Work out the number of paydays of |
|                                   | the person in the bereavement     |
|                                   | lump sum period                   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 3                                 | Multiply the rate obtained in     |
|                                   | step 1 by the number obtained in  |
|                                   | step 2. The result is the amount  |
|                                   | of the lump sum payable to the    |
|                                   | person under this section.        |
