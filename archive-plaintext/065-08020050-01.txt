This document outlines the role of Home Equity Access Scheme (the
Scheme) National team upon receipt of advice of settlement of a Scheme
debt.

Background

The Scheme customers wanting to settle their loan can be placed in
contact with the Home Equity Access Scheme National team to initiate
settlement.

Settlement can occur for the below reasons:

-   Sale of the security property
-   Customer is deceased and there is no surviving partner
-   The surviving partner would like to settle
-   Recovery from the surviving partner’s estate
-   The customer and/or partner have decided they no longer require this
    service and have the funds to repay the loan

Changes to land title details

The payments made to a customer under the Scheme are a loan:

-   secured by Australian real estate

A secured charge or caveat is lodged by the Commonwealth over the real
estate to:

-   protect Government outlays, and
-   make sure Services Australia is advised of any changes to the land
    title details

For example, via an impending sale of the real estate used to secure a
Scheme loan. If this occurs, the Home Equity Access Scheme National
team:

-   cancel the loan as appropriate
-   can arrange settlement
-   renegotiate the loan security

If a customer wants to offer another property as security, see the
Resources page for the Substitute Security Tasking request template.

applications for documents and valuations details.

Customer obligation to contact the agency before settlement

If a customer intends to sell the real estate securing a Scheme loan,
they must:

-   contact the agency before settlement to arrange for renegotiation of
    the loan security, or
-   repay the outstanding loan balance upon settlement of the sale

No Negative Equity Guarantee (NNEG)

If a customer contacts about settling their Scheme loan, the NNEG must
be considered.

A NNEG applies when a customer settles their Scheme loan. This means
they will not need to repay more than the current market value of the
property used as security. The NNEG will not apply if a customer:

-   intentionally increases encumbrances (such as mortgages) on the
    secured property which limits the Commonwealth’s ability to recover
    the full amount of the loan balance
-   misrepresents their circumstances while participating in the Scheme,
    or
-   commits fraud

When the customer is first granted under the Scheme, the equity in the
property that secures the Scheme loan is calculated using information
from the HEAS Details (PLS) screens

At settlement however, if the NNEG is to be applied an ‘adjusted real
estate value’ needs to be determined. The adjusted real estate value is
the current market value minus any non-Scheme encumbrances or loans.

There is a ministerial determination that sets out how the ‘adjusted
real estate value’ is calculated:

The Commonwealth cannot recover more than the ‘adjusted real estate
value’

If a customer settles their Scheme debt and repays the total amount
owing via electronic banking, and it is later found the NNEG applied to
their circumstances, a:

-   full, or
-   partial refund is required

If possible, determine if the NNEG applies before a customer makes
repayment.

The Resources page contains examples of how to calculate the adjusted
real estate value for NNEG.

Settlement of loan before release of the security

If a customer or nominee contacts requesting release of the security
property, they must settle their loan first.

    see Home Equity Access Scheme > Resources page > FAQs
-   The Settlement letter, that can be issued from Home Equity Access
    Scheme letters (HEASL) in Process Direct, and provides projected
    payout figures
-   See Repayment of Home Equity Access Scheme loans for more details
    about repayments, and options on how to repay the loan

Repayment of loan when customer has died

The loan must be repaid from a customer's estate after their or their
surviving partner's death. In the case of the death of a single
customer, the agency will usually enforce the charge on the real estate
and recover the outstanding loan balance immediately from the estate.

amount for more details.
