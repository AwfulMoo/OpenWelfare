For staff in the Tasmanian Transport Programs (TTP) Team only

This document outlines processes for TFES overpayments, underpayments
and manual debt calculations.

Overpayments of TFES

If an overpayment has been made to a claimant this can be deducted in
whole or in part from any future amount payable to the claimant or
recovered as a debt.

Manual debt calculations

Manual debt calculation arises after a claimant has had a claim
finalised, then had goods exported to other markets or received returned
goods which will result in a debt. This debt must be manually calculated
by an Assessor in the Tasmanian Transport Programs (TTP) team.

Underpayments of TFES

If an underpayment has been made to a claimant, a further payment may be
made to the claimant to correct the underpayment.
