|                                   | Jan and Mal separate on 8 March   |
|                                   | 2001. Jan attends the local       |
|                                   | Centrelink Service Centre on 9    |
|                                   | March 2001 and claims income      |
|                                   | support on the same day. Jan      |
|                                   | calls Child Support the same day  |
|                                   | to apply for a child support      |
|                                   | assessment and chooses to collect |
|                                   | child support privately.          |

|                                   | assume the end of the relevant    |
|                                   | period will be 30 June 2001       |
|                                   | unless Jan advises a further      |
|                                   | change in circumstances.          |

|                                   | application on 1 April 2001, the  |
|                                   | assessment backdated to 9 March   |
|                                   | 2001, i.e. the day of contact.    |
|                                   | Jan then reconciles with Mal on   |
|                                   | 28 April 2001 and requests Child  |
|                                   | Support end the assessment on     |
|                                   | that day. The reconciliation      |
|                                   | fails and Jan reclaims income     |
|                                   | support and reapplies for a child |
|                                   | support assessment on 15 May      |

|                                   | Jan's situation remains unchanged |
|                                   | as at 30 June 2001.               |

|                                   | case on the 30 April 2006. The    |
|                                   | customer's relevant period would  |
|                                   | be the 1 September 2005 to the 29 |

|                                   | relationship. During the 2014/15  |
|                                   | financial year there were a       |
|                                   | number of changes of care for the |

|                                   | Freda and Carmine were in         |
|                                   | Philippa's care prior to 01 July  |
|                                   | 2014, subsequently left care on   |

|                                   | Philippa's care on 21 February    |
|                                   | 2015. This means they were in     |
|                                   | Philippa's care for 324 days      |
|                                   | during the 2014/15 financial      |
|                                   | year. Willow was in Philippa's    |

|                                   | left care on 04 October 2014.     |

|                                   | There are 2 relevant periods in   |
|                                   | this case 01 July 2014 to 10      |
|                                   | January 2015 and 21 February 2015 |
|                                   | to 30 June 2015, as the remaining |
|                                   | 2 children to the case (Freda and |
|                                   | Carmine) left care for the period |
|                                   | 11 January-20 February 2015. The  |
|                                   | total number of days in the 2     |
|                                   | relevant periods is 324.          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Even though Willow left the       |
|                                   | customerâ€™s care on 4 October      |
|                                   | 2014, the maintenance liability   |
|                                   | remained in place for the other 2 |
|                                   | children, and therefore the first |
|                                   | relevant period did not end until |
|                                   | 11 January 2015.                  |

|                                   | When the other 2 children         |
|                                   | returned to the care of the       |
|                                   | customer on 21 February 2015, a   |
|                                   | new maintenance liability was put |
|                                   | in place, and therefore a new     |
|                                   | relevant period commenced. This   |
|                                   | second relevant period finished   |
|                                   | at the end of the 2014-15         |
|                                   | financial year.                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Although there are 2 relevant     |
|                                   | periods, there is no need to do a |
|                                   | separate calculation for each     |
|                                   | period when annualising the       |
|                                   | amount of maintenance income. The |
|                                   | formula for annualising           |
|                                   | maintenance income states the     |
|                                   | division is by the total number   |
|                                   | of days in the relevant period or |
|                                   | periods in the income year. In    |
|                                   | this case the total number of     |
|                                   | days in the 2 relevant periods is |
|                                   | 324.                              |
