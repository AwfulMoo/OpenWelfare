Claiming 31340

Claiming 31340 (excision of one or more of muscle, bone or cartilage) scenario

Table 2: This table provides examples of scenario claiming 31340.

When claiming item 31340, it must be keyed under the base item. Where
two base items are billed with two items 31340, each 31340 must be keyed
directly under its corresponding base item for the system to calculate
the correct benefit.

If the items were not keyed in this manner, the system cannot apply the
derived fee correctly.

Note: for electronic claiming, the provider will have to ensure the item
numbers are in the correct order before submitting the claim.

| Example                           | Response                          |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Example A                         | A provider has excised 2 lesions  |
|                                   | and it was clinically indicated   |
|                                   | to excise underlying muscle, bone |
|                                   | or cartilage for each of the      |
|                                   | lesions. The items must be keyed  |
|                                   | in the following order:           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   excision item for lesion A    |
|                                   | -   31340 for lesion A            |
|                                   | -   excision item for lesion B    |
|                                   | -   31340 for lesion B            |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Example B                         | A provider has excised 2 lesions  |
|                                   | and the 2nd one (lesion B) also   |
|                                   | required excision of muscle, bone |
|                                   | or cartilage. The items must be   |
|                                   | keyed with the 31340 below the    |
|                                   | correct lesion.                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   excision for lesion A         |
|                                   | -   excision for lesion B         |
|                                   | -   31340 for lesion B            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the 31340 is keyed under       |
|                                   | lesion A the derived fee will be  |
|                                   | incorrectly calculated for lesion |
|                                   | A rather than lesion B where it   |
|                                   | was actually performed.           |

|                                   | excision items are payable and no |

|                                   | examination shows that the lesion |
|                                   | is a seborrheic keratosis?        |

| 7                                 | How does the provider bill for    |
|                                   | multiple services provided on the |
|                                   | one occasion if they have to wait |
|                                   | for histology to determine the    |
|                                   | item number?                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: Where two or more         |
|                                   | services are provided on the one  |
|                                   | occasion, all services must be    |
|                                   | either bulk billed or privately   |
|                                   | charged. Split billing of claims  |
|                                   | subject to the Multiple Operation |
|                                   | Rule is contrary to legislation   |
|                                   | and all Group T8 Items for the    |
|                                   | same occasion should be billed on |
|                                   | the one account or receipt.       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Therefore, billing for all        |
|                                   | procedures should be after        |
|                                   | histology results have been       |

|                                   | service as the associated skin    |
|                                   | lesion item?                      |

|                                   | Answer: It is a legislative       |
|                                   | requirement that item 45201 is    |
|                                   | performed in association with     |
|                                   | certain skin lesion excision      |

|                                   | patients who live in a rural or   |
|                                   | remote location item 45201 can be |
|                                   | claimed up to 3 days after the    |
|                                   | initial skin lesion excision      |
|                                   | service.                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The practitioner other than the   |
|                                   | practitioner that performed the   |
|                                   | initial excision service may      |
|                                   | perform the service under item    |
|                                   | 45201. The date of service for    |
|                                   | item 45201 should be the date the |
|                                   | flap was performed, not the date  |
|                                   | the excision was performed. Where |
|                                   | a skin flap service is performed  |
|                                   | 1 to 3 days after the associated  |
|                                   | skin lesion excision, the         |
|                                   | multiple operation rule does not  |
|                                   | apply as the services occurred on |

|                                   | lesion and it is clinically       |
|                                   | indicated to repair the excision  |
|                                   | using multiple skin flaps what    |
|                                   | item/s should be used?            |

|                                   | Answer: If the provider uses a    |
|                                   | â€˜Zâ€™ plasty, which is a particular |
|                                   | type of transposition flap repair |
|                                   | where two flaps are created,      |
|                                   | benefit is only payable under     |
|                                   | 45201 once per defect.            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the additional flap is not a   |
|                                   | â€˜Zâ€™ plasty, then the first flap   |
|                                   | should be claimed under item      |
|                                   | 45201, as long as the item        |
|                                   | description is met and the        |
|                                   | additional flap under 45202. The  |
|                                   | multiple operation rule will      |

|                                   | flap rests with the clinical      |
