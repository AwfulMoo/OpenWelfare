| 1                                 | Scott suffered a back injury      |
|                                   | doing heavy work as a teenager    |
|                                   | and was worried about the future  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Scott moved to Australia as a     |
|                                   | child and did not go to high      |
|                                   | school, as both parents needed    |
|                                   | Scott to stay at home and look    |
|                                   | after the younger siblings. As a  |
|                                   | teenager, Scott had a back injury |
|                                   | doing heavy work. Scott worked as |
|                                   | a cleaner for a while, but had to |
|                                   | stop because the physical demand  |
|                                   | of the job exacerbated the        |
|                                   | previous back injury. Scott       |
|                                   | lodged a medical certificate      |
|                                   | identifying the impacts of his    |
|                                   | back condition and his inability  |
|                                   | to return to his previous         |
|                                   | employment role.                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | At the ESAt, Scott revealed that  |
|                                   | he was worried about the future.  |
|                                   | This uncertainty caused great     |
|                                   | distress. Scott was relieved to   |
|                                   | be able to talk to someone about  |
|                                   | the current situation. Most       |
|                                   | importantly, Scott was grateful   |
|                                   | to be given a possible solution.  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The Assessor determined that      |
|                                   | Scott needed help to learn to     |
|                                   | manage the back injury and to     |
|                                   | assist in finding more suitable   |
|                                   | types of work. The Assessor       |
|                                   | recommended that Scott be         |
|                                   | referred to Disability Employment |
|                                   | Services (DES) - Disability       |
|                                   | Management Services (DMA) and     |
|                                   | arranged an appointment for Scott |
|                                   | with a DES provider.              |
