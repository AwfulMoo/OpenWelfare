| 1                                 | Determining the qualification     |
|                                   | date                              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Teena contacts Services Australia |
|                                   | on 1 June and is granted Austudy  |
|                                   | from this date. Teena started a 3 |
|                                   | year course at the University of  |
|                                   | Western Australia on 22 February  |
|                                   | of the same year.                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Teena's qualification for SSS     |
|                                   | begins on the first day of        |
|                                   | meeting all the conditions of     |
|                                   | eligibility for SSS. From that    |
|                                   | day (the SSS qualification time), |
|                                   | Teena must be undertaking study   |
|                                   | in an approved scholarship course |
|                                   | 35 days after the qualification   |
|                                   | date.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | In Teena's case, the              |
|                                   | qualification for SSS begins on 1 |
|                                   | June. This is because although    |
|                                   | Teena was studying from 22        |
|                                   | February, one of the eligibility  |
|                                   | conditions for SSS is being in    |
|                                   | receipt of a qualifying payment - |
|                                   | in this case, Austudy. Teena is   |
|                                   | eligible for SSS for the first    |
|                                   | study period in the year.         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The next regular SSS payment is   |
|                                   | due on 21 July, however, there    |
|                                   | must be a break of at least two   |
|                                   | months between SSS payments. This |
|                                   | means Teena would receive the     |
|                                   | next SSS with the regular Austudy |
|                                   | payment on or after 1 August.     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Note: a person cannot receive     |
|                                   | more than two payments of SSS in  |
|                                   | a calendar year.                  |

|                                   | studies after a break. The        |
|                                   | qualification for SSS in this     |
|                                   | period begins on this date        |
|                                   | (students studying a 2 semester   |
|                                   | course normally re-commence in    |

|                                   | to qualify for SSS).              |

|                                   | As Ting is actually undertaking   |
|                                   | study on 1 July, the              |

|                                   | that date and because there are   |

|                                   | August, Ting will qualify for SSS |

|                                   | at Macquarie University that was  |
|                                   | started in the first semester     |
|                                   | 2013. Meagan received a SSS for   |
|                                   | this course in the first          |
|                                   | semester.                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | On 2 August 2013, Meagan returns  |
|                                   | to the university to continue     |
|                                   | studying for the course in the    |
|                                   | second semester. However, on 28   |
|                                   | August 2013, Megan decides to     |
|                                   | defer the studies until 2014.     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Part of the eligibility for SSS   |
|                                   | is that students must commence or |
|                                   | recommence studies and be         |
|                                   | studying in an approved           |

|                                   | days after their qualification    |
|                                   | date for the period.              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Although Meagan recommenced       |
|                                   | studies in the second semester on |
|                                   | the 2 August 2013, Megan was not  |
|                                   | studying 35 calendar days later.  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This means that Meagan has been   |
|                                   | overpaid SSS in second semester   |
|                                   | and will need to repay this       |
|                                   | amount. Meagan's overpayment will |
|                                   | need to be raised manually.       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | To assist with calculating        |
|                                   | scholarship eligibility, the      |
|                                   | system uses default study start   |
|                                   | date for continuing students. The |
|                                   | default study start dates for SSS |
|                                   | are 21 February and 21 July. The  |
|                                   | system uses these default dates   |
|                                   | when calculating whether a        |
|                                   | student has met the 35 days study |
|                                   | requirement.                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | These default dates may not be    |
|                                   | the same as the actual start of   |
|                                   | the institution's semester, so    |
|                                   | when coding student end dates it  |
|                                   | is essential that Service         |
|                                   | Officers check whether the        |
|                                   | student has met the 35 day study  |
|                                   | requirement based on their actual |
|                                   | start date and not the default    |
|                                   | start date.                       |

|                                   | January 2016 Angus must have been |
|                                   | in continuous receipt of YA since |
|                                   | the last Student Start-up         |
|                                   | Scholarship payment prior to 1    |
|                                   | January 2016. This means Angus    |
|                                   | needs to have received YA without |
|                                   | a break since 29 July 2015.       |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | for grandfathering purposes.      |
|                                   | Therefore Angus is regarded as    |
|                                   | receiving YA during the 6         |
|                                   | fortnights at nil rate.           |

|                                   | However, Angus also has a         |
|                                   | non-payment period from the date  |
|                                   | his YA is cancelled until YA is   |

|                                   | The non-payment period is 28 days |
|                                   | (four weeks).                     |

|                                   | As this non-payment period is     |
|                                   | less than 6 weeks long it is an   |
|                                   | ‘allowable break’ and does not    |
|                                   | count as a break in payment.      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Therefore Angus is eligible for   |
|                                   | Student Start-up Scholarship in   |
|                                   | 2016.                             |

|                                   | However, because Angus’s rate of  |
|                                   | YA was zero on the default SSS    |

|                                   | 2016, Angus did not receive a SSS |
|                                   | payment prior to his YA being     |
|                                   | cancelled.                        |

|                                   | 2015. Because Portia’s rate is    |
|                                   | zero, Portia stops reporting      |
|                                   | after two fortnights and Youth    |

|                                   | more than 6 weeks so it can only  |
|                                   | be treated as an ‘allowable       |
|                                   | break’ if Portia had been         |

|                                   | The non-payment period starts on  |
|                                   | the day her YA is cancelled (20   |
|                                   | December) at which time Portia    |
|                                   | had only been receiving YA for 11 |

|                                   | This means Portia is only         |
|                                   | entitled to an 'allowable break'  |
|                                   | of up to 6 weeks.                 |

|                                   | Because Portia has had a          |

|                                   | before 1 January 2016, Portia is  |

|                                   | In September 2015 Sacha went      |
|                                   | overseas and YA was suspended     |
|                                   | under the portability provisions. |

|                                   | is therefore an ‘allowable break’ |
|                                   | for SSS grandfathering purposes.  |

|                                   | provisions. After six weeks YA is |

|                                   | than 12 weeks is now an           |

|                                   | 12 weeks, which means Sacha       |
