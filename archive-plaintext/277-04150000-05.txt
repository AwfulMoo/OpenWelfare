Automated Message – Election Accepted to Pay Voluntarily

When selected from the Services Australia workspace, customers will be
played the Automated Message:

'You’ve asked us not to have your employer deduct child support payments
from your pay. This means you will make your payments direct to Services
Australia. In doing so you understand:

-   you must make your payments before the due date, and contact us if
    you cannot make your payment on time
-   if you fail to make your payment on time and don’t tell us, we will
    ask your employer to make deductions from your pay - this ensures
    child support will be paid regularly and on time
-   the other party may request that we review this decision, so it’s
    important that you maintain timely payments'
