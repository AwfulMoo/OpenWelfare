This document outlines the Recovery Fee Workload Management (WLM)
process within the Customer Compliance Division.

Workload Management involvement in Recovery Fee

When processing a Recovery Fee within the Customer Compliance Division
there are a number of Workload Management steps to be followed. This
will ensure the intervention is actioned at the correct time and
returned to the correct site for actioning.

When the customer contacts to discuss the Recovery Fee, any Compliance
Officer (CO) can have the Recovery Fee conversation with the customer
and must advise the customer whether the Recovery Fee will be applied or
not.

The CO who calculated the debt will then be responsible for raising the
debt, applying/not applying the Recovery Fee and finalising the
intervention.

Earnings debts with a period of 14 days or less will be automatically
raised on completion of the earnings activity. Recovery Fee is not
applied to auto raised debts.

Note: the customers engagement will determine the Recovery Fee for the
online compliance intervention process.

Contacts must be recorded on the Review Contact Summary (IRCS) screen or
Review Contact Details (IRCD) screen.
