| 1                                 | John was receiving ABSTUDY PES in |
|                                   | 2021 and completed the course on  |
|                                   | 14 September 2020. John has now   |
|                                   | advised Services Australia on 20  |
|                                   | April 2022 that a new full-time   |
|                                   | course started and it started on  |
|                                   | 13 February 2022.                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | ABSTUDY PES can be backdated to 1 |
|                                   | January as John has not had a     |
|                                   | break greater than one semester.  |
|                                   | The closing date is not relevant  |
|                                   | in John's situation as ABSTUDY    |
|                                   | PES is being restored.            |

| 2                                 | Simon is a full-time student, and |
|                                   | lodged a claim for 'Incidentals   |
|                                   | Allowance only' and was granted   |
|                                   | before the ABSTUDY PES closing    |
|                                   | date. Simon has now contacted     |
|                                   | after the closing date asking to  |
|                                   | claim ABSTUDY PES, and have it    |
|                                   | backdated.                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Provided that Simon qualifies,    |
|                                   | ABSTUDY PES can be backdated. The |
|                                   | closing date has been met as      |
|                                   | Simon already claimed ABSTUDY     |
|                                   | before the closing date.          |

|                                   | over the vacation break. Special  |
|                                   | coding is required to facilitate  |
|                                   | the payment over the holiday      |
|                                   | period.                           |

| 4                                 | Raven submits an ABSTUDY PES      |
|                                   | claim on 1 July 2020. Raven is    |
|                                   | claiming PES for the same course  |
|                                   | started in February 2019 as a     |
|                                   | part time student. Raven will     |
|                                   | resume studies as a full time     |
|                                   | student on 15 July 2020.          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Although continuing in the same   |
|                                   | course Raven is not deemed to be  |
|                                   | a continuing student as Raven was |
|                                   | not previously a concessional or  |
|                                   | full time student. The PES start  |
|                                   | date is therefore the 15th July,  |
|                                   | the date Raven starts the course  |
|                                   | as a full time student            |

| 1                                 | Sarah is studying part-time in a  |
|                                   | 29 week course starting on 22     |
|                                   | February 2022 and finishing on 30 |
|                                   | November 2022. Sarah lodges a PES |
|                                   | claim on 15 March 2022.           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | As this is not a full year        |
|                                   | course, the start date is         |
|                                   | determined by the start of the    |
|                                   | course, the four week rule and    |
|                                   | the date of receipt of the claim. |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | In this case the customer has     |
|                                   | lodged within 4 weeks of starting |
|                                   | the course, so Sarah is entitled  |
|                                   | to be paid PES back to 22         |
|                                   | February 2022.                    |

|                                   | Note: the customer is not         |
|                                   | entitled to be paid to 31         |
|                                   | December 2022 but only to the     |
|                                   | course end date of 30 November    |
|                                   | 2022. To prevent the system from  |
|                                   | paying to 31 December, offset the |
|                                   | end dates on the EDC screen by    |
|                                   | making the institution end date   |
|                                   | one day later than the student    |
|                                   | end date.                         |

|                                   | 2022, as the claim was not lodged |
|                                   | within 4 weeks of starting the    |
