This document outlines the process when actioning changes to care
arrangements for Carer Payment (CP).

Changes to care arrangements require verification

Services Australia bases the assessment of 2 or more carers for 1 care
receiver on the medical condition of the care receiver. Changes to care
arrangements will require verification that the care continues to be
provided in the residence of the care receiver. This is unless the
change is due to:

-   overseas absences
-   allowable absences when the carer is absent from the caring
    situation, or
-   respite and hospitalisation

When a carer contacts to advise of a change in the care arrangements,
the Service Officer needs to ensure:

-   the relevant information is gathered and verified by contacting all
    carers
-   each carer continues to meet the qualifications for care
-   the records are updated to reflect the new circumstances

If a carer is in receipt of Carer Payment (CP) when the care of the care
receiver is shared, the temporary cessation of care (respite) provisions
will apply to the CP carer while the care receiver is in the care of the
other person. When the Temporary Cessation of Care (respite) is
exhausted, CP will be cancelled.

Dispute between carers

If there is a dispute between 2 carers over the care provided see Change
of care for Carer Payment (CP) and Carer Allowance (CA) customers.
