If a child is in immediate danger or risk of harm you must act, and a
delegate must call 000.

This document outlines information for Services Australia social workers
conducting Unreasonable To Live At Home (UTLAH) assessments.

Child safe framework

Services Australia has a zero tolerance approach to child abuse.

A staff member must act when they see or hear behaviour, which raises
concern about a child or young person’s safety. Follow the agency's Risk
Identification and Reporting model when identifying and responding to
child safety concerns. See Risk identification and management of threats
to the safety or welfare of a child.

Conducting an UTLAH assessment

A customer:

receiving or claiming Youth Allowance (YA), Disability Support Pension
(DSP) or Special Benefit (SpB) may be considered independent under
UTLAH, or

may be exempt from providing parental income for Tertiary Access Payment
(TAP) if their circumstances meet the UTLAH provisions:

-   if they cannot live at the home of either or both parents
-   if they are not receiving continuous financial or other support,
    directly or indirectly, from their parent(s) or guardian(s), and
-   if they are not receiving any other payment in the nature of income
    support from a commonwealth, state or territory government

Reasons why the young person cannot live in the home of a parent:

-   extreme family breakdown or other similar exceptional circumstances,
-   living at home would cause a serious risk to the customer's physical
    or mental well-being due to family and domestic violence, sexual
    abuse or other similar unreasonable circumstances, or
-   the parents are not able to provide a suitable home for the customer
    due to a lack of stable accommodation

A customer aged under 18 years of age claiming Disability Support
Pension (DSP), Youth Allowance (YA), Special Benefit (SpB), Tertiary
Access Payment (TAP) or ABSTUDY UTLAH must be interviewed and assessed
for independence by a Services Australia social worker.

When conducting an UTLAH assessment the Services Australia social worker
will:

-   interview the customer
-   interview one or both of the parents/guardians
-   interview the third party, and
-   record all details in a Social Work Information System (SWIS) report

The social worker will also assess potential risk of harm to the young
person or others, such as siblings.

Guardian in an UTLAH assessment

Consideration must be given to all four factors listed below in
determining a guardian for UTLAH:

-   The duration of care - long standing relationship between the young
    person and adult
-   The kind of care - the young person is given constant care and
    attention, emotional and material support as would be expected of
    parents to child. The young person is nurtured and treated as a
    member of the family in every way, with every attention given to
    welfare and education
-   The degree of independence - the young person does not have a high
    degree of independence and ability to manage his/her own affairs
-   The nature of the relationship - a close, intimate relationship
    between the young person and adult, like that between a parent and
    child. A parent-child like relationship is often, but not
    necessarily, linked with duration of care

Notes:

-   if a young person is living with a relative, that does not
    necessarily make them a 'guardian', even if the young person refers
    to them as their 'guardian' verbally or on a claim form
-   receiving Family Tax Benefit (FTB) is a trigger for exploration, but
    does not necessarily indicate that the carer has a role of a
    guardian

Situations where parents have separated

If a young person's parents are separated, circumstances about each of
the parents must be assessed. For more details, see the Process page.

Timeframe for interview to be conducted

The interview with the young person should be conducted within 5 working
days of lodgement of the claim whenever possible. If the young person is
in need of immediate social work help, or is under 16 years of age and
applying for Special Benefit, every effort should be made to conduct an
interview within 24 hours.

Eligibility for the UTLAH independent category

Assessment of eligibility for the UTLAH independent category is based on
the details taken from:

-   the claim form
-   additional documents, and
-   the information received during the interviews

Once the assessment is finalised, a decision is recorded in the SWIS
report and on the customer’s record. During the assessment process, the
social worker will also assess the young person's support needs.

Note: a new UTLAH assessment and a SWIS report are not needed if:

-   there have been no changes in circumstances, and
-   the customer has received a payment, and has remained eligible for
    the UTLAH category in the last 52 weeks

See Unreasonable to live at home (UTLAH) initial contact for Youth
Allowance (YA), Disability Support Pension (DSP), Special Benefit (SpB)
or Tertiary Access Payment (TAP).

Parental contact

Parental contact must be attempted in all cases unless:

the young person refuses permission

there are verified circumstances of family and domestic violence,
neglect or abuse

-   this includes all elements of family and domestic violence,
    including homophobia and transphobia

contact with the parent presents a serious risk to the young person or
others, such as siblings, or

it has been verified that there has been no parental contact and concern
for 2 years or more

Note: if the young person refuses to give permission for parent(s) to be
contacted, and serious risk circumstances cannot be verified, it may
mean that their claim cannot be granted.

In all cases, if a parent of a customer aged under 18 is not to be
contacted because of issues of risk, or the young person has refused
consent to contact, consultation with the Social Work Manager (EL2) must
occur. This consultation must be documented in the UTLAH report.

Note: for customers 18 years or over, consultation is with the Social
Work Support Managers (EL1) who support the Over 18 UTLAH Assessment
Team.

Consultation with the Social Work Manager is not needed if:

-   efforts to contact the parent have been made through the accepted
    processes, by phone and letter
-   the parent is deceased
-   there has been no contact for 2 years or more
-   the parents are living together and one of the parents has been
    contacted, and the other parent is satisfied their input has been
    represented, or
-   the young person is in State Care
-   the young person is 18 years of age or over and a Social Work
    Support Manager supporting the Over 18 UTLAH Assessment Team has
    been consulted

Consult with a Social Work Support Manager if uncertain.

Independent third party contact

Verification from an independent third party for assessment of a UTLAH
claim is needed in order to conduct a holistic assessment of the young
person's circumstances.

Follow-up intervention

Some UTLAH assessments may identify a need for follow-up intervention
with the young person. The purpose of follow-up intervention is to make
sure that vulnerable young people have early access to supports and
services. The aim is to provide early, focused intervention with
strategies that are tailored to the young person's development and life
situation.

All customers under 16 years will automatically be considered to need
follow up arrangements, with the level of follow up decided by the
assessing social worker. Other customer groups that should be considered
for follow-up include young people with identified:

-   substance abuse problems
-   unstable or inappropriate accommodation
-   offending behaviours
-   unstable school attendance
-   young pregnant women, or
-   those who with their families have engaged in mediation/counselling

Job Seeker Portfolio positional mailbox details.

Under 16 years old

Young people under 16 who do not live with a parent or guardian must be
referred to a social worker. The social worker will help with deciding
payment eligibility and offer support through social case work.

If a young person has applied for an income support payment under UTLAH
provisions, a full assessment will occur, including:

-   contact with parents/guardians as appropriate, and
-   referral to the relevant State or Territory Welfare Authority, if
    needed

When a young person under 16 has applied for Special Benefit (SpB), the
social worker will:

-   assess the customer’s current living circumstances to make sure the
    young person is not at risk
-   help decide if the young person is considered a dependent child of
    another adult who is providing care and who can apply for Family Tax
    Benefit (FTB)

A young person can be considered a dependent child even where the adult
does not qualify for FTB, (consideration must be given to the nature and
intent of the support provided). If a social worker has decided the
young person is a dependent child of another adult, the reasons for this
must be clearly outlined in a social work report.

Given the vulnerability identified with young people in this age group,
regular consultations should occur between social workers and their EL1
Social Work Support Manager or EL2 Social Work Manager. See Assisting a
customer under 16.

Unfavourable decision

When making an unfavourable decision, speak to the customer:

-   explain the decision
-   give them a chance to provide more details or evidence relevant to
    the decision
-   advise their review and appeal rights, and record an application for
    a formal review of the decision if needed

Make 2 genuine attempts to contact the customer before finalising the
decision.
