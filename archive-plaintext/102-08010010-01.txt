To reduce the risk of fraud and the creation of multiple and intertwined
records, ensure the record to be updated is the correct one. Before
making updates, verify Proof of Record Ownership by asking
authentication questions.

This document outlines the process to follow when correcting the
recorded name of a customer or the name of a child under 18 in the
customer's care.

Correcting a name

Corrections to names can be actioned at the first point of contact, if
the correction is straightforward. If the customer requests a change of
name for themselves or for a child under 18 in their care, see Changing
the Legal name of customers or their children.

Examples of straightforward name corrections include:

-   spelling errors, for example, Stehpen instead of Stephen
-   adding middle names not previously included, or where only initials
    have been used
-   names are ordered differently, for example the family name may
    appear first and the given name second. See the Multicultural Guide
    for further details

Note: correction to a name on one record will update display on the Link
Summary (LS) screen of another linked record, such as a customer and a
nominee or carer/care receiver.
