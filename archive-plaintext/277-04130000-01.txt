Prohibition Orders.

Departure Prohibition Order (DPO)

A DPO prevents a child support debtor (payer) from leaving Australia. If
a payer attempts to leave Australia when a DPO is in force they will be
physically stopped at the point of departure by the Australian Federal
Police (AFP).

A DPO places significant restrictions on the normal liberties of
citizens, residents and visitors to Australia, and will only be made
after serious consideration of all relevant circumstances.

This document outlines the duties and responsibilities of Service
Officers, Intensive Collection Services Referral Officers, DPO
specialists and the delegated decision makers to:

-   issue a DPO
-   activate and/or retain a DPO
-   issue a Departure Authorisation Certificate
