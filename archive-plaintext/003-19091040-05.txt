Using the Google Maps measuring tool

If it is difficult to determine if a customer’s principal place of
residence is ‘reasonably close’ to a burn scar that is within 5 to 10kms
using the QLD Emergency Live Feed Application, use the Google Maps
measuring tool for further assistance. The Google Maps measuring tool
allows distances to be measured between an address and another selected
location.

Locate the customer’s principal place of residence on the QLD Emergency
Live Feed Application and confirm the customer lives in a declared LGA.

-   Determine where the closest fire is according to the QLD Emergency
    Live Feed Application (zooming out may be required)
-   Go to Google Maps
-   Place the customer’s address in Google Maps and select ‘search’
-   Once the address is located on Google Maps, zoom out
-   Compare this with the QLD Emergency Live Feed Application.
-   Pinpoint the approximate location of the burn scar on the Google map
-   Right mouse click on this location and select option ‘Measure
    Distance’
-   Left mouse click on the customer’s address
-   The distance will be displayed at the customer’s address in
    kilometres (kms)
