+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Are there any payments available  |
|                                   | for customers who have cancelled  |
|                                   | because they have received their  |
|                                   | full four-year entitlement        |
|                                   | (measured as 1,460 days)?         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Customers who have received their |
|                                   | 4 year (1,460 days) entitlement   |
|                                   | cannot apply for FHA again until  |
|                                   | July 2024. However, customers who |
|                                   | have reached their 4 year (1,460  |
|                                   | days) entitlement between 1 July  |
|                                   | 2019 and 30 September 2020 will   |
|                                   | receive the one-off FHA Relief    |
|                                   | Payment. From 16 December 2019,   |
|                                   | the FHA Relief Payment was issued |
|                                   | to all customers that have        |
|                                   | already cancelled from payment    |
|                                   | because they have received their  |
|                                   | 4 year (1,460 days) entitlement.  |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 2                                 | How much will customers receive   |
|                                   | with the FHA Relief Payment?      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Customers who have received their |
|                                   | 4 year (1460 days) entitlement    |
|                                   | who cancel up to and including 30 |
|                                   | September 2020 will receive a     |
|                                   | lump sum payment ($7,500 single   |
|                                   | rate and $6,500 partnered rate).  |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 3                                 | Where a customer advises that     |
|                                   | they are no longer with their     |
|                                   | partner that they were with on    |
|                                   | their final day of payment, will  |
|                                   | they get the single or coupled    |
|                                   | rate of the FHA Relief Payment?   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Customers will be paid based on   |
|                                   | their circumstances on the final  |
|                                   | day they received FHA, therefore  |
|                                   | customers who were coupled but    |
|                                   | now separated will receive the    |
|                                   | partnered rate.                   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 4                                 | Are there any review and appeal   |
|                                   | rights for the amount of FHA      |
|                                   | Relief Payment paid to the        |
|                                   | customer?                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | No, the payment of FHA Relief     |
|                                   | Payment is legislated and not     |
|                                   | subject to review and appeal      |
|                                   | rights. The FHA Relief Payment    |
|                                   | will be paid to customers based   |
|                                   | on their circumstances on the     |
|                                   | final day they received FHA.      |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 5                                 | The customer is partnered and     |
|                                   | cancelled because they received 4 |
|                                   | years (1,460 days) of FHA payment |
|                                   | but their partner is still        |
|                                   | receiving FHA, or their partner   |
|                                   | has never received FHA, will the  |
|                                   | customer be paid the coupled or   |
|                                   | single rate and will their        |
|                                   | partner receive the payment?      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Customers who have a partner on   |
|                                   | the final day they receive FHA    |
|                                   | will be paid the partnered rate   |
|                                   | ($6,500) regardless if their      |
|                                   | partner is eligible for the       |
|                                   | Relief Payment or not. The FHA    |
|                                   | Relief Payment will only be paid  |
|                                   | to customers who have cancelled   |
|                                   | because they received four years  |
|                                   | (1,460 days) of FHA payments,     |
|                                   | therefore if the partner is not   |
|                                   | eligible, they will not receive   |
|                                   | the payment.                      |

| 6                                 | Is the FHA Relief Payment         |
|                                   | Taxable?                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The FHA Relief Payment is taxable |
|                                   | and will be assessed as income    |
|                                   | for Family Tax Benefit but will   |
|                                   | not be included as income for     |
|                                   | other Centrelink payments.        |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 7                                 | Determining if the FHA Relief     |
|                                   | Payment is recoverable            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the customer has a debt raised |
|                                   | for FHA, and has days added back  |
|                                   | to their clock as a result. The   |
|                                   | FHA Relief Payment is not         |
|                                   | recoverable.                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The FHA Relief Payment is only    |
|                                   | recoverable if it has been        |
|                                   | determined that the customer      |
|                                   | received payment of FHA through   |
|                                   | fraudulent activity. If this is   |
|                                   | determined, the FHA Relief        |
|                                   | Payment must be manually raised   |
|                                   | as a debt.                        |
