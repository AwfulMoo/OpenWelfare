| 1                                 | Customer scenario - Parenting     |
|                                   | Payment Partnered (PPP) customer  |
|                                   | separated by illness              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Val (a PPP customer) and partner  |
|                                   | Bob, live in a remote area that   |
|                                   | is approximately 150 kilometres   |
|                                   | from their nearest hospital. Bob  |
|                                   | has recently suffered from a rare |
|                                   | blood disorder and requires       |
|                                   | regular life-saving transfusions. |
|                                   | Because of this medical           |
|                                   | condition, Bob has been admitted  |
|                                   | to the hospital as an aged care   |
|                                   | facility patient type patient and |
|                                   | Val is still living at their      |
|                                   | homestead. Val drives in to see   |
|                                   | Bob almost daily with their       |
|                                   | child, Tammy to make sure that    |
|                                   | Bob is comfortable.               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Val and Bob are still a member of |
|                                   | a couple and would therefore, be  |
|                                   | classed as an illness separated   |
|                                   | couple. Val's PPP can now be paid |
|                                   | at the illness separated rate.    |
|                                   | While Val's Family Tax Benefit    |
|                                   | (FTB) Part A does not require an  |
|                                   | income test as Val is receiving   |
|                                   | an income support payment, the    |
|                                   | entitlement to FTB Part B is      |
|                                   | still assessed on the lower       |
|                                   | earner's income.                  |

|                                   | condition has deteriorated and    |
|                                   | George has been admitted to a     |

|                                   | separation, Service Officers must |
|                                   | take into account factors such as |

|                                   | of living expenses. It may mean   |

|                                   | illness separated rate.           |
