is separated due to illness.

| 1                                 | Customer scenario - Parenting     |
|                                   | Payment Partnered (PPP) customer  |
|                                   | separated by illness              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Val (a PPP customer) and partner  |
|                                   | Bob, live in a remote area that   |
|                                   | is approximately 150 kilometres   |
|                                   | from their nearest hospital. Bob  |
|                                   | has recently suffered from a rare |
|                                   | blood disorder and requires       |
|                                   | regular life-saving transfusions. |
|                                   | Because of this medical           |
|                                   | condition, Bob has been admitted  |
|                                   | to the hospital as an aged care   |
|                                   | facility type patient and Val is  |
|                                   | still living at their homestead.  |
|                                   | Val drives in to see Bob almost   |
|                                   | daily with their child, Tammy to  |
|                                   | make sure that Bob is             |
|                                   | comfortable.                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Val and Bob are still a member of |
|                                   | a couple and would therefore, be  |
|                                   | classed as an illness separated   |
|                                   | couple. Val's PPP can now be paid |
|                                   | at the illness separated rate.    |
|                                   | While Val's Family Tax Benefit    |
|                                   | (FTB) Part A does not require an  |
|                                   | income test as Val is receiving   |
|                                   | an income support payment, the    |
|                                   | entitlement to FTB Part B is      |
|                                   | still assessed on the lower       |
|                                   | earner's income.                  |

|                                   | owns the home and pays for all    |
|                                   | utilities. George's medical       |
|                                   | condition has deteriorated and    |
|                                   | George has been admitted to a     |
|                                   | hospital on an indefinite basis.  |

|                                   | When determining whether          |
|                                   | Daniella's cost of living         |

|                                   | likely to increase due to illness |
|                                   | separation, Service Officers must |
|                                   | take into account factors such as |
|                                   | transportation, medication and    |
|                                   | the loss of ability to pool       |
|                                   | resources.                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Where it is evident from          |
|                                   | discussions with the customer,    |
|                                   | there is no increase to the cost  |
|                                   | of living expenses. It may mean   |
|                                   | the customer is not eligible for  |
|                                   | illness separated provisions.     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Evidence of the customerâ€™s        |
|                                   | increased living expenses is      |
|                                   | generally not required for the    |
|                                   | assessment. Evidence of increased |
|                                   | living expenses should only be    |
|                                   | requested if there is genuine     |
|                                   | doubt about the information       |
|                                   | provided by the customer.         |

| 1                                 | Customer scenario - living        |
|                                   | separately and apart due to one   |
|                                   | member of a couple entering care  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Tanya and Glen are married and    |
|                                   | own a home together. Glen has     |
|                                   | advanced stages of Alzheimer's    |
|                                   | disease and must now move into    |
|                                   | care. Due to Glen's specific type |
|                                   | of neurological disorder, once    |
|                                   | entering care Glen and Tanya      |
|                                   | could be entitled to be assessed  |
|                                   | as living separately and apart    |
|                                   | (that is, genuinely separated).   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If Glen and Tanya want to be      |
|                                   | assessed as illness separated,    |
|                                   | Tanya's income of $80,000 per     |
|                                   | year would affect Glen's pension. |
|                                   | As Tanya is now responsible for   |
|                                   | the mortgage, Tanya may find it   |
|                                   | difficult to help Glen in paying  |
|                                   | for the care facility.            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If they were assessed as living   |
|                                   | separately and apart Tanya's      |
|                                   | income and assets would not be    |
|                                   | taken into consideration when     |
|                                   | assessing Glen's pension. The     |
|                                   | income tested fees of Glen's care |
|                                   | residence would be based on       |
|                                   | Glen's income and assets alone.   |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | Glen's former principal home,     |
|                                   | Glen's portion of the principal   |
|                                   | home would then be considered an  |
|                                   | asset for pension purposes and    |
|                                   | the higher non-homeowner asset    |
|                                   | threshold applies.                |

|                                   | The value of Glen's assets may    |
|                                   | then affect the rate of his       |
|                                   | pension. If this occurs, Glen may |
|                                   | wish to apply under the asset     |
|                                   | test hardship provisions.         |

|                                   | As Bert no longer has a partner   |
|                                   | and has been in care for more     |
|                                   | than 2 years, the half share of   |
|                                   | the former principal home would   |
|                                   | now be counted as an asset for    |
|                                   | pension purposes unless another   |
|                                   | exemption was applicable.         |

|                                   | pension purposes, the rate of     |
|                                   | income support payment could be   |
|                                   | affected depending on the half    |

|                                   | former principal home. Where the  |
|                                   | value of Bert's assets affects    |
|                                   | the rate of pension, Bert may     |
|                                   | wish to apply under the asset     |
