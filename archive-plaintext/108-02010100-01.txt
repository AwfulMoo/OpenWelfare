This document outlines information relating to the linking of records of
parents and guardians deemed to be a parent for the purposes of the
Parental Income Test (PIT) for dependent recipients or claimants of:

-   ABSTUDY
-   Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) Scheme
-   Tertiary Access Payment (TAP)
-   Youth Allowance (YA)

This is commonly known as PIT Linking.

Automatic transfer information

Linking parents and guardians to the ABSTUDY, AIC, TAP and YA dependent
child allows recorded information relevant to the Parental Income Test
(PIT) to be automatically transferred between records.

Advantages of automatic transfer

Advantages include:

-   the family needs only notify Services Australia once of changes to
    their circumstances for the changes to be updated on the agency's
    records for all family members
-   records of the dependent recipient (and those students where the
    parent is also a recipient) will contain up-to-date information,
    ensuring they are receiving their correct entitlement
-   a reduction in the number of debts incurred, for example, in cases
    where the PIT exemption ceases automatically after notification of
    changes

Change in circumstances which may affect the PIT

Changes in circumstances, which may affect the PIT include:

-   a parent becomes an income support recipient
-   a parent ceases to receive an income support payment
-   a recipient (or student) loses or gains a parent on whose income the
    PIT is applied
-   a substantial increase or decrease in parental income
-   changes to the family pool

Updating recipient or claimant records

Service Officers can update records to:

-   create links with any parents, or persons deemed to be a parent for
    the PIT, if a link has not been created, or
-   cease links when a parent, or persons deemed to be a parent for the
    PIT, leaves the family situation and is no longer regarded as a
    parent for the PIT

ABSTUDY recipients placed in state care (including supported
accommodation, hostels, or boarding schools) and who do not have a
parent or carer, will require a PIT link to be made to the organisation.
To create the link, a dummy person record is required for the
organisation.

A dependent YA recipient may have an Indigenous student in their care
who meets the eligibility criteria for Schooling A Award (ABT).

Requirement for CRNs

It is a requirement that all parents and dependent siblings are linked
on the ABSTUDY or YA customer's record. In some cases a parent may not
have received family assistance, a Social Security pension or benefit,
or a child record was archived due to not being in use for a significant
period of time.

It is important to conduct a thorough search to locate the correct
customer record before updating the customer's details, or to confirm
that no record exists before adding a new record for the customer.

See Searching for a customer on the system.

The requirement of a CRN is due to:

-   the data matching of parent income details with the Australian
    Taxation Office (ATO)
-   changes to the parents and siblings statuses, if they are or have
    been in receipt of a Low Income Health Care Card, pension or benefit
    from Services Australia, to determine the rate of payment for YA or
    ABSTUDY

Parent CRNs are a compulsory component of the coding of dependent
ABSTUDY and YA new claims.
