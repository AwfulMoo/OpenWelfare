|                                   | STA when Term 1 commences for the |

|                                   | -   Sarah did commence for the    |
|                                   |     term, and                     |

|                                   | -   Sarah retains eligibility for |

|                                   | record automatically cancels      |
|                                   | CAN-ANQ on that date. Even though |

|                                   | of a qualifying payment for STA   |
|                                   | on the first day of school,       |
|                                   | because Millie did attend school  |
|                                   | in Term 1, and the parent was in  |
|                                   | receipt of a qualifying payment   |
|                                   | within the term entitlement       |
|                                   | period, Millie remains eligible   |
|                                   | for STA for Term 1.               |

|                                   | student                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Isaac is the child of separated   |
|                                   | parents Mary and Frank. Isaac was |
|                                   | living with Mary up until 10      |
|                                   | January when the care arrangement |
|                                   | changed and Isaac went to live    |
|                                   | with Frank.                       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | On 12 January, Frank submitted a  |
|                                   | Schooling A claim for Isaac. As   |
|                                   | Isaac will be in Frank's care     |
|                                   | during the school term, Frank     |
|                                   | will have the entitlement to      |
|                                   | receive the STA for Term 1.       |
|                                   | However, because Mary had some    |
|                                   | care of Isaac during the term     |
|                                   | entitlement period for Term 1,    |
|                                   | the system determines Mary will   |
|                                   | receive the full Term 1 STA       |
|                                   | payment. This is incorrect. To    |
|                                   | ensure Frank receives the STA     |
|                                   | payment for the term, Mary's ABT  |
|                                   | claim must be cancelled or        |
|                                   | rejected.                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The cancellation or rejection     |
|                                   | will be from the first day of the |
|                                   | relevant term entitlement period  |
|                                   | (in this case from 1 January).    |
|                                   | Frank's claim will then be        |
|                                   | granted from 1 January. Record a  |

|                                   | In Term 1 2020, Ari's school      |
|                                   | advised attendance above 85%. Ari |
|                                   | is entitled to the Term 2 STA     |
|                                   | payment due to satisfactory       |
|                                   | attendance in Term 1.             |

|                                   | requires a student to have        |
|                                   | attendance of 85% or more in term |
|                                   | 1 of 2020. As Ari had             |
|                                   | satisfactory attendance in Term   |
|                                   | 1, Ari is entitled to the Term 3  |
|                                   | and 4 STA payment regardless of   |
|                                   | actual attendance in Term 2 and   |

|                                   | In Term 1 2020, Billie's school   |
|                                   | advised attendance under 85%.     |
|                                   | Billie was not entitled to the    |
|                                   | Term 2 STA payment due to         |
|                                   | unsatisfactory attendance in Term |
|                                   | 1.                                |

|                                   | also requires a student to have   |
|                                   | attendance of 85% or more in term |
|                                   | 1 of 2020. As Billie had          |
|                                   | unsatisfactory attendance in Term |
|                                   | 1, Billie is not entitled to the  |
|                                   | Term 3 or 4 STA payment.          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Billie's school provides a letter |
|                                   | advising that Billie's attendance |
|                                   | in Term 2 and 3 was above 85% and |
|                                   | considered satisfactory. However, |
|                                   | as Billie had unsatisfactory      |
|                                   | attendance in Term 1, Billie is   |
|                                   | not entitled to the Term 3 or 4   |
|                                   | STA payment and this remains      |
|                                   | unchanged.                        |

|                                   | ABSTUDY.                          |

|                                   | the calendar year. As the letter  |
