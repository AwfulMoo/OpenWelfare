| 1                                 | Child cannot be linked to         |

|                                   | Jane and Bobby notify Child       |
|                                   | Support of a care change for      |
|                                   | their child, Frankie to 80% care  |
|                                   | to Jane and 20% to Bobby. Frankie |
|                                   | is linked to Jane's Centrelink    |
|                                   | record, but not to Bobby's, as    |
|                                   | Bobby has not claimed FTB or any  |
|                                   | other payment for Frankie. Data   |
|                                   | is sent from Child Support to     |
|                                   | Centrelink via the data exchange  |
|                                   | to reflect Jane's 80% care and    |
|                                   | Bobby's 20% care. However,        |
|                                   | because Frankie is not linked to  |
|                                   | Bobby, Bobby's name isn't         |
|                                   | displayed as the carer with 20%   |
|                                   | care on Jane's Centrelink record  |
|                                   | (the % is shown, but with no      |
|                                   | name).                            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A Service Officer later           |
|                                   | identifies that the level of care |
|                                   | for Frankie is not recorded for   |
|                                   | Bobby as he does not have Frankie |
|                                   | linked to his record on Customer  |
|                                   | First. Frankie cannot be linked   |
|                                   | to Bobby's record unless Bobby    |
|                                   | lodges a claim for Frankie (for   |
|                                   | example FTB, CCB, CCS, PPL, DAP,  |
|                                   | PPS or CDA or an Income Support   |

|                                   | decision (see below).             |

|                                   | A few months later, Jane advises  |
|                                   | Centrelink that the level of care |
|                                   | for Frankie is now 64% to her and |
|                                   | 36% to Bobby. Bobby confirms the  |
|                                   | new care arrangements. The        |
|                                   | Service Officer attempts to code  |
|                                   | the new care decision, however    |
|                                   | encounters the following edit on  |
|                                   | the FTB Shared Care (FSC)         |
|                                   | screen - E004WA - Mandatory value |
|                                   | not entered on screen. The        |
|                                   | purpose of the edit is to prompt  |
|                                   | the Service Officer to select     |
|                                   | Bobby from the drop down box for  |
|                                   | the previous (Child Support) care |
|                                   | decision.                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | As the Service Officer is         |
|                                   | recording a subsequent care       |
|                                   | decision, and the error is        |
|                                   | occurring, they can link the      |
|                                   | child to Bobby's record to allow  |
|                                   | the edit to be resolved.          |

|                                   | Charlie receives FTB for Henry,   |
|                                   | and contacts Centrelink to notify |
|                                   | a change in care for child Henry. |
|                                   | The other party, Jamie, agrees    |
|                                   | with the change in care. As       |
|                                   | Charlie receives FTB for Henry,   |
|                                   | Charlie's Customer First record   |
|                                   | can be updated to reflect the new |
|                                   | percentage of care.               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | However, Henry has never been     |
|                                   | linked to Jamie in Customer       |
|                                   | First, therefore Henry will need  |
|                                   | to be linked to Jamie's           |
|                                   | Centrelink record so the          |
|                                   | percentage of care for Henry can  |
|                                   | be recorded.                      |
