All online claims for AGDRP/NZ DRP and DRA/NZ DRA meet the minimum
identity requirements. No further identity documents need to be provided
or coded in the Document Verification Service (DVS).

For phone claims and claim forms, where identity document/s do not
verify in the DVS, staff must not follow the process to record
alternative identity in Process Direct.

If a customer does not meet eligibility criteria for payment, identity
documents do not need to be checked or requested.

For how to confirm customers meet identity requirements, select the
relevant tab.
