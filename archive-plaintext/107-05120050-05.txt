|                                   | consider the net result of the 2  |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The amount of CCB that may be     |
|                                   | waived is the amount overpaid in  |
|                                   | the period 1 November 2010 - 19   |
|                                   | March 2011 less any additional    |
|                                   | CCR entitlement paid as a result  |
|                                   | of this overpayment.              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | For example, a customer incurs a  |
|                                   | CCB overpayment for the period 1  |
|                                   | November 2010 - 19 March 2011 of  |
|                                   | $200. The customer is eligible    |
|                                   | for CCR and therefore the reduced |
|                                   | CCB entitlement means they have   |
|                                   | received an increased CCR         |
|                                   | entitlement of $100 (as their     |
|                                   | out-of-pocket expenses have       |
|                                   | increased by $200). The net       |
|                                   | result for the 2 entitlements is  |
|                                   | a debt of $100. This amount may   |
|                                   | be waived.                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the customer was not eligible  |
|                                   | for CCR (for example: because     |
|                                   | they did not meet the             |
|                                   | work/training/study test), the    |
|                                   | amount that could be waived is    |
|                                   | the CCB overpayment in the period |
|                                   | 1 November 2010 - 19 March 2011   |
|                                   | of $200. In the above             |
|                                   | circumstances, the amount would   |
|                                   | be $200.                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | CCR                               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The maximum amount of CCR to      |
|                                   | consider for waiver is the amount |
|                                   | overpaid in the period 1 November |
|                                   | 2010 - 19 March 2011.             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the CCR overpayment occurred   |
|                                   | because the customer received an  |
|                                   | increased entitlement to CCB, the |
|                                   | overpayment will not be eligible  |
|                                   | for waiver. This is because the   |
|                                   | CCR overpayment has been fully    |
|                                   | offset from any CCB top-up paid.  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | For example, customer received a  |
|                                   | CCB reconciliation top-up for the |
|                                   | period 1 November 2010 - 19 March |
|                                   | 2011 of $200. As they received    |
|                                   | their CCR quarterly, they now     |
|                                   | have a CCR overpayment for this   |
|                                   | period of $100 (as their          |
|                                   | out-of-pocket expenses have       |
|                                   | decreased by $200). The net       |
|                                   | result for the 2 entitlements is  |
|                                   | a top-up of $100, meaning there   |
|                                   | is no amount eligible for waiver. |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Note: the maximum waiver amount   |
|                                   | is the net value of customer's    |
|                                   | CCB and CCR combined              |
|                                   | reconciliation for the 2010-11    |
|                                   | financial year, where the result  |
|                                   | is a debt.                        |

|                                   | customer is eligible for CCR and  |
|                                   | therefore the reduced CCB         |
|                                   | entitlement means they have       |
|                                   | received an increased CCR         |
|                                   | entitlement of $100 (as their     |
