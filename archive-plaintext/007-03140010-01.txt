This document outlines the use of codes for cancellations or rejection
decisions for Child Care Benefit (CCB) for approved care and registered
care or JET Child Care fee assistance (JETCCFA).

Cancellation and rejection codes

Specific cancellation/rejection codes were used to record a decision to
cancel a payment or reject a claim for the following service reasons:

-   CCF - CCB for approved care
-   CCI - CCB for registered care
-   JFA - JETCCFA for approved care

The Process page contains a list of rejection and cancellation reasons
for these service reasons. JETCCFA with a status of CAN or REJ cannot be
reassessed.

The Resources page contains an example of how to check from the
Assessment Results (AR) screen why a claim is rejecting, and a link to
the Services Australia website.
