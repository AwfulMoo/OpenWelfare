This document explains residency and when a residency referral for a
residency decision is needed.

Residency overview

Determining the residency of a customer means making a decision that the
customer is a resident of:

-   Australia
-   a reciprocating jurisdiction, or
-   a non-reciprocating jurisdiction

A customer's place of residence is one of the factors that determines a
customers' eligibility about child support assessments. Information must
be gathered to make the decision. This includes if the travelling
customer intends to be overseas for more than 6 months or 12 months if
visiting friends and family.

When a residency decision is required

Services Australia makes a determination about a parent’s residency in
order to determine, among other things, whether:

-   an application for administrative assessment is properly made and
    able to be accepted
-   the appropriate income rules are being used to determine an
    assessment
-   an overseas maintenance liability can be registered
-   a terminating event has occurred

Child Support may become aware, a residency decision is required when, a
customer:

-   leaves or may leave Australia, arrives in Australia or moves between
    other jurisdictions
-   makes an application for an assessment and advises they or the other
    parent reside outside of Australia. See Customer Referral Guidelines
    (CRG) – International New customers
-   who lives outside Australia provides an overseas maintenance
    liability. See Customer Referral Guidelines (CRG) – International
    New customers

Note: a residency decision is required even if the case has been ended.

Terminating event

Services Australia must:

-   amend the end date of a liability that has ended if we become aware
    of an earlier terminating event. This includes a change in the
    residency of a parent
-   amend or end a child support liability if a child support
    terminating event happens
