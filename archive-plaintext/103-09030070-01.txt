This document outlines the action to be taken when a customer, or a
Business, advises that a Centrepay deduction was not received or is
incorrect.

Incorrect deduction

A customer or Centrepay business may advise that a Centrepay deduction
is incorrect. There could be a number of reasons for this, including the
deduction was:

-   sent to the wrong business
-   coded on the incorrect customer record
-   for the wrong amount
-   not cancelled when requested
-   duplicated, or
-   not delivered

Where an overpayment of a Centrepay deduction has occurred, the process
to follow will depend on whether Services Australia, the customer or the
business is responsible for the error.

Centrepay deduction not received

A customer or Centrepay business advises that the business has not
received a deduction that is showing on the customer's record as being
paid. This will require investigation to make sure all details such as
the account number, are correct.

The Resources page contains a link to the Services Australia website for
the Centrepay Policy and Terms, the Centrepay Procedural Guide for
Business and a link to Office Locator.
