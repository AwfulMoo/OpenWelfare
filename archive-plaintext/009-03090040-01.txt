This document outlines information about when more than one person
receiving care dies and the carer is receiving Carer Payment (CP).

Bereavement payment

Only one bereavement payment is payable upon the simultaneous death of
more than one care receiver in this situation.

If the care receivers were one of:

-   two to four children with disabilities
-   a lower Adult Disability Assessment Tool (ADAT) score adult and
    dependent child where the carer is not the adult's partner

The rate payable throughout the bereavement period depends on the
Carer's actual circumstances. If entitled to a Lump Sum Bereavement
Payment (LBP), the amount is the same as for a single adult care
receiver.

If the care receivers were a lower ADAT score adult and a dependent
child and the carer is the adult's partner, a calculation must be done
to work out the bereavement assistance payable to the carer as:

-   a member of a couple, and
-   a carer of a single care receiver

The bereavement provisions which are most beneficial to the CP customer
apply.
