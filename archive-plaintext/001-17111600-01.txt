-   Background

This document outlines the processes for approving drug or alcohol
dependency treatment programs, or interventions as approved activities
for job seekers.

On this Page:

Drug and alcohol treatments/interventions (treatment activities) as an approved activity

Drug and alcohol treatment programs/interventions (treatment activities)
can be undertaken as approved activities by job seekers in Streams A, B
and C.

Treatment activities may or may not contribute to mutual obligation or
annual activity requirements, depending on whether a job seeker is
provider or Centrelink managed.

Provider managed job seekers

Provider managed job seekers can discuss appropriate and available
treatment programs or interventions with their provider for inclusion in
their Job Plan.

If the job seeker is undertaking intensive treatment (such as
residential rehabilitation) and is unable to participate in other
activities, the treatment activity will fully meet their mutual
obligation or annual activity requirements. Appointments, other
activities and job search must not be included in their Job Plans.

The job seeker will remain provider managed and the treatment activity
will be included in their Job Plan.

If they are undertaking less intensive treatment activities (such as a
fortnightly counselling session), this may contribute to meeting their
mutual obligation or annual activity requirements. The job seeker will
need to undertake other activities, such as job search or training in
order to meet their requirements. However, the provider may reduce these
requirements as appropriate, based on the job seeker's individual
circumstances.

Jobactive providers help job seekers by having access to the Employment
Fund, which can be used to pay for professional services, such as drug
and alcohol counselling or rehabilitation.

Disability Employment Services Providers are able to use their service
fees to pay for appropriate types of assistance tailored to the
individual job seeker's circumstances. This assistance may include
interventions such as drug and alcohol counselling or rehabilitation.

If a job seeker fails to meet their compulsory requirements, they may be
subject to compliance action under the Targeted Compliance Framework.

Centrelink managed job seekers

Centrelink managed job seekers may undertake treatment activities and
include this as a voluntary activity in their Job Plan. Participation in
these treatment activities does not reduce a Centrelink managed job
seeker's mutual obligation requirements. They are additional voluntary
activities only.

Centrelink managed job seekers must still undertake the required
compulsory activities that have been approved by Services Australia and
included in their Job Plan, for example:

-   part-time work, voluntary work, or
-   quarterly participation interviews

The voluntary treatment activities must not impact on their ability to
meet compulsory requirements. These job seekers are not be subject to
compliance action if they fail to attend or cease their treatment
activity. However, they must continue to meet their compulsory mutual
obligation requirements, and may need to have their Job Plan updated to
include other activities to replace the treatment activity.

If the job seeker wishes to reduce or fully satisfy their mutual
obligation requirements through participation in a drug/alcohol
treatment activity, they should be referred to an Employment Services
Provider for assistance. Providers can access a greater network of
services and resources to support job seekers to overcome their barriers
to employment.

Services Australia does not have access to funding to pay for treatment
activities. If a job seeker wishes to discuss treatment options, they
should be directed to speak with their treating health professional.

Treatment activities that may be included in a Job Plan

Treatment activities may include, but are not limited to:

-   further assessment services
-   support and case management
-   counselling
-   information and education programs
-   detoxification or withdrawal management
-   non-residential care or rehabilitation, residential care or
    rehabilitation, and
-   pharmacotherapy (e.g. opioid substitution therapy such as methadone)

Provider managed job seekers

If a provider contacts you to discuss treatment activities for a job
seeker, direct them to their Account Manager for assistance.

Centrelink managed job seekers

Where the job seeker is seeking to add a treatment activity as an
additional voluntary activity, Service Officers are not required to
recommend or determine appropriate treatment activities.

Inclusion of a treatment activity in the Job Plan is guided by evidence
from treating health professionals and/or disclosure by the job seeker.
