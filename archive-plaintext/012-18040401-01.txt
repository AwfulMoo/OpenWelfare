This document outlines how to process the pay run for an MI payment
application.

MI Pay run process

A monthly MI payment is scheduled for the third last business day of
each month to pay eligible MI applications and refunds. This is designed
to allow Accounting Operations, Services Australia’s Finance area (based
in Queensland) and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) sufficient time
to release the payments prior to the legislative deadline of the last
day of the month. The only exception to this rule occurs in December
each year when the MI pay run is scheduled for a date that falls
approximately 5 business days before Christmas Day. The December MI pay
run generally occurs between 17-20 December. Funding is provided by the
Department of Health and Aged Care via a sweeping account arrangement.

Note: it is also important to be conscious ahead of time of anything
that may affect the processing payment time for the MI pay run, such as
daylight saving, state-based public holidays and office closures, as
this can affect the ability of the Accounting Operations team to have
sufficient time to release the MI payment.
