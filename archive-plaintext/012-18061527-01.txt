Enquiry escalation

The Provider Registration enquiry line and email inbox, managed by
Medicare Provider Services (MPS), are used as the front door for all
enquiries relating to the processing of provider registrations.

Enquiries to this area are responded to by a Service Officer trained in
all aspects of provider registration. These Service Officers escalate
complex enquiries to their team leader or a Programme Support Officer
(PSO) who will liaise with the Provider Eligibility and Accreditation
team in National Office for assistance if required.
