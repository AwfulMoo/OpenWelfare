Determining if account balance increase or decrease is outside the threshold

The system applies a formula that decides if the account balance given
by the customer is an increase or decrease outside of the thresholds. In
these cases, a Service Officer must investigate the review activity.

The system applies a different formula to the April and October reviews.

|                                   | within B and C it is acceptable   |
