| Item                              | Example                           |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Payee ceases to be an eligible    |
|                                   | carer                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A COA decision is made at a time  |
|                                   | when the payee has 100% care of   |
|                                   | the child of the case. The COA    |
|                                   | decision set the payer’s annual   |
|                                   | rate at $12 500 per year. After   |
|                                   | the COA decision, the child moves |
|                                   | into the 100% care of the payer.  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | To give effect to the change in   |
|                                   | circumstances, the Register may   |
|                                   | amend the assessment, to depart   |
|                                   | from the COA decision until the   |
|                                   | payee has at least 35% care       |
|                                   | again.                            |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 2                                 | Special circumstances cease to    |
|                                   | exist                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A COA decision increases the      |
|                                   | payer’s rate by $8500 per year,   |
|                                   | as a contribution to the child’s  |
|                                   | private school fee costs. After   |
|                                   | the decision is made, the child   |
|                                   | ceases to attend the private      |
|                                   | school, meaning the payee no      |
|                                   | longer has to pay the private     |
|                                   | school fees. The Registrar can    |
|                                   | amend the assessment to stop      |
|                                   | applying the COA determination on |
|                                   | the grounds the school fees are   |
|                                   | no longer payable.                |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 3                                 | Special circumstances cease to    |
|                                   | exist                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | COA decision increased the annual |
|                                   | rate for a 3 year period from 1   |
|                                   | January 2019 to 31 December 2021  |
|                                   | by $3500. This accounted for the  |
|                                   | paying parent’s contribution to   |
|                                   | the child’s private school fees.  |
|                                   | Both parents confirmed the child  |
|                                   | finished at the private school on |
|                                   | 15 December 2020 and is enrolled  |
|                                   | in a public school for 2021.      |
|                                   | Based on the considerations of    |
|                                   | the original decision, it is      |
|                                   | appropriate to amend the          |
|                                   | assessment from 1 January 2021,   |
|                                   | ending the COA decision on 31     |
|                                   | December 2020.                    |

|                                   | exist                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | COA decision set the cost of      |
|                                   | child for child Adam at $0 from   |
|                                   | 15 February 2020 until 23 October |
|                                   | 2021 due to Adam’s employment.    |
|                                   | The parents provide a separation  |
|                                   | certificate and confirm Adam      |
|                                   | ceased employment on 10 November  |
|                                   | 2020 and has enrolled in          |
|                                   | secondary education. Based on the |
|                                   | cessation of the special          |
|                                   | circumstance, it is appropriate   |
|                                   | to amend the assessment from 11   |
|                                   | November 2020, ending the COA     |
|                                   | decision on 10 November 2020.     |
