Quality Assurance process

All DHCAS claims and registrations are quality checked prior to
finalising DHCAS work items in the Processing and National Demand
Allocation tool (PaNDA). The following responsibilities occur during the
quality assurance process:

Service Officer:

-   processes DHCAS claim or registration

Experienced Service Officer/Subject Matter Expert:

-   performs initial quality assurance on claim or registration
-   creates the payment run

Team Leader:

-   completes quality assurance on claims
-   completes quality assurance on the payment run
-   notifies delegate that claims on the payment run are awaiting
    authorisation

Delegate:

-   conducts final quality assurance of the claims on the payment run
-   authorises payments to be released by finance

Note: quality checking completed in the Quality & Support Tool is
separate to the above quality assurance guidelines.

Once DHCAS work items are finalised in the Processing and National
Demand Allocation tool (PaNDA), they are selected for quality checking
in the Quality and Support Tool. Quality Checking is completed once a
payment run has been finalised, within approximately 5 working days.

All quality checks for the month must be actioned within 4 calendar days
of the following month. After this time, remaining work is abandoned.

Types of quality checks

Pre-checks

Pre-checks include checking documents have been verified against the
submitted claims or registrations prior to finalisation. Pre-checks are:

-   applied to work completed by Service Officers receiving initial
    training
-   completed within 5 business days of processing
-   made against applications held in the Processing and National Demand
    Allocation (PaNDA)

The results of pre-checks are captured in the Quality and Support Tool,
but are not included in any quality reports.

Post-checks

Post checks are used to determine the level of accuracy for finalised
work. All work completed the previous business day is identified in
PaNDA for checking. Post checks are completed against source
documentation in PaNDA and system records.

The results of post checks are used to measure accuracy standards, which
are captured in the Quality and Support Tool and included in quality
reports.

Targeted Checks

These apply to:

-   staff when there is a substantial new process introduced or an
    identified quality issue
-   Aim for Accuracy process (Check the Checker) which is completed
    every 12 months. This confirms the accuracy of quality checking
    results. The process involves rechecking a sample of previously
    checked work to decide if quality checking procedures have been
    followed correctly

Sampling plan

The quality checking sample for DHCAS is 100%. This includes:

-   Service Officers in training and undertaking consolidation
-   processing Service Officers
-   experienced Service Officers / Subject Matter Experts
-   team leaders
-   delegates
-   all staff who undertake quality assurance

Staff in training must achieve 90%+ accuracy in order to be deemed
proficient.

Process for quality checks

Timeframes

Quality checks are undertaken daily on a random sample of work:

-   Pre-checks - quality checks are normally done within 1-2 business
    day of the work being completed
-   Programme checks - where possible quality checks are completed
    within 4 calendar days of being allocated in the QST. At the end of
    the month any program check not completed is automatically abandoned
    after 4 calendar days
    Note: work will not be abandoned for 100 % quality checks

Resources

Quality checkers must have access to the following to do quality checks:

-   program specific processing systems
-   Processing and National Demand allocation (PaNDA)
-   Quality and Support Tool (QST)
-   skill tags added on the Quality and Support Tool
-   relevant internet and intranet sites, e.g. Operational Blueprint

Error definition

An error is information processed or keyed that does not match the
documents supplied, or the supporting documents uploaded on the system.

Error codes are categorised as critical and non-critical.

Critical errors

An error is defined as critical when there is a potential risk to:

a customer's:

-   privacy
-   eligibility
-   payments
-   finalisation of an application assessment
-   record

the reputation of the agency

Non-critical errors

An error is defined as non-critical where it does not meet the above
criteria. Generally, this relates to administrative errors.

Note: only critical errors will be used to calculate the accuracy of
processing results.

Recording results

Each time a quality check is completed, the Quality Checker records the
outcome in the Quality and Support Tool (QST). A system-generated email
is sent to the Service Officer and their Team Leader advising them of
the outcome. Individual results are captured in QST.

Feedback

Feedback is emailed to the Service Officer and the Team Leader. It gives
details about the"

-   check
-   result (including any errors identified)
-   quality checking dispute process

During coaching sessions, staff can:

-   contribute to collective understanding of why errors occurred
-   assist in identifying underlying causes, such as process gaps,
    system faults or limitations, or other environmental issues

Method for managing and storing feedback

Feedback is recorded/stored in the Quality & Support Tool. Discussion
notes about the feedback should be detailed in coaching sessions.

Correcting Errors

Critical errors - Quality Checkers must correct critical errors
immediately as they are found

Non-critical errors - Quality Checkers provide instruction in the
feedback email. Service Officerâ€™s correct non-critical errors.

Change management

Quality checking procedures are reviewed and updated by the programme in
consultation with policy area and the Services Delivery Quality and
Support Team. The review makes sure the error codes are current and the
approved changes to programme business polices are included.

Any changes that require immediate action will be advised and updated
accordingly. Any changes not critical to quality will be incorporated in
the review of the procedures.
