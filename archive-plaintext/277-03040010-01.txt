Care changes notified up to 14 May 2019 for WA Ex-nuptial child support
cases must be managed under the legislation that was in place prior to
the amendments effective 1 July 2018, see For WA Ex-nuptial cases -
Notification of change in child support care (post 1 July 2010).

This document outlines information on the process for notification of
change in child support care (post 1 July 2010).

Care date of effect

When a care change occurs on or after 1 July 2018, or before 1 July 2018
but notified on or after 30 December 2018 and we are notified more than
28 days after it occurred, the new care determination will be used for
child support in the assessment from the date:

-   the care changed, if a person’s care has decreased
-   notified to Services Australia, if a person’s care has increased

A single care change for a child, if advised outside of 28 days, will
take effect in the assessment on different days for each
parent/non-parent carer.

If the care changed before 1 July 2018 and we are notified more than 28
days after the change but before 30 December 2018, the new care
determination will be used in the child support assessment from the date
we are notified for all parents/non-parent carers.

Note: the 1 July 2018 care date of effect changes do not apply to child
support cases involving WA ex-nuptial children for changes in care
notified before 15 May 2019.
