This document outlines the information relating to End of Year (EOY)
processing for ABSTUDY students.

Changes to EOY processing

The EOY process is independent of the end of course reviews (for
designated students whose study is recorded as finishing that year).

For the 2014 study year, EOY processing has been enhanced to deliver a
more streamlined process for low risk ABSTUDY students to move from one
year of study to the next year without interruption to their
entitlements, and without having to lodge a review form each year.

Previously, each year the system automatically identified which records
required a review and either:

-   issued a letter or questionnaire and set up a future review, or
-   set up a Manual Follow-up (MFU) activity for the manual issue of a
    review form or review of eligibility

EOY processing

From October 2013, EOY processing has been enhanced so that most
customers will not be issued an annual review letter and required to
confirm or update their intended study and living circumstances for the
following year. The following will now occur:

-   secondary students completing Year 11 or below will have their study
    details automatically updated to the following year and payments
    will continue into the next calendar year
-   an ABSTUDY secondary student recorded as boarding will have study
    details automatically updated to the following year, boarding
    details and changes updated for the following year and payments will
    continue into the next calendar year
-   an ABSTUDY tertiary student recorded as undertaking a course of more
    than one year duration will have payments continue into the next
    calendar year

Examples of a student whose study details can be derived for the
following year and whose study and living details will be updated,
rather than be issued a review, are:

-   an ABSTUDY Schooling A students whose current study details are
    recorded as undertaking Year 8 at Hopetown High School will be
    automatically updated to Year 9 at Hopetown High School
-   an ABSTUDY student recorded as boarding and undertaking Year 10 at
    Worawa College will have study details automatically updated to Year
    11 at Worawa College and also have boarding details and charges
    updated to the following year
-   an ABSTUDY tertiary student recorded as undertaking the second year
    in a three year Bachelor Degree at Melbourne University will not be
    asked to confirm if moving into third year of the course but will
    have payments continue into the next calendar year

Letters issued after automatic updates

All students that have their details updated automatically receive a
letter advising them of the study and living circumstances Services
Australia will base their entitlement upon in the following year, and
invite them to contact if those details are incorrect, or they have
changes.

Reviews and Manual Follow-ups

Some new reviews and Manual Follow-ups (MFUs) are created for updated
records. ABSTUDY Smart Centres manage any required manual updates to
customer records.

The Resources page contains a table listing the various EOY categories
of ABSTUDY (and PES) students and the new enhanced EOY processing which
applies to each student category.
