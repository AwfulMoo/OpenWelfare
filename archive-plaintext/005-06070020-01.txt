This document outlines the role of the Department of Home Affairs and
their contracted Service Providers in the administration of the Status
Resolution Support Services (SRSS) payment.

SRSS payment

The SRSS payment may be paid to eligible asylum seekers in the SRSS
Program. The SRSS Program provides support to asylum seekers while their
immigration status is being resolved.

Services Australia is responsible for making SRSS payments to eligible
customers as advised by the Department of Home Affairs.

Service Providers are contracted by the Department of Home Affairs to
deliver services to eligible asylum seekers to assist them in resolving
their immigration status.

Eligibility for both the SRSS Program and the SRSS payment is determined
by the Department of Home Affairs.
