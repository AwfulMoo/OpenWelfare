This document outlines how to assess and record a student or Australian
Apprentice's independence for ABSTUDY on the grounds their parents are
unable to exercise parental responsibilities.

Independence criteria

Students and Australian Apprentices applying for ABSTUDY are considered
independent if:

-   they are 15 years of age or older, and
-   both of their natural, adoptive or relationship parents (or parent
    if they only have one parent) are unable to exercise parental
    responsibilities

This category of independence is reviewable. The student or Australian
Apprentice may no longer be considered independent if their
circumstances change. Students and Australian Apprentices must notify
any changes to their circumstances within 14 days of the change.
