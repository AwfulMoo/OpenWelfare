This document outlines the requirements for coding an address for real
estate and the real estate data cleansing for incorrect or insufficient
real estate details. The real estate address must be coded correctly to
help identify the real estate for asset valuations and to assist in the
customer's entitlement assessment.

Location of asset

Centrelink must be able to precisely define the location of a real
estate asset in a manner which is understood by both customers and
external organisations in order to assist with assessment for example,
by verifying nature of interest (ownership) through various state land
title offices.

The real estate must have a site location address with minimum
requirements for coding to ensure it can be identified. The address can
be:

-   Urban address - this refers to areas suitable for or occupied by
    private homes that is, not used for primary production
-   Rural address - this refers to areas suitable for or used for
    primary production
-   Complex address - this allows identifying a location in a complex
    site for example, within a retirement village and/or part of a large
    unit complex
