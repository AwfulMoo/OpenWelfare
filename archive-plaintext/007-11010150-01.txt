This document outlines the non-payment of Family Tax Benefit (FTB)
instalment payments to zero entitlement customers including how to
record and assess new preclusions.

Underestimating income for FTB

From 1 July 2012, customers who repeatedly underestimate their income
for FTB and have no entitlement at reconciliation will no longer be
entitled to receive fortnightly instalment payments of FTB Part A and/or
FTB Part B.

A separate procedure applies where a customer's fortnightly payments
have been cancelled due to non-lodgement of tax returns under the Sunset
Clause. If a customer is subject to PIP and the zero entitlement
measure, the zero entitlement measure preclusion overrides any
entitlement to related ancillary payments available under PIP. Note: for
the zero entitlement measure, PIP periods will be counted as part of the
2 consecutive years of non-entitlement due to income.

Customers precluded from receiving fortnightly FTB instalments

Preclusion will apply where all of the following has occurred for 2
consecutive financial years from 2009-10:

the customer was entitled to FTB Part A or FTB Part B as fortnightly
instalments with a legislative rate greater than zero based on their
estimate of income (including where the customer was on zero rate due to
payment choice or PIP), and

at reconciliation the customer had zero entitlement for that component
for the entire claim period, and

at reconciliation there is at least one day in the instalment period
where there is no entitlement to that component due to income, resulting
in the component being cancelled (CAN-INC) for that period and during
the CAN-INC period:

-   for FTB Part A only, all of the income estimates provided during the
    claim period were less than the ATI amounts, or
-   for FTB Part B only, the zero entitlement is due to the
    underestimation of the primary income earner

These are referred to as zero entitlement years.

Not considered to be zero entitlement years for this measure are any
years the customer has zero entitlement due to non-lodgement of tax
returns or a non-income related reason, where they are entitled to more
than zero rate for any day for that component, or where there was no
instalment period (for example, the customer claimed via lump sum only).

Any preclusion will also apply to the customer's partner (if
applicable), including members of a blended family couple.

Effect of preclusion on FTB

Customers will only lose access to fortnightly FTB Part A or FTB Part B
if they had zero entitlement at reconciliation for the relevant
financial years.

If both FTB Part A and FTB Part B are precluded, the customer's FTB will
cancel, see further details below:

If Part A instalments are precluded, the customer loses access to all
FTB Part A components, and is no longer deemed eligible for assistance
such as:

-   Child Dental Benefit Schedule (CDBS) administered by Medicare
-   the lower threshold of the extended Medicare Safety Net
-   Schoolkids Bonus

FTB Part B instalments are only precluded if the underestimation of
income is due to the primary income earner's estimate. Secondary income
earners are not affected by this measure

Once the preclusion is applied, the customer and their partner will not
be able to access FTB Part A and/or Part B instalments until they can
demonstrate that they are again eligible, or a change in circumstances
has occurred and an exemption is granted.

Cancellation of FTB

FTB will cancel when:

-   both FTB Part A and FTB Part B instalments have been precluded
-   FTB Part A is already cancelled and FTB Part B is precluded
-   FTB Part B is already cancelled and FTB Part A is precluded, or
-   FTB is currently at zero rate due to care of a Regular Care child
    and FTB Part A is precluded

When FTB is cancelled any unpaid FTB advance payment amount will be
raised as a debt.

Assessment of unpaid FTB for a precluded customer

If only FTB Part A or FTB Part B is precluded and the customer remains
FTB current, any entitlement to the precluded payment will be
automatically assessed at reconciliation.

If the customer's FTB has cancelled as a result of this measure, the
customer must lodge an FTB lump sum claim to be assessed for the
precluded FTB payment.

Exemptions and formal review of decisions

An exemption from this initiative can be granted if:

a customer demonstrates that they have regained entitlement to
instalment payments due to a reconciliation, re-reconciliation or lump
sum claim result, or

an FTB child who was not an FTB child of the customer (or their partner)
during the 2 consecutive zero entitlement years has come into the
customer's care, this can include any of the following:

-   newborn or adopted child
-   Regular Care child that has since become an FTB child
-   partner's child that has become an FTB child of the customer since
    becoming partnered

the customer has become separated or is no longer a member of a couple
with the person who was their partner at the end of the second zero
entitlement year

the customer (or their partner) has received or been granted an income
support payment, the customer has a deemed entitlement to FTB

the customer (or their partner) has an entitlement to FTB greater than
zero for a later financial year due to reconciliation, re-reconciliation
or the assessment of a lump sum claim

special circumstances for a non-payment of FTB instalments preclusion
exist in relation to the customer or their partner that did not exist at
the end of the 2 consecutive zero entitlement years

An exemption allows FTB instalments to continue or recommence.

If the customer applies for a formal review of the decision to preclude
FTB payments, the normal review and appeal processes apply. If a
customer is requesting a reassessment because of a change in
circumstances, an appeal is not recorded and eligibility for a
preclusion exemption must be assessed.

Warning errors and MFU

A warning error or Manual Follow-up (MFU) will be created in an activity
that results in possible eligibility for preclusion or exemption. A
determination as to whether the customer meets the rules for a
preclusion or exemption must be made.
