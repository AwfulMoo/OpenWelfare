|                                   | Minjilang, in the Northern        |
|                                   | Territory (NT). Allira has been   |
|                                   | granted the away from home rate   |
|                                   | of Living Allowance in March and  |
|                                   | will be enrolling into Aquinas    |
|                                   | College in Perth from the start   |
|                                   | of term 2. The most expensive     |
|                                   | journey from Minjilang to a       |
|                                   | location within NT, which has a   |
|                                   | boarding school/hostel, is        |
|                                   | Wangkana Kari Hostel, Tennant     |
|                                   | Creek.                            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | At the time of assessment, no     |
|                                   | average fare costs have been      |
|                                   | determined for these intrastate   |
|                                   | and interstate locations.         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Allira must travel from Minjilang |
|                                   | to Darwin, before travelling from |
|                                   | there to either Tennant Creek or  |
|                                   | Perth. The cost of travel between |
|                                   | Minjilang and Darwin would be the |
|                                   | same for both an intrastate or    |
|                                   | interstate journey. It can be     |
|                                   | disregarded, as it has no impact  |
|                                   | on the cost effectiveness         |

|                                   | Tennant Creek or Cairns. The cost |

|                                   | Darwin would be the same for both |
|                                   | an intrastate or interstate       |
|                                   | journey and can be disregarded,   |
|                                   | as it has no impact on the cost   |

|                                   | from Darwin to Cairns is cheaper  |
|                                   | than the average fare cost of a   |

|                                   | Creek. Therefore, interstate      |
|                                   | travel can be approved, as it is  |
|                                   | more cost effective.              |
