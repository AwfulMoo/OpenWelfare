From 17 March 2021, Income Management (IM) customers based in the
Northern Territory (NT) can permanently transition to the Cashless Debit
Card (CDC) program. Customers on an income support payment who are
living in the NT and are not currently on IM, will be able to volunteer
for the Cashless Debit Card (CDC) from this date.
For more information on this process or to initiate an IM to CDC
transition, see Income Management (IM) to Cashless Debit Card (CDC)
Transition in the Northern Territory, which also contains staff
resources and links to the transition overview Intranet page for
additional information.

This document outlines how a customer can transfer from one Income
Management (IM) measure to another.

On this Page:

One IM measure to apply at a time

A customer’s payments can only be income managed under one measure of
Income Management at any one time, even though they may be eligible for
multiple measures. The hierarchy of Income Management measures outlines
which measure should apply when a customer is eligible for more than one
measure at a time.

As a result of the hierarchy, a customer may cease to be eligible for
one particular measure of Income Management but may then continue to be
income managed under a lower measure.

Movement between IM measures

Customers may also move between Income Management measures when they:

-   transfer from the Disengaged Youth (DEY) measure to the Long Term
    Welfare Payment Recipient (LTWPR) measure, for example customer
    turns 25 years old and satisfies all requirements including period
    of time on income support payments under the Long Term Welfare
    Payment Recipient (LTWPR) measure
-   are income managed under Compulsory Income Management (CIM) either
    the Disengaged Youth (DEY) or Long Term Welfare Payment Recipient
    (LTWPR) measures, and a referring authority refers them for Child
    Protection Income Management (CPIM) or the Supporting People at Risk
    (SPaR) measure
-   are no longer eligible for any of the compulsory measures of Income
    Management but choose to enter into a Voluntary Income Management
    Agreement
-   are no longer eligible for Income Management on their own, but they
    have a payment nominee who is subject to income management under a
    certain measure so are automatically transferred to Nominee Income
    Management
-   are on Voluntary Income Management and become eligible for one of
    the compulsory measures of Income Management (except customers
    automatically identified for the Welfare Payment Recipients measure)

Impact on IM funds when moving between measures

When a customer moves between Income Management measures without a break
in the period of Income Management their expenses will continue to be
paid, their BasicsCard will remain valid and their Income Management
balance will remain in their Income Management account.

Consideration needs to be given to any possible change in the Income
Management percentage that may result from moving between measures and
the effect this may have on their Income Management expenses. For this
reason, when a customer moves between measures Service Officers must
check their current Income Management expenses to ensure they are still
meeting the customer's priority needs.

If a customer has been off Income Management for a period of time and a
residual balance has begun to be disbursed, when the customer is income
managed again, disbursement payments to the customer will stop. Any
remaining residual balance will be income managed again.

Interviews and letters

Where a customer is transferring from one measure to another, they
should have an interview to ensure:

-   they understand their requirements under the new measure
-   they are aware of any exemptions or exclusions from Income
    Management which may be available under the new measure
-   their priority needs are still being met, in particular where the
    Income Management percentage has changed, and
-   they are fully aware of their review and appeal rights

These interviews can be conducted face-to-face or by telephone.

The customer is also sent a letter to explain why they are transferring
from one Income Management measure to another.

The Resources page contains scenarios of a customer transferring between
measures and the impact of this on their expense allocations.
