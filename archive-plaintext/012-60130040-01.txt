Emergencies and the PBS Authority line

When emergency situations affect the operation of the PBS Authority line
or risk the approval of PBS Authority prescriptions, specific policies
and processes must be followed by all staff.

The Resources page contains examples of emergency situations that may
affect the operation of the PBS Authority line and what actions are
required. Actions may include activation of emergency messaging as well
as stakeholder notification.

Call waiting time complaints on PBS Authority line

When Service Officers receive complaints from doctors regarding call
wait times they should apologise to the doctor in the first instance for
any inconvenience caused.

The following points provide additional assistance/scripting for Service
Officers when handling enquiries regarding wait times on the PBS
Authority line:

-   The majority of calls to the PBS Authority line are handled
    immediately
-   We generally receive 100 000+ PBS Authority calls each week
-   We constantly review our call volume forecasts to make sure the
    maximum number of Service Officers are available in peak times
-   Occasionally, callers are placed into a queue. All attempts are made
    to avoid this, but where required, we ensure wait times are as brief
    as possible
-   Occasionally technical issues result in delays
-   We focus on providing high quality and efficient services in a cost
    effective manner
-   We consistently review our processes, procedures and technology to
    improve the quality and responsiveness of our services to medical
    providers

The Resources page contains information about emergency messaging in
emergency situations and the procedures Service Officers should follow
where a complaint is not resolved.
