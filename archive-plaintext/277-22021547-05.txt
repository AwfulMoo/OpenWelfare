Trouble shooting

Transaction statements

Transaction statements (generated manually in the system) need to be
printed locally. They will not batch print from Cuba, even if the status
has been updated to reviewed.

Before setting the transaction statement to reviewed, print the
statement locally. This will create a new statement.

Once printed:

-   post the transaction statement manually
-   delete the original pending transaction statement, then
-   delete the Deceased Client letter intray

Excess cash letters

There is a known issue in Cuba which prevents the status of excess cash
letters in Cuba from being updated. Apply the following workaround to
update the letter status:

-   In the letters list, highlight both the Excess cash letter and the
    last letter issued and select Open
-   Use the toggle next button to move to the Excess letter
-   Select and change the letter status drop down to Reviewed. Save and
    exit the window
