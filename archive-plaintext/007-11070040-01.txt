This document outlines how a suite of screens show the details of a
Family Tax Benefit (FTB) lump sum claim lodged by a customer through the
Australian Taxation Office (ATO). From 1 July 2009, FTB can no longer be
claimed through the ATO.

Electronic transfer from the ATO

The information on these screens is transferred electronically by the
ATO to Centrelink and is based on information provided by the customer
on the claim form. This information is not used for ongoing FTB
payments.

Some of these are enquiry screens used to locate information about a
claim lodged via the ATO. Some screens can be used to update or correct
information if the customer advises a change. Updating details will
trigger a recalculation of their FTB lump sum claim entitlement.

If a customer enquire about the outcome of their FTB lump sum claim
lodged with the ATO before 1 July 2009, calculation details can be
viewed by selecting the relevant lump sum claim line on the FAO
Reconciliation and Claim Summary (FRCS) screen.
