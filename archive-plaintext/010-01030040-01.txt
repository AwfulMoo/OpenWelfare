Aim of the scheme

The aim of ITAS is to help Indigenous students achieve educational
outcomes equal to those of other Australians.

Apart from the provision of tutors, ITAS funds may also be provided to
Homework Centres where Indigenous school students can complete homework
and study assignments.

Indigenous students who are assessed as requiring additional assistance
with their studies may receive this assistance from a tutor, either
individually or in a small group.

Administration

ITAS is administered by the Department of Social Services (DSS) as part
of the Indigenous Education Training Programme. Further information is
available from the DSS Indigenous Education website, or by contacting
DSS via phone.

Services Australia does not handle enquiries regarding ITAS. Customers
with questions about ITAS should contact DSS.

Assistance Schemes.
