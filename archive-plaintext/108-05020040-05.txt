|                                   | John's employer is paying John's  |

|                                   | using the Fringe Benefit Tax      |
|                                   | rate. It factors in the income    |

|                                   | purposes, the rate of FBT is      |
|                                   | equal to the highest marginal     |
|                                   | rate of income tax plus the       |
