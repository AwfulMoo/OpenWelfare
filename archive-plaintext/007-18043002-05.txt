|                                   | for their child Xan. Their rate   |
|                                   | of FTB Part A is $17.87 per       |
|                                   | fortnight. They are not eligible  |
|                                   | for FTB Part B or any other       |
|                                   | add-ons.                          |

|                                   | due to immunisation applies to    |
|                                   | the rate of FTB Part A for Xan.   |
|                                   | This reduces the rate of FTB to   |
|                                   | zero.                             |

|                                   | Vui’s FTB will not cancel and     |
|                                   | will instead remain current at    |
|                                   | zero rate (CZR-INR). The          |
|                                   | reduction will remain in place    |
|                                   | until Xan meets immunisation      |

|                                   | 2019. This is because the FTB     |
|                                   | Part A rate reduction was         |
|                                   | incorrectly applied.              |
