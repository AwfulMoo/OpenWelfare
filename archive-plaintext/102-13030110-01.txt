Comprehensive assessment of the record

Data Quality Unit (DQU) Service Officers have access to end date child
to parent (CHI/PAR) links to resolve multiple and intertwined records.
Before a CHI/PAR link is end dated, a comprehensive assessment of the
record(s) must be undertaken. For multiple child record(s), DQU staff
are to refer to Multiple Centrelink Child CRN Checks and Cleansing.

FCC specialist staff have access to end date CHI/PAR links to resolve
children entrusted to care as part of the process of adoption or
surrogacy.

After the CHI/PAR link has been end dated, the child will not be
displayed in the parent(s)/guardian(s)' record or be included in future.
