information.

Skin biopsy for diagnostic purposes (items 30071 and 30072)

A skin biopsy is the removal of a sample of tissue for examination under
a microscope to check for cancer cells or other abnormalities.

Item 30071 (diagnostic biopsy of the skin) or item 30072 (diagnostic
biopsy of mucous membrane) should be used when a biopsy (including
shave) of a lesion is required to confirm a diagnosis and would
facilitate the appropriate management of that lesion.

These items can be claimed when the biopsy:

-   is performed as an independent procedure
-   specimen is sent for pathological examination, and
-   is clinically necessary to confirm the diagnosis for appropriate
    management of the lesion

Benefits are payable for more than one biopsy of the same area, provided
separate incisions have been made. Where multiple biopsy services are
billed, the claim can be paid as long as the account or claim notates
separate sites or words to similar effect.

If a shave biopsy results in the definitive excision of the lesion, only
MBS items 30071 or 30072 can be claimed. This means no further items for
that service can be billed after a diagnosis is received.

Where pathological examination of a skin biopsy results in confirmation
of malignancy and further surgery is necessary for the definitive
excision of that lesion, the relevant malignant item can be used for the
second service. The initial biopsy service will attract a Medicare
benefit under MBS item 30071 or 30072.

Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNBx)

A sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNBx) is a procedure in which the
sentinel lymph node is identified, removed, and examined to determine
whether cancer cells are present. It is used in people who have already
been diagnosed with cancer.

Item 30311 (melanoma specific sentinel lymph node biopsy) should be used
for patients with intermediate thickness melanoma. The procedure is to
determine if melanoma cells have spread to the sentinel lymph node.

There is a limit of one primary lesion (that is, melanoma) per patient
per occasion. Benefits are payable for more than one biopsy, provided
they are performed on separate sites (separate lymph node groups).

To pay multiple SLNBx services for the one occasion, the account or
claim must notate separate sites or similar.

Skin lesion excision

A skin lesion is a superficial growth or patch of the skin that does not
resemble the area surrounding it. Skin lesions can include tumours,
cysts, ulcers, scars and solar keratoses (sunspots) that are
non-malignant, suspicious or malignant.

Note: treatment of seborrheic keratosis (by any means) attracts benefits
on an attendance basis only.

A skin lesion excision is a procedure in which a practitioner removes a
skin lesion and an area of surrounding tissue called the margin.

The MBS item descriptors for skin lesion excision items outline the
following:

-   malignant or non-malignant lesion
-   location of the lesion such as nose, eyelid
-   excision diameter, and
-   histopathological requirements

Episode of care

An episode of care includes both the excision and closure for the same
defect, even when excision and closure occur at separate attendances.

Malignant skin lesions

The excision of malignant skin lesions are covered by MBS items 31356,
31358, 31359, 31361, 31363, 31365, 31367 and 31369.

Histological malignancy confirmation must be received before itemisation
of accounts with the relevant skin malignancy item/s.

Item restrictions

Malignant skin lesion excision items cannot be claimed in association
with skip flap items 45200, 45203 or 45206.

See the Process page for a table of malignant skin lesion items.

See the Resources page for a list of skin lesion types that are covered
by this item range.

Non-malignant skin lesions

The excision of non-malignant (benign) skin lesions are covered by MBS
items 31357, 31360, 31362, 31364, 31366, 31368 and 31370.

Excision of pre-malignant lesions, including solar keratoses where
clinically indicated, attract benefits under non-malignant items.

Excision of suspicious pigmented lesions for diagnostic purposes attract
benefits under non-malignant items.

These items must be sent for histological examination.

Item restrictions

Non-malignant skin lesion excision items cannot be claimed in
association with skip flap items 45200, 45203 or 45206.

See the Process page for a table of non-malignant skin lesion items.

See the Resources page for a list of skin lesion types that are covered
by this item range.

Malignant melanomas

The excision of malignant melanomas are covered by MBS items in the
range 31371-31376.

Histological malignancy confirmation must be received before itemisation
of accounts with the relevant skin malignancy item, ensuring the items
descriptor has been met in full.

These items have a requirement of definitive excision.

Definitive surgical excision is defined as surgical removal with
curative intent with an adequate margin.

Item restrictions

This item range cannot be claimed in association with skin flap items
45200, 45203 or 45206.

See the Process page for a table of malignant melanoma items.

See the Resources page for a list of skin lesion types that are covered
by this item range.

Re-excision of malignant skin lesions and malignant melanomas

Health practitioners can bill a malignant skin lesion or malignant
melanoma excision item twice for the same skin lesion where further
surgery is required to ensure complete surgical removal of the lesion to
prevent reoccurrence. This means malignant skin items can be used for
the initial excision of the lesion and where clinically relevant, the
re-excision.

An incomplete surgical excision of a malignant skin lesion or melanoma
with curative intent should be billed as a skin lesion or malignant
melanoma excision item even when a re-excision is needed to meet the
requirement of ‘definitive’ excision.

Re-excision of a malignant skin lesion or malignant melanoma may be
required because:

-   the original surgical excision was incomplete, or
-   to ensure an adequate margin of healthy tissue around an excised
    malignant skin lesion is achieved to prevent reoccurrence

Where a re-excision is performed, the practitioner should select the
relevant item for the size of excision diameter required as though no
previous excision has occurred.

Determining lesion size for malignant and non-malignant skin lesions (items 31356 to 31376)

The necessary excision diameter (or defect size) refers to the lesion
size plus a clinically appropriate margin of healthy tissue required
with the intent of complete surgical excision.

Margin size should be determined in line with:

-   National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines: Clinical
    practice guide - Basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma (and
    related lesions) - a guide to clinical management in Australia.
    November 2008 Cancer Council Australia, and
-   Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Melanoma in
    Australia and New Zealand (2008)

For the purpose of Items 31356 to 31376 the defect size is calculated by
the average of the width and the length of the skin lesion and an
appropriate margin. Therefore, the necessary excision diameter is
calculated as follows:

Defect size = (excision length + excision breadth)/2

Note: measurements should be taken prior to excision.

This information is available as a fact sheet for health professionals
on the MBS Online website.

Retention of evidence

Health professionals must retain copies of histological reports and any
other supporting evidence (such as patient notes, photographs etc.) with
the patient’s record. Photographs should include scale.

Histological examination

There are certain skin lesion items which require the specimen to be
sent for histological examination, these items include this criteria
within the MBS item descriptor:

-   Items 31206 to 31225 and 31350 to 31376 require that the specimen be
    sent for histological examination
-   Items 31356, 31358, 31359, 31361, 31363, 31365, 31367, 31369 and
    31371-31376 require that the specimen has been sent for histological
    confirmation of malignancy, and any subsequent specimens are sent
    for histological examination. For these services, confirmation of
    malignancy must be received before billing these services to
    Medicare
-   Item 30196 requires the specimen be sent for histological
    examination. If malignancy is confirmed by a specialist
    dermatologist before histological results are received, this item
    can be billed
-   Item 30202 requires that the specimen must be sent for histological
    examination or confirmed as malignant by a specialist dermatologist

Where histological results are available at the time of issuing an
account or claiming for Medicare benefits, the histological diagnosis
will decide the appropriate MBS item to be used.

Retention of evidence for skin services

For items 31356 to 31376 practitioners must retain copies of
histological reports and any other supporting evidence, such as patient
notes, photographs etc., with the patient’s record. Photographs should
include scale.

See the Resources page for a link to a health professional guideline for
substantiating proof of malignancy for items 30196 and 30205. Note:
items 30197, 30203 and 30205 ceased on 1 November 2018 but the guideline
still applies to records for these services performed before this date.

Items 14100 and 14124 require photographs to be retained on the
patient’s record. Evidence may be kept digitally or in paper form.

Solar keratoses

Solar Keratosis (sun spots) is a skin condition caused by excessive
exposure to the sun.

Diagnostic biopsy item 30071 may be appropriate for pathological
examination of solar keratosis if the practitioner deems it clinically
necessary to confirm the diagnosis for appropriate management of the
lesion.

Treatment by excision

-   where clinically relevant, the excision of solar keratoses is
    covered by non-malignant skin lesion excision items 31357, 31360,
    31362, 31364, 31366, 31368 and 31370

Treatment by ablative techniques

-   treatment of fewer than 10 solar keratoses by ablative techniques
    attracts benefits on an attendance basis only
-   where 10 or more solar keratoses are treated by ablative techniques,
    benefits are payable under item 30192

Seborrheic keratoses

Seborrheic keratosis is a non-cancerous skin growth.

Diagnostic biopsy item 30071 may be appropriate for pathological
examination of seborrheic keratoses if the practitioner deems it
clinically necessary to confirm the diagnosis for appropriate management
of the lesion. However, treatment of seborrheic keratosis (by any means)
attracts benefits on an attendance basis only.

Malignant neoplasms (item 30196 and 30202)

Items 30196 and 30202 are for removing malignant neoplasms from skin or
mucous membranes. These items require that the diagnosis is confirmed by
either:

-   histopathology or
-   specialist dermatologist confirmation - item 30196 additionally
    requires histology be submitted for confirmation, but results are
    not required before billing

Item 30196 is for removal by serial cutterage or laser
excision-ablation, which is performed with a carbon dioxide or erbium
laser.

Item 30202 is for removal by cryotherapy, where treatment involves
repeatedly freezing the lesion with liquid nitrogen and allowing it to
thaw.

Mohs micrographic surgery (items 31000 to 31005)

Mohs micrographic surgery involves removing one thin layer of tissue at
a time. As each layer is removed, the margins are studied under a
microscope for the presence of cancer cells (histological examination).
If the margins are cancer free, the surgery is ended, if not, more
tissue is removed from the margin. The procedure is repeated until all
margins of the final tissue sample examined are clear of cancer.

Items 31000, 31001 and 31002 are for the removal of tumours by Mohs
micrographic surgery on the following body areas:

-   head
-   neck
-   genitalia
-   hand
-   digits
-   leg (below knee)
-   foot

Items 31003, 31004 and 31005 are for removal of tumours removed on all
other areas of the body. The item description for each item includes the
number of excisions per tumour.

These items can be claimed multiple times where more than one tumour is
excised on the same patient on the same occasion. The account or claim
should notate separate sites or similar. Where multiple procedures are
billed to Medicare, the procedures will be subject to the multiple
operations rule. See the Process page for a table of Mohs micrographic
surgery items.

Excision of muscle, bone or cartilage (item 31340)

Item 31340 requires that the patient must be undergoing surgical
treatment for a skin malignancy and require the excision of muscle, bone
or cartilage for completion of the procedure.

Item 31340 covers the excision of one or more muscle, bone or cartilage,
if clinically indicated and if:

the specimen excised is sent for histological confirmation

is performed in association with one of these base excision items:

-   31000, 31001, 31002, 31003, 31004, 31005 (Mohs surgery)
-   31356, 31358, 31359, 31361, 31363, 31365, 31367, 31369 (malignant
    skin lesion excision)
-   31371, 31372, 31373, 31374, 31375 or 31376 is excised (malignant
    melanoma excision)

Item 31340 has a 75% derived fee calculation. This means that the
schedule fee for item 31340 will be calculated at 75% of the schedule
fee of the base excision item.

In order for the system to calculate the correct schedule fee, item
31340 must be co-claimed directly below one of the items in its
description. The 2 items are required to be claimed in the correct order
to be processed correctly.

If item 31340 is billed on its own, the message 3-CHK TUMR will appear.
Instructions for Service Officers are stated in the return message.

The Resources page contains an example of how a claim should be keyed.

Skin flaps

A skin flap is commonly used to cover a deep or large open wound, or to
repair damaged skin. A skin flap is a portion of skin that is moved from
one area of the body to another and is made up of all layers of the skin
and some fatty tissue. A skin flap may also include muscle and
cartilage.

A local skin flap is directly adjacent to a defect requiring closure.
The flap remains partially attached and is moved into the defect by
rotation, advancement or transportation, or a combination of these
manoeuvres.

A secondary skin defect will be created which may be closed by direct
suture, skin grafting or sometimes a further local skin flap. This later
procedure will also attract benefit if closed by graft or flap repair
but not when closed by direct suture.

By definition, direct wound closure (for example, by suture) does not
constitute skin flap repairs.

Similarly, angled, curved or trapdoor incisions which are used for
exposure and which are sutured back in the same position relative to the
adjacent tissues are not skin flap repairs.

Undermining of the edges of a wound prior to suturing is considered a
normal part of wound closure and is not considered a skin flap repair.

Medicare benefits for flaps are only payable when clinically relevant.
Clinically relevant in this instance means that the flap or graft is
required to close the defect:

-   because the defect cannot be closed directly, or
-   because the flap is required to adapt scar position optimally with
    regard to skin creases, or landmarks,
-   to maintain contour on the face or neck, or
-   to prevent distortion of adjacent structures or apertures

Skin flap item restrictions

Skin flap items 45200, 45203, 45206 or 45207 cannot be claimed for
closure of a defect related to items 31356-31376. If a claim contains a
skin flap 45200, 45203, 45206 or 45207 and an excision in the range
31356-31376 different sites must be notated before the restriction can
be overridden.

The practitioner other than the practitioner that performed the initial
excision service may perform the service under item 45201. Item 45201
can be claimed up to three days after the initial excision service. This
is to allow for weekends, public holidays or for patients who live in a
rural or remote location. If one of these items is not present, either
accompanying the 45201, or on the patients history, then the return
message 6-ASC NOT will display and the restriction cannot be overridden.

Skin flap item 45202 can be claimed in either of the below situations:

-   a second flap is required after item 45201 has already been claimed
    for that same defect, or
-   item 45201 does not apply to the defect and the:
-   patient has severe pre-existing scarring, severe skin atrophy or
    sclerodermoid changes, or
-   repair is contiguous with a free margin

See the Process page for MBS item numbers relating to skin flaps.

'Z' plasty

A ‘Z’ plasty is a particular type of repair of a skin defect by the
transposition of two triangular flaps of adjacent skin.

Although 2 flaps are created, benefit will be paid on the basis of items
45201, claimable once per defect. Additional flaps that are not part of
a ‘Z’ plasty are to be claimed under item 45202, if clinically
indicated.

Laser photocoagulation (items 14100 to 14124)

Items 14100 to 14124 are for treating vascular lesions by laser
photocoagulation using laser radiation.

Vascular lesion item restrictions

Items 14100 to 14118 have a maximum number of sessions in a rolling year
starting on the date of the first session. The maximum number of
sessions applies to all items across this range not just the individual
item itself. The maximum number of sessions are:

-   14100 - 4 sessions
-   14106 - 6 sessions
-   14115 - 6 sessions
-   14118 - 6 sessions

These can also be viewed as time dependencies on QITI.

Item 14124 can only be claimed after associated items in the range 14100
to 14118 are on the patient’s history.

Laser treatments for severely disfiguring lesions (items 30190 and 30191)

Items 30190 and 30191 are for treating severely disfiguring or
recurrently bleeding tumours by laser ablation. These items require that
a specialist dermatologist confirms the diagnosis. They exclude
treatment of:

-   melanocytic naevi or common warts
-   sebaceous hyperplasia
-   dermatosis papulosa nigra
-   Campbell De Morgan angiomas, and
-   seborrheic or viral warts

Item 30191 is for treatment of one or more lesions by carbon dioxide,
erbium or other appropriate laser.

Item 30190 is for treatment of 10 or more tumours on the face or neck by
carbon dioxide or erbium laser. It includes any resurfacing required.

Repair of wounds

Items 30026 to 30049 are for the repair of wounds of the skin and
subcutaneous tissues or of mucous membranes. Item selection should take
into account all of the following:

-   area of treatment
-   depth of the wound, and
-   size of the wound

The depth of the wound is indicated by the words:

-   ‘superficial’ meaning the skin, subcutaneous tissue and fat, or
-   ‘involving deeper tissue’ meaning both the skin and subcutaneous
    tissues and the tissues below the subcutaneous layer, such as the
    fascia and muscle

See the Process page for a table setting out the wound repair items
30026 to 30049.

Aftercare (Post-operative treatment)

The Medicare benefit for skin service procedures includes all
professional attendances necessary for the purpose of post-operative
treatment of a patient until recovery from the operation, plus the final
check or examination.

Medicare benefits are not payable where routine post-operative care is
provided by the health professional who performed the surgery. However,
Medicare benefits are payable where the aftercare is provided by the
patient’s GP, when the patient is unable to return to the original
practitioner to receive aftercare, typically because of the patient’s
location from their specialist.

For more information on aftercare arrangements, see Aftercare assessing
rules in Medicare.

Skin services and item restrictions

There are restrictions included in specific skin services item
descriptions that exclude other services from being performed together.

Where restrictive skin items are performed on the same day, the
account/claim should be endorsed with additional information such as the
time of service for separate occasions or the area the procedure was
performed on (e.g. left shoulder or right hand).

It is preferable that health professionals notate the exact location to
assist with the assessment of a claim, as ‘separate sites’ may not be
sufficient if more than 2 lesions have been treated.

There are certain circumstances which allow for restrictive items to be
overridden and paid. For example, where a skin flap item is performed
with a skin lesion excision item on the same day and a restriction
applies, notations of separate sites on the account/claim (e.g. left
shoulder for the skin flap and right hand for the skin lesion excision)
means a Medicare benefit is payable for both services and the item
restriction can be overridden.

Where restrictive situations arise, using resources such as QITI and
following prompts in return messages in the Medicare mainframe will
assist with the assessment of each restrictive claim.

Service Officers will need to assess what type of restriction has
returned and only where applicable, override the restriction.

For more information about assessing restrictive items, see Restrictive
items assessing in Medicare.

website, common enquiries and scenario claiming examples.
