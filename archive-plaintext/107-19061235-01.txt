This document outlines processing Manual Follow-up (MFU) tax activities,
generated due to benefit transfer adjustments.

Benefit transfers

Benefit transfers occur when customers transfer between payments. The
negative amount may be due to an error in the original activity that
performed the transfer.

MFU tax activities for benefit transfers are system generated, they:

-   cannot be automatically adjusted through correction of the customer
    record
-   require access to the 'Change' function on the Tax Payment Summary
    (TXGS) screen

Actioning MFU tax activities

The MFU tax activity:

flags that the payment summary is prevented from being issued

must be actioned to:

-   correct the negative amount, and
-   issued a payment summary to the customer

Compliance and Debt Operations (CDO) staff will:

-   investigate the errors
-   correct the negative amount shown on the payment summary, and
-   process benefit transfer MFU tax activities. They have access to the
    'Change' function on the TXGS screen

The Resources page contains an example of how to action a Tax MFU when 2
or more benefits have been paid in the same benefit transfer period and
a link to mySupport.
