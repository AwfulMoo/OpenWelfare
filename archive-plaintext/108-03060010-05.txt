How DFISA rates will display on DFS screen for reporting customers

Before 1 January 2022, DFISA payments for stimulus reporters were
calculated and transmitted to DVA when the customer reports their income
at the end of every entitlement period. DVA paid DFISA for the
entitlement period retrospectively. This is to ensure the correct amount
of DFISA was paid and to prevent overpayment.

A zero DFISA rate was then transmitted to DVA at the start of every
entitlement period. This occurred in the background. The DFISA Summary
(DFS) screen will show a provisional rate of DFISA, which is the rate
that would apply if the customer did not report any income.

Table 1: This table describes an example of the details displayed on the
DFISA Summary (DFS) screen for these reporting customers.

| 1                                 | A customer’s entitlement period   |
|                                   | end date and reporting date is 27 |
|                                   | October 2017. The start date for  |
|                                   | this entitlement period is 14     |
|                                   | October 2017.                     |

|                                   | displays a provisional DFISA rate |
|                                   | for the start of the entitlement  |
|                                   | period. This is the DFISA rate    |
|                                   | that would apply if the customer  |
|                                   | did not report any income.        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The provisional rate of DFISA     |
|                                   | will be visible on the DFS screen |

|                                   | as the customer has not yet       |
|                                   | reported.                         |

|                                   | 2017. This will halt DVA DFISA    |
|                                   | payments until the customer       |
|                                   | reports at the end of the         |

Calculating notional rent assistance

|                                   | amount should be coded on the     |
|                                   | DFLS screen, which triggers an    |
|                                   | automatic transmission to DVA     |
|                                   | (who will pay the amount). A      |
|                                   | system issue may prevent the      |
|                                   | transmission from occurring – in  |
|                                   | this instance the DVA Clearance   |
|                                   | Team will advise DVA of the       |
|                                   | amount manually.                  |
