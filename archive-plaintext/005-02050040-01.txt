This document explains the exemptions from mutual obligation
requirements for refugees.

Exempting refugees from their mutual obligation requirements

An exemption from mutual obligation requirements is granted to newly
arrived refugees to help them with their initial settlement activities.
This may include English language studies or getting stable
accommodation.

Refugees have diverse life experiences and educational backgrounds. Some
refugee customers may be job ready earlier, and therefore wish to access
employment services earlier. For such customers, they are eligible to be
referred to Workforce Australia from 6 weeks onwards. The level of
Workforce Australia support they receive is based on their
circumstances.

For more details, see Refugee humanitarian and protection visa holder
service offer.

The 13 week activity exemption period is often reduced to 11 weeks and 6
days so that it can align with the:

-   12 week reporting, and
-   12 week appointment that the customer will need to attend

During the new claim interview, Refugee and Asylum Seekers (RAS) staff
will manually change the Activity and Exemption Summary (AEX) screen to
end the exemption period at 11 weeks and 6 days.
