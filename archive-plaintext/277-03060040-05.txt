|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Nelly advises that Ron has been   |
|                                   | in care 100% of the time since 20 |
|                                   | July 2019 as Trent (the other     |
|                                   | parent) has moved interstate.     |
|                                   | There is no care arrangement in   |
|                                   | place. Trent is contacted and     |
|                                   | agrees that Ron’s care has        |
|                                   | changed, but states that the care |
|                                   | could not have changed on 20 July |
|                                   | 2019 because that was Trent's     |
|                                   | birthday weekend and remembers    |
|                                   | caring for Ron for the entire     |
|                                   | weekend and returning Ron to      |
|                                   | Nelly’s house on Monday 22 July   |
|                                   | 2019. Trent also claims that      |
|                                   | plans have been made to take Ron  |
|                                   | overseas for 8 weeks during the   |
|                                   | 2019 Christmas holidays. Trent    |
|                                   | advises that during the care      |
|                                   | period expects to care for Ron    |
|                                   | for 56 nights (15%).              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Nelly is contacted again to       |
|                                   | discuss Trent’s claims. During    |
|                                   | the conversation, Nelly recalls   |
|                                   | the birthday weekend and confirms |
|                                   | the care changed on 22 July 2019. |
|                                   | Nelly also agrees that Trent is   |
|                                   | taking Ron overseas for 8 weeks   |
|                                   | over Christmas to see family.     |
|                                   | Nelly also explains that during   |
|                                   | the initial contact, as the       |
|                                   | overseas trip was a one-off event |
|                                   | and not a permanent change, this  |
|                                   | was not included in the original  |
|                                   | notification. In this event, care |
|                                   | would be recorded as set out      |
|                                   | above and measured over the whole |
|                                   | care period using date of event   |
|                                   | as agreed to by customers and     |
|                                   | percentage of care now agreed to  |
|                                   | by customers.                     |

|                                   | The agency is notified of a care  |
|                                   | change on 2 August 2019. Customer |
|                                   | A advises that care changed on 17 |
|                                   | July 2019, Customer B advises     |
|                                   | that care changed on 23 July      |
|                                   | 2019. Neither parent can provide  |
|                                   | evidence to support their claims  |
|                                   | and nor is one parent’s           |
|                                   | information more compelling than  |
|                                   | the other. The point of agreement |
|                                   | is 23 July 2019 – the first day   |
|                                   | both parents agree that the care  |
|                                   | had changed.                      |
