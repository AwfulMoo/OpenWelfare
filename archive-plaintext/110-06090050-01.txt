If a child is in immediate danger or risk of harm you must act, and a
delegate must call 000.

This document outlines the process for review of the Homelessness
Indicator and referral for a wellbeing assessment.

Child safe framework

Services Australia has a zero tolerance approach to child abuse.

A staff member must act when they see or hear behaviour which raises
concern about a child or young person’s safety. Follow the agency's Risk
Identification and Reporting model when identifying and responding to
child safety concerns. See Risk identification and management of threats
to the safety or welfare of a child.

File assessment

A Service Officer needs to undertake a file assessment and either:

-   update the Homelessness Indicator as the customer is no longer
    homeless or at risk of homelessness
-   extend the Homelessness Indicator
-   refer the customer to a social worker if the customer is at risk

Homelessness Indicator no longer needed

Service Officers need to conduct a file assessment to identify customers
who no longer need the Homelessness Indicator due to:

-   not having received an Income Support Payment (ISP) for three months
    or more
-   getting Rent Assistance for at least 3 months, or providing a lease
    agreement
-   residing in government housing/community housing
-   long term imprisonment, for example, more than 3 months
-   securing stable accommodation
-   entering Residential Aged Care or awaiting a placement for aged care

No change in circumstances - consider wellbeing assessment

If there is no evidence of any change in the customer's circumstances
since the Homelessness Indicator was coded, consider other assistance:

-   community support services
-   JobActive Services for eligible job seekers, or
-   referral for a wellbeing assessment to a social worker

Referring customers to a social worker

Factors to consider when referring a customer to a social worker for a
wellbeing assessment could include:

-   customers experiencing family and domestic violence
-   unsupported young people, especially those who are living out of
    home, have left state care or youth justice, or are under 16 years
    of age
-   customers presenting with significant mental health issues

To refer a customer to a social worker, use the Social Worker referral
guided procedure

For customers at risk of harm, see Customers talking about suicide or
self-harm.
