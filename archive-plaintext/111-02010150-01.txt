This document outlines the process of accessing archived Pensioner
Education Supplement (PES) data using the Archiving and Culling Engine
(ACE) application.

General rules

The general rules for archiving PES records are:

-   The record must have been cancelled for 3 or more years
-   The record must not have a recent or unfinalised Debt, Appeal,
    Prosecution or Compensation activity

Service reasons to be archived

The PES service reasons to be archived are:

-   Pensioner Education Supplement (PES)
-   Employment Pathway Fund (EPF)
-   ABSTUDY PES (EPA)
-   Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) scheme PES

Not all data for a 3 year old cancelled record is archived. Only
Assessment and Summary data relevant to PES is archived. No Person data
or common Circumstance data is archived, and is retained in the system
for use by other Common Platform Systems.

After a record has been archived, the PES data normally displayed on the
system will be displayed in a similar format in ACE.
