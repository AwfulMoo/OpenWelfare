*FTB Part A reduction due to immunisation will be applied to days where
the child does not meet immunisation requirements following a 63 day
grace period. If the child fails to comply after the grace period the
reduction will be applied to the days in the grace period at end of year
reconciliation. The reduction will cease when the child meets
immunisation requirements.
