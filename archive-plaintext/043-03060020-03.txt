|                                   | some points to note:              |

|                                   | a sole trader cannot employ       |

|                                   |     to base the assessment of the |

|                                   |     received by a customer from a |

|                                   |     if the business has lost a    |
|                                   |     contract or suffered some     |
|                                   |     other reduction in income,    |
|                                   |     ask the customer to provide   |
