This document outlines information about concession cards and when
entitlement can be extended even though the payment may have ceased.

Extended entitlement to a concession card

Customers who have received some payments may continue to be qualified
for their concession card even after their payment has ceased. This
mainly applies when the payment has ceased due to income from
employment, however, there are limited other reasons where extended
entitlement to a concession card may be applicable. In all cases the
extended entitlement to a concession card is determined by the payment
they received.

Customers who are eligible for Working Credit will be entitled to their
concession card where the customer is in an employment income nil rate
period.

In all cases the customer's Concession Entitlement Summary (MCCS) screen
should be checked for current entitlement start and end dates. The Card
Issue Summary (CCIS) screen displays actual cards issued, not current
entitlements.
