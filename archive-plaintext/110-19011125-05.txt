| 1                                 | Limitation on information         |
|                                   | requests                          |

|                                   | There is a limitation on the      |
|                                   | scope of information requests.    |
|                                   | The agency has a limitation of 7  |
|                                   | years for historical information  |
|                                   | requests.                         |

|                                   | information outside 5 years. This |
|                                   | is due to tax legislation         |
|                                   | requiring information to be       |
|                                   | retained for 5 years.             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the start date of the income   |
|                                   | stream is within 7 years, request |
|                                   | information since start of the    |
|                                   | product. Otherwise, request       |
|                                   | historical information as per the |
|                                   | 7 year scope limitation.          |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   the scope start date for      |
|                                   |     historical information        |
|                                   |     requests within 7 years will  |
|                                   |     be 1 July of the financial    |
|                                   |     year, which is 7 years before |
|                                   |     the current financial year    |
|                                   | -   in the 2020-21 financial      |
|                                   |     year, the scope start date    |
