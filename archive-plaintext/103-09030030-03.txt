|                                   |     period. This ensures the      |
|                                   |     customer receives the same    |

|                                   | Deduction, code a target amount   |
|                                   | equal to the deduction amount. Do |
|                                   | not use the One Time Payment      |
|                                   | (OTP) option when coding a        |
