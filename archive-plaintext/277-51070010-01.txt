This document outlines how the Details of your child support (FA003)
form is used to obtain information about children from a previous
relationship for Family Tax Benefit (FTB) customers. This allows correct
application of the Maintenance Action Test and Maintenance Income Test
for FTB Part A.

Verbal response to FA003

For each child from a previous relationship, a verbal response or the
FA003 is used to obtain the following information:

-   their relationship to the child
-   the name of the child's parent(s)
-   details of any formal or informal arrangement in place to receive
    child support for the child
-   details of the amount or value of the benefit received

A separate form (FA003) is needed for each previous relationship. For
blended families, both the customer and their current partner will need
to complete a form.

Service Officer actions

Service Officers must:

-   check if action to obtain child support is required by the customer
    and/or their current partner and advise the customer what action
    they need to take
-   group the children correctly on the customer's record
-   update the Maintenance Action Test (MAT) code for each child to
    reflect the action the customer has taken to obtain child support,
    or that action to obtain child support is not required
-   record maintenance income if necessary
-   advise the customer what action they need to take before recording
    details, if the form is received at an interview
-   record details on the customer's record before advising the customer
    of their obligations, if the form is received by mail.
