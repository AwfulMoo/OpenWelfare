|                                   | introduced on 20 March 1995.      |
|                                   | Before that date, war widow(er)'s |
|                                   | were able to receive an income    |

|                                   | of entitlement was fixed at a     |
|                                   | maximum ceiling or 'frozen' rate  |
|                                   | of $124.90.                       |

|                                   | in the same way as for other      |
|                                   | pensioners - that is, based on    |
|                                   | the person's income and assets    |
|                                   | with the war widow(er)'s pension  |
|                                   | taken into account as income.     |

|                                   | ISP payable could not exceed      |
|                                   | $124.90.                          |

|                                   | If the war widow(er) was          |
|                                   | partnered, their social security  |
|                                   | pension and the partner's pension |
|                                   | were calculated based on the      |

|                                   | both partners, with the WWP taken |
