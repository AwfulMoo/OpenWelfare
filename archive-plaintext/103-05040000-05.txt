+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Question: What is the tax status  |
|                                   | of an advance payment?            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: For tax purposes, advance |
|                                   | payments are treated as a 'loan   |
|                                   | of money'. This applies           |
|                                   | irrespective of when the advance  |
|                                   | payment was paid during the       |
|                                   | financial year. Advance payments  |
|                                   | do not attract any additional tax |
|                                   | liability as they are not an      |
|                                   | extra payment but a lump sum      |
|                                   | payment of the customer's ongoing |
|                                   | entitlement.                      |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 2                                 | Question: Can the advance be paid |
|                                   | as a lump sum or instalments?     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: All advances can be paid  |
|                                   | as a lump sum into their normal   |
|                                   | bank account. Social Security     |
|                                   | Entitlement advance payments can  |
|                                   | also be paid in 2 instalments.    |

|                                   | The customer must nominate the    |
|                                   | instalment amounts and the date   |

|                                   | instalment to be automatically    |
|                                   | paid. Staff must code this date   |
|                                   | in line with current payment      |
|                                   | processing times. For a pension   |
|                                   | customer, the instalment date is  |
|                                   | coded as 2 working days prior to  |
|                                   | the date the funds are required   |
|                                   | by the customer. For a            |
|                                   | non-pension customer, the         |
|                                   | instalment date is coded as one   |
|                                   | working day prior to the date the |
|                                   | funds are required by the         |
|                                   | customer.                         |

|                                   | The second instalment must be     |
|                                   | paid within 6 months of grant of  |
|                                   | the advance.                      |

|                                   | When a customer elects to have    |
|                                   | instalments, the recovery rate is |
|                                   | calculated on the full amount to  |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: For Social Security       |
|                                   | advance payments: no. Only the    |
|                                   | recovery of the overpayment has   |
|                                   | been temporarily written off,     |
|                                   | therefore the customer still has  |
|                                   | a recoverable debt owing to the   |
|                                   | Commonwealth Government. This     |
|                                   | includes those with non-lodger    |
|                                   | debts temporarily written off     |
|                                   | under the separated couples rule. |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | For Family Tax Benefit (FTB),     |
|                                   | generally, if the customer has an |
|                                   | overpayment temporarily written   |
|                                   | off, they still have a            |
|                                   | recoverable debt owed to the      |
|                                   | Commonwealth and they will not be |
|                                   | entitled to an advance payment,   |
|                                   | except if the debt is temporarily |
|                                   | written off due to an ex-partner  |
|                                   | non-lodger debt or bankruptcy     |
|                                   | debt - these debts will not       |
|                                   | affect their eligibility for an   |
|                                   | advance payment.                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Mobility Allowance Advance        |
|                                   | payments, however, are not        |
|                                   | affected by existing debts.       |

| 2                                 | Question: Is a customer entitled  |
|                                   | to an advance payment if they     |
|                                   | have a permanently written off    |
|                                   | overpayment?                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: If the overpayment has    |
|                                   | been permanently written off,     |
|                                   | while the customer still owes the |
|                                   | amount to the Commonwealth        |
|                                   | Government, it is no longer       |
|                                   | recoverable by means of           |
|                                   | deductions. This means the        |
|                                   | customer is eligible for an       |
|                                   | advance payment. The Service      |
|                                   | Officer still has a duty of care  |
|                                   | to ensure the customer will not   |
|                                   | be placed in financial hardship,  |
|                                   | and may reject the application    |
|                                   | for this reason.                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the Service Officer is         |
|                                   | satisfied the customer will not   |
|                                   | be placed in financial hardship,  |
|                                   | they can grant the advance        |
|                                   | payment.                          |

| 3                                 | Question: Should a Service        |
|                                   | Officer grant a customer an       |
|                                   | advance when they apply with an   |
|                                   | outstanding debt balance of less  |
|                                   | than 5 cents?                     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: This procedure will not   |
|                                   | work for Special Employment       |
|                                   | Advance (SEA) or Pharmaceutical   |
|                                   | Allowance (PhA) Advance. When a   |
|                                   | customer pays the outstanding     |
|                                   | balance of a debt but a rounding  |
|                                   | amount remains outstanding, any   |
|                                   | advance payment application       |
|                                   | processed will automatically      |
|                                   | reject. Service Officers are      |
|                                   | allowed in these instances to     |
|                                   | override the rejection using the  |
|                                   | Manage Advances action in Process |
|                                   | Direct where the customer has an  |
|                                   | outstanding debt balance of less  |
|                                   | than 5 cents. This is so the      |
|                                   | customer is not disadvantaged by  |
|                                   | the administrative process which  |
|                                   | occurs as the remaining rounding  |
|                                   | amount will not clear until after |
|                                   | the customer's next pay day.      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Example: Customer has a debt for  |
|                                   | $234.67, they attend a Post       |
|                                   | Office or service centre to pay   |
|                                   | $234.67 but due to rounding only  |
|                                   | pay $234.65. The 0.02 cents       |
|                                   | outstanding will not clear until  |
|                                   | the customer's next pay. A        |
|                                   | Service Officer can manually      |
|                                   | override the application          |
|                                   | rejection and process the next    |
|                                   | advance if the customer meets all |
|                                   | other qualification criteria.     |

| 4                                 | Question: If a customer has a     |
|                                   | Compensation Insurer debt that    |
|                                   | has not been repaid, can they     |
|                                   | receive an advance payment?       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: This type of debt does    |
|                                   | not meet the disqualification     |
|                                   | requirements and should not       |
|                                   | prevent the customer from         |
|                                   | receiving an advance. The debt is |
|                                   | owed to the Commonwealth by the   |
|                                   | insurer, not the customer.        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | As the system is unable to        |
|                                   | identify this type of debt from   |
|                                   | other debts, the workflow will    |
|                                   | automatically reject the          |
|                                   | application. In these cases the   |
|                                   | rejection should be overridden.   |
|                                   | Note: there is no override        |
|                                   | feature for Special Employment    |
|                                   | Advance (SEA) or Pharmaceutical   |

|                                   | Answer: The system will generate  |
|                                   | a repayment amount spread over    |
|                                   | the next 13 fortnights.           |

|                                   | If the amount of repayment        |
|                                   | requested by the customer is      |
|                                   | equal to or greater than the      |
|                                   | system generated amount, this     |
|                                   | amount is accepted and updated on |
|                                   | the customer's record when the    |
|                                   | advance payment is being granted. |

|                                   | If the amount of repayment        |
|                                   | requested by the customer is less |
|                                   | than the system generated amount, |
|                                   | the customer's advance payment    |
|                                   | will be rejected as the customer  |
|                                   | is unable to afford the           |
|                                   | repayments.                       |

|                                   | recovered separately. If the      |
|                                   | customer is granted a second or   |
|                                   | third advance payment while still |
|                                   | repaying an earlier one (for      |
|                                   | non-pension customers, this would |

| 6                                 | Question: Can a customer increase |
|                                   | their rate of repayment via       |

|                                   | Answer: [] Yes. Customers can     |
|                                   | request to increase their rate of |
|                                   | repayment. The preferred channel  |
|                                   | is to use Centrelink online       |
|                                   | account or the Express Plus       |
|                                   | mobile app. This request will be  |
|                                   | approved only if the customer     |
|                                   | will not suffer severe financial  |
|                                   | hardship.                         |

|                                   | The increased amount must be less |
|                                   | than or equal to twice the        |
|                                   | legislated repayment amount which |
|                                   | is determined by dividing the     |
|                                   | advance amount by 13. For         |
|                                   | example, a $500 advance equals    |
|                                   | repayments of $38.50 per          |
|                                   | fortnight, therefore the increase |
|                                   | should not exceed $77 per         |
|                                   | fortnight.                        |

|                                   | The repayment amount cannot be    |
|                                   | increased for MOB advance         |
|                                   | payments.                         |

| 7                                 | Question: Can the customer have   |
|                                   | their rate of repayment           |
|                                   | decreased?                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: Decreasing the rate of    |
|                                   | repayment or stopping the         |
|                                   | repayments should only be         |
|                                   | considered for the standard       |

|                                   | one-off transitional FTB advance  |
|                                   | payment) or SEA if:               |

|                                   | -   the customer has special and  |
|                                   |     unusual circumstances, and    |
|                                   | -   they would suffer severe      |
|                                   |     financial hardship if the     |
|                                   |     repayment rate was not        |
|                                   |     reduced                       |

|                                   | FTB advance payment will reject   |
|                                   | if an outstanding advance of any  |
|                                   | type has a reduced recovery       |

|                                   | customer must have capacity to    |
|                                   | make repayments at the standard   |
|                                   | rate for the advance to be        |

| 8                                 | Question: Can the customer use    |
|                                   | online services to have their     |
|                                   | rate of repayment decreased?      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: [] A customer may         |
|                                   | decrease their advance repayment  |
|                                   | amount using the online channels  |
|                                   | only if they are currently on an  |
|                                   | increased repayment rate and the  |
|                                   | decreased amount is greater than  |
|                                   | or equal to the prior legislated  |
|                                   | repayment amount. This is         |
|                                   | determined by dividing the        |
|                                   | advance amount by 13. For         |
|                                   | example, a $500 advance equals    |
|                                   | repayments of $38.50 per          |
|                                   | fortnight.                        |

|                                   | The repayment amount cannot be    |
|                                   | reduced for MOB advance payments. |
|                                   |                                   |
