This document outlines how to code education details for ABSTUDY and
ABSTUDY Pensioner Education Supplement (EPA) customers.

Situations where this procedure does not apply

Different procedures apply for situations where the customer:

-   will not commence full-time study for ABSTUDY, ABSTUDY PES, AIC and
    AIC PES
-   is receiving ABSTUDY or ABSTUDY PES and defers or discontinues study
    before the end of the course
-   is receiving ABSTUDY or ABSTUDY PES and changes the course and/or
    education institution that they were studying
-   has now finished their course

Continuing students

Customers are deemed to be continuing students where they:

have had a break in full-time or concessional study-load of 1 semester
or less, and the first day of their approved course is between 1 January
and 31 March, or between 1 July and 31 July. These customers do not need
to have been receiving a study payment during the previous study period

have had a break in full-time or concessional study-load greater than 1
semester, and the break in study was due to circumstances beyond their
control

discontinue and then subsequently commence full-time or concessional
study-load, in either the same course or a different course. They remain
entitled to Living Allowance if the period between is no more than 28
days

were receiving Living Allowance or another Australian Government payment
on the basis of undertaking approved full-time or concessional
study-load study:

-   immediately before the vacation period, and
-   are intending to undertake approved full-time or concessional
    study-load study in the study period immediately after the vacation
    period. This includes a vacation period that falls during the time a
    student is transitioning from secondary to tertiary level study

Note: for ABSTUDY customers, there is no entitlement to Living Allowance
over the long vacation period if:

-   the approved course immediately before the vacation period ended
    earlier than 15 September, and
-   the approved course immediately after the vacation period starts
    after 31 March

Additional coding required for Relocation Scholarship (RS)

Students studying an approved scholarship course may also qualify to
receive an RS. RS eligibility explains additional coding required for
students studying an approved scholarship course to ensure that the RS
is paid correctly.

Unfavourable decisions

When making an unfavourable decision, speak to the customer:

-   explain the decision
-   give them a chance to provide more information or evidence
-   advise their review and appeal rights. Record an application for a
    formal review of the decision if required

Make 2 genuine attempts to contact the customer before finalising the
decision.

The Resources page contains contact details and links to the National
Course Approvals sub-site and the Australian Qualifications Framework
(AQF).
