Table 2: This table describes examples of when a parent delays in
notifying Child Support or Centrelink of changes in care. These multiple
changes can be reported at the same time.

| Item                              | Example                           |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | On 1 July 2016, Marge notifies of |
|                                   | 2 changes in care for a child     |
|                                   | that occurred the previous year:  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   1 August 2015, Marge started  |
|                                   |     having 2 nights care per      |
|                                   |     fortnight, and                |
|                                   | -   1 December 2015, Marge        |
|                                   |     started having 4 nights care  |
|                                   |     per fortnight                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The care percentage for the first |
|                                   | event (1 August 2015) is          |
|                                   | calculated over 12 months from    |
|                                   | that event date as though the     |
|                                   | second event had not occurred.    |
|                                   | That is, 2 nights per fortnight   |
|                                   | is 14% care (52 nights over 12    |
|                                   | months). The care percentage for  |
|                                   | the second event (1 December      |
|                                   | 2015) is calculated over 12       |
|                                   | months from that event date. That |
|                                   | is, 4 nights per fortnight is 28% |
|                                   | care (104 nights over 12 months). |
|                                   | As both decisions were notified   |
|                                   | outside of 28 days, only the      |
|                                   | later change affects the          |
|                                   | assessment from the date of       |
|                                   | notification 1 July 2016.         |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 2                                 | On 15 June 2016 Child Support was |
|                                   | notified of a care change for the |
|                                   | child that occurred on 1 May      |
|                                   | 2016. Under the new arrangement,  |
|                                   | each parent will have 50% care.   |
|                                   | The care period begins on 1 May   |
|                                   | 2016 for both Child Support and   |
|                                   | Centrelink. As the date of        |
|                                   | notification was more than 28     |
|                                   | days after the date the event     |
|                                   | changed, the child support        |
|                                   | assessment is amended from 15     |
|                                   | June 2016 (date of notification), |
|                                   | however the amendment to FTB      |
|                                   | takes effect from the date the    |
|                                   | care changed (date of event)      |
|                                   | being 1 May 2016.                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Where care changes occur close    |
|                                   | together and are notified within  |
|                                   | 28 days of the first event, or    |
|                                   | the below regular care rules      |
|                                   | apply, there is a greater         |
|                                   | retrospective effect as more than |
|                                   | one care change may affect the    |
|                                   | child support assessment.         |

|                                   | occurring, the following will     |
|                                   | occur:                            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   the first care period begins  |
|                                   |     on 12 August 2016, being the  |
|                                   |     first date of event. The care |
|                                   |     percentage is calculated as   |
|                                   |     60%. The care period is       |
|                                   |     calculated as though it is    |
|                                   |     going to run for a full 12    |
|                                   |     months, regardless of the     |

|                                   |     the second date of event. The |
|                                   |     care percentage is calculated |
|                                   |     as 75%                        |
|                                   | -   the child support assessment  |
|                                   |     will be changed from 12       |
|                                   |     August 2016 to reflect 60%    |

|                                   |     care. As both decisions were  |
|                                   |     notified within 28 days, both |
|                                   |     changes affect the assessment |
|                                   |     from the respective dates of  |

|                                   | John and Karen alternate care of  |
|                                   | Laura over Christmas such that    |
|                                   | Laura stays with John for all of  |
|                                   | the Christmas school holidays one |

|                                   | Emerson. There is no care         |
|                                   | arrangement in place for Emerson, |
|                                   | however, until recently Marcia    |
|                                   | had 100% care of Emerson.         |
|                                   | Marciaâ€™s circumstances changed    |
|                                   | such that Marcia is no longer     |
|                                   | able to care for Emerson full     |
|                                   | time and so has asked Eric if     |
|                                   | they could look after Emerson     |
|                                   | until Marcia is able to resume    |

|                                   | agreed but cannot commit          |
|                                   | permanently due to travel         |

|                                   | per week for the next 2 months,   |
|                                   | and then will increase care of    |
|                                   | Emerson by one night per week     |
|                                   | every 2 months until full time    |
|                                   | care is resumed.                  |

|                                   | advise of the new arrangement. As |
|                                   | the parents have agreed on the    |
|                                   | specific arrangements to increase |
|                                   | Marciaâ€™s care in a staggered but  |
|                                   | foreseeable way over a definable  |
|                                   | period, it would be appropriate   |
|                                   | to use a care period of 2 months  |
|                                   | for each of the periods that      |
|                                   | Marcia is due to increase the     |
|                                   | care of Emerson. This ensures the |
|                                   | care percentage accurately        |
|                                   | reflects the care that each       |
|                                   | parent is providing during each 2 |

|                                   | Li and Mai have one child, Tung.  |
|                                   | Tung usually lives with Mai 100%  |
|                                   | of the time. Mai needs to go to   |
|                                   | hospital for 3 weeks for an       |
|                                   | operation, and may require a      |
|                                   | further period of intensive       |
|                                   | rehabilitation where Mai will not |
|                                   | be able to care for Tung. Li will |

|                                   | contacts Services Australia and   |

Applying special rounding rules examples

Table 6: This table describes two examples of applying the percentage of
care (special rounding rules).

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Item                              | Example                           |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Mahlee has 134 nights care per    |
|                                   | year. Mahlee's percentage of care |
|                                   | is (134/365) x 100 = 36.71%. This |
|                                   | is less than 50% and is therefore |
|                                   | rounded down to 36%.              |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 2                                 | Tristan has 231 nights care per   |
|                                   | year. Tristanâ€™s percentage of     |
|                                   | care is (231/365) x 100 = 63.28%. |
|                                   | This is greater than 50% and is   |
|                                   | therefore rounded up to 64%.      |

Determining Child Support date of effect for a change in care

Table 7: This table provides scenarios and examples to determine the
date of effect for change in care.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

|                                   | Child moves from 100% care of one |
|                                   | parent to 100% care of the other  |
|                                   | parent. This is a change of care  |
|                                   | not a terminating event, as the   |
|                                   | child is in the care of a party   |
|                                   | to the assessment. The change     |
|                                   | will take effect from the date    |
|                                   | Child Support was notified of the |
|                                   | change unless notified within 28  |

|                                   | to Daveâ€™s 100% care on 2 February |
|                                   | 2016. Fran and Dave do not have a |
|                                   | written care arrangement for      |
|                                   | Jill. Fran advised Child Support  |
|                                   | of this change in care on 11 July |
|                                   | 2016. This is a change in care    |
|                                   | and will take effect from 11 July |
|                                   | 2016, the date of notification.   |
