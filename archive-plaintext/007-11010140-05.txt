|                                   | A bereavement deferral can be     |
|                                   | recorded after:                   |

|                                   | Bereavement deferrals cannot be   |

|                                   | and their FTB child dies, PIP     |
|                                   | cannot be lifted (due to the      |
|                                   | bereavement deferral) until PIP   |
|                                   | has been resolved. Bereavements   |
|                                   | should be assessed on a           |
