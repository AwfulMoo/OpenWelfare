This document outlines the process of returning or redirecting aged care
service forms. This process applies to the Aged Care Payments Team (Aged
Care and Allied Health (ACAH) Branch).

Returning or redirecting forms

There will be occasions when the ACAH Branch receive a form that is:

-   incomplete and needs to be returned to the aged care service for
    completion and resubmission
-   meant to be sent to the Department of Health and Aged Care or the
    Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA) and needs to be returned with
    advice to the aged care service to resend the form to the relevant
    department
-   meant for Centrelink and should be redirected to the Smart Centres
    Aged Care team for processing

Returning a form to an aged care service

Service Officers from the ACAH Branch must return incomplete forms to
the aged care service to complete and resubmitt.

Service Officers can use the More information required (excluding ACFI)
letter template.

messaging homepage.

Notifying changes in circumstances and changes to key personnel

Key personnel are people associated with an aged care service that have
authority and responsibility for (or significant influence over)
day-to-day operations and decision making within an aged care service.

Aged care services are no longer required to advise the Aged Care
Quality and Safety Commission of key personnel changes, however they are
still required to:

-   ensure that key personnel are not disqualified individuals
-   advise of changes that materially affects the suitability of an aged
    care service

These material changes are substantial or considerable changes in
nature. For example, the aged care service:

is no longer an incorporated organisation

is unable to meet any of the home, flexible or residential care
standards

is unable to manage its financial responsibilities including subsidies
and care recipient’s fees and payments

makes a change which may affect the rights of aged care recipients

makes substantial changes to its organisational or governance structure
such as:

-   entering into a brokerage arrangement for delivery of clinical care
-   use of a management company

These are examples only and aged care services should consider each
situation individually and can contact the Aged Care Quality and Safety
Commission for further information.
