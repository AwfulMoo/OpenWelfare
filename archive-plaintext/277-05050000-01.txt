This document outlines information about the application of Low Income
Non Enforcement (LINE) periods for Stage 1 Child Support cases,
including overseas liabilities.

Stage 1 case - LINE periods

A payer can apply to suspend an Australian court order or court
registered agreement for child maintenance and a child and/or spousal
maintenance order made by, or a child and/or spousal maintenance
agreement registered by, a judicial authority of a reciprocating
jurisdiction where:

-   the payer receives or has applied for a Centrelink pension or
    benefit and meets the Prescribed Income Test, and
-   in the case of an Australian child maintenance liability, the court
    order or court registered agreement does not provide for a reduction
    in liability due to unemployment or reduced income

Note: payers who are only in receipt of Parental Leave Payments will not
be eligible to suspend their Australian court order or court registered
agreement or overseas court order or court registered agreement. This is
because although in most cases Centrelink administers this entitlement.
It is not considered a Centrelink pension or benefit.

This period of suspension is called a Low Income Non Enforcement period
(LINE) period. A LINE period ends when the payer is no longer in receipt
of a Centrelink pension or benefit, or no longer meets the Prescribed
Income Test.

Child Support has been able to accept an application from a payer to not
enforce an overseas child or spousal maintenance order or court
registered agreement since July 2007.
