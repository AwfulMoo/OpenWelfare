This document outlines how a pharmacy can be registered as an
organisation in the Healthcare Identifiers (HI) Service.

PKI location

Many pharmacies are already registered with a Public Key Infrastructure
(PKI) location certificate to use PBS online. This is because they have
an established relationship with Services Australia via:

-   Pharmacy Approval process
-   various Government Guild Incentive Programs

In some instances, however, a pharmacy may need to register.

full details on how to register a pharmacy as an organisation in the
Healthcare Identifiers (HI) Service.

Known customer and EOI

A known customer does not need to provide evidence of identity (EOI)
again. Verification that the applicant is a known customer confirms that
the individual has previously supplied Services Australia with 100
points of identity.

The Resources page contains information about Approval and ID numbers,
and when a Responsible Officer (RO) requires evidence of identity (EOI)
to act on behalf of an organisation.
