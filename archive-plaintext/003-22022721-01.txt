This is a Family and Domestic Violence Interaction Point. If the
customer is with another person, on speaker phone, or already identified
with family and domestic violence concerns, continue with the current
business conversation. Otherwise, go to the Family and domestic violence
procedure to conduct the risk identification and referral process.

If a customer calls to check the progress of a claim lodged yesterday or
today, tell them:
‘Services Australia is experiencing high demand due to the current
natural disasters. All claims are being assessed as soon as possible.
You will be notified through your myGov account or via mail when your
claim has been finalised.’
If their claim was lodged earlier than yesterday, see Processing AGDRP
and NZ DRP claims in Process Direct to finalise the claim (grant or
reject) where possible.

Due to the sensitivities of the current flood events, when talking to
customers, do not use the term rejection. Use the term ineligible.
For example, “After assessing your claim we have found it does not meet
the conditions of the payment and therefore your claim outcome is
ineligible.”

Check the dates a customer was adversely affected by the major disaster
(AGDRP or NZ DRP) or suffered an income loss as a direct result of the
major disaster (DRA or NZ DRA) to determine the event they should claim
under. Customers may be eligible to claim under the Queensland Floods -
January 2022 and this event, depending on dates they were impacted and
the local government area (LGA) they are claiming. See the start and end
dates and declared LGAs in Queensland Floods - January 2022 and this
procedure. For help, contact Technical Peer Support (TPS).

All DRA and NZ DRA claims that do not meet the eligibility criteria can
be rejected. See Rejecting claims for DRA and NZ DRA only.

All AGDRP and NZ DRP claims that do not meet the eligibility criteria
can be rejected. See Rejecting claims for AGDRP and NZ DRP only.

Debt pause provisions are in place for customers in Local Government
Areas (LGAs), see Debt pause for customers in locations affected by a
disaster event in 2022.

Floods – February 2022.

Automation of ineligible claims – AGDRP only

From 10 April 2022, the system will automatically assess and finalise
ineligible AGDRP claims where specified business rules are met and the
customer:

is not residentially qualified (NRQ)

-   The customer does not meet the residence requirements for AGDRP

does not live in Queensland (the qualifying area, NQL) and

-   they have not been seriously injured
-   a dependent child has not been seriously injured, or
-   an immediate family member has not died or is missing as a direct
    result of the major disaster

Note: automation of ineligible claims does not apply to NZ DRP, DRA or
NZ DRA

Rejecting claims - AGDRP and NZ DRP only

AGDRP and NZ DRP - all claims can be rejected.

Due to the sensitivities of the current flood events, when talking to
customers, do not use the term rejection. Use the term ineligible.
For example, “After assessing your claim we have found it does not meet
the conditions of the payment and therefore your claim outcome is
ineligible.”

Contacting customers before rejecting a claim

While all claims can now be rejected, the need to make genuine
attempt(s) to contact a customer is based on the:

-   LGA, and
-   claim reason

For the number of contact attempts needed before rejecting a claim, see
the Process page.

A specialist team will be allocated claims where 2 genuine attempts to
contact a customer are needed. For staff outside the specialist team,
see Step 7 in the Assess and finalise claim table for how to allocate
these claims to the correct team to action

Before rejecting a claim, staff must check the claim and any DOC on the
customer’s record to make sure the customer is not eligible. Staff must
determine if the claim should be granted or rejected.

To reject a claim, see the Assess and finalise claim table in Processing
AGDRP and NZ DRP claims in Process Direct.

Rejecting claims - DRA and NZ DRA only

From 12 April 2022, that all DRA and NZ DRA claims for this event that
do not meet eligibility criteria can be rejected.

Due to the sensitivities of the current flood events, when talking to
customers, do not use the term rejection. Use the term ineligible.
For example, “After assessing your claim we have found it does not meet
the conditions of the payment and therefore your claim outcome is
ineligible.”

Before rejecting a claim, staff must check the claim and any DOC on the
customer’s record to make sure the customer is not eligible. Staff must
decide if the claim should be granted or rejected.

Staff must consider if:

the reason the claim was placed on hold pending rejection

the customer has

claimed the incorrect event

-   for example, DRA instead of NZ DRA

any change to the list of declared LGAs has now made this claim eligible

the claim can be assessed on the details provided by the customer in the
claim

-   that is, if claim was held pending evidence there may be sufficient
    detail in the claim to grant the payment

a Request for Information (RFI) has been issued for information such as
Tax File Number (for DRA) or evidence of participation in Australian Tax
System (for NZ DRA)

Contacting customers before rejecting a claim

All DRA and NZ DRA claims must have 2 genuine attempt(s) to contact the
customer before rejecting the claim. Record the outcome of each contact
attempt in a DOC.

If contact with customer is successful and claim is to be rejected:

discuss the option of other Income Support Payment (ISP) (such as
JobSeeker Payment or Parenting Payment) - noting that customers who
claimed NZ DRA will have limited ISP options because of residency

-   provide details about income and asset tests for ISP (including
    partner income for customers who are partnered and parental income
    for customers under 22)
-   if the customer wants to test eligibility for ISP refer them to the
    appropriate Online Claim process

document any discussion about potential ISP claim and that customer was
advised to make an Online Claim

To reject a claim for:

-   DRA, see the Assess and finalise claim table in Processing DRA in
    Process Direct
-   NZ DRA, see the Rejecting claims in Customer First in Processing DRA
    and NZ DRA in Customer First

Extra help with the cost of child care

Additional Child Care Subsidy (ACCS) (Temporary Financial Hardship) may
be paid if the customer or their partner is affected by the declared
disaster.

If the customer wants to apply for ACCS, warm transfer the customer to
the Family and Parenting (FAO) phone queue using Services Australia
Workspace.

Circumstances (CrP-EXO) if AGDRP, NZ DRP, DRA or NZ DRA is available for
the same circumstance, unless:

-   the claim was lodged before the Australian Government made a
    determination under the Social Security Act 1991 this major disaster
    occurred, and
