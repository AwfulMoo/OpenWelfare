This document outlines the different functions performed by Centrelink’s
Service Profiling.

Function

The Service Profiling Capability operates on Centrelink’s computer
system and:

-   checks the customer's circumstances and applies the appropriate
    Predictors
-   assigns a Service Profile or Profiles and a rating of High, Medium
    or Low based on the level of service required by the customer
-   determines the Service Strategy which targets the service or
    assistance required by the customer to achieve the best results
-   advises specific actions/checks that should be performed, based on
    the customer's Service Profile. This information is readily
    available for viewing. The customer’s Service Profile is used to
    manage the customer contacts
