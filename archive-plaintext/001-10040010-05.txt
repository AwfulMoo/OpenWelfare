|                                   | identifies the provider sent out  |

|                                   | As all evidence suggests that had |
|                                   | the incident date been correct,   |
|                                   | the failure would have been       |
|                                   | valid. Penny amends the incident  |
|                                   | date and ensures the decision     |
|                                   | includes documentation about the  |

|                                   | date was amended.                 |

|                                   | Similar to this scenario, it is   |
|                                   | appropriate to amend a failure    |

|                                   | failure has occurred and the      |
|                                   | provider has used the date the    |

|                                   | rather than the date of           |

|                                   | had intended to report the        |

| 1                                 | UNPP not applicable as work       |
|                                   | deemed unsuitable                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | John has worked in an 'adult'     |
|                                   | shop for a period of 8 months and |
|                                   | has recently been asked to        |
|                                   | undertake tasks that have made    |
|                                   | John feel uncomfortable. John has |
|                                   | now voluntarily left this         |
|                                   | employment. Despite John working  |
|                                   | there for a reasonable period of  |
|                                   | time, if the work (or recent      |
|                                   | changes in role) would not be     |
|                                   | considered reasonable in the      |
|                                   | first place (that is, determined  |
|                                   | unsuitable according to the       |
|                                   | 'unsuitable' work guidelines) no  |
|                                   | UNPP is applicable for the        |
|                                   | voluntary unemployment.           |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 2                                 | UNPP not applicable due to wage   |
|                                   | below the minimum statutory       |
|                                   | standard                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Janelle has been working in a     |
|                                   | market garden for 2 years and has |
|                                   | voluntarily left the employment   |
|                                   | due to being underpaid for some   |
|                                   | time. Upon the investigation of a |
|                                   | UNPP, it is discovered Janelle    |
|                                   | was being paid $8.50 per hour,    |
|                                   | which was determined to be below  |
|                                   | the minimum statutory standard    |
|                                   | for this type of employment. The  |
|                                   | employment is not regarded as     |
|                                   | suitable and therefore no UNPP    |
|                                   | has occurred.                     |
