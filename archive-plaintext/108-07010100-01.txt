This document outlines the assessment and coding of leave and
termination payments paid by an employer. Income tested Services
Australia payments may be affected by leave payments received while
still employed, or by accrued leave payments and termination payments
received upon cessation of employment. Treatment depends on the payment
type and whether the employment to which the payment relates is ongoing
or terminated.

Treatment of leave and termination payments

Leave and termination payments paid by an employer for a period
beginning before 20 September 2009 or advised before 19 April 2010 are
assessed differently.

Leave and termination payments received by an Interim Farm Household
Allowance or Farm Household Allowance (FHA) customer or their partner
are to be treated and coded as if the person had been getting JobSeeker
Payment (JSP).

If a customer’s assets change as a result of receiving a leave or
termination payment, assets should be updated. See Coding income and
assets for Centrelink payments and services.

Assessment of leave depends on whether the employment to which the leave
payment relates is ongoing or terminated.

See Process for information on the assessment of:

-   Leave payments for a temporary absence from employment
-   Paid out leave entitlements
-   Purchased leave
-   Rostered days off/flex time
-   Stand down payments for non-teaching support staff employed by NSW
    Department of Education
-   Termination payments/redundancy

Types of leave and redundancy payments

Leave and redundancy payments can include:

-   Annual leave
-   Sick leave
-   Personal leave
-   Carer leave
-   Ancillary and Defence leave (paid for absences such as for
    Australian Defence Force, Emergency Leave, eligible Community
    Service and Jury Service)
-   Long service leave
-   Leave loading
-   Maternity or paternity leave
-   Rostered days off paid out after termination
-   Redundancy payment
-   Payment in lieu of notice
-   Gratuity or ‘Golden handshake’
-   Other payments received on termination of employment

Termination or leave payments from supported employment

Termination or leave payments received by customers through supported
employment including Australian Disability Enterprise, the Support Wage
System or another program of support, are assessed the same as leave or
termination payments received from open employment.

Considerations for different payments and concessions

ABSTUDY

For ABSTUDY customers, who receive a leave or termination payment from
an employer, these payments are not Income Maintenance Period (IMP)
affected.

Mobility Allowance

A customer receiving paid leave is considered employed for Mobility
Allowance (MOB) purposes during the period of leave.

Pension Bonus Scheme

If the customer or their partner is registered for the Pension Bonus
Scheme (PBS), the leave may affect their entitlement to the Pension
Bonus. Refer the case to a Service Support Officer (SSO) to consider if
entitlement to the Pension Bonus is likely to be affected. If so, a
Financial Information Service (FIS) referral is required.

Low Income Health Care Card

LIC customers are not subject to an Income Maintenance Period (IMP). The
treatment of lump sum leave and redundancy payments for LIC is different
to the way such payments are treated for income support payments. See
LIC income test for more information.

Effects on Working Credit and the Work Bonus

Working Credit allows certain income support recipients of workforce age
to offset income from employment against credits accrued during periods
of low or no income.

The Work Bonus is a discount applicable to the assessment of eligible
income earned by pensioners over Age Pension age. On 1 July 2019,
eligible income was extended to include self-employment income from
personal exertion. Work Bonus does not apply to Parenting Payment Single
(PPS) customers who are Age Pension age.

The Work Bonus or a Working Credit balance cannot reduce income assessed
under an Income Maintenance Period.

For students and Australian Apprentices, income bank can be offset
against income from paid leave.

Casual employees

If a customer is working casually, they are not entitled to leave
payment/loading.

The customer may receive a loading as part of their ordinary pay in lieu
of holidays or sick leave. This loading is included in their hourly rate
of pay and assessed as employment income. This loading is coded with all
other employment income.

The Resources page contains examples of coding leave payments.
