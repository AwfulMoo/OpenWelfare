|                                   | died 2 weeks ago.                 |

|                                   | Fern was issued LBP of $3,000     |

|                                   | calculator showed that Fern's PBV |
|                                   | entitlement would be $2,900. The  |
|                                   | Q150 letter was sent to Fern, but |
|                                   | did not include an invitation to  |

|                                   | 3 weeks later Fern advised Fern   |
|                                   | wanted to claim PBV, as they were |
|                                   | pregnant.                         |

|                                   | The bereavement calculator showed |
|                                   | that Fern's PBV entitlement would |
|                                   | be $2,900, based on Fern being 27 |
|                                   | weeks pregnant when Peter died.   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Fern was advised that Fern's PBV  |
|                                   | entitlement would be less than    |
|                                   | the LBP received. If Fern decided |
|                                   | they still wanted to receive PBV, |
|                                   | Fern would have a $100 debt       |
|                                   | raised for the LBP, as the offset |
|                                   | of the PBV amount would be        |
|                                   | insufficient to cover the LBP.    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The OOP screen would show the LBP |
|                                   | amount of $3,000 as deleted and   |
|                                   | replaced by the PBV amount of     |
|                                   | $2,900.                           |

|                                   | Miranda is now entitled to PBV of |

|                                   | referred for priority processing. |

|                                   | David's DSP is rejected, so PBV   |
|                                   | of $2,500 is paid.                |

|                                   | David appeals the rejection. The  |

|                                   | subsequently granted. David is    |

|                                   | which needs to be issued          |

|                                   | amount, so is raised as a debt.   |
|                                   | There is no automatic offsetting  |
|                                   | of the LBP by the PBV.            |
