This document outlines the required processes for managing identifiers
listed on the Manual identity verification for Provider Digital Access
form (HW080) form and Provider Digital Access (PRODA) flagged
identifiers for Healthcare providers and administrators.

HW080 listed identifiers

The user can list Medicare identifier/s to be added to their PRODA
account as part of the HW080 form. See the Process page, Service
Officers - processing identifiers from the HW080 form table for how to
add the identifiers to the user's PRODA account. They will not have full
access to the service they want to link to until their identifiers have
been linked.

Flagged identifiers

If a user has not been able to link an identifier to their PRODA
account, they can flag the identifier for assistance.

They will not have full access to the service they are trying to link to
until the flagged identifier has been assessed.

Flagged identifiers are automatically escalated to Tier 3 for
processing.

The Resources page contains contact details for Provider Digital Access
(PRODA)
