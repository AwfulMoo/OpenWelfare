This page contains information about processing derived income for Child
Support customers.

Note: adding an income auto saves all eligibility information ‘I’ and
warning ‘W’ changes, however the eligibility window is not visible in
the income window.

Before adding manual income, Service Officers must check the eligibility
window for accuracy. Review the assessment includes total number of
children / relevant dependents in the calculation, complete and
uncorrupted care records for all of the children / relevant dependents,
reverse case has applied correctly with aligned CSPs and estimates.

If unable to resolve any ‘I’, ‘W’ or ‘E’ or the assessment or reverse
case is not correct, do not add the derived income. Resolve the issues
first, if required seek peer support or advice from a Service Support
Officer (SSO).
