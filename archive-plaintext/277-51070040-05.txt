Scenarios - Applying the MAT in ACP cases

Table 1: This table provides guidance on how the Maintenance Action Test
(MAT) should be applied in artificial conception procedure (ACP) cases,
depending on whether the ACP was through a medical clinic or
professional or self-administered.

|                                   | generally, there is no other      |

|                                   | of whether the donor is known or  |
|                                   | unknown. The decision maker       |
|                                   | should confirm that no other      |
|                                   | parent is named on the child's    |
|                                   | birth certificate. If there is no |
|                                   | other parent named on the birth   |
|                                   | certificate, the parent would not |

|                                   | maintenance action to receive     |
|                                   | more than the base rate of FTB    |
|                                   | Part A for the child. The MAT     |
|                                   | code IVF should be coded in these |

| 1                                 | Surrogacy arrangement             |

|                                   | Julie forms a de facto            |
|                                   | relationship with Susan. During   |
|                                   | the relationship Julie and Susan  |
|                                   | enter into a (non-commercial)     |
|                                   | surrogacy arrangement with        |
|                                   | Theresa, whereby Theresa will     |
|                                   | become pregnant using gametes     |
|                                   | from Susan and gametes from a     |
|                                   | donor. The arrangement takes      |
|                                   | place and Theresa gives birth to  |
|                                   | John.                             |

|                                   | child as Julie and Susan. The     |
|                                   | child is then deemed to be a      |
|                                   | child of both Julie and Susan - a |
|                                   | child of the current              |
|                                   | relationship. Action to obtain    |
|                                   | child support for John is not     |
|                                   | appropriate.                      |

|                                   | If in the future Julie and Susan  |
|                                   | separate, the custodial parent of |
|                                   | John would be required to take    |
|                                   | reasonable steps to obtain child  |
|                                   | support from the other parent to  |
|                                   | receive more than the base rate   |

Approved Q999 letter text

Approved Q999 letter text - IVF assessment, customer is required to obtain child support

A decision has been made that (you need/your partner needs) to take
reasonable action to obtain child support for (affected child name/s) to
continue to receive more than the minimum rate of Family Tax Benefit
Part A.

Choose option:

This is because the birth certificate provided shows that (affected
child name/s) has two legal parents.

Or

This is because we have not received a document or a receipt indicating
the procedure was undertaken by a medical professional or medical
clinic. You should also provide a copy of a birth certificate if you
haven't already done so.

What (you need/your partner needs) to do

If (you are/your partner is) already receiving child support in the form
of regular cash or lump sum payments, for example, mortgage payments,
household expenses or school fees, you will still need to apply for a
child support assessment.

You also need to call us on 136 150 so we can let you know how this may
affect your Family Tax Benefit.

If there is a reason that makes it difficult for (you/your partner) to
apply for a child support assessment for (affected child name/s), please
call 136 150 so we can discuss your options.

If you would like to speak to us in a language other than English,
please call 131 202.
