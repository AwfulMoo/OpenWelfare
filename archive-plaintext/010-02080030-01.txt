This document outlines under what conditions ABSTUDY can be paid for
students being taught at home. Some families choose to teach their
children themselves at home rather than have them undertake formal
study. Formal study is undertaken when attending a school or enrolling
for distance education.

Conditions for ABSTUDY to be paid for home schooling

ABSTUDY may be paid for home schooling for secondary students if certain
conditions are met. These conditions are that the relevant
State/Territory Government school education authority:

-   has given specific, individual approval for the home study,
-   confirms that the study is full-time and conforms with the secondary
    qualification accredited by that authority, and
-   confirms that the study will be counted towards the secondary
    qualification accredited by that authority

If there is no education authority approval, ABSTUDY may still be
approved for home schooling only if the student is:

-   formally registered at an approved secondary school
-   studying accredited subjects, and
-   undertaking a full-time workload

Proof that these requirements are being met would have to be provided by
the secondary school. They would provide a letter confirming enrolment,
the subjects being undertaken and the workload.

ABSTUDY will usually only be paid where the student is studying an
accredited course at an approved institution. It is not intended to be
paid to families who have chosen, without considering the educational
requirements of their child, to withdraw from formal schooling.

The Resources page contains a table detailing home schooling
arrangements for States/Territories, -Home schooling arrangements for
ABSTUDY.
