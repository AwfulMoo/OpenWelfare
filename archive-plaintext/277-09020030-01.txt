This document outlines the process for managing a Level 2 complaint.

Level 2 complaint

Most Level 2 complaints are escalated Level 1 complaints. A Level 2
complaint should be finalised within 10 working days of receipt.

Difference between a general enquiry and a complaint

Consider the following criteria to assess whether a customer is making a
general enquiry or a complaint:

-   the manner in which the customer communicates or expresses the
    issues
-   the urgency of the issues raised
-   the potential or actual impact of the identified issues on the
    customer
-   prior or ongoing attempts at resolution through regular business
    processes

General enquiries are contacts from customers requesting information or
advice, where the customer is not intending to make a complaint,
compliment or suggestion. Some examples of general enquiries may include
when a customer:

-   is not happy with a decision and wants to know their review rights
-   wants to know about a payment date or amount
-   requires assistance with completing a transaction online
-   seeks advice about collection options or the progress of an
    objection or Change of Assessment decision

Difference between an objection and a complaint

A complaint is not a review of the technical correctness of a decision.
Customers need to pursue their review rights through the relevant
channels such as objection or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT).
