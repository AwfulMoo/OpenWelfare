This is a Family and Domestic Violence Interaction Point. If the
customer is with another person, on speaker phone, or already identified
with family and domestic violence concerns, continue with the current
business conversation. Otherwise, go to the Family and domestic violence
procedure to conduct the risk identification and referral process.

This document explains eligibility criteria, appropriate evidence (if
needed) and escalations for Australian Government Disaster Recovery
Payment (AGDRP) and DRP for New Zealand non-protected Special Category
(subclass 444) visa holders (NZ DRP).

AGDRP eligibility

To receive AGDRP, a customer must meet the following criteria on any day
of the major disaster:

-   at least 16 years old, or
-   under 16 and getting a social security payment (see ‘social security
    payment’ in Definitions), and
-   adversely affected by a major disaster

Note: this means:

-   customers at least 16 years old do not need to be getting a social
    security payment to meet this eligibility criteria
-   only customers aged under 16 must be getting a social security
    payment to meet this eligibility criteria

They must also meet at least one of the following:

an Australian resident (through legal permanent residence and residing
in Australia)

-   to check if a visa is a permanent visa, see the References page for
    a link to the Social Security Guide, Chapter 9.2, Visa subclasses
    and payment eligibility for visas issued after 1/9/1994, or

the holder of a specified visa for AGDRP and DRA, or

getting a social security payment (see ‘social security payment’ in
Definitions), or

an Australian citizen who is not an Australian resident but can qualify
under a ministerial determination

Note: a customer does not need to be in Australia at the time of making
their AGDRP claim.

NZ DRP eligibility

To receive NZ DRP, a customer must meet all the following criteria on
any day of the major disaster:

-   at least 16 years old, or under 16 and getting a social security
    payment
-   a New Zealand non-protected Special Category Visa (SCV) subclass 444
    holder (not an Australian Resident under the Social Security
    Act 1991) who is living in Australia
-   participated in the Australian tax system for at least one year in
    the past 3 financial years, or before the ‘next 12 months’ date in
    NZ DRP tax participation in the Background page of the Operational
    Blueprint for the event, and
-   adversely affected by a major disaster in Australia

Note:

-   To find the Operational Blueprint for the event, see Current
    emergency management events and select Natural Disasters
-   For ‘participation in the Australian tax system,’ see Table 1 Step 6

A customer can also claim as the primary claimant on behalf of a
secondary claimant. The secondary claimant must:

-   have been adversely affected by the major disaster, and
-   not be eligible for NZ DRP or AGDRP for the major disaster

Note: a customer does not need to be in Australia at the time of making
their NZ DRP claim.

Unsuccessful claims

Claims that do not meet the eligibility criteria can only be rejected
once formal approval is given to reject claims for the event.

Approval is given via staff communication channels and the Operational
Blueprint for the event.

Note: to find the Operational Blueprint for the event, see Current
emergency management events and select Natural Disasters.

Review and appeal process

AGDRP claims

If a customer has asked for a review of an AGDRP decision, see Request
for an explanation or application for a formal review.

NZ DRP claims

If a customer does not agree with:

-   a NZ DRP decision, they can ask for the decision to be reviewed by a
    Subject Matter Expert (SME)
-   a SME review, they can ask for an Authorised Review Officer (ARO) to
    review the decision
-   an ARO decision, they can appeal the decision within 4 weeks of the
    ARO decision

NZ DRP claims cannot be referred to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal
(AAT). If a customer wants to appeal an ARO’s decision, escalate the
claim to the Level 2 Helpdesk.

How to refer a claim for review

Run the Internal Review/Explanation script:

select the correct payment type and emergency event:

-   AGDRP - select Aust Govt Disaster Rcvr Pymt
-   NZ DRP - select Ex-gratia One Off Pymt

transfer the appeal activity to EPT

If a customer requests an explanation of a decision, a SME or suitably
skilled officer will:

-   investigate the decision
-   correct any identified errors
-   undertake any reassessment, and
-   (if the customer is not on the phone), contact the customer to
    explain the decision
