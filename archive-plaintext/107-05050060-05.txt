|                                   | Tom has a wage garnishee for a    |
|                                   | debt of $6,500. The debt was      |
|                                   | recently reduced from $6,500 to   |
|                                   | $3,500 after Tom provided new     |
|                                   | information.                      |

|                                   | A DMNMFU activity is created to   |
|                                   | vary the garnishee notice amount. |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The initial garnishee notice      |
|                                   | amount was for $6,000, as Tom had |
|                                   | repaid $500.                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A total of $800 has been received |
|                                   | from Tom's employer. This reduces |
|                                   | the balance to $5,200.            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | When Tom's debt was reduced, the  |
|                                   | balance also reduced to $2,200    |
|                                   | ($3,500 - $500 - $800).           |

|                                   | As the debt amount has been       |
|                                   | reduced, Tom's employer needs to  |
|                                   | remit $3,000 instead of $6,000.   |
|                                   | (New debt amount of $3,500 minus  |
|                                   | $500 already paid).               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Tom's employer gets a Q613 letter |
|                                   | with an amended notice amount of  |
|                                   | $3,000. This includes $800        |
|                                   | already remitted.                 |

|                                   | The new notice amount is the new  |
|                                   | total amount (for example         |
|                                   | $3,000), not the outstanding      |

|                                   | the employer, would only remit a  |

|                                   | $30 per week.                     |

|                                   | still needs to complete a         |
|                                   | financial circumstances           |

|                                   | week. Lucy advises Adrian that    |

|                                   | reduced to $40 per week (two      |

|                                   | accepts this offer.               |
