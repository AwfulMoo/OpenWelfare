Consideration of distance - assessment of constant care for CP

Information and examples on determining if constant care is being
provided when the care and care receiver are not living together

Note: consider each case based on the circumstances. The distances below
are a guide only. The assessment of constant care does not apply to CP
(XWP). Care requirements for these carers only apply to CA.

Factors to consider when assessing constant care for CP when the carer and care receiver live together in more than 1 private residence

Note: consider each case based on the circumstances. The below factors
are a guide only. The assessment of constant care does not apply to CP
(XWP). Care requirements for these carers only apply to CA.

It is possible that the carer and care receiver are living together in 2
homes. This usually occurs when they are related, own their respective
homes, the homes are a significant distance apart and they stay at each
other’s home regularly and for a reasonable time. Often the carer has a
partner or children and this prevents them from leaving their home on
permanently.

-   How far apart are the homes and how long does it take to travel
    between them?
-   How long do they spend at each home and how often?
-   When did this start and why?
-   Is it intended to continue?
-   What activities of daily living do the carer and care receiver do
    when they stay at each home, for example eat, sleep or shower?
-   Are there any activities which either party only does at 1 of the
    homes, for example laundry?
-   Does either party keep some of their possessions at both homes all
    the time or do they only take some possessions with them temporarily
    while they are at 1 of the homes, for example clothes, toiletries,
    reading material, items related to hobbies?
-   Is there any equipment used as part of the caring which is only at 1
    of the homes? Why?

If there is a significant distance between the 2 homes and it would not
be reasonable for either the carer or the care receiver to travel
between the 2 homes each day and they stay at each home for a reasonable
time on an ongoing basis, it would usually be accepted that care is
being provided in 2 homes.

It is not possible to define reasonable time, but it would need to
support the claim that the carer or care receiver is living in that
home.
