|                                   | In Ireland, national legislation  |
|                                   | requires the compulsory payment   |
|                                   | of social security contributions, |
|                                   | usually through deductions from   |
|                                   | paid employment. Social security  |

|                                   | retirement age. There are         |
|                                   | non-contributory benefits for     |
