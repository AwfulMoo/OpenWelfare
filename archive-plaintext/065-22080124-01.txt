This document outlines the respective aged care roles of Services
Australia and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA). It also
outlines the process for resolving DVA customer related aged care
enquiries, including where there is insufficient information available
to resolve an enquiry.

Departments’ responsibilities

DVA is responsible for administering aged care for veterans. This
includes undertaking the initial means assessment for aged care
recipients in receipt of a DVA means tested income support payment, or
who have qualifying service. DVA administer a variety of support
programmes for a range of veterans in the community, home and
residential aged care settings.

Services Australia is responsible for paying subsidies and supplements
to aged care providers for all care types on behalf of the Department of
Health and Aged Care and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA).

Once DVA completes the initial means assessment, Services Australia is
responsible for fee determination, ongoing correspondence and
adjustments, including:

data management across all Services Australia aged care systems

calculating fees and producing letters

income and means assessments and enquiries for care recipients where DVA
is not responsible for the means assessment

hardship assessment and enquiries for all care recipients, including
those DVA is responsible for

reviews including ad hoc, departure and quarterly review

refund calculations

provider queries

care recipients who were discharged from care and a manual means
assessment is required as they:

-   did not have a means assessment completed prior to discharge
-   require a correction of an existing means assessment after they have
    been discharged from care
-   are now deceased and the executor is requesting a manual means
    assessment in order to finalise the care recipient’s estate
