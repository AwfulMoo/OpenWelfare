This document outlines information for Service Officers who are
responsible for coding a claim, or a review of the away from home rate
for dependent ABSTUDY customers.

Applying for the away from home rate

ABSTUDY claimants can apply for away from home rate in the initial claim
by:

-   using the ABSTUDY Claiming Tool (secondary students only)
-   online claim (tertiary students and Australian Apprentices only)
-   Assisted Customer Claim (ACC) (tertiary students and Australian
    Apprentices only), or
-   completing the Claim for ABSTUDY (SY019)

Customers can also apply for the away from home rate while in receipt of

Secondary students impacted by COVID-19

During the COVID-19 pandemic which occurred in Australia from March
2020, some boarding providers closed and others had reduced capacity due
to social distancing requirements within the board facility.
Additionally, some students may not be able to return to their board
arrangements. Students impacted by COVID-19 in Term 2, 3 or 4 of 2020 or
Term 3 or 4 of 2021 or Term 1 or 2 of 2022 may continue to be entitled
to the away from home rate.

Continuing students

Students remain entitled to the away from home rate in Term 2, 3 or 4 of
2020 or Term 3 or 4 of 2021 or Term 1 or 2 of 2022 if:

-   they were approved for boarding entitlements in the term immediately
    prior
-   their board provider holds a boarding place for them
-   the student intends to return to board as soon as possible, and
-   the school/board provider continues to support the student study
    remotely using other methods, such as online

Continuing students who changed board providers

Entitlement to the away from home rate for continuing students who
commenced with a new board provider in Term 2, 3 or 4 of 2020 or Term 3
or 4 of 2021 or Term 1 or 2 of 2022 was dependant on their study mode
and enrolment or acceptance date.

Continuing students who have changed board providers before the first
day of the relevant term, remain eligible for the away from home rate
where:

-   they were approved for boarding entitlements in the term immediately
    prior to the impacted term
-   their board provider holds a boarding place for them in the impacted
    term
-   the student intends to return to board as soon as possible, and
-   the school/board provider continues to support the student study
    remotely using other methods, such as online

Students who changed board providers after the first day of the relevant
term, were only be eligible once they physically present at the new
boarding provider.

There is no change for students who continued to board and study in
person.

New Claims

For ABSTUDY boarding claims granted from 1 April 2020, a student will be
entitled to the away from home rate in Term 2 if they were:

-   accepted to board before the end of Term 1 and will study either in
    person or online during Term 2, or
-   accepted to board after the start of Term 2 and will physically
    attend at the boarding provider during Term 2

For new ABSTUDY boarding claims, a student will only qualify for the
away from home rate in Term 3 or 4 of 2021 or Term 1 or 2 of 2022, if
the student's enrolment was finalised before the first day of the
relevant term and:

-   the student satisfies eligibility criteria for Away From Home
    entitlements
-   the student remains enrolled/registered for the same boarding
    arrangement during the relevant term
-   their board provider held a boarding place for them
-   the student intended to commence the boarding arrangements as soon
    as possible
-   the school/board provider continued to support the student study
    remotely using other methods, such as online

Where students with new claims were entitled to the away from home rate,
claims should be assessed as per Assessing a claim for ABSTUDY Schooling
B Award, Tertiary Award and Masters and Doctorate Award.

For all other ABSTUDY boarding claims, a student will only qualify for
the away from home rate once the students physically attends the
boarding provider.

There was no change for students who continued to board and study in
person.

Tertiary students impacted by COVID-19

During the COVID-19 pandemic, which occurred in Australia from March
2020, some students were required to leave their on campus term
accommodation. Many students also transitioned to online study as
face-to-face teaching was unavailable.

Students who were receiving the away from home rate, and temporarily
transitioned to online learning as a result of COVID-19 remain eligible
for the away from home rate. Tertiary students must return to
face-to-face study as soon as it becomes available to continue to be
eligible for the away from home rate.

Where a student had to move out of education provider accommodation
(such as on campus) and are, or were temporarily staying with their
parents, they will remain eligible for the away from home rate providing
they:

-   remain enrolled in their course of study, and
-   intend to return to their campus accommodation as soon as the
    education provider allows them to return

This includes students who:

-   had their accommodation arrangement cancelled by the education
    provider and have moved their belongings out of that accommodation
-   were approved for Residential Cost Option (RCO)

Note: the away from home rate of ABSTUDY Living Allowance can be paid
for any period that the education provider does not charge a residential
fee, rather than the reduced rate of Living Allowance.

Coding requirements

The payment of away from home rate needs to be recorded on the
customer's Services Australia record including:

-   the criteria for away from home rate approval
-   the customer's living arrangements
-   the payee
-   any board and school fee charges

If all of these are correctly recorded on the customer's record, the
correct rate of payment and correct payee will result. The full
assessment and coding for ABSTUDY entitlements is covered separately.

Secondary, secondary non-schooling and tertiary students

The coding required for a secondary school student varies slightly in
respect of students boarding at hostels, boarding schools, or in an
approved ABSTUDY Homestay arrangement, and students boarding privately.
Some coding specific to tertiary, secondary non-schooling students and
Australian Apprentices is also different to secondary school students.
This reflects key entitlement differences between secondary, secondary
non-schooling and tertiary students, with additional allowances
available to secondary students.

Note: ABSTUDY secondary school students approved for the away from home
rate are entitled to receive the full package of away from home
allowances for the full period of eligibility for away from home rate.
This differs from ABSTUDY tertiary, secondary non-schooling students and
Australian Apprentices, and particular coding is needed to ensure full
entitlement is paid.

Claim lodged for the purpose of attending an interview

Orientation and Special Purpose Visit travel is available if:

-   a secondary school or boarding facility requires prospective
    students to attend interviews or other selection procedures prior to
    acceptance
-   the student is intending to study in an approved tertiary course of
    at least one year's duration at the study location, and has
    completed secondary studies in the previous year

In order to claim this type of travel, a full ABSTUDY assessment needs
to be made for the period the student is intending to study.

A secondary boarding facility may need to conduct an interview or
selection process in their own right and it may not be possible at the
time of claiming to confirm the school they are attending. The Process
page contains special coding instructions for these cases.

Relocation Scholarships

Dependent students living away from home studying an approved
scholarship course may also be qualified to receive Relocation
Scholarship, see Relocation Scholarship (RS) eligibility.

Note: ABSTUDY Students in state care (not receiving Foster Care
Allowance) are to be assessed the same way as ABSTUDY dependent students
who are living away from home for the purposes of Relocation
Scholarship.

The Resources page contains scenarios illustrating how the system
calculates whether a customer has an entitlement to receive a top-up
from the School Fees Allowance (SFA) (Group 2) towards boarding
expenses.
