This document outlines information for Service Officers creating or
re-establishing a link between the carer and care receiver, as part of a
review process for Carer Payment (CP) where the link has been broken.

Creating CP links where the carer link has been broken

CP links are generally established at grant, and are needed to link
information between the carer’s and care receiver’s records. These links
also ensure reviews of CP and Carer Allowance (CA) are processed at the
same time if the carer is receiving both payments. When CP is reviewed,
it may be necessary to check the Link Summary (LS) or Care Receiver
Summary (CRS) screen on the carer's record to see if the current care
receiver's name appears and if a link needs to be re-established. If not
already established, or if the link has been broken and needs to be
re-established, the link must be created by the Service Officer at the
time of the CP review.
