This document explains the Education Tax Refund (ETR) one-off payment
for the 2011-12 financial year and the transition to Schoolkids Bonus.

Transition details

In May 2012, the government announced the abolition of the Education Tax
Refund administered by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).The ETR was
claimed through the ATO for 2010-11 and previous years.

The Education Tax Refund (ETR) payment delivered by Services Australia
was a one-off lump sum payment made to eligible customers for the
2011-12 financial year and was a transitional payment between the ATO
administered ETR and the commencement of Schoolkids Bonus (SKB) from
January 2013.

SKB payments were delivered automatically in January and July to
eligible Family Tax Benefit (FTB) and income support recipients from
2013 to 2016. On 5 September 2014, legislation passed to abolish
Schoolkids Bonus from 31 December 2016.

Types of ETR payments

There were 2 types of ETR payments:

-   ETR Statutory payment was paid automatically to eligible
    parents/guardians who received Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A for
    school aged children and secondary students who received an income
    support payment on 8 May 2012
-   ETR Administrative Scheme payment was paid to FTB Part A and income
    support customers who did not meet the requirements for a statutory
    payment but would have been eligible to claim the ETR through the
    taxation system or would have received a higher rate through the
    taxation system than was paid to them as a statutory payment. These
    payments were delivered from 1 July 2012
