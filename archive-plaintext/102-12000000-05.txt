Date of Effect

Example: A person in weekend detention from Friday night to Sunday
afternoon is only imprisoned for one whole day, that is, Saturday,
because this is the only day that the person is detained from midnight
to midnight. This means that the person's payment should only be
suspended for one day as a result of the detention. See Using the
correct date of effect when raising debts.
