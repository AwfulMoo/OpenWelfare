|                                   | Joe attends an ESAt interview     |
|                                   | after having supplied a medical   |
|                                   | certificate to Services Australia |
|                                   | for a bad back. Joe has a history |
|                                   | (over 18 months) of supplying     |
|                                   | medical certificates on and off   |
|                                   | for this back condition. The      |
|                                   | medical certificate states that   |
|                                   | it is a temporary exacerbation of |
|                                   | a condition likely to persist for |
|                                   | more than 2 years and that the    |
|                                   | symptoms include generalised      |
|                                   | lower back pain, referred pain to |
|                                   | Joe's legs, and an inability to   |
|                                   | sit or stand for more than 10     |
|                                   | minutes.                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Joe gets up and down from the     |
|                                   | chair to stretch and change       |
|                                   | positions regularly throughout    |
|                                   | the assessment. Treatment is      |
|                                   | indicated to be non-steroidal     |
|                                   | anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), |
|                                   | physiotherapy and exercise. Joe   |
|                                   | is also a little overweight. The  |
|                                   | doctor indicates on the           |
|                                   | certificate that Joe cannot       |
|                                   | undertake usual work or study,    |
|                                   | nor can Joe do more than 8 hours  |
|                                   | of work per week.                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Joe tells the Assessor that these |
|                                   | back problems started after a     |
|                                   | fall at work 5 years ago, but in  |
|                                   | the last couple of years, it has  |
|                                   | become worse. Joe says that       |
|                                   | surgery has been suggested,       |
|                                   | however there is just as much     |
|                                   | chance it will do damage as there |
|                                   | is it will improve, so Joe is not |
|                                   | keen to pursue it. Joe says the   |
|                                   | back condition affects            |
|                                   | everything, even when not         |
|                                   | suffering from a 'relapse'.       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Joe's history of medical          |
|                                   | certificates along with a verbal  |
|                                   | history, current medical          |
|                                   | evidence, presentation at         |
|                                   | interview, and indication that    |
|                                   | the only treatment option may not |
|                                   | be effective, means that it is    |
|                                   | likely Joe's situation will       |
|                                   | affect Joe's ability to work into |
|                                   | the future and will in fact       |
|                                   | deteriorate.                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Therefore, an upgrade to a JCA    |
|                                   | and the impact of Joe's condition |
|                                   | assessed against the impairment   |
|                                   | tables would be appropriate. In   |
|                                   | this case, where medical          |
|                                   | certificates are the only         |

|                                   | doctor would be needed.           |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | can be granted, a Disability      |

|                                   | required.                         |

|                                   | Answer: An Assessor should        |
|                                   | upgrade an ESAt to a JCA wherever |
|                                   | possible where the available      |
|                                   | evidence indicates that the       |

|                                   | For an assessment to be upgraded  |
|                                   | to a JCA, the Assessor must       |
|                                   | determine, based on available     |
|                                   | evidence, that the job seeker     |
|                                   | meets the DSP medical             |

|                                   | -   are assessed as either having |
|                                   |     a severe impairment or as     |
|                                   |     having actively participated  |

|                                   | If a submitted ESAt report        |
|                                   | contains sufficient evidence to   |
|                                   | assess the job seeker as meeting  |
|                                   | all medical eligibility criteria  |
|                                   | for DSP and the assessment was    |
|                                   | not upgraded, staff should:       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   review the report to identify |
|                                   |     the reason the Assessor did   |
|                                   |     not upgrade the assessment    |
|                                   | -   contact the Assessor to       |
|                                   |     discuss the reason the        |
|                                   |     assessment was not upgraded   |
|                                   | -   accept or return the report   |

|                                   | Answer: After an upgraded ESAt    |
|                                   | has been submitted, the report is |
|                                   | reviewed and accepted following   |
|                                   | normal procedures. Once the       |
|                                   | report is accepted, the customer  |
|                                   | must be invited to claim          |
|                                   | Disability Support Pension (DSP). |

|                                   | Invite the customer to claim if   |
