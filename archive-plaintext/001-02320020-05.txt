|                                   | Joe attends his ESAt interview    |
|                                   | after having supplied a medical   |
|                                   | certificate to Services Australia |
|                                   | for his bad back. He has a        |
|                                   | history (over 18 months) of       |
|                                   | supplying medical certificates on |
|                                   | and off for his back condition.   |
|                                   | The medical certificate states    |
|                                   | that it is a temporary            |
|                                   | exacerbation of a permanent       |
|                                   | condition and that his symptoms   |
|                                   | include generalised lower back    |
|                                   | pain, referred pain to his legs,  |
|                                   | and an inability to sit or stand  |
|                                   | for more than 10 minutes.         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Joe gets up and down from his     |
|                                   | chair to stretch and change       |
|                                   | positions regularly throughout    |
|                                   | the assessment. Treatment is      |
|                                   | indicated to be non-steroidal     |
|                                   | anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), |
|                                   | physiotherapy and exercise. Joe   |
|                                   | is also a little overweight. The  |
|                                   | doctor indicates on the           |
|                                   | certificate that Joe cannot       |
|                                   | undertake his usual work or       |
|                                   | study, nor can he do more than 8  |
|                                   | hours of work per week.           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Joe tells the Assessor that he    |
|                                   | has had back problems since a     |
|                                   | fall at work 5 years ago, but in  |
|                                   | the last couple of years, it has  |
|                                   | become worse. He says that he     |
|                                   | could have surgery, but there is  |
|                                   | just as much chance it will do    |
|                                   | damage as there is it will        |
|                                   | improve, so he is not keen to     |
|                                   | pursue it. He says that even when |
|                                   | he is not suffering a 'relapse'   |
|                                   | his back affects everything he    |
|                                   | does.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Joe's history of medical          |
|                                   | certificates along with his       |
|                                   | verbal history, his current       |
|                                   | medical evidence, presentation at |
|                                   | interview, and his indication     |
|                                   | that the only treatment option    |
|                                   | may not be effective, means that  |
|                                   | it is likely his situation will   |
|                                   | affect his ability to work into   |
|                                   | the future and will in fact       |
|                                   | deteriorate.                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Therefore, an upgrade to a JCA    |
|                                   | and the impact of his condition   |
|                                   | assessed against the impairment   |
|                                   | tables would be appropriate. In   |
|                                   | this case, where medical          |
|                                   | certificates are the only         |
|                                   | evidence, contact with Joe's      |
|                                   | doctor would be needed.           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Note: before a claim for          |
|                                   | Disability Support Pension (DSP)  |
|                                   | can be granted, a Disability      |
|                                   | Medical Assessment (DMA) will be  |
|                                   | required.                         |

|                                   | Answer: An Assessor should        |
|                                   | upgrade an ESAt to a JCA wherever |
|                                   | possible where the available      |
|                                   | evidence indicates that the       |
|                                   | customer meets medical            |
|                                   | qualification criteria for        |
|                                   | Disability Support Pension (DSP). |

|                                   | For an assessment to be upgraded  |
|                                   | to a JCA, the Assessor must       |
|                                   | determine, based on available     |
|                                   | evidence, that the job seeker     |
|                                   | meets the DSP medical             |
|                                   | qualification requirements, that  |

|                                   |     stabilised (FDTS)             |
|                                   | -   are assessed as having a      |
|                                   |     physical, intellectual or     |

|                                   |     2 years because of their      |
|                                   |     impairment, and               |

|                                   |     in a Program of Support (POS) |

|                                   | If a submitted ESAt report        |
|                                   | contains sufficient evidence to   |
|                                   | assess the job seeker as meeting  |
|                                   | all medical eligibility criteria  |
|                                   | for DSP and the assessment was    |
|                                   | not upgraded, the Service Officer |
|                                   | should:                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   review the report to identify |
|                                   |     the reason the Assessor did   |
|                                   |     not upgrade the assessment    |
|                                   | -   contact the Assessor to       |
|                                   |     discuss the reason the        |
|                                   |     assessment was not upgraded   |
|                                   | -   accept or return the report   |

|                                   | after an upgraded ESAt is         |
|                                   | submitted? + Read more ...        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: After an upgraded ESAt    |
|                                   | has been submitted, the report is |
|                                   | reviewed and accepted following   |
|                                   | normal procedures. Once the       |
|                                   | report is accepted, the customer  |
|                                   | must be invited to claim          |
|                                   | Disability Support Pension (DSP). |
|                                   | The Service Officer should:       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   review the customer record to |
|                                   |     ensure they meet other        |
|                                   |     non-medical DSP eligibility   |
|                                   |     (for example income and       |

|                                   | Service Officer should email the  |
