This document outlines how changes in the age of a customer may have an
effect on the income support payment the customer receives. This may
result in a customer no longer being entitled to the payment they are
receiving or now being entitled to a payment that they were not
previously entitled to due to age disqualification, for example Age
Pension.

Other changes affecting income support payments

Sometimes other changes may need to be made. For example, if the
official date of birth recorded for a customer is incorrect, the
customer must advise Services Australia. For information about the
official date of birth, see Incorrect date of birth recorded.

The Resources page contains a link to the Confirmation of identity page
on the Services Australia website.
