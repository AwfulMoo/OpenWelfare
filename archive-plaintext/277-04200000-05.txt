| Item                              | Example                           |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Example 1 - Debt increases after  |
|                                   | new child is added                |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A case is registered with 2       |
|                                   | children on 1 January. On 1 June  |
|                                   | a third child is added. Debt as   |
|                                   | of 30 June is $3,000.             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Under the simple apportionment    |
|                                   | method, the debt per child would  |
|                                   | be:                               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | $3,000 divided by 3 = $1,000      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Clearly, this would be            |
|                                   | inequitable as the third child    |
|                                   | was not on the case for the same  |
|                                   | length of time as the other 2.    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A more accurate calculation would |
|                                   | be to compare the debt at 30 June |
|                                   | to the debt at 31 May and         |
|                                   | apportion the debt per child as   |
|                                   | follows.                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Debt 31 May $2,400.               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Divide the debt equally between   |
|                                   | children 1 and 2 ($1,200 each).   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The debt for June ($3,000 -       |
|                                   | $2,400) is divided between the 3  |
|                                   | children ($200 each).             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The debts per child is:           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   Child 1: $1,400 ($1,200 +     |
|                                   |     $200)                         |
|                                   | -   Child 2: $1,400 ($1,200 +     |
|                                   |     $200)                         |
|                                   | -   Child 3: $200                 |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 2                                 | Example 2 - Debt reduces after    |
|                                   | new child added - Last in first   |
|                                   | out calculation                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Use the same information as       |
|                                   | Example 1, except that the debt   |
|                                   | at June 30 is $2,000.             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The debt for June would be        |
|                                   | $2,000 - $2,400 which equals a    |
|                                   | negative number. Therefore, it    |
|                                   | could be calculated that there is |
|                                   | no debt for Child 3 because there |
|                                   | was no increase in debt during    |
|                                   | June.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The debts would then be:          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   Child 1: $1,000 (half of      |
|                                   |     $2,000)                       |
|                                   | -   Child 2: $1,000 (half of      |
|                                   |     $2,000)                       |
|                                   | -   Child 3: $0                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This assumes the latest           |
|                                   | liabilities are credited prior to |
|                                   | any arrears component being paid. |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 3                                 | Example 3 - Debt reduces after    |
|                                   | new child added - First in first  |
|                                   | out calculation                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | From Example 1: Debt was $2,400   |
|                                   | as at 31 May.                     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Liability for June was $600.      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Therefore, if the total debt at   |
|                                   | June 30 is $2,000, then the pre   |
|                                   | May 31 arrears would be $1,400    |
|                                   | and the June arrears would be     |
|                                   | $600.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The per-child calculation is:     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   Child 1: $900 (half of $1,400 |
|                                   |     plus $200)                    |
|                                   | -   Child 2: $900 (half of $1,400 |
|                                   |     plus $200)                    |
|                                   | -   Child 3: $200 (one third of   |
|                                   |     $600)                         |

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | What is FTB?                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | FTB is a payment from Centrelink  |
|                                   | to help with the cost of raising  |
|                                   | children. A parent claiming FTB   |
|                                   | can choose to receive fortnightly |
|                                   | payments or a lump sum after the  |
|                                   | end of the financial year. The    |
|                                   | payment is made according to the  |
|                                   | level of care provided for a      |
|                                   | child. For example, FTB can be    |
|                                   | paid to a parent with a child in  |
|                                   | their care for 35% of more of the |
|                                   | time.                             |

|                                   | Support cannot make deductions    |

|                                   | deductions can only be used to    |
|                                   | recover the portion of a          |
|                                   | customer’s child support debt     |
|                                   | that relates to the child or      |
|                                   | children for whom the FTB is      |
|                                   | being paid.                       |

|                                   | For example, if the total debt    |
|                                   | relates equally to 3 children,    |
|                                   | but the customer is only          |
|                                   | receiving FTB for 1 of the        |
|                                   | children, only one third of the   |

| 3                                 | Why can FTB deductions not be     |
|                                   | used for multiple cases?          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If a payer is liable to pay child |
|                                   | support to more than 1 payee, any |
|                                   | amount collected must be          |
|                                   | apportioned between the payees    |
|                                   | according to the apportionment    |
|                                   | rules in section 70 of the        |
|                                   | Registration and Collection Act.  |
|                                   | See the References page for a     |
|                                   | link to the Act.                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This means that a payer’s FTB     |
|                                   | entitlement for 1 child might be  |
|                                   | disbursed to the payee caring for |
|                                   | another child. This would be      |
|                                   | inconsistent with the intention   |
|                                   | that a payer’s FTB entitlement    |
|                                   | for a particular child could be   |
|                                   | applied to the payer’s child      |
|                                   | support debt for that same child. |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The same applies when recovering  |
|                                   | payee overpayments.               |

|                                   | be deducted from their total      |
|                                   | amount of FTB payment - the       |
|                                   | maximum permissible amount.       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Child Support can only deduct up  |
|                                   | to the maximum permissible amount |
|                                   | (the maximum permissible amount   |
|                                   | is defined in the Family          |
|                                   | Assistance Act). See the          |

| 5                                 | Why is a section 120 notice to    |
|                                   | Centrelink (CSU) required?        |

|                                   | deducted - the maximum            |
|                                   | permissible amount. Child Support |
|                                   | can only deduct up to the maximum |
