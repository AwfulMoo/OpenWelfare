This document outlines how customers can use phone self service to
report employment income, changes in circumstances or participation
details.

Report employment income

This service allows customers to:

-   Report details of their (and their partner's) employment income paid
    to them in their reporting period. Note: this does not include
    self-employment income
-   Answer questions about their mutual obligation requirements or
    participation requirements
-   Report changes to their circumstances

When they report they will get a receipt number and the outcome:

-   next payment amount and date of deposit
-   partner's next payment, if they get a payment from the Services
    Australia and they have given the customer permission to see this
    information
-   working credit balance, income bank balance or work bonus balance
-   next reporting date

Once a customer reports using self service, they will no longer be sent
SU19 forms.

Eligibility

Customers must be registered for self service with a status of active.

They must also be eligible to report using self service. Use the Self
Service Access Facility (SSAF) screen to check and update a customer's
eligibility.

Genuine attempts must be made to transition customers to self service
options, unless an Exception applies.

If the customer is not eligible, they will need to call or go to a
service centre to discuss their reporting options.

The Resources page contains a link to the Services Australia Website,
intranet links to Self service IVR problem reporting and Digital Support
Products, and questions and answers.
