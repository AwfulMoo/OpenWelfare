Notifying recipients

When the EAP was issued, notification was sent to the recipient
advising:

-   the payment being paid into the same bank account as the recipient's
    regular fortnightly income support payment

New claims for eligible payments

The one-off EAP is paid to recipients who made a claim for an eligible
payment on or before the relevant test date, where the claim is granted
after the test date and back dated to this day or earlier.

Reassessment of eligible payments

Recipients of eligible payments, who received a nil rate of payment for
the period including relevant test date, and are subsequently reassessed
and receive payment for that period, are eligible for the one-off EAP.

Recipients who received the partnered rate of EAP and are later
reassessed as being single as at the relevant test date will receive a
top-up payment of $12.50.

Restoration of eligible payments

A recipient will be paid the one-off EAP if their eligible payment was
suspended or cancelled on the relevant test date and:

-   their payment is subsequently restored on or before the relevant
    test date
-   an amount for the period that includes the relevant test date is
    payable
-   they are otherwise eligible

Overpayment of EAP and recovery of existing debts

Debts will not be raised for the EAP if a recipient is subsequently
assessed as not being eligible on the relevant test date.

The EAP will be raised as a debt in fraudulent circumstances.

The EAP will not be withheld to recover existing debts.
