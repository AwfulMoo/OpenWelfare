|                                   | Explanation: Franking credits are |
|                                   | also known as imputation credits. |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Prior to 1 July 2000, a taxpayer  |
|                                   | obtained a tax rebate equal to    |
|                                   | the amount of imputation credits  |
|                                   | received. The rebate reduced      |
|                                   | income tax payable, but once tax  |
|                                   | payable was reduced to zero, no   |
|                                   | benefit was obtained from further |
|                                   | excess credits and was lost.      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | From the 2000-01 financial year,  |
|                                   | a person without a tax liability  |
|                                   | can lodge an 'Application for     |
|                                   | Refund of Imputation Credits for  |

|                                   | Taxation Office (ATO) and receive |
|                                   | a payment from the ATO equal to   |
|                                   | the amount of imputation credits. |
|                                   | A person with a tax liability     |
|                                   | will continue to lodge an income  |
|                                   | tax return to obtain a rebate to  |
|                                   | reduce income tax payable.        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | From 1 July 2001, a person        |
|                                   | without a tax liability may       |
|                                   | receive the gross amount of the   |

|                                   | dividend, that is, eligible       |
|                                   | taxpayers will be able to receive |
|                                   | early refunds of excess           |

|                                   | A company is a taxpayer in its    |
|                                   | own right. This means any         |
|                                   | dividend received from its        |
|                                   | investments, both from shares in  |
|                                   | other companies and from managed  |
|                                   | investments may have imputation   |
|                                   | credits attached to them.         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | These imputation credits are      |
|                                   | income in the 'hands' of the      |
|                                   | company, but will not show up in  |
|                                   | the profit and loss statements of |
|                                   | the company because they may be   |

|                                   | the company. Therefore, the       |
|                                   | imputation credits attached to    |
|                                   | dividends received by a company   |
|                                   | have to be added to the           |
|                                   | accounting profit of the company. |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A trust does not pay tax in its   |
|                                   | own right, but can be assessed    |
|                                   | separately on income it does not  |
|                                   | distribute. This means the tax    |
|                                   | return of a trust will include    |
|                                   | the imputation credits attached   |
|                                   | to dividends received even though |
|                                   | the profit and loss may not,      |
|                                   | because usually they are          |
|                                   | distributed to the beneficiaries  |
|                                   | and the beneficiaries are the     |

|                                   | As such, imputation credits need  |
|                                   | to be added to any dividends paid |
|                                   | to shareholders by a company, but |
|                                   | are already included in any       |

|                                   | The basic rules of imputation     |
|                                   | are:                              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   (a) for a company (private or |
|                                   |     public) the amount of franked |
|                                   |     dividend declared does not    |
|                                   |     include the imputation credit |
|                                   |     and the two will need to be   |
|                                   |     added together. For example:  |
|                                   |     if $700 franked dividend is   |
|                                   |     declared as income, and a     |
|                                   |     $300 imputation credit, then  |
|                                   |     the income to be assessed is  |
|                                   |     $700 + $300 = $1000           |
|                                   | -   (b) however for a trust       |
|                                   |     (private and managed fund)    |
|                                   |     the distribution amount on    |
|                                   |     the trust's tax return (for   |
|                                   |     financial years prior to      |

|                                   |     grossed up to include the     |
|                                   |     imputation credit, that is,   |
|                                   |     the imputation credit is      |
|                                   |     already included in the       |
|                                   |     distribution amount declared. |
|                                   |     For example: if $1000 is      |
|                                   |     declared as a distribution    |
|                                   |     and a $300 imputation credit, |
|                                   |     then the income to be         |
|                                   |     assessed is $1000             |
|                                   | -   (c) from the 2011/2012        |
