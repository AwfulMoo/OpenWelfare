|                                   | Explanation: Franking credits are |
|                                   | also known as imputation credits. |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Prior to 1 July 2000, a taxpayer  |
|                                   | obtained a tax rebate equal to    |
|                                   | the amount of imputation credits  |
|                                   | received. The rebate reduced      |
|                                   | income tax payable, but once tax  |
|                                   | payable was reduced to zero, no   |
|                                   | benefit was obtained from further |
|                                   | excess credits and was lost.      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | From the 2000-01 financial year,  |
|                                   | a person without a tax liability  |
|                                   | can lodge an 'Application for     |
|                                   | Refund of Imputation Credits for  |

|                                   | Taxation Office (ATO) and receive |
|                                   | a payment from the ATO equal to   |
|                                   | the amount of imputation credits. |

|                                   | From 1 July 2001, a person        |
|                                   | without a tax liability may       |
|                                   | receive the gross amount of the   |

|                                   | taxpayers will be able to receive |

|                                   | A company is a taxpayer in its    |
|                                   | own right. This means any         |
|                                   | dividend received from its        |
|                                   | investments, both from shares in  |
|                                   | other companies and from managed  |
|                                   | investments may have imputation   |
|                                   | credits attached to them.         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | These imputation credits are      |
|                                   | income in the 'hands' of the      |
|                                   | company. The credits will not     |
|                                   | appear in the profit and loss     |
|                                   | statements of the company because |
|                                   | they may be offset against any    |
|                                   | tax payable by the company.       |
|                                   | Therefore, any imputation credits |
|                                   | attached to dividends received by |
|                                   | a company have to be added to the |
|                                   | accounting profit of the company. |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A trust does not pay tax in its   |
|                                   | own right, but can be assessed    |
|                                   | separately on income it does not  |
|                                   | distribute. The tax return of a   |
|                                   | trust will include the imputation |
|                                   | credits attached to dividends     |
|                                   | received even though it may not   |
|                                   | appear in the trust profit and    |
|                                   | loss statement. This is because   |
|                                   | the credits are usually           |
|                                   | distributed to the beneficiaries  |
|                                   | who can take advantage of the     |
|                                   | imputation credits.               |

|                                   | As such, imputation credits need  |
|                                   | to be added to any dividends paid |
|                                   | to shareholders by a company, but |
|                                   | are normally already included in  |
|                                   | any distribution paid to          |
|                                   | beneficiaries by a trust.         |

|                                   | The basic rules of imputation     |
|                                   | are:                              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   for a company (private or     |
|                                   |     public) the amount of franked |
|                                   |     dividend declared does not    |
|                                   |     include the imputation credit |
|                                   |     and the two will need to be   |
|                                   |     added together. For example:  |
|                                   |     if $700 franked dividend is   |
|                                   |     declared as income, and a     |
|                                   |     $300 imputation credit, then  |
|                                   |     the income to be assessed is  |
|                                   |     $700 + $300 = $1000           |
