This document outlines the 28 day notification rule for International
Services (CIS) customers.

CIS customers

Customers living overseas, who have their payments administered by CIS,
have up to 28 days to report all changes. This exemption recognises that
it may not always be possible for overseas customers to comply with the
general 14 day notification period.

Extended notification period

For customers granted an extended notification period, the extended
period applies from the date of the event that led to them being granted
the extension, for example, the date they went overseas.

Where a customer goes overseas permanently or intends to remain overseas
for at least 12 months, but their partner remains in Australia, the
notification period for each member of the couple is different. However,
as most events will apply to and should be notified by each of the
couple it would be sensible for Services Australia to be notified within
14 days to prevent any possibility of overpayment.
