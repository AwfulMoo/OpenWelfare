This document outlines information on processing Manual Follow-up (MFU)
tax activities due to incorrect ABSTUDY processing.

Actioning MFU tax activities

Service Officers in the ABSTUDY Smart Centre Processing team are
required to investigate and:

-   correct errors within the debt calculation
-   resolve CRN details

Both the parent and child records may need adjustment. Return completed
records to the ABSTUDY team to action the MFU tax activity.

The MFU tax activity:

flags that the payment summary is prevented from being issued

must be actioned to:

-   correct the negative amount, and
-   issue a payment summary to the customer

The ABSTUDY Smart Centre Processing Team processes ABSTUDY third party
debts when manual correction using the 'Change' function on the Tax
Payment Summary (TXGS) screen is required.

The Resources page contains a link to mySupport and an example of what
to do when a customer with a debt incurs a third party debt of the same
benefit type.
