Finalising calls

Finalising calls includes:

-   the termination of calls to Centrelink
-   dealing with aggressive or abusive callers and
-   the circumstances in which receipt numbers may or may not be issued.

When a call is finalised it will be terminated quickly and politely.
Aggressive or abusive customers will first be warned before terminating
the call. A receipt number may be given to a customer as appropriate.
