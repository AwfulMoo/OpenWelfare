|                                   | Generally, the agency will only   |
|                                   | consider intervening if the payer |

|                                   | that the court considers the      |
|                                   | payer's total debt and that any   |

|                                   | Note: when the agency intervenes  |

|                                   | proceeding, the agency becomes    |
