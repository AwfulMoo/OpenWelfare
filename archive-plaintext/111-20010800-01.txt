This document outlines QMA, the quality checking function in Process
Direct. It has information about QMA sampling, reporting and management.

Sampling

QMA identifies which work items need checking.

This is based on either the:

-   skill tag model, or
-   auto sampling model

Skill tag model

QMA sampling uses the skill tag to record the staff member's proficiency
level. Team leaders record and manage this in Essentials.

Proficiency levels must reflect the staff member’s current capability.
This ensures the correct amount of checking.

See Resources page for information about the proficiency levels and
manual proficiency assessments for QMA under the skill tag model.

Auto sampling model

QMA auto sampling started in September 2019 for non-new claim work. The
QMA sampling rate is automatically calculated.

From June 2020 the auto sampling model included new claims. All new
transactions being introduced into Process Direct will use the QMA auto
sampling model.

The auto sampling model:

-   calculates and adjusts the sampling rate based on a staff member's
    accuracy
-   uses data and metrics to determine the QMA sampling rate for a staff
    member, and
-   means that managers do not need to record proficiency levels in
    Essentials or assess annual proficiency

Note: skill tags are still required for Workload Management allocation
purposes.

A default 100% sampling rate will apply to staff members new to the
Agency or undertaking a new piece of work. A set number of work items
will be selected for QMA checking before the auto sampler is enabled.
See Resources for more details including an example.

When the work moves into Process Direct, staff skilled in that work will
transition at their current sampling rate, based on their QOL
proficiency level (Proficient or Intermediate). This will only occur at:

-   the initial rollout, where the work type is not subject to a Pilot,
    or
-   National rollout, where the work type is subject to a Pilot

Staff who have not gained QOL proficiency (Proficient or Intermediate)
at the time of the rollout will automatically be sampled under the
default 100% sampling rate. These staff must gain their proficiency
under the auto sampling model.

Checking process

QMA will display the fields the staff member has updated. High risk
(mandatory) fields are checked whether or not a staff member has updated
them.

Service Officers do not fix identified errors. The Quality Management
Officer (QMO):

-   records details of any errors and corrects them as they check the
    work
-   provides feedback to the Service Officer through the QMA, and
-   finalises the work item

Comparison table

The Resources page has a comparison table that identifies if the work
type:

-   is subject to the auto sampling model, or the skill tag model
-   is part of the Standalone QMA interface, or the Integrated QMA
    workflow
-   has the Replay functionality enabled
-   has the name and a description of each Variant
-   has the number of work items completed before auto sampling applies.
    Note: this only applies to the auto sampling model

Reporting and Management data for QMA

The QMA Dashboard was introduced in April 2021.

Staff, Team Leaders, Service Support Officers (SSO)/ Quality Development
Officers (QDO) and Business/Support Teams use the dashboard to view QMA
data and to generate reports of QMA results for up to 12 months.

QMA Dashboard

The QMA Dashboard can generate reports from an individual user level to
a national level. It is accessed via Process Direct, where tiered access
will apply:

QMA Dashboard - Service Officer tile:

-   is used by staff to access their own QMA results
-   must be regularly checked to view quality checking results and
    comments from Quality Management Officers

QMA Dashboard - Team Leader tile:

-   is used by line managers to access QMA results for their direct line
    reports
-   has reports which include QMA checks performed by QMOs in their team

QMA Dashboard - Help Desk tile (Service Support Officer/Quality
Development Officer):

-   is used by SSO/QDO to access QMA results for their organisation/site
-   has reports to assist with undertaking performance analysis and
    reporting requirements

QMA Dashboard – Help Desk tile (Business/Support Teams):

-   is used by Business/Support Teams to access National QMA data
-   has reports to assist with undertaking analysis and reporting
    requirements
-   assists to identify trends and continuous improvement opportunities

QMA Dashboard - Help Desk tile: (Helpdesk Staff)
