This document outlines how to locate the source and cause of a debt.

Investigation of debt

Investigate the source and cause of a debt on the Debt Management and
Information System (DMIS). When a negative adjustment is recorded after
an activity has been completed, the adjustment will be linked to the
DMIS activity. This is the 'source' of the debt.

Child Care Subsidy (CCS) debts are managed in Process Direct, which
means that staff must use Process Direct when locating the source and
cause of a CCS debt. Once the debt has been raised, information about
the debt can be viewed in DMIS.

Debts should be actioned when they have been identified. Further
information about the circumstances which led to the potential debt may
be required before the debt can be raised. See Calculating Centrelink
entitlements and gathering information when investigating debts.
