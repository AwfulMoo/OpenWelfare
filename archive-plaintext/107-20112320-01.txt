This document outlines the recovery process for customers managed by the
Case Managed Recovery (CMR) Teams.

Intensive Debt Collection (IDC)

IDC teams form part of the Debt Programme and Compensation Recovery
Branch (DPCR). IDC Case managers take a case managed approach to high
value debts to ensure customers equitably repay their debts.

IDC consists of the following teams:

-   Case Managed Recovery
-   Taskforce Recovery
-   Specialised Recovery
-   Strategic Debt Raising

Case managers engage with customers to:

negotiate repayment arrangements using intelligence data

understand a customer's:

-   real financial position, and
-   capacity to repay debts

Recovery methods

Where customers fail or refuse to make an acceptable arrangement, Case
managers consider other recovery methods.

Case managers may recover a debt through:

-   cash arrangements
-   withholdings (Taskforce Recovery and Specialised Recovery Team's
    only)
-   wage garnishee
-   bank garnishee
-   proceeds of crime garnishee
-   referral to External Collection Agents (ECA)
-   civil litigation

Intensive debt collection indicators

Customers managed by an IDC team have a:

-   Civil-Action debt status, and
-   Display on Access (DOA) DOC

Staff not in IDC Case Managed Recovery Teams must hand off these
customers to the IDC team.
