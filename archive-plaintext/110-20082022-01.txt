This document outlines the details that need to be gathered and noted
before remediating a customer’s record. Remediation will take place when
an income compliance debt was raised wholly or partially using income
averaging of Australian Taxation Office (ATO) data, and has now been
refunded and/or reduced to zero within the refund process.

Government intent

On 19 November 2019, the Minister announced changes to the income
compliance program, including that Services Australia would no longer
raise income compliance review debts based wholly or partially using
income averaging of ATO data.

On 29 May 2020, the Minister announced that from July this year,
Services Australia will refund all repayments made on debts raised using
income averaging of ATO data. Refunds will also be made for any interest
charges and/or recovery fees paid on related debts.

Any debts previously raised wholly or partially using income averaging
of ATO data will be:

-   reduced to a $0 balance
-   any amounts recovered for these debt/s will be refunded to the
    customer, and
-   removed from the customer's record

The Resources page contains links to the Services Australia website and
the ACE application, how to locate refund letters and CMS
troubleshooting.
