This is a Family and Domestic Violence Interaction Point. If the
customer is with another person, on speakerphone, or already identified
with family and domestic violence concerns, continue with the current
business conversation. Otherwise, go to the Family and domestic violence
procedure to conduct the risk identification and referral process.

This document outlines the duties and responsibilities of Service
Officers, Intensive Collection Services Referral Officers, DPO
specialists and the delegated decision makers when issuing a DPO.

Departure prohibition order

A DPO prevents a child support debtor, including a debtor with an
overpayment, from leaving Australia. If a payer attempts to leave
Australia when a DPO is in force they will be physically stopped at the
point of departure by the Australian Federal Police (AFP).

DPOs place significant restrictions on the normal liberties of citizens,
residents and visitors to Australia and are only made after serious
consideration of all relevant circumstances.
