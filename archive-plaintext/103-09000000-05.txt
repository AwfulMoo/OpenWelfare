Customer Correspondence

Customers will receive a letter when a deduction has been set up,
changed or cancelled. In addition to the letter, some customers will
also receive an SMS.

SMS messages will be sent when a Centrepay deduction is set up, changed,
cancelled, suspended (and resumed) by either the Centrepay Business or
the agency. SMS messages are not sent where the customer has managed
their deduction through their online channel/s.

To encourage customers to manage their deductions they will also receive
an SMS notification when a:

-   deduction has been in place, unchanged for 12 months
-   second deduction has been commenced for the same service reason
    (i.e. two deductions for electricity)
-   target amount or end date is reached
-   partial or a nil Centrepay payment has been made

SMS messages will promote online services as the preferred method to
manage their deductions.

To be eligible to receive Centrepay SMS messaging a customer must:

-   be subscribed to Electronic Messages, and
-   not have a nominee arrangement

For further information on customer letters and electronic messaging,
see Centrelink letters online and Electronic Messaging.
