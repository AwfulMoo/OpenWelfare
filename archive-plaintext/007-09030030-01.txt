This document outlines information about the restoration of Parental
Leave Pay (PPL) when a customer's qualification for payment has been
re-established.

Restoring PPL claim after cancellation

If PPL is cancelled and it has been established that the payment should
not have been cancelled, it can be restored without the need to reclaim.
The only PPL cancellation reason that cannot be restored is when the
full entitlement of PPL has been paid (reason: end of payment - EOP).

A PPL claim may have been cancelled at the customer's request or as a
result of:

-   changes in the customer's circumstances
-   a review of a Centrelink decision
-   the customer not providing information as requested

Generally PPL may be restored from the date it was cancelled if the
customer was eligible from that date. If there have been changes in the
customer's circumstances these must be recorded before restoration.

The Resources page contains an example of the restoration of payments as
a result of a review of a decision.
