This document outlines whether Away from Base assistance for travel is
available for ABSTUDY students to attend an approved Away from Base
activity.

On this Page:

Components of assistance

Fares Allowance is payable to eligible customers who have not exceeded
their Limits on Away from Base assistance.

Assistance for non-student travellers

Fares Allowance (FAA) may be payable to non-student travellers such as
education institution representatives, where travel to the student's
home community or communities can be demonstrated to be cost-effective
for assessment testing or residential schools.

Away from Base assistance may be granted if the journey is not within
reasonable travelling time or distance from the student's permanent home
or term address. FAA can be approved if the student only needs to travel
to the activity and back in one day, as an overnight stay is not
required to meet this qualification.

Cost of chartered transport for off-campus residential school

Where an education provider conducting a residential school arranges
accommodation at an off-campus location, FAA may cover the cost of
transport between the place of accommodation and the education provider,
provided:

-   there is no suitable and convenient form of public transport
-   the education provider arranges the transport
-   the costs of the transport are reasonable and can be justified

Possible restrictions

Some restrictions may apply to interstate travel.

Note: an Australian Apprentice is not entitled to Fares Allowance for
the Australian Apprenticeship.

Further assistance

Residential expenses and Travel allowance may be available also to
assist students undertaking an approved Away from base activity.

(SY032).
