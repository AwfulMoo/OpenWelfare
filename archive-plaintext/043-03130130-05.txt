These scenarios describe events occurring before 1 February 2020. On
this date the Department of Human Services became the Federal government
agency Services Australia.

Scenario 1 - Self-employed initially advised but increases not advised

Cathy is granted Disability Support Pension (DSP). Cathy's partner
Chris, advises (on 10 November 2005) of being self-employed. They
provide a copy of the 2003-04 tax return.

Chris' income of $12,000 per annum (pa) for 2003-04. This amount is
coded. They have no other income. On 15 November 2005, they are sent
letters stating they need to advise Services Australia (the agency)
within 14 days if their combined income increases.

-   On 16 December 2005, Chris signs the 2004-05 tax return indicating
    income from self-employment of $15,000. Chris does not advise the
    agency within 14 days
-   On 14 May 2007, Chris signs the 2005-06 tax return indicating that
    the income increased to $18,000. Again, Chris does not advise the
    agency
-   On 18 November 2007, Chris signs the 2006-07 tax return showing a
    reduction of income to $10,000 p.a. Again, Chris does not advise the
    agency
-   On 20 November 2008, Chris signs the 2007-08 tax return showing an
    increase in income to $13,000. Chris also indicates to the
    Australian Taxation Office of ceasing self-employment on 30
    June 2008. Chris does not tell the agency

Following Data Matching, it is confirmed that Chris had the following
amounts of income from self-employment and the Decision Maker (DM)
obtains the dates the tax returns were signed.

Question: What is the start date of the debt?

Answer

The first notifiable event is 16 December 2005 and the debt starts on 16
December 2005 per section 100 of the SSAA.

Question: What income figure should be used from the start date?

Answer

On 16 December 2005, the customer’s ITR was prepared for the 2004-05
financial year. Use the 2004-05 financial year income.

Question: What dates and income figures should be used after that?

Answer

When the customer has not notified at all, the debt continues on from 16
December 2005 until 30 June 2008. This is the date self-employment
ceased. Use income from the customer’s ITR or financial statement to
update the record and identify any overpayments.

This means use:

-   2004-05 financial year income to assess entitlement from 16 December
    2005 to 13 May 2007
-   2005-06 financial year income to assess entitlement from 14 May 2007
    to 17 November 2007
-   2006-07 financial year income to assess entitlement from 18 November
    2007 to 30 June 2008

Question: What is the end date of the debt?

Answer

As above the end date of the debt is 30 June 2008, the date the customer
ceased self-employment. Section 126(4) of the SSAA is used to stop the
debt in these circumstances.

Example

If Chris had not ceased self-employment, the last reported income i.e.
2006-07 would continue to apply to the end date of the debt. The Process
page contains step by step information.

Scenario 2 - Self-employment not initially notified

Customer 1

Brian:

-   claims Age Pension on 10 November 2005 but does not advise of being
    self-employed
-   has the same income details as Chris above
-   signed his 2003-04 tax return on 12 December 2004

Customer 2

Angela:

-   has been on Carer Payment since 2001
-   became self-employed on 10 November 2005 but does not advise the
    agency
-   also has the same income details as Chris, however as Angela did not
    commence self-employment until 10 November 2005, the first tax
    return completed was for the 2005-06 financial year

The Service Officer is raising the debts for both Brian and Angela on 20
September 2009.

Question: What is the start date of the debt?

Answer

In both cases, use a manual, adverse determination under section 118(9)
of the SSAA. This is because both Brian and Angela have made a false
statement/misrepresentation. The start date of the debt for:

-   Brian is 10 November 2005 (that is, date of grant)
-   Angela is 10 November 2005 (that is, the date self-employment
    commenced)

Question: What income figure should be used from the start?

Answer

Brian, use actual income - 2003-04 financial year income from 10
November 2005.

Angela, use actual income - 2005-06 financial year income from 10
November 2005.

Question: What dates and income figures should be used after that?

Answer

Use income from the customer’s ITR or financial statement to update the
record.

This means in:

Brian's case use:

-   2004-05 financial year income to assess entitlement from 16 December
    2005 to 13 May 2007
-   2005-06 financial year income to assess entitlement from 14 May 2007
    to 17 November 2007
-   2006-07 financial year income to assess entitlement from 18 November
    2007 to 30 June 2008

Angela's case use:

-   2005-06 financial year income to assess entitlement from 14 May 2007
    to 17 November 2007
-   2006-07 financial year income to assess entitlement from 18 November
    2007 to 30 June 2008

Note: for Angela, maintain the 2005-06 financial year income until the
actual business income for 2006-07 financial year is known. In this
example the 2006-07 financial year income is known on 18 November 2007.

Question: What is the end date of the debt?

Answer

The end date of the debt is 30 June 2008, the date the customer/s ceased
self-employment. Use s126(4) of the SSAA to stop the debt in these
circumstances.

Note: if Brian and Angela had not ceased self-employment, the last
reported income i.e. 2006-07 continues to apply until the end date of
the debt. The Process page contains step by step information.

Scenario 3 - Self-employment initially notified and some increases advised

Georgia is granted Age Pension. Georgia advises being self-employed and
provides a copy of the 2005-06 tax return. Georgia's income is $4,000
per annum for 2005-06 financial year. Code this amount.

Following Data Matching, it is confirmed that Georgia had the following
amounts of income from self-employment. Get the dates the tax returns
were signed.

This table shows the financial years, income amounts and dates tax
returns were signed for this scenario and whether Services Australia was

January 2008 per section 100 of the Social Security Administration Act
(SSAA) 1991.

Question: What income figure should be used from the start date?

Answer

Assess the income from the date the tax return was signed. It will be
the 2006-07 income of $13,000.

Question: What dates and income figures should be used after that?

-   2007-08 financial year income for the period 20 December 2008 to 31
    May 2010
-   2008-09 financial year income for the period 1 June 2010 to 31

    August 2013
-   2012-13 financial year income for the period from 5 August 2013
    through to the end date of the undetermined debt. This income is
    maintained until the 2013-14 income tax return and financial
    statements are prepared

Scenario 4 - Self-employment not initially notified for a new business

Jack has been on Age Pension since 2015, he commenced self-employment on
1 January 2020, but did not advise the agency.

-   On 1 May 2020, Jack lodged his Profit and Loss statement. He
    reported $10,000 from self-employment for the 2019-20 financial year
-   On 1 August 2020, Jack lodged a tax return with the agency, his
    self-employment income was $63,000 for the 2019-20 financial year.
    Business documents show Jack signed a new $50,000 contract on 15
    April 2020

Question: Can the debt be raised using the Profit and Loss statement before a tax return is lodged?

Answer

Yes, in this example, the debt period is 1 January 2020 to 30 April
2020.

Question: When should reassessments be completed?

Answer

Delegates must determine whether the increase in the reported amount was
significant enough for the customer to have known before the date they
reported the increase.

-   Was the increase gradual and not something the customer may have
    been aware of before lodging their tax return?
-   Did the customer become aware of the increase on a particular date?

In the example, Jack became aware of the increase in income on 15 April
2020. This is the date he signed the contract. Jack should have reported
the significant increase in income within 14 days of the event.

-   the agency will reassess his rate of payment from 15 April 2020
-   the debt period is 15 April 2020 to 30 July 2020
