This document outlines how the External Complaints - Child Support
(ExCCS) team manage complaints from customers and others who write
directly to the Minister or Prime Minister. It also applies when a
parliamentarian writes to the Minister for the National Disability
Insurance Scheme and Minister for Government Services on behalf of a
constituent.

Ministerial complaints to ExCCS

-   A Services Australia (the agency) response is provided when a Child
    Support customer writes directly to the Minister or the Prime
    Minister
-   An Electorate Officer (EO) response is provided when an EO from a
    Parliamentarian’s Office writes to the Minister on behalf of a
    constituent
-   A Ministerial response is provided when a Parliamentarian writes to
    the Minister on behalf of a constituent

A written response is usually required to all Ministerial and EO
complaints.
A verbal resolution may be provided in certain circumstances.

Occasionally a recommendation is made to take no further action (NFA) to
the issues raised by the customer if there are no new issues raised in
the complaint. The customer must have previously been informed in
writing that:

-   the matters they have raised have been comprehensively reviewed and
    addressed, and
-   further correspondence from them regarding the same issues will be
    read and filed but not responded to

An NFA recommendation should be completed and sent for approval within 2
business days of being allocated the complaint. This allows adequate
time for a response to be prepared in the event the NFA recommendation
is not approved.

The NFA decision is made by the ExCCS Service Manager.

Complaints received from parliamentarians

Parliamentarians and their staff making representations on behalf of
their constituent are a representative with ordinary authority.

For complaints received from parliamentarians via the Parliamentarian
Enquiry line or email, see Parliamentarian complaints about Child
Support customers.

Responding to Ministerial complaints

A response to a Ministerial complaint is required as follows:

-   Agency and EO responses should be prepared, cleared and sent to the
    customer within 21 calendar days of the agency receiving the
    complaint
-   A Ministerial response should be prepared, cleared and sent to the
    Minister’s office within 14 days of the complaint registration on
    the Parliamentary Document Management System (PDMS). This timeframe
    may vary in accordance with the requirements of the Minister's
    Office

Providing feedback to the business

Compliments and complaints provide the agency with a valuable source of
information to:

-   assess performance
-   identify systemic issues
-   assist in the training, development and support of staff
-    provide written feedback on all staff compliments and upheld and
    partially upheld complaints using the Staff Feedback tool

Resources contains links to macros and Intranet pages to manage external
complaints, guides to preparing written responses, Child Support forms
and facts sheets and the Staff Feedback tool.
