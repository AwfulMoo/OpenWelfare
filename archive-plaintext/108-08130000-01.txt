The document outlines the Rent Deduction Scheme (RDS) deductions that
can be deducted from a customer's payment.

On this Page:

Rent Deduction Scheme

The RDS allows Services Australia (the agency) customers to have their
government housing payments deducted from their Centrelink payment each
fortnight and sent directly to the appropriate state or territory
Housing Authority (HA). These deductions can be for:

-   payment of rent
-   repayment of HA loans
-   payment of HA arrears
-   other housing payments

Commencement of deductions

Calculation of the deduction amount will be determined by each
individual state or territory Housing Authority (HA). Customers who
receive payments from which RDS deductions can be made, can participate
in the scheme. With the customer's consent, the HA can start, vary or
cancel a RDS deduction by sending a new instruction transaction to the
agency.

Customers must contact their HA to commence or vary an RDS deduction.
Customers can withdraw from the scheme and have their RDS deductions
cancelled at any time, by contacting the appropriate HA or by contacting
the agency by phone or in person.

Participation in the RDS is entirely voluntary; however, some HAs have
signing up for RDS as a requirement in their tenancy agreement.

Once the customer has given consent for an RDS deduction, information on
the form can be shared between the agency and the HAs. This includes
details of a customer's:

-   type of payment and Customer Reference Number (CRN)
-   name, address, telephone number and date of birth
-   type and amount of deduction(s)

The RDS was established to increase efficiencies for all HAs and to
improve customer service. It is governed by formal agreements between
the agency and the HAs in all states and territories.

Cancelation/suspension of payment

When a customer's Centrelink payment is cancelled or suspended, the RDS
deduction instruction is kept current for the standard 'grace' period
(13 weeks for all payments). If the customer returns to payment within
that period the deduction instruction will be re-activated automatically
and pay to the HA from the customer's next pay day.

The deduction that recommences will not include any arrears that may be
owed.

If the customer does not return to payment within the grace period of 13
weeks, the deduction will cancel. The HA will receive a termination
advice (ITI) on their next deduction report for the instruction.

Note: a customer who pays government rent is not eligible for Rent
Assistance (RA). However, where the customer (living in state housing)
is an eligible government sub-tenant they may qualify for RA.

For customers whose rent deduction type is 'OHO' (Other Housing
Organisations), these organisations are not government housing and the
customer may be eligible for Rent Assistance (RA), depending on the
amount of rent paid.
