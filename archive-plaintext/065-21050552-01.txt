Historical SPARC process

legacy aged care payment system for residential care. SPARC is a view
only system from 20 August 2022.

To view the legacy SPARC process, see the historical version.

Background

Aged care means assessments determine the care recipient’s ability to
contribute towards government-funded aged care services. There are
different schemes in place depending on the date of entry into care. See
Aged Care means assessment for more details.

Care recipients (or their nominees) can opt in to the post 1 July 2014
means assessment scheme if they:

-   were in a residential care service or receiving a home care package
    on 30 June 2014, and
-   have moved to a new service on or after 1 July 2014, and
-   have not spent more than 28 days outside of care (other than on
    approved leave)

Written details about the 1 July 2014 means assessment arrangement must
be given to care recipients (or their nominees) who:

-   were in care on 30 June 2014, and
-   choose to opt in to the post 1 July 2014 means assessment scheme

This includes care recipients who are intending to move to a new
service.

All care recipients who choose to opt in to the post 1 July 2014 means
assessment scheme must give the new service a completed Continuing Care
Recipient opting into the New Aged Care Arrangements from 1 July 2014
form (AC022) before they transfer into the new service.

    – Home Care and New Arrangements for Aged Care from 1 July 2014 –

The AC022 form must be submitted with the care recipient’s entry event

Online entry events that contain the care recipient’s decision to opt

Matter Experts (SME) assess and process held entry events to determine
if a valid AC022 form has been received by Services Australia. See

Portal (ACSP).

2014 means assessment scheme if they have:
