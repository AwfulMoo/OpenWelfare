Codes for cancellation or suspension

The Centrelink system uses codes when a decision to cancel or suspend a
payment is recorded on the computer system. A description of the code is
used in correspondence with customers. Some of these actions occur
automatically due to an update being made to the customer's
circumstances (for example, income or asset details). Others are coded
manually.

The Process page contains the cancellation, suspension and rejection
codes for WidB and WP.
