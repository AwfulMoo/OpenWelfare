This document explains the eligibility, payment rates and claiming
options for the COVID-19 Disaster Payment - Australian Capital
Territory.

For staff not trained in processing claims, complete a cold
(unannounced) transfer to 'COVID-19 Disaster Payment' in Services
Australia Worksapce.

If a customer calls about the status of their claim or automatic
payment, see Status of claim - customer calls to enquire for what to
tell the customer.

All Australian Capital Territory online claims that do not meet
eligibility requirements can be rejected, except when the customer has a
pending Income Support Payment.

The claiming period for this event has ended. Staff will only assess
online claims for this event that were lodged before the claiming period
ended or phone claims where special circumstances apply.

To receive a payment

To receive a payment a customer must:

-   be unable to attend work and therefore unable to earn their usual
    income because of a state public health order for restricted
    movement, and
-   meet the general eligibility criteria

General eligibility

For online claims for this payment, do not contact customers to confirm
online claim details unless advised to do so by the Level 2 Helpdesk.

Do not follow this procedure for any other event.

A customer qualifies if they meet all of the following on the same day
for at least 1 day in the relevant period:

an Australian resident (through legal permanent residence and residing
in Australia) or a holder of a visa class permitted to work in Australia
(to check these see Resources for visa subclasses), and in Australia at
the time of their claim

be at least 17 years old

either:

-   lives or works in a relevant area subject to a state public health
    order for restricted movement that is a deemed a COVID-19 hotspot by
    the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer
-   were present in a COVID-19 hotspot at the time the restricted
    movement was declared, and are now subject to a second public health
    order that restricts their movement in the state or territory they
    are currently in

would have worked on or after the first day of a state public health
order for restricted movement

not received the COVID-19 Disaster Payment for the same relevant period,
or part thereof

has not received or will not receive an income support payment
(including a zero rate) for any day in the COVID-19 Disaster Payment
relevant period they are claiming for
Note: if a customer chooses to cancel an income support payment to
receive the COVID-19 Disaster Payment, this should be for a date before
the relevant period starts. 'Zero rate' does not include customers with
a pending, assessed (ASS) or suspended (SUS) status. See Income support
payment customers

has not received or will not receive any of the following payments, for
any day in the COVID-19 Disaster Payment relevant period they are
claiming for:

-   state pandemic payment
-   Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment
-   state small business payment
-   Dad and Partner Pay (DAP)
-   Parental Leave Pay (PPL),
    Note: staff must consider the period a payment was paid for not the
    date the customer received a payment

not receiving pandemic-related paid leave entitlements, or will use them
up during the same relevant period, and

for any day in the COVID-19 Disaster Payment relevant period they are
claiming for, their employer has not received or will not receive the
Retaining Domestic Airline Capability (RDAC) payment on their behalf.
Note: staff must consider the period the payment was paid for, not the
date the employer received the payment on the customer’s behalf

To receive a payment, customers must also be unable to attend work and
therefore unable to earn their usual income due to a state public health
order for restricted movement.

There is no liquid assets criteria for this event.

To be eligible for the COVID-19 Disaster Payment after Australian
Capital Territory reaches 80% full vaccination of its population who are
aged 16 years and older, a customer must:

-   have received a COVID-19 Disaster Payment in relevant period 10, and
-   continue to meet the eligibility criteria

A customer who is in gaol or imprisoned is not eligible for the COVID-19
Disaster Payment.

If a customer’s employer has not allowed them to attend work and earn
their usual income, as they are not vaccinated against COVID-19, the
customer may be eligible if they meet all eligibility criteria.

Self-employed customers can have the same work and home address.

Customers involved in a trust or company

Customers who only derive their income from a trust or company
(distributions/dividends) are not eligible:

-   a customer must be working and due to the restricted movement be
    unable to work and therefore unable to earn an income
-   distributions/dividends will not count as employment as the
    restricted movement is not affecting their income

Company directors

A customer who is a company director, even when they draw a wage from
the business, cannot receive the COVID-19 Disaster Payment if the
business has received a state small business payment.

The customer may be eligible to receive the COVID-19 Disaster Payment
if:

-   the business has not received a state small business payment,
-   the customer draws a wage from the business, and
-   all other eligibility criteria is met

For help assessing eligibility:

-   see the scenarios
-   contact Technical Peer Support

Unable to work and earn usual income

To receive a payment, customers must be ‘unable to attend work and
therefore unable to earn their usual income due to a state public health
order for restricted movement’.

This means the customer cannot earn their usual amount of income from
any employer (existing or new).

That is, if a customer has lost income from an employer, but is able to
regain the same lost income from a new employer, they:

-   can attend work and earn their usual income, and
-   are not eligible to receive a payment

Reasons a person may be unable to attend work and earn their usual
income

A person may be unable to attend work and earn their usual income for a
number of reasons related to the restricted movement conditions. This
includes where customers:

-   are not permitted or unable to work from home,
-   cannot attend work due to caring responsibilities
-   are not vaccinated against COVID-19
-   have an exemption from wearing a mask, however, cannot work because
    of a state public health order mandating mask wearing (this must be
    because of a state public health order and not because of a
    condition an employer has placed on a person’s employment)

A person may be unable to attend work and earn their usual income for a
number of reasons related to the restricted movement conditions. This
includes where customers are:

-   not permitted or unable to work from home, and
-   cannot attend work due to caring responsibilities

Unable to attend work and therefore unable to earn their usual income
means the customer, in the relevant period, must have lost at least:

-   8 hours of work, or
-   1 full day of work

A full day of work does not need to be at least 8 hours.

For example: a customer normally works a 3 hour shift during the
relevant period and cannot attend that shift because of the restricted
movement. The customer meets the 'unable to attend work and therefore
unable to earn their usual income' criteria as they have lost 1 full day
of work in the relevant period.

If a customer does not lose 1 full day of work, they must lose at least
8 hours of work in the relevant period.

For example:

-   A customer normally works 1 x 10 hour shift during the relevant
    period. They work 5 hours of that shift. The customer does not meet
    the 'unable to attend work and therefore unable to earn their usual
    income' criteria as they have not lost at least 8 hours of work or 1
    full day of work in the relevant period
-   A customer normally works 2 x 10 hours shifts during the relevant
    period. They work 5 hours each day of those 2 shifts. The customer
    does meet the 'unable to attend work and therefore unable to earn
    their usual income' criteria as they have lost 10 hours of work in
    the relevant period

The payment rate the customer receives is based on hours of work lost
during the relevant period, not hours the customer would have worked if
the restricted movement did not occur.

Relevant period

-   Relevant period 1: 13-19 August 2021 inclusive
-   Relevant period 2: 20-26 August 2021 inclusive
-   Relevant period 3: 27 August - 2 September 2021 inclusive
-   Relevant period 4: 3-9 September 2021 inclusive
-   Relevant period 5: 10-16 September 2021 inclusive
-   Relevant period 6: 17-23 September 2021 inclusive
-   Relevant period 7: 24-30 September 2021 inclusive
-   Relevant period 8: 1-7 October 2021 inclusive
-   Relevant period 9: 8-14 October 2021 inclusive
-   Relevant period 10: 15-21 October 2021 inclusive
-   Relevant period 11: 22-28 October 2021 inclusive
-   Relevant period 12: 29 October to 4 November 2021 inclusive

If a customer claims for relevant period 1 or onwards:

-   They will automatically receive the same rate of payment for all
    future relevant periods, unless they advise of a change in
    circumstances, or where the state reaches 70% full vaccination, see
    Where automatic payments stop
-   The length of the relevant period does not impact the rate of the
    automatic payment
-   They do not need to lodge a new claim

If a customer does not claim for relevant period 1, claims cannot be
lodged until the claiming period for the relevant period starts.
Workflows will only be available on the first day after the end of a
relevant period.

There are different claiming periods for each relevant period. See
Timeframes for claiming.

Where automatic payments stop

When Australian Capital Territory reaches 70% full vaccination of its
population who are aged 16 years or older:

-   automatic payments will stop
-   customers must reapply for each relevant period

Customers in Australian Capital Territory receiving automatic payments
will receive their final automatic payment for relevant period 8.

To continue receiving COVID-19 Disaster Payment from relevant period 9,
customers must reapply for each relevant period.

Note: automatic payments will continue to apply to all claims for
relevant periods before the final automatic payment, up to and including
the final automatic payment for relevant period 8.

Customers who previously claimed:

-   online, should continue to use their myGov account to apply
-   over the phone, can now claim online. See Claiming options

An abridged claim process will apply in certain circumstances.

COVID-19 Disaster Payment ending

When Australian Capital Territory reaches 80% full vaccination of its
population who are aged 16 years and older:

the payment will reduce over 2 weeks before ending

-   if this happens part way through the relevant period, the customer
    will get paid the full weekly payment for that period

Australian Capital Territory reached the 80% full vaccination mark of
its population who are aged 16 years and older on 18 October 2021. This
means the reduction in payment will apply from relevant period 11.

See Payment amount.

Customers requiring further financial help after the end of the COVID-19
Disaster Payment should go to Payment and Service Finder to find the
most appropriate payment and/or service for them.

Relevant areas

There is 1 'relevant area':

-   Australian Capital Territory

Staff must check a customer lives, works or was present in a relevant
area by using the Geospatial tool.

To be eligible to receive a payment, an address must be in the blue
shaded area for the customer to be eligible.

Present in

For the purposes of the COVID-19 Disaster Payment - Australian Capital
Territory, the eligibility criteria covers whether a customer lives,
works or has been present in (visited) a relevant area.

The area must be:

-   declared a COVID-19 hotspot, and
-   under period of restricted movement

A second public health order:

-   is a state or territory public health order that restricts a
    person's movement, due to them being in a COVID-19 hotspot that was
    also under a restricted movement order at the time they were there,
    even if they are now in another location
-   includes stay at home orders, self-quarantine or mandatory
    (supervised) quarantine
-   can differ depending on the home state or territory

The address the customer was present in within the COVID-19 hotspot area
will be checked using the Geospatial tool to make sure the relevant area
was 'declared a COVID-19 hotspot' and is under a period of restricted
movement.

Leave entitlements

To get the COVID-19 Disaster Payment, customers must not be receiving
pandemic related paid leave entitlements or will exhaust those
entitlements during the same relevant period.

Customers do not need to take

accrued leave entitlements such as:

-   annual leave
-   long service leave
-   unpaid leave

leave they are not entitled to access if they have been stood down
without pay by their employer under the Fair Work Act, for example:

-   paid sick leave
-   carer’s leave
-   compassionate leave

However, if a customer is receiving any of the above leave types,
including pandemic related leave entitlements, during the entire
relevant period, they:

-   have not lost income, and
-   are not eligible to receive the COVID-19 Disaster Payment

For unpaid leave, while the customer may have lost income, they would
not meet the ‘would have worked’ criteria. That is, if a person is on
unpaid leave, they would not have worked even if the restricted movement
did not occur.

If these leave entitlements do not cover the entire relevant period the
customer meets this eligibility requirement.

For example, if a customer has leave entitlements, including pandemic
related leave entitlements, that cover 3 days of the relevant period,
they meet this eligibility requirement. Note: the customer must meet all
eligibility requirements for at least 1 day in the remaining period.

Payment amount

If the customer is eligible, the payment amount is:

-   $450 if they have lost at least 8 hours and less than 20 hours of
    work or a full day of work in the relevant period
-   $750 if they have lost 20 hours or more of work in the relevant
    period

The payment cannot be paid pro rata. The customer must be paid the full
amount of $450 or $750.

When Australian Capital Territory reaches 80% full vaccination of its
population who are aged 16 years and older, the rate of payment will
reduce over 2 weeks before ending.

Australian Capital Territory reached the 80% full vaccination of its
population who are aged 16 years and older mark on 18 October 2021.

Customers will receive their last full payment of $750/$450 in relevant
period 10.

The next 2 payments for customers who claim the non-income support
payment rate will be:

Next payment:

-   $450 (that is, customers receiving $750 or $450 will all get the
    same amount of $450) in relevant period 11

Final payment:

-   $320 (that is, everyone will get $320) in relevant period 12

The COVID-19 Disaster Payment will stop after this final payment.

Maximum number of payments

Do not process more than 1 payment of COVID-19 Disaster Payment in 1
day, see Payment methods.

Customers cannot receive the COVID-19 Disaster Payment for:

-   the same relevant period, or part thereof
-   relevant periods that overlap
