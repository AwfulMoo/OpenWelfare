This document outlines whether or not an Assistance for Isolated
Children (AIC) Scheme student is still eligible to receive AIC when they
turn 19 years of age and, if not, the most appropriate payment for the
student.

Eligibility

AIC is payable in respect of students who undertake approved studies and
are isolated from their nearest appropriate state school or meet special
needs or deemed isolated criteria.

Students must satisfy the general eligibility conditions for AIC,
including the age criteria. A primary, secondary or equivalent ungraded
level student may continue to receive AIC until the end of the year in
which they turn 19 years of age. However, a student may be eligible for
a further year of assistance if their progress through school has been
delayed by special circumstances.

Tertiary Students

Eligible tertiary level students are eligible for AIC until the day they
have met the minimum education and training participation age or
requirement for their state or territory.
