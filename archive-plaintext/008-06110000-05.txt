Matrix of Assessor qualifications

All Job Capacity Assessments (JCA) must use a Contributing Assessor (CA)
where the Assessor’s qualification(s) do not align with the impairment
table(s) used to assess the medical condition with the most functional
impact. This also includes where medical conditions are not considered
fully diagnosed, treated or stabilised. The CA provides support to the
JCA based upon their field of expertise. Their details are found in the
CA section in the JCA report.

Table 1: This table describes Assessor qualifications that have been
linked to the relevant Impairment Tables given the focus on functional
ability. If an assessor's professional discipline is not listed against
a particular table, they must engage a CA with 1 of the professional
disciplines listed.
