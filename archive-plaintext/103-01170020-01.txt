From 17 March 2021, Income Management (IM) customers based in the
Northern Territory (NT) can permanently transition to the Cashless Debit
Card (CDC) program. Customers on an income support payment who are
living in the NT and are not currently on IM, will be able to volunteer
for the Cashless Debit Card (CDC) from this date.
For more information on this process or to initiate an IM to CDC
transition, see Income Management (IM) to Cashless Debit Card (CDC)
Transition in the Northern Territory, which also contains staff
resources and links to the transition overview Intranet page for
additional information.

This document outlines the criteria to identify a customer for Income
Management under the Long Term Welfare Payment Recipient (LTWPR)
measure.

On this Page:

LTWPR Income Management

A customer will be identified automatically for Income Management under
the Long Term Welfare Payment Recipients (LTWPR) measure if they meet
all the following criteria:

-   The customer's usual place of residence is in the Northern Territory
-   The customer is in receipt of a category E welfare payment
-   The customer has been in receipt of a category E welfare payment for
    at least 52 weeks during the past 104 week period. This period does
    not have to be continuous and can be any combination of Category E
    payments (that is, does not have to be the one payment for 52
    weeks). Periods of current zero rate and periods where payment is
    suspended count towards the 52 weeks. Periods where the payment is
    assessed (such as serving a Liquid Assets Waiting Period) do not
    count towards the total
-   The customer is at least 25 years old and has not reached Age
    Pension age
-   The customer is not already income managed under a measure which is
    above this Compulsory Income Management (CIM) measure on the
    hierarchy of Income Management measures
-   The customer does not have an excluded payment nominee for Income
    Management purposes

Usual Place of Residence

The usual place of residence will be determined by the system based on
the customer's home or term address.

If the address is updated to indicate that the customer now lives in the
Northern Territory, and all other eligibility criteria are met, the
system will identify the customer as eligible for Income Management
under this measure and an Initial Assessment interview will be required.

Customer moves out of an Income Management (IM) area

If a customer moves out of the Northern Territory after being identified
for or commencing Income Management under this measure, their payments
may still be income managed. For more information see, Customer moves
out of an Income Management area.

Percentage of payments for IM

Under the Long Term Welfare Payment Recipients (LTWPR) measure, 50% of a
customer's regular fortnightly payments are income managed, and 100% of
lump sum payments income managed.

Exemptions from Income Management

Customers may qualify for an exemption from Income Management under the
Long Term Welfare Payment Recipients (LTWPR) measure. Different
exemption criteria apply depending on whether the customer has dependent
children or not.

Exiting from Income Management

Customers cease to be income managed under this measure if:

-   it has been more than 13 weeks since they moved out of the Northern
    Territory on a permanent or indefinite basis
-   they qualify for a measure higher in the hierarchy of measures (in
    which case Income Management would continue under that measure)
-   their category E welfare payment is cancelled
-   they are granted an exemption from Income Management
-   they have an excluded payment nominee
-   the customer has passed away.

Reviews and Appeals

Customers can request a review of decisions to apply Income Management
to their payments under the Long Term Welfare Payment Recipients (LTWPR)
measure at any time. Normal review processes apply.
