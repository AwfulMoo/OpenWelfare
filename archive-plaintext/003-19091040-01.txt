The claiming period has now closed, unless special circumstances apply.
For more details see Emergency payment claims lodged outside of the time

Formal approval has been given to commence rejection of claims for all
declared and non-declared Local Government Areas. This also applies to
DRA/NZ DRA Determination 2020 claims where a Request for Information
(RFI) letter was sent requesting documentary evidence of income.

This document outlines how to work out if Australian Government Disaster
Recovery Payment (AGDRP), Disaster Recovery Allowance (DRA) or their
associated ex-gratia payment can be paid to customers affected by an
emergency event.

Emergency payments

The federal government has made a determination under the Social
Security Act that a major disaster has occurred. The following payments
have been activated for Queensland Bushfires (Sep 2019):

-   Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment (AGDRP)
-   NZ Disaster Recovery Payment (DRP) - for New Zealand non-protected
    Special Category visa (subclass 444) holders, that is NZ equivalent
    of AGDRP
-   Disaster Recovery Allowance (DRA)
-   NZ DRA - for New Zealand non-protected Special Category visa
    (subclass 444) holders, that is NZ equivalent of DRA

Affected Local Government Areas (LGAs)

The determination specifies which LGAs are eligible for each emergency
payment.

The determination covers the affected LGAs of:

-   Noosa
-   Scenic Rim
-   Southern Downs
-   Sunshine Coast

The Process page contains more information on the current active
emergency events LGAs.

Reasonably close (AGDRP/ex-gratia DRP only)

Static maps are not available.

For the Queensland Bushfires (Sep 2019) the customer’s principal place
of residence must be:

-   within one of the designated LGAs and
-   ‘reasonably close’ to the bushfires

Live maps can be used to assist in assessing reasonably close. Live maps
detail the burn scar for each fire and can be used to assist in
determining the likelihood that any major damage was a direct result of
the designated bushfire.

See the Resources page to access the live maps.

Assessing claims where a customer's principal residence is outside 10km burn scar radius

Customers located outside of the 10km radius of a bushfire burn scar may
require a greater degree of examination and customer questioning to
ensure the damage claimed was a direct result of the declared major
disaster.

Where the customer's principal place of residence is outside the 10km
burn scar radius, Service Officers can escalate the claim to the
Emergency Management Technical Peer Support once the following have been
completed and the investigation is documented on the customer's record:

-   All other eligibility criteria has been assessed as met
-   Major damage criteria has been established, the customer has clearly
    demonstrated how they have met the criteria. For information see the
    Process page when assessing 'major damage' and 'reasonably close'
-   If the Service Officer doubts the validity of the customer’s claim,
    evidence should be requested before escalating to the Emergency
    Management Technical Peer Support

The Emergency Management Technical Peer Support reviews the customer's
record to ensure all information has been provided/documented. If more
information is required, they advise the Service Officer to:

-   ask the customer to provide the information required, and
-   place the claim on hold with the relevant keyword

If all information has been provided, the Emergency Management Technical
Peer Support escalates the claim to the Emergency Management Level 2
Helpdesk/TPS. See the Escalation of claims from the Emergency Management
Technical Peer Support to the Emergency Management Level 2 Helpdesk
table in Assessing eligibility for the Australian Government Disaster
Recovery Payment (AGDRP) or ex-gratia Disaster Recovery Payment (DRP).

If the customer’s principal place of residence is more than 15km from
the closest burn scar, evidence to support the major damage assessment
should be requested. Once evidence has been provided a referral is made
to the Emergency Management Technical Peer Support for escalation to
Emergency Management Level 2 Helpdesk.

Eligibility for payments

To be eligible to receive a payment, a customer must have been impacted

Customers can:

-   call the Australian Government Emergency Information Line on 180 22

these claims.

Claims cannot be rejected until formal approval has been provided. Staff

Payment methods

There are a range of payment methods available for customers advising
they are in financial hardship. These include:

-   New Payments Platform (NPP)
-   Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) payments

Discuss the preferred method of payment for the customer. Use of NPP and
RTGS will help customers adversely affected by the major disaster
receive their payment/s faster.

Note: NPP is not available for all banks including Bank of Queensland,
however RTGS is available for most banks. Check which payment methods
are available before discussing payment options with the customer.

NPP is capped at $3,000. Any attempt to transfer more than that amount
will result in no funds being transferred in that attempt.

Claims must be finalised before using the NPP. For further information
see Immediate payment by payment method New Payments Platform (NPP).

Additional Child Care Subsidy (ACCS) (Temporary Financial Hardship)

Customers may be able to get ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship) if they
have been impacted by a declared disaster.

To support an application for ACCS (Temporary Financial Hardship)
customers must:

-   provide evidence that the event(s) occurred less than six months
    prior to the application
-   demonstrate a causal link between the event(s) and their financial
    hardship

Note: where the customer or their partner is/has received the AGDRP they
will need to show proof of this payment and no further evidence will be
required to demonstrate financial hardship.

If a customer wants to apply for ACCS transfer the customer to 13  6150.
