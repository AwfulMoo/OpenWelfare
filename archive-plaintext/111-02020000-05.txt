|                                   | Archive retrieval requests take a |
|                                   | few minutes to a few hours        |
|                                   | depending on the number of users  |
|                                   | on the system. There tends to be  |
|                                   | fewer users before 11am AEST, so  |
|                                   | archive requests may take less    |
|                                   | time to retrieve before this      |
|                                   | time.                             |
