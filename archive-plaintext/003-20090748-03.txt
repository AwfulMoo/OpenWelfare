Rejecting a claim

Do not follow this procedure for self-isolation, quarantine or caring
periods that start on or after 18 January 2022. See Processing Pandemic
Leave Disaster Payment Claims in Process Direct

Table 7: Process to follow if a customer’s claim is to be rejected. Do
not use this table for customers with multiple claims, or for claims
with a self-isolation, quarantine or caring period that ends on or
before 1 August 2020.

If a customer contacts the agency after a claim has been rejected to
provide more information or to advise they disagree with a decision
made, they can request an explanation of the decision. A formal review
cannot be undertaken. Do not run the Disaster Recovery Payment Claims
workflow again to change the decision.
