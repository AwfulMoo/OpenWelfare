This document describes the processes for managing representatives with
ordinary authority for child support customers.

What is a Child Support representative?

Services Australia is authorised to disclose child support information
about a parent or carer to another person with the customer's consent.
This document includes the process for a person to authorise the
disclosure of their child support information to a representative of
their choice. This is a form of express authority and is usually done so
the authorised person can represent the customer in their dealings with
Child Support.

A person authorised in this way is referred to as the customer's
authorised representative. An authorised representative has ordinary
authority, rather than authority to act as the customer's agent, for
example, as occurs with power of attorney. A representative with
ordinary authority is limited in terms of what they can do for the
customer. This document explains those limits and provides general
information about how Child Support manages representatives with
ordinary authority.

For more information about representatives who are authorised agents,
such as those with power of attorney or legal guardianship, see Child
Support authorised agent.

The Resources page contains a link to the Child Support representative
authority form.
