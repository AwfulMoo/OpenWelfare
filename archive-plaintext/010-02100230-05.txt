|                                   | community of Oombulgurri and      |
|                                   | Michael lives away from home to   |
|                                   | study in Perth. Michael is        |
|                                   | approved for end of term travel.  |
|                                   | Michael must take a flight from   |
|                                   | Perth to Broome and then catch a  |

|                                   | Kununurra. Michael then takes a   |

|                                   | Oombulgurri. The flight from      |
|                                   | Broome to Kununurra is delayed    |
|                                   | due to mechanical problems and    |

|                                   | not land at Oombulgurri after 6   |
|                                   | pm so Michael has to stay         |
|                                   | overnight in Kununurra and catch  |
|                                   | the charter plane to Oombulgurri  |

|                                   | on the return trip home. Freda    |

|                                   | this. Freda writes Samara was     |
|                                   | supplied with a fixed price board |
|                                   | and accommodation package,        |
|                                   | covering all meals and            |
|                                   | accommodation. Freda has not      |
|                                   | listed the individual meal types  |
|                                   | or costs. The claim is assessed   |
|                                   | by the same Service Officer who   |
|                                   | processed Samara's previous       |
|                                   | claim. The separate amounts       |
|                                   | charged for the individual food   |
|                                   | items in Example 2 are equal to   |
|                                   | the fixed price package charged   |
|                                   | this time. Fixed board and        |
|                                   | accommodation packages must be    |
|                                   | used by the assessor when         |
|                                   | comparing the ATO's travel        |
|                                   | allowance figures. The amount     |
|                                   | reimbursed to Samara is the full  |
|                                   | accommodation and meals package   |
|                                   | charged by Freda, which is higher |
|                                   | than the amount reimbursed for    |
|                                   | the forward trip. This is because |
|                                   | where board and accommodation are |
|                                   | provided at a fixed price, the    |
|                                   | fixed price must be used.         |
