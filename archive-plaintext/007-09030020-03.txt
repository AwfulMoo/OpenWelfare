|                                   | from date paid to + 1 (DPT+1).    |

|                                   | Cancelling the PPL CRQ is an      |
|                                   | administrative decision, and not  |
|                                   | made under the PPL Act. Customers |
|                                   | cannot appeal the CRQ             |
|                                   | cancellation reason if they later |
|                                   | change their mind. A cancelled    |
|                                   | PPL payment may be restored if    |
|                                   | the customer has maintained       |
|                                   | eligibility. If restoring the     |
|                                   | payment, check with the customer  |
|                                   | for any change in circumstances   |
|                                   | (for example, return to work). If |
|                                   | after cancellation there has been |
|                                   | a change in circumstances, these  |
|                                   | changes must be coded in the      |
|                                   | restoration activity. This may    |
|                                   | result in PPL cancelling after    |
|                                   | restoring for another reason. See |
