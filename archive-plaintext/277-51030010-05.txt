Voluntary child support coded on or after 1 January 2011 is included in
the MIT from the date the voluntary child support started. It is not
applied from the start date of the DMA period, unless the child support
and the Maintenance Action Test (MAT) have the same date of effect.

Table 1: this table describes how voluntary child support collected
during a DMA period is assessed in the MIT and how to code discharged
child support arrears.

|                                   | Worker therefore grants a partial |
