About Customer Record

Customer Record enables users to navigate to legacy systems used by
Services Australia. For:

-   Centrelink - Customer Record enables users to navigate to Income
    Security Integrated System (ISIS) screens and launch Scripts. It
    provides users with a separate access point outside of Customer
    First and should only be used where the required functionality is
    not available in Customer First
-   Medicare - Customer Record enables users to navigate to the Medicare
    Mainframe (Medicare Emulator) without the need to leave Customer
    First

Scripts for Centrelink staff

Scripts are only available to Centrelink staff from Customer Record.
They automate and standardise the processing of routine work done by
staff.

The Resources page contains a link to the Customer Record keyboard
mapping document for Medicare.
