This procedure only applies to Centrelink International Services and
some ABSTUDY claims. For Centrelink payments and services use the
Identity Confirmation Dashboard in Process Direct, see Identity
Confirmation.

This document outlines how to use the legacy Proof of Identity Amendment
(POIA) screen.

POIA screen

Staff can use the Legacy POIA screen to:

-   amend POI document details when they have been incorrectly coded
-   insert correct POI documents, and
-   delete incorrect POI documents

To make these changes on the Legacy POIA screen, the customer must be
current and the POI indicator on the legacy Proof of Identity Summary
(POIS) screen must be Y.

If a customer is on a POI exemption, documents can be added via the
Legacy POI screen as usual.

If a customer has not reached standard POI, it is not possible to
correct the serial numbers of documents already coded. These can only be
corrected when standard POI is reached.

Documents should only be updated if previous coding is clearly
incorrect. If the document details have changed over time, do not update
the Legacy POI screen. For example, when there is a different expiry
date on a passport or licence. This includes when a document is provided
as part of the Legacy Abridged POI process.

Access to the Legacy POIA screen is restricted in each site. Only
Identity Subject Matter Experts (SME) and Technical Support Staff have
access. Service Officers need to contact their Identity SME with details
of documents that need to be amended, inserted or deleted.
