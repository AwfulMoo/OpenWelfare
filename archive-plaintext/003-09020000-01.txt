This document explains the role of Services Australia in the early
release of superannuation benefits on severe financial hardship grounds.

Overview

A person generally cannot access their superannuation money before
reaching their preservation age, except if they meet the conditions for
financial hardship.

Financial hardship conditions are in Sub-regulation 6.01 (5) and (5A) of
the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations 1994. The
Resources page includes a link to the Australian Taxation Office website
for more information.

The customer needs to meet the financial hardship requirements in the
superannuation legislation. One of those requirements is about getting
income support.

The customer's superannuation fund decides if the customer:

-   is in financial hardship, and
-   if they are eligible for an early release of their superannuation

The only role of Services Australia is to confirm the customer meets the
income support requirement. Even if the customer meets the income
support requirements, the superannuation fund is responsible for the
decision to release the funds to the customer.

Eligibility letters

The agency can give the customer an eligibility letter confirming the
customer meets the income support requirement for the early release of
superannuation. It is valid for 21 days.

If a customer needs it after 21 days, another letter can be issued.

A copy of the letter is automatically issued to the customer’s myGov
inbox if they receive their Centrelink letters online.

Customers with an involuntary nominee arrangement

An involuntary nominee arrangement is where a third party has been given
legal right to administer the customer's affairs as the result of a:

-   court
-   tribunal
-   guardianship, or
-   administration order

If the Reason for Arrangement on the NORS screen is CRT (Court appointed
involuntary nominee arrangement) or PAI (Power of Attorney involuntary
nominee arrangement):

-   under no circumstances is an eligibility letter to be issued at the
    request of this customer without their nominee's approval
-   contact must be made with their nominee and approval obtained before
    issuing the letter. The name of the person who gave the approval,
    must be included in the DOC. A copy of the eligibility letter must
    then to be sent to the nominee
-   if the nominee does not provide approval or cannot be contacted, the
    Service Officer must reject the request for the letter. The customer
    should be advised that the letter needs to be requested by their
    nominee

Centrelink Confirmation eServices (CCeS)

CCeS is used to confirm the customer meets the income support
requirement for early release of superannuation electronically, without
requiring an eligibility letter from the agency.

To use CCeS, the superannuation fund administrators or trustees must:

-   be registered for the service
-   have the customer's permission

CCeS is fast and effective, and reduces the risk of fraud. If a
superannuation fund is interested in registering for CCeS, they should
contact the National Business Gateway - Confirmation Services Helpdesk.

Decisions cannot be reviewed or appealed

The information given by the agency is explained in the:

-   Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations 1994, and
-   Retirement Savings Account Regulations 1997

There are no provisions for the agency to:

-   review the decision if the customer does not meet the income support
    requirements
-   apply discretion in individual cases

Even if the customer meets the income support requirements, the
superannuation fund is responsible for the decision to release the funds
to the customer.

Compassionate grounds

Claims for release of superannuation on compassionate grounds are
assessed by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).

Tell the customer to visit the ATO website for more information.
