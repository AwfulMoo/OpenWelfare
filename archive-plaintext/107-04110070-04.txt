Family payment system transition debts in the 2000-01 financial year

For the 2000-01 financial year only, measures to assist families in the
transition to the new family payment system were introduced. These were
for debts resulting from:

-   the family assistance reconciliation
-   the Australian Tax Office (ATO) amended tax notice of assessment
    (TNA) re-reconciliation, and
-   Services Australia family assistance generated re-reconciliation

Eligibility for the one-off $1,000 waiver

The Government has decided that in some cases, there will be a one-off
waiver of the first $1,000 of:

-   a Family Tax Benefit (FTB) overpayment, and
-   Child Care Benefit (CCB) overpayment

Those eligible for the waiver include:

-   customers paid FTB via instalments during 2000-01
-   mixed delivery customers (customers who have been paid instalments
    and paid via an FTB ATO claim or agency past period claim for
    2000-01), and
-   CCB customers
