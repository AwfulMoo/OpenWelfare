|                                   | For most customers advising they, |
|                                   | and/or their partner (if          |
|                                   | applicable), have ceased work in  |
|                                   | the last 12 months, an SU1 will   |
|                                   | be required for each employer.    |
|                                   | However, there are certain        |
|                                   | circumstances, where an SU1 may   |
|                                   | not be required. The following    |
|                                   | circumstances determine when an   |
|                                   | SU1 may not be required:          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Single Touch Payroll (STP)        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | STP cessation data may pre-fill   |
|                                   | during statement reporting or     |
|                                   | within an online claim. If the    |
|                                   | cessation details are confirmed   |
|                                   | by the customer, an SU1 is not    |
|                                   | required for that employer,       |
|                                   | unless changes have been made to  |
|                                   | amounts paid or there is any      |
|                                   | doubt about the number of days    |
|                                   | for leave or termination          |
|                                   | payments.                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Note: STP data does not prefill   |
|                                   | the number of days or period      |
|                                   | covered for these payments.       |
|                                   | Therefore it is important to      |
|                                   | review the days provided by the   |
|                                   | customer is reasonable for the    |
|                                   | amount paid, example: $3,000 for  |
|                                   | one day's leave is not reasonable |
|                                   | and would need to be verified.    |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | If a customer is still employed   |
|                                   | but has had the number of working |
|                                   | hours reduced, an SU1 is not      |
|                                   | required as their employment has  |
|                                   | not been terminated. If the       |
|                                   | customer was a casual or          |
|                                   | part-time employee but is no      |
|                                   | longer employed an SU1 is         |
