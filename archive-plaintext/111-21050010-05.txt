This page contains two tables, one for customer circumstances and the
automatically generated text the workflow creates and one of the prompts
that will require a checkbox to be selected to create a DOC.

There are two major groups of auto generated text, those that are
produced based on the customer circumstances and those that are event
based and would be triggered after certain actions in the workflow, for
example, checking that a discussion has occurred for a specific prompt,
or answering a particular question in the workflow.

A hierarchy is used to indicate which information is shown first on the
DOC summary/extra detail line in Online Document Recording (ODR). If
more than one update exists a plus (+) sign will appear on the extra
detail line to indicate that there is additional information contained
in the DOC as well as the indicated DOC text. See the table below for
hierarchy details.
