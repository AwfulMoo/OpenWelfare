This document outlines what action to take when a customer requests to
vary their restricted percentage via the Local Community Panel process.

Community Panels

Under the Cashless Debit Card (CDC), legislation allows the Minister to
authorise the establishment of a community body via legislative
instrument, called a community panel.

Community panels currently exist in the trial locations of Ceduna and
East Kimberly (Kununurra and Wyndham) only. There are no local Community
Panels for CDC customers on the Goldfields region or the Bundaberg and
Hervey Bay region.

Community Panels can provide a written direction to Services Australia
to vary an applicant’s restricted amount of payment so that it is
between 80 and 50 per cent of their total Centrelink payment. This gives
customers the option to apply for a reduction in the restricted portion
of their income support payment to give them access to more cash.

Customers can apply to vary their restricted amount by completing an
application form. Application forms can be obtained from Services
Australia Website, a Centrelink Service Centre or a Local Partner.

Application forms can be returned to a Centrelink Service Centre. The
Service Officer will scan the form to the customer’s record and send an
email to the Community Panel Administrator (Welfare Quarantining
Management Team) for progression.
