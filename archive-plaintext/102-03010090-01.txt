This document outlines information on changing the address of a care
recipient when they have moved permanently into residential aged care.

Moving to an aged care home

This information covers when a care recipient enters residential aged
care or moves from one aged care home to another. It does not cover when
a care recipient leaves residential aged care, see Change of address
from an aged care home.

There are 2 main ways Services Australia (the agency) receives
notification that a care recipient has moved into permanent residential
care:

The care recipient or correspondence nominee notifies of the move if the
care recipient is currently in receipt of an income support payment
(ISP) from the agency. ISP customers must notify the agency of a change
of address within 14 days, including:

-   name and address of the aged care home
-   type of residential aged care service (for example, approved aged
    care provider or Multi-purpose service facility)
-   whether the care recipient has paid, or agreed to pay any
    accommodation costs including a refundable accommodation deposit
    (RAD) or a refundable accommodation contribution (RAC)
-   date of entry into care

Aged Care data matching occurs when the aged care home notifies the
agency of a care recipient’s entry into residential aged care

-   Name of the aged care home and date of admission will be populated
    onto the RCIRC screen source of these activities will be *RC when
    created automatically
-   Do not use entry details to update a care recipient’s address unless
    approved by an APS5 (as per item 60 in the Aged Care Act 1997 and
    Accountability Principles 2014 – Delegations Instrument) or above.
    Note: this only applies to care recipients with no family remaining
    in the home, or an authorised third party to act on their behalf

Care recipient was homeowner before moving to an aged care home

If a care recipient receives an income support payment (ISP) from the
agency and was a homeowner before moving to residential aged care, the
care recipient or authorised third party must give the information
below:

-   The value and status of the former principal home. Note: not needed
    if a protected person lives in the former principal home. See Aged
    care means assessment – protected person for more information
-   Any amount paid as an accommodation bond (pre 1 July 2014),
    refundable accommodation deposit (RAD) or refundable accommodation
    contribution (RAC)
-   If the care recipient is in an Australian Government subsidised bed
    in an approved aged care home
-   The address the care recipient/nominee wants their mail sent to

Care recipients who have a temporary change of address to an aged care
home for respite care need to notify the agency.

Rental income received for a care recipient’s former principal home may
be exempt for ISP customers who:

-   entered permanent residential care prior to 1 January 2017
-   are renting their former principal home, and
-   are paying their accommodation costs by a periodic payment,
    including when a partial lump sum is paid

For aged care, this rental income exemption applies to care recipients
who entered care before 1 January 2016 (including pre-entry leave). See
Aged Care means assessment - Rental income from principal home for more
information.

One or both members of a couple moving to an aged care home

If one or both members of a couple enter residential aged care (for
example, aged care home, Multi-purpose service facility, nursing home
type patient in hospital awaiting entry to residential aged care) both
partners are considered to be 'illness separated' even if they move into
the same aged care home.

This procedure does not apply for income support payment (ISP) customers
who are moving in to a retirement village.

Care recipient paid rent before moving to an aged care home

Income support payment (ISP) customers paying rent for accommodation
immediately before entering permanent residential aged care are entitled
to receive rent assistance for up to 14 days following their entry into
care.

This only applies if the care recipient is still liable to pay rent
following their entry into care.
