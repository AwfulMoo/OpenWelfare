This document outlines procedures that explain the bereavement
assistance available when a Parenting Payment customer, their partner or
child dies. The procedures explain how to record details when a death is
notified.

Government intent

When a person contacts Services Australia after the death of a person or
child, the primary outcome is to provide appropriate bereavement
assistance and services.

Confirmation of death

The death must be confirmed before any action is taken. Once confirmed,
it is important that the death be recorded as soon as possible to ensure
that customers receive their correct entitlement.

The procedures required to complete a death action vary according to
which family member has died and which payments the family were
receiving.
