The Student Financial Supplement Scheme (SFSS) closed from 1 January
2004. Since December 2005 all outstanding Financial Supplement Loans
(FSL) have been transferred to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) for
recovery.

This page contains a table of information for Service Officers to use to
assist customers with enquiries about the effect of bankruptcy on
repayment of the Financial Supplement Loan (FSL).
