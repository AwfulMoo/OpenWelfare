Study requirements

In general, the student meets the qualifying study requirements if:

-   they are enrolled in a course, or they are a continuing student /
    intending student who intends to enrol in a course of education at
    an educational institution, and
-   the course is an approved course of education or study and
-   the study load is either full-time (at least 75% of the normal
    amount of full-time study), or a concessional study load (i.e. at
    least 25% or 66% of the normal amount of full-time study).

Note: a customer cannot be considered to be undertaking qualifying study
if they are employed on a full-time basis as an apprentice or trainee
including Australian Apprenticeships (apprentice or trainee).

Completed Masters or Doctorate level courses

A customer who has completed a Master or Doctorate level course in
Australia or an overseas qualification of the same standing cannot
qualify for PES.
