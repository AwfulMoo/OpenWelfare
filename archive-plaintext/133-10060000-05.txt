|                                   | In January 2005, Australian       |
|                                   | Health Ministers agreed that the  |
|                                   | AODR would become a register of   |
|                                   | consent. This would allow a       |
|                                   | person to record their legal      |
|                                   | decision to become an organ or    |
|                                   | tissue donor after death.         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | To ensure consent is legally      |
|                                   | valid, only people aged 18 years  |
|                                   | or over can record their consent  |
|                                   | on the Donor Register. Children   |
|                                   | aged 16 and 17 can register their |
|                                   | intent. Consent from their        |
|                                   | families is still needed for      |
|                                   | transplantations.                 |

|                                   | Registrations from children under |
|                                   | 16 cannot be recorded. The Donor  |
|                                   | Register is bound by State and    |
|                                   | Territory consent legislation.    |
|                                   | Not all jurisdictions support     |
|                                   | children signing legal consent to |
|                                   | organ donation.                   |

|                                   | Children aged under 16 can still  |
|                                   | become organ and/or tissue        |
|                                   | donors. Their parent or guardian  |
|                                   | needs to give consent at the time |
|                                   | of death.                         |
