System for processing claims

When processing Carer Payment and/or Carer Allowance child claims, it is
expected that if an SA408 or SA394 is lodged as part of a paper claim,
it will be coded in Process Direct (PD). However, there will occasions
where it may need to be coded in Customer First (CF)/ Customer Record
(CR) (for example, reviews and reassessments).

About the form

To accurately assess the Care Needs Assessment of the care receiver,
enter the answers provided on the form completed by the carer. Coding
can be found in the tables below for each question

During the assessment, If the Service Officer is not satisfied that any
response on the CNA questionnaire is an accurate reflection of the
child's functional ability, behaviour and special care needs, the
service officer is to a make determination if the response should be
included in the Care Needs Assessment, or they may request further
information to clarify the response if required.

Note: If a carer marks more than 1 answer to any question, excluding
questions 54 and 55 which allow multiple responses, only the answer that
gives the highest score (that is, the most beneficial) will be taken
into account and disregard the other responses. Note: This is different
to coding the THP.
