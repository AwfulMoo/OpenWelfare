|                                   | The reconciliation process will   |
|                                   | take into account the customer's  |
|                                   | annualised actual income.         |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | income will need to be annualised |
|                                   | manually.                         |

|                                   | Final reconciliation will only    |
|                                   | occur where both the partner (if  |
|                                   | applicable) and the estate has    |
|                                   | lodged an Income Tax Return or at |
|                                   | the end of the lodgement year.    |
