correct withholdings, and payments received.

Debt management systems

Services Australia has a number of systems that manage financial
information raising, recording, and recovering debts. Information
exchanges between these systems ensure correct:

-   withholdings and
-   record of payments

ESSentials and DMIS

For financial accounting purposes ESSentials maintains records of all
payments received and made. Only record payments in DMIS when:

-   the money has already been receipted and verified within ESSentials
    and
-   the details have not and will not be credited to DMIS via the
    interface

The Resources page contains links to Services Australia website,
mySupport, ESSentials task cards, and self-service information.
