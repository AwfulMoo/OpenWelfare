This document outlines information on payments and concession cards
available to customers serving the Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting
Period (NARWP).

Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Period (NARWP)

Migrants who arrive in Australia or who are granted permanent residence
are normally subject to a Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Period
(NARWP) before they can receive most (but not all) social security
payments and concession cards. The NARWP is determined by the grant date
of the first permanent resident visa or temporary visa providing
qualification for payment.

From 1 January 2019, changes to waiting periods came into effect. See
Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Period (NARWP) for full details
relating to these changes.

In certain circumstances, customers may be entitled to some payments and
concession cards while serving the NARWP.

Payments/concessions available while serving NARWP

The following payments and concessions may be available while a customer
is serving the NARWP:

-   Child Care Subsidy (CCS)
-   Disability Support Pension (DSP)
-   Double Orphan Pension (DOP)
-   Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part B
-   Health Care Card (HCC)
-   Stillborn Baby Payment (SBP)

International social security agreements

Customers who have previously lived or worked in a country which has an
International social security agreement may use the agreement to qualify
for payments such as Age Pension, Disability Support Pension, Carer
Payment or Parenting Payment single.

The Resources page outlines exemptions from the NARWP in various
payments.
