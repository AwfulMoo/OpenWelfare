|                                   | focus on cases where the customer |
|                                   | has had a high number of          |
|                                   | unapproved absences in a term.    |
|                                   | Absence from school does not      |
|                                   | result in loss of qualification   |
|                                   | for payment. However, a high      |
|                                   | level of unapproved absences      |
|                                   | maybe an indicator that the       |
|                                   | student may have ceased studies.  |

|                                   | shows that the student has not    |
|                                   | ceased studies, they remain       |
|                                   | qualified for payment but may     |
|                                   | potentially be required to enter  |
|                                   | into an Activity Agreement.       |

|                                   | Act 1991, informing the customer  |

|                                   | office or contact Services        |
|                                   | Australia. The Q001 notice is to  |
|                                   | be sent which provides an         |
|                                   | opportunity to enter the relevant |

|                                   | entered, Service Centres that     |
|                                   | operate interviews via walk-in    |
|                                   | appointments can enter a          |

|                                   | (for example, 'anytime between    |
|                                   | 9:00am and 12:00pm').             |

|                                   | days, a Q001 letter should not be |
|                                   | sent as it would not reach the    |
|                                   | student in time, however a        |
|                                   | written notice must still be      |
|                                   | provided to the customer at the   |
|                                   | time they attend the Service      |
|                                   | Centre.                           |

|                                   | Once a the customer has been      |
|                                   | advised of the requirement to     |

|                                   | that staff can follow-up on their |

|                                   | Note: the Q001 will require an    |
|                                   | appointment date and time to be   |
|                                   | added, even though this may not   |
|                                   | be able to be recorded in the     |

|                                   | available are still able to       |
|                                   | invite the customer to a          |
|                                   | scheduled appointment and book    |
|                                   | them in as a walk-in when they    |
