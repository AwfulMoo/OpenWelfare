This document provides an overview of a Job Capacity Assessment (JCA).

Job Capacity Assessment (JCA)

Assessors undertake a JCA to assess a customer's level of functional
impairment and work capacity due to a medical condition(s), to
determine:

-   the permanent or temporary nature of medical condition(s)
-   an impairment rating(s) if applicable
-   Continuing Inability To Work (CITW)
-   if the customer fulfils the requirement to have actively
    participated in a Program of Support (POS)

A JCA may be required when a customer:

-   applies for Disability Support Pension (DSP)
-   is in receipt of DSP and requires a review of their ongoing
    eligibility
-   lodges an appeal following a rejection of DSP on medical grounds
-   requires assessment for the purpose of determining eligibility under
    the 'no future work capacity' portability provisions
-   claims Special Benefit paid under DSP criteria
-   needs to be assessed for Supported Wage System (SWS) but is not in
    receipt of an income support payment
-   are required to have their level of impairment and work capacity
    assessed for the purposes of eligibility for Principal Beneficiary
    of a Special Disability Trust

Interview format and viewing JCA

The mode of a JCA will default to phone however may also include file
and face-to-face/video conferencing assessments as determined by
Assessment Services. JCA appointment details can be viewed in Customer
First using the Online Diary workflow. Appointment Summary is located on
the Provider Summary screen. The JCA report is completed after the
Assessor conducts the JCA interview via the Department of Education,
Skills and Employment's Employment Services System (ESSWeb).

The status of any completed JCA or ESAt reports are checked on:

-   the Referral Summary (RRSUM) screen in Customer First, or
-   More Options menu in Process Direct. Select the DSP Claim Summary
    function and the JCA/ESAt icon

Contents of the JCA

The JCA may contain:

-   the Assessor's and, if necessary, any Contributing Assessor's
    qualifications, see the Resources page
-   interpreter details and vendor number, if used
-   the customer's medical condition(s) including verified status,
    and/or fully diagnosed, treated and stabilised status (FDTS)

    functional impacts and work history, see Work Capacity
-   employment history, including qualifications, vocational goals and
    previous POS
-   vulnerability indicators
-   identified current and addressed barriers, and appropriate
    interventions including recommended referral to Employment Service
    Provider (ESP)
-   for Disability Employment Services referrals (DES), identified
    employment support requirements, including the type of support
    recommended and the period for which support is required
-   a summary of information not captured in the assessment, such as
    mode of assessment if different from the referring assessment mode,
    medical conditions with no impacts, recommended referral information
    including deferred referrals, unsuccessful contact attempts with a
    Treating Health Professional (THP), risk assessment and verbal
    consent
-   any consultation with the Health Professional Advisory Unit (HPAU)
-   if the report contains any information which might be prejudicial to
    the customer's health if released

Fully diagnosed, treated and stabilised (FDTS)

Fully diagnosed & fully treated

In assessing if a medical condition has been fully diagnosed by an
appropriately qualified medical practitioner and if it has been fully
treated, consider:

-   if there is supportive evidence of the condition
-   what reasonable treatment or rehabilitation has occurred in relation
    to the condition, and
-   if treatment is continuing or is planned in the next 2 years

Reasonable treatment meets all the following:

-   is available at a location reasonably accessible to the person
-   is at a reasonable cost
-   can reliably be expected to result in a substantial improvement in
    functional capacity
-   is regularly undertaken or performed
-   has a high success rate, and
-   carries a low risk to the person

A condition is fully stabilised if:

either the customer has undertaken reasonable treatment for the medical
condition and any further reasonable treatment is unlikely to result in
significant functional improvement to a level enabling the customer to
undertake work in the next 2 years, or

the customer has not undertaken reasonable treatment for the medical
condition and:

-   significant functional improvement to a level enabling the customer
    to undertake work in the next 2 years is not expect to result, even
    if the person undertakes reasonable treatment, or
-   there is a medical of other compelling reason for the customer not
    to undertake reasonable treatment

Insufficient medical evidence to conduct a JCA

All medical/sensitive information relevant to a JCA must be scanned and
attached to the customer's electronic Medical Information File Envelope
(eMIFE). In the event that a customer does not supply sufficient medical
evidence prior to or at the time of their JCA, the assessment will
proceed with the available medical evidence at hand.

Work capacity

A customer is assessed as having a Temporary Reduced Work Capacity
(TRWC) if they have been assessed by an Assessor as being temporarily
unable to work for at least 30 hours per week because of a medical
condition.

A Partial Capacity to Work (PCW) is decided based on permanent verified
medical conditions. The customer is assessed as having a PCW if both
'baseline work capacity' and 'with intervention' work capacity are
assessed to be less than 30 hours per week. Assessors select a
bandwidth(s) for 'baseline' and 'with intervention' work capacity from
the following bandwidths:

-   0-7 hour per week
-   8-14 hours per week
-   15-22 hours per week
-   23-29 hours per week
-   30+ hours per week

Customers with a PCW or a TRWC of 0-7 or 8-14 hours per week of 12 weeks
or more in duration, will be required to attend compulsory quarterly
participation interviews with Services Australia to fully meet their
requirements, unless they are:

-   over 35 and in receipt of DSP, or
-   undertaking paid work or self-employment within their bandwidth

Customers who fail to attend a compulsory quarterly interview
appointment may have their payment suspended.

Customers with an assessed TRWC of 0-7 or 8-14 hours per week of less
than 12 weeks in duration will not have a quarterly interview
requirement. Instead, these customers will fully meet their requirements
by lodging their Reporting Statement and attending appointments with
Services Australia if requested.

Customers with a PCW or TRWC of either 0-7 or 8-14 hours per week are
still required to meet mutual obligation requirements, with the
following exceptions:

-   while these customers are always encouraged to participate with
    Employment Services Providers, they cannot be penalised if they
    choose not to do so
-   customers with a TRWC of 0-7 hours per week. Customers cannot be
    referred to Disability Employment Services (DES) but can be referred
    to Workforce Australia, and
-   to fully meet their requirements through paid work instead of
    attending quarterly interviews, the hours of work must be within
    their bandwidth (for example, at least 8 hours per week, if they
    have a PCW of 8-14 hours per week)

A customer who lodges a medical certificate (seeking exemption from
mutual obligation requirements) may be referred for an Employment
Services Assessment (ESAt) to assess their PCW or TRWC where there is
not already a current and valid assessment of the customer's work
capacity. The referral for an ESAt should not delay the decision about
the temporary incapacity exemption. In all cases, the decision about
whether to grant an exemption is based on available evidence, including
the medical certificate completed by the customer's treating doctor.

A customer is assessed as having a Continuing Inability To Work (CITW)
if their medical condition(s) prevents them from being able to work for
more than 15 hours or more per week, and when:

-   educational
-   pre-vocational
-   vocational, or
-   work related training is unlikely to enable the customer to do any
    work for 15 or more hours per week, within 2 years, independently of
    a program of support.
    A CITW must be met in addition to meeting other eligibility criteria
    for DSP

For the purposes of work capacity, 'work' is considered to be any work.
It is not limited by the work the customer usually performs nor, work
available in the customer's area. It is expected that a person will be
capable of reliably performing work on a sustainable basis, that is, for
a reasonable period of time without requiring excessive sick leave or
work absences. In this context, a reasonable period of time generally
means 26 weeks and work means work in open, unsupported employment. Sick
leave or absences of 1 month or more (in total) taken in any given 26
week period are considered excessive.

Disability Medical Assessment (DMA)

For Disability Support Pension (DSP) new claims and appeals, (with the
exception of manifestly eligible), where the JCA recommends a potential
grant, the system will automatically refer them to a DMA with a
Government-contracted Doctor (GCD) to confirm medical eligibility. For
information about the DMA referral process, see Assessing a new claim
for Disability Support Pension (DSP) after a Job Capacity Assessment
(JCA).

Managing customer appointments for a JCA

JCA appointments cannot be rescheduled, cancelled or mode of assessment
adjusted by Service Officers, Assessment Services must be contacted.

It is in the customer's best interest to attend the JCA appointment and
have an opportunity to discuss their case with the Assessor to
contribute to the assessment of their medical condition(s).
Non-attendance will mean they will miss the opportunity to discuss their
case with the Assessor and the assessment will be completed using the
available information. See Job Capacity Assessment (JCA) and Employment
Service Assessment (ESAT) appointments.

Interpreters will be arranged by Assessment Services staff where this
requirement is identified on the customer's record.

Specialist Assessments for Disability Support Pension (DSP)

Assessors can arrange a specialist assessment to assist in completing a
JCA report and, in some circumstances where the medical evidence
supplied to the Assessor for an ESAt indicates the person may be
eligible for DSP, and the:

-   necessary information does not currently exist and is essential for
    completion of the ESAt or JCA report
-   available evidence is unclear or insufficient for the Assessor to
    complete the report
-   person is unable to obtain or supply additional evidence
-   Assessor is unable to obtain the necessary additional information or
    clarification from the person's treating doctor(s), the Health
    Professional Advisory Unit (HPAU) or Contributing Assessors

For internal specialist assessments with appropriately qualified
Assessors, notes are added to the future appointment to indicate that
the appointment is a specialist assessment. The specialist assessment
appointment details will then be able to be viewed in the online diary
in Process Direct.

JCA for pre-release prisoners or recently released prisoners

Claims for income support payments may be lodged up to 3 weeks prior to
the customer's release. For JCA queries related to this customer group,
contact Assessment Services.

Request to finalise an ESAt/JCA report to create a new JCA referral

A JCA referral can only be made when a previous ESAt/JCA report has a
status of 'Finalised'. See Request to finalise an Employment Services
Assessment (ESAt) or Job Capacity Assessment (JCA) report to create a
new JCA referral.

Release of JCA reports

Customers may request a copy of a JCA report. See Release of DSP Medical
Assessment Reports.
