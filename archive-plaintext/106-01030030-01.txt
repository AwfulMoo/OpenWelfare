This document outlines information about Australian South Sea Islanders
(ASSI).

Definition of ASSI customer

Australian South Sea Islanders (ASSI) are the descendants of South Sea
Islanders brought to Australia as indentured labour around the turn of
the twentieth century and have been identified by legislation as a
disadvantaged minority group. According to the Australian Bureau of
Statistics definition, this group excludes later voluntary migrants from
the South Pacific region.

They were formally recognised as a distinct cultural group by the
Australian Government in 1994 and by the Queensland State Parliament in
2000.

Around three quarters of ASSI live in Queensland or northern NSW. Many
gravitate to coastal towns such as Mackay, which has probably the
largest ASSI population in Australia.
