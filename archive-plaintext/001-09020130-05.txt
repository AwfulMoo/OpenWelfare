Identifying issues and challenges through effective interviewing

This table contains information central to the Service Officer's role in
conducting a thorough, detailed and accurate assessment of a job
seeker's situation and needs, including individual and family
circumstances. This needs to be done properly to ensure that any
subsequent actions (such as referrals for appropriate assistance) are
likely to lead to successful outcomes for the job seeker.
