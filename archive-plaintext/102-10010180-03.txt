| Cancellation (CAN)                | Cancelled records can sometimes   |

|                                   | When cancellation occurs, staff   |
|                                   | must ensure they consider the     |
|                                   | notification and actual           |
|                                   | cancellation date. Customers are  |
|                                   | notified of their cancellation at |
|                                   | different times of the            |
|                                   | cancellation. This depends on the |
|                                   | payment type and the cancellation |
|                                   | reason.                           |

|                                   | restored. Staff must ensure they  |
|                                   | review customer's record          |
|                                   | thoroughly when determining the   |

|                                   | Before cancelling a customer's    |
|                                   | payment, take care to establish   |
|                                   | that the customer has lost        |
|                                   | entitlement for that payment.     |

|                                   | When making an unfavourable       |
|                                   | decision, speak to the customer:  |

|                                   | -   explain the decision          |
|                                   | -   give them a chance to provide |

|                                   | -   advise their review and       |

|                                   | before finalising the decision.   |

E-J list of cancellation, suspension and rejection codes

Table 6: This table describes a list of E-J cancellation, suspension and
rejection codes relating to payments in the NSS System. The right hand
column indicates whether the payment may be restored at Smart Centre
Call or only at a Service Centre. Note: the Document List (DL) screen
should always be checked for information regarding the suspension as in
some cases it may not be appropriate to restore at the first point of
contact.

K-Z list of Cancellation, suspension and rejection codes

Table 8: This table describes a list of K-Z cancellation, suspension and
rejection codes relating to payments in the NSS System. The right hand
column indicates whether the payment may be restored at Smart Centre
Call or only at a service centre. Note: the Document List (DL) screen
should always be checked for information regarding the suspension as in
some cases it may not be appropriate to restore at the first point of
contact.
