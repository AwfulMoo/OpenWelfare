Integrated Care Customer Management

Service Officers in Integrated Care work in both the Centrelink and
Child Support programs. The following customer management processes
apply:

-   Child Support’s Customer Management Approach (CMA). Staff undertake
    Minimum Collection Activity and common activities until the care
    decision is made. See Common and specialised activities for Child
    Support staff
-   In scope Centrelink Business Imperatives. The Resources page
    contains a link to the Business Imperatives homepage.

Note: the 'Ready for Work' option in Customer First allocates work to
Integrated Care Subject Matter Expert (SME). Some Operational Blueprint
content refers to locating SME work via a report. This is not the
process for Integrated Care.

Real-time expectations

While on the phone with a customer, Service Officers will complete the
above activities and any other items within scope to finalise or
progress as far as possible. This would generally not include Family Tax
Benefit (FTB) new claims unless the customer is experiencing financial
hardship.

Integrated Care Service Officers must check the routing of the SCT
Referral intray (or other SCT intrays) on both customers. If the SCT
intrays are:

-   already routed to an Integrated Care Service Officer, lock relevant
    customers to that Service Officer
-   routed to a team’s none position, lock the customers to that team’s
    none position
-   not allocated and sitting in the Z – DISAGREED REFERRALS Cuba
    position. The receiving Integrated Care Service Officer will keep
    ownership and lock customers in dual systems as appropriate
