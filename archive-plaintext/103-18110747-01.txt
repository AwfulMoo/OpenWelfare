This document provides an overview of a part year tax statement request
for customers and includes information on how to access and issue part
year tax information.

Part year tax statements

A part year tax statement is required for management of a customer’s tax
affairs.

A part year tax statement provides a point in time advice on the
reportable taxable and non-taxable payments, tax withheld and Remote
Area Allowance amounts received by a customer for a specified time
period within the current financial year.

If the customer is deceased, see Requests for information after someone
has died.

Note: provision of part year tax information does not replace the end of
financial year Centrelink payment summary. Customers who request a part
year tax statement will still have a Centrelink payment summary
available that covers the full financial year from 1 July.

Request for information

Common circumstances a part year tax statement is requested and issued
are:

-   For the management of tax affairs
-   Death of a customer
-   Customer leaves Australia permanently and needs to finalise their
    tax affairs
-   Customer is currently residing permanently outside of Australia, or
-   Relationship breakdown

A customer or their representative can request part year tax information
via written request, or verbally over the phone or in person.

Note: if the information has been requested for a deceased customer, see
Requests for information after someone has died.
