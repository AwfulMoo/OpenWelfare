This document outlines how to help customers having trouble accessing
and using their Child Support online account and the Express Plus Child
Support mobile app.

Troubleshooting by Service Officers

Service Officers must help customers with common online problems.

Ask the customer questions to identify the problem. Confirm that the
problem lies with the online service and whether the customer can fix
it. Some problems can be quickly fixed.

Common problems:

-   no access to Child Support services through myGov
-   service interruptions
-   internet or Wi-Fi connection
-   mobile device, internet browser and settings
-   trouble accessing or using a service option

More help

If the Service Officer cannot resolve the issue, they seek help from a
Service Support Officer (SSO).

If the SSO cannot resolve the issue, they refer it to the ICT Service
Desk by submitting a mySupport request.

The Resources page contains links to the Services Australia website, a
demonstration version of a Child Support online account, and links for
more information and support.
