Table 2: this table outlines the security roles needed to access
different functions in WLM and Work Optimiser for the Medicare (MCA)
programme. Security roles are requested and approved in ESSentials. For
task card support when requesting a security role, go to ESSentials >
Help Home > User Access > Requestors.

|                                   | This reason is generally used     |

|                                   | should only be used for           |
