This document outlines the common types of letters issued by Centrelink.
It provides information on how to process incomplete letters and Manual
Follow-up (MFU) activities related to letters. It also links to
procedures about how to identify and create manual letters.

Government intent

Centrelink sends letters to customers notifying them about:

-   their obligations
-   changes to eligibility and entitlement
-   important policy changes

Batch Laser Advice (BLA) letters

Most letters sent to customers are 'batch' letters. Batch letters are
generated after 'end-of-day' processing and sent automatically as a
result of activity that has been completed on the customer's record.

Recent BLA letters are visible on the customer's History Summary (HS)
screen in Customer First or Customer Record. Older letters can be viewed
using the Archiving and Culling Engine (ACE).

Online Advice (OLA) letters

These are manually created by a Service Officer or specialist officer.

The most common reasons for creating OLAs are to:

-   let customers know of changes to their benefits and payments
-   tell customers their rights and responsibilities
-   request documents
-   ask customers to make or attend an appointment

Each OLA contains a 'shell' or template of standard text. Where required
staff enter variables or free text to complete the letter. Some OLA
letters are 'free text'. Wherever free text is entered, staff must make
sure it meets the standards for letters. Staff can preview OLAs before
finalising them for local or central print.

Recent OLA letters are visible on the customer's History Summary (HS)
screen in Customer First or Customer Record. Older letters can be viewed
using the Archiving and Culling Engine (ACE).

SAP OC letters

SAP OC is the new platform used to create and send letters. Most are
'batch' letters created as a result of activity on the customer's
record. Some are 'immediate' letters created by Service Officers, such
as requests for information and duplicate Rent Certificates.

SAP OC letters are visible for 120 days on the HS page in Process Direct
or the Search Outbound Correspondence page in Customer First. Older
letters can be viewed using the Archive Search option on the Search
Outbound Correspondence page.

Online letters

Customers who are subscribed to myGov Inbox for their Centrelink letters
will receive most of their letters via the inbox, for example:

-   BLA and SAP OC letters
-   some OLA letters

Most OLA letters can only be delivered by post.

Requesting copies of letters

Customers can request copies of original letters. See Viewing or
reissuing a letter or electronic message.

Requesting duplicate documents

[A self service option is available for customers.] Customers can use
Centrelink documents and appointments options online to request, view,
print and save documents. These include:

-   Income Statements
-   Payment Summaries
-   Deduction Statements
-   Rent Certificates, and
-   Reporting Statements (SU19)

Standards

Letters sent to customers must meet standards relating to plain English
and minimum content requirements.

Feedback

Staff can give feedback, suggest improvements or report errors for
forms, letters and electronic messages.

The Resources page contains:

-   links to the standards for letters
-   user guides
-   collections and delivery standards for Centrelink letters, and
-   how to give feedback or report errors
