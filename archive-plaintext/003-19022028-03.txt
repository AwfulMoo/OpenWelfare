Determining eligibility for AGDRP and ex-gratia DRP claims

Table 3: This table describes the steps to assess eligibility for
AGDRP/ex-gratia DRP for customers affected by Northern NSW Bushfires,
February 2019. Service Officers should not process a claim unless they
have completed formal training.
Note: if a customer is not eligible for AGDRP/ex-gratia DRP, claims are
still to be recorded and the outcome noted as rejected. Claims cannot be
rejected until formal approval has been provided. Staff will be notified
via an Operational Message once they are able to reject payments.
