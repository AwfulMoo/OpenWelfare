This document introduces the two quality checking frameworks for
transactions completed in Process Direct and Customer First in the
Centrelink master program.

Quality checking transactions in Process Direct

Transactions completed for a customer in Process Direct, create work
items that are subject to a quality assurance check using the Quality
Management Application (QMA) checking framework.

 

Quality checking transactions in Customer First

Transactions completed for a customer in Customer First, create
activities that are subject to a quality assurance check using the
Quality On Line (QOL) checking framework.

Quality checking principles

There are 2 quality checking principles, which are embedded in QMA and
QOL.

Payment Correctness - underpins the integrity of payments made by
Centrelink and is defined by The Four Pillars of Payment Correctness:

-   Right Person
-   Right Program
-   Right Rate
-   Right Date

Getting it Right Standards – enables staff to get it right for our
customers and supports payment correctness. For further details see
Quality standards in service delivery.

Quality Control

QMA and QOL are supported by quality assurance frameworks which include,
but are not limited to:

-   quality policy such as sampling
-   accreditation and review process of quality checkers
-   the outline of roles and responsibilities
-   the design, application and maintenance of checking tools
-   a reporting output used to identify and improve quality outcomes
