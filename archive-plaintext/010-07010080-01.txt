This document outlines the effect of late starting courses of study on
continuing payments for ABSTUDY customers.

Start date

For ABSTUDY, a late starting course is a course (including an
articulated short course sequence) that starts on or after 1 April (and
before 1 July) or after 31 July. The significance of late starting
courses is in relation to continuing students enrolling in a new course
and the ABSTUDY start date.

ABSTUDY and ABSTUDY Pensioner Education Supplement (PES)

Payment for a late starting course would start only from the first day
of that course (having ended on the appropriate date for the previous
course). Eligibility for other payments such as JobSeeker Payment (JSP)
may be considered for any period the customer cannot be paid as a
student.

Students are paid over the holiday period at the end of the semester or
year on the basis that they will continue studying again at the first
opportunity. A late starting course is not usually the first opportunity
to commence study. The customer would not be considered a continuing
student and so would not be paid as a student over the holiday period.

Unfavourable decisions

When making an unfavourable decision, speak to the customer:

-   explain the decision
-   give them a chance to provide more information, and
-   advise their review and appeal rights
