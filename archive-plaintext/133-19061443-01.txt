Channel preferences

Customers can choose to receive their letters and statements online or
by post. They can choose different channels for letters and statements,
or receive them all the same way.

The preferred channel preference is online. Encourage this at every
opportunity.

can view them in their myGov Inbox. Letters will remain available to
view in the customer’s myGov Inbox until the myGov account is closed.
Some letters will still be sent by post.
