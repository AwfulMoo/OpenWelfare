Examples - Home Equity Access Scheme fortnightly loan amounts payable

Table 2: this table provides examples of the fortnightly Home Equity
Access Scheme loan amounts payable (LON component).

The Maximum Pension Rate (MPR) is the sum of the maximum basic rate of
pension, and Pension Supplement, Energy Supplement and Rent Assistance
(RA) the customer is eligible for under the Pension Rate Calculator. RA
paid with Family Tax Benefit (FTB) is not included in the maximum
payment rate for the Scheme purposes.

The maximum Scheme rate is 1.5 times the MPR (150% equivalent).

These amounts may not be current. They are examples only. For current
payments, see Rates and thresholds.
