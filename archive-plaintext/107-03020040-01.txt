This document outlines information about the Payment Details Download
Sheet (PS Tool).

PS Tool functionality

The PS Tool is a spreadsheet that it extracts information from the
Customer Record. It extracts information from the:

-   Payment Summary (PS) screen, and
-   Payment Details (PD) screen

Once the data is loaded, it can be changed to suit the needs of the
user.

The PS Tool helps staff with manual debt calculations to:

-   extract payments received in the relevant period
-   assist in processing tax Manual Follow-ups (MFUs), and
-   deal with customer enquiries about their payments

How to use the PS Tool

Open the PS Tool and enable the content:

-   Click the 'Start' button
-   Click the 'Start copying' option
-   Enter the Customer Reference Number (CRN)
-   Select the payment system and manually enter the date range
-   Click on 'OK'

Staff should try not to have multiple applications (for example, excel
spreadsheets, Customer First) open while running the PS Tool.

The PS Tool includes a help file. This:

-   can be found under the 'Start' button
-   explains the various functions when selected

The Resources page has a link to the Calculators and Tools on the
Intranet.
