This document outlines when a dependent is listed on a customer's
concession card, including Health Care Card (HCC), Pensioner Concession
Card (PCC), Low Income Health Care Cards (LIC), Foster Child HCC (FST),
Commonwealth Seniors Health Card (CSHC) and Ex-Carer Allowance (child)
HCC (EHC).

Dependents listed on PCC or HCC (other than FTB HCC)

A PCC or HCC (other than a Family Tax Benefit (FTB) HCC) for customers
receiving eligible income support payments or a social security pension
will automatically issue and list:

-   Any dependent children, unless the dependent child holds a PCC or
    HCC in their own right
-   Some shared care arrangement children (see below), and
-   The customer's partner (if the customer chooses to have the partner
    listed). For more information see Preferences for concession cards

Dependents are not listed on HCCs for customers receiving Mobility
Allowance (MOB).

Some dependents may not be automatically listed on their parent's
concession card.

Family Tax Benefit (FTB) HCC

An FTB HCC automatically issues including the cardholder's partner and
any FTB child or Regular Care Child for which the cardholder:

-   Is eligible for the maximum rate of income tested FTB Part A paid by
    instalment through Services Australia, regardless of the payment
    choice (with the exception of lump sum claims)
    Note: if a customer's FTB Part A is precluded due to the Non-payment
    of FTB instalment payments to zero entitlement customers measure,
    the customer will lose access to the HCC regardless of their
    estimated income
-   Would be eligible for maximum rate FTB Part A except that they only
    have care of a Regular Care Child
-   Receives FTB Part A which is reduced only by the Maintenance Income
    Test

Claimable cards - LIC, FST, EHC HCC and CSHC

Dependents are listed on the following claimable cards:

-   Low Income Health Care Cards (LIC) - will include the cardholder’s
    partner and Family Tax Benefit (FTB) child or Regular Care Child
-   Foster Child HCC (FST) - will only include the foster child

Dependents are not listed on the following claimable cards:

-   Commonwealth Seniors Health Card (CSHC) - will not include the
    cardholder’s partner or dependent children. Only the cardholder is
    listed on the CSHC
-   Ex-Carer Allowance (child) HCC (EHC) - will not include the
    cardholder’s partner or other dependent children. Only the
    cardholder is listed on the EHC

Shared care

Customers who have shared care arrangements are required to have a
certain percentage of care to enable them to have their dependants
listed on their HCC or PCC. The Resources page includes a table listing
the percentage of care required.

Maintenance Action Test failure

If a customer's FTB Part A is reduced from the maximum rate due to the
failure of the Maintenance Action Test (MAT) for all children the
customer will no longer be eligible to receive an automatic FTB HCC.

If only some of a customer's children fail the MAT, the customer may
continue to receive a FTB HCC - for all children including the ones who
have failed the MAT.

The Resources page contains a table describing the percentage of care
required before a cardholder’s shared care dependents are listed on the
cardholder's concession card, a link to the Level 2 Policy Helpdesk,
links to relevant forms and the Services Australia website.
