|                                   | Sara is applying for Youth        |
|                                   | Allowance (YA). Sara has worked   |
|                                   | full-time for the past 3 years    |
|                                   | since leaving school. Sara is     |
|                                   | already independent from parents  |
|                                   | and meets the workforce criteria. |

|                                   | the parental means tests.         |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | work, therefore Tom receives the  |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Sara and Tom are not considered   |
|                                   | to be a member of a YA couple as  |
|                                   | they have only been together for  |
|                                   | 4 months. This means that while   |

|                                   | is independent. Sara is not       |

|                                   | Tom's rates of YA and RA would    |
|                                   | have the personal income test or  |

|                                   | (whichever reduces the rate the   |
|                                   | most in the fortnight) as Tom is  |
