This document outlines the services provided by Multicultural Service
Officers (MSO) within Services Australia (the agency).

Multicultural Service Officer (MSO) Program

The MSO Program connects migrants and refugees to the agency's
information, payments and services. MSOs work together with Community
and Third Party Organisations (CTPO) and staff. They promote and improve
access to our products, payments and services for culturally and
linguistically diverse (CALD) customers and communities. CTPOs include
providers and agencies such as:

-   Migrant Resource Centres
-   Community Health Centres and,
-   local charities

MSOs play a main role in ensuring our services and products are relevant
and accessible for our CALD customers. MSOs are able to highlight gaps
or issues CALD customers may be facing when accessing our services. They
do this by:

-   conducting outreach and
-   liaising with multicultural community agencies

There are about 70 MSOs located in service centres throughout Australia

Key audiences

-   CTPOs
-   Service Australia customers
-   Service Australia staff

Community and Third Party Organisations (CTPO)

MSOs form and maintain strong relationships with CTPOs. The MSO role is
vital in identifying and feeding back to the agency local community
issues and service delivery gaps. They often work together with CTPOs to
provide the best outcomes for CALD customers. Some of the work MSOs
undertake in the community include:

-   Working with CTPOs to recognise emerging trends and issues in local
    communities
-   Developing strategies to address issues faced by CALD customers
-   Attending various stakeholder meetings to keep CTPOs informed of key
    changes to policy, payments or procedures that may affect CALD
    customers
-   Promoting the agency's services, payments and products to increase
    CTPOs knowledge
-   Delivering education and information sessions on agency services
-   Attending state based Multicultural Advisory Forums to foster
    relationships, build knowledge around CTPO services and programs and
    work with stakeholders
-   Obtaining feedback on agency program and services to improve service
    delivery to CALD customers
-   Establishing local focus groups to help design services that are
    accessible to CALD people

CALD Customers

CALD customers may encounter specific challenges or barriers in
accessing services. The role of the MSO is to assist in educating and
informing customers to lessen these barriers. MSOs consult with
communities, deliver information sessions on our services and liaise
with other specialists to escalate and follow up on CALD customer
issues. MSOs support CALD customers by:

-   connecting them to the appropriate service channels and ensuring
    they have access to our payments, products and services
-   organising and delivering information sessions to CALD customers to
    inform them of payments and services. They engage with interpreters
    as required
-   working with CTPOs to address local issues mutual customers may be
    facing in the community
-   assisting CALD customers that face multiple and complex issues. MSOs
    help them navigate the system and can refer them to other
    specialists or community agencies
-   seeking customer feedback to identify service gaps and escalate or
    resolve issues
-   delivering the newly arrived refugee information session within the
    first 4 to 10 weeks of their arrival
