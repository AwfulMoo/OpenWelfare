|                                   | External students (also known as  |
|                                   | correspondence students) do not   |
|                                   | need to attend classes on a       |
|                                   | regular basis. As such, they do   |
|                                   | not have to live in a particular  |
|                                   | location. This would mean they    |
|                                   | could live overseas if they       |
|                                   | choose, while continuing to study |
|                                   | at an Australian institution.     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If they do make that choice, they |
|                                   | would generally not be eligible   |
|                                   | for payments while overseas. The  |
|                                   | away from home rate would not be  |
|                                   | payable either.                   |

|                                   | Business at Edith Cowan           |
|                                   | University. This is a 3 year      |
|                                   | course approved for YA. After the |
|                                   | first year of the course, Jack    |
|                                   | accepts an offer to undertake a   |
|                                   | year of study at the University   |
|                                   | of Saitama in Japan. Jack will    |
|                                   | remain enrolled as a full-time    |
|                                   | student at the Australian         |
|                                   | university. Edith Cowan           |
|                                   | University will count that year   |
|                                   | as being the second year of study |
|                                   | in the bachelor course.           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Jack continues to be eligible for |
|                                   | YA for staying enrolled in an     |
|                                   | approved course and effectively   |
|                                   | undertaking it. As the study is   |
|                                   | overseas, Jack would also receive |
|                                   | payment of the away from home     |
|                                   | rate.                             |

|                                   | University (ANU). To complement   |
|                                   | work at ANU, the University of    |
|                                   | Oxford in England invites         |
|                                   | Shay-Lee to do a Post Graduate    |
|                                   | Diploma in International Law.     |

|                                   | This course is not part of the    |
|                                   | studies at ANU. Oxford University |
|                                   | is not an approved institution    |

|                                   | by Services Australia. As such,   |
|                                   | there is no approval of the study |
|                                   | there for YA.                     |

|                                   | load. Charles studies French      |

|                                   | requirements. UQ will only give   |

|                                   | in Alice Springs. Stephen studies |
|                                   | at the University of Adelaide and |
|                                   | rents a small flat at Glenelg on  |
|                                   | a long term lease. Based on       |
|                                   | travelling time, Stephen has had  |
|                                   | the away from home rate of YA     |
|                                   | granted. As part of the course,   |
|                                   | Stephen will be undertaking a     |
|                                   | year of study in China. While     |
|                                   | away, Stephen will keep paying    |
|                                   | rent for the flat (to move back   |
|                                   | into when returning from China).  |
|                                   | Stephen will also have to pay for |
|                                   | the accommodation in China.       |
|                                   | Stephen can still receive payment |
|                                   | of RA for the flat in Glenelg but |
|                                   | not for the residence in China.   |
