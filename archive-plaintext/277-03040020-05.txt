|                                   | in Nelly’s care 100% of the time  |
|                                   | since 16 July 2016. Other parent  |
|                                   | Trent has moved interstate. There |
|                                   | is no care arrangement in place.  |

|                                   |     birthday weekend. Trent       |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Nelly is contacted again to       |
|                                   | discuss Trent’s claims. During    |
|                                   | the conversation:                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   Nelly recalls the birthday    |
|                                   |     weekend and confirms the care |

|                                   |     the overseas trip was a       |
|                                   |     one-off and not a permanent   |
|                                   |     change, this was not included |
|                                   |     in the original notification  |

|                                   | the whole care period using date  |
|                                   | of event and percentage of care   |
