|                                   | accurate, they will amend the     |

| 3                                 | Question - How do I review an     |

|                                   | payment if it falls within this   |
|                                   | period.                           |

| 4                                 | Question - How do I review        |
|                                   | multiple estimates?               |

|                                   | Answer                            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Each estimate must be looked at   |
|                                   | separately when considering a     |
|                                   | review. In other words, there     |
|                                   | must be an event defined for any  |
|                                   | estimate that is to be reviewed   |
|                                   | and result in an amendment.       |

|                                   | amend an estimate once the        |
|                                   | financial year has ended?         |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Yes, Child Support can either     |
|                                   | Client or CSA Amend an estimate   |
|                                   | at any stage, before the estimate |
|                                   | is reconciled. Once the estimate  |
|                                   | has been reconciled Child Support |
|                                   | can no longer review the          |
|                                   | estimate.                         |

| 6                                 | Question - Can Child Support      |
|                                   | amend the estimate using the      |
|                                   | income details in this s161       |
|                                   | response?                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The s161 response from the        |
|                                   | employer shows the customer       |
|                                   | ceased employment, and includes   |
|                                   | income details while employed.    |
|                                   | Customer has not responded to     |
|                                   | contact attempts and no income    |
|                                   | information found for the period  |
|                                   | after the customer ceased         |
|                                   | employment.                       |

|                                   | Answer                            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | No. If the s161 response provides |
|                                   | a date the customer ceased to be  |
|                                   | employed, the estimate review     |
|                                   | should not include income from    |
|                                   | that employer for the period      |
|                                   | after the customer ceased         |
|                                   | employment.                       |

|                                   | Child Support needs to determine  |
|                                   | whether the customer has any      |
|                                   | source of income after the date   |
|                                   | the s161 response says they       |
|                                   | finished work. If the customer is |
|                                   | working again, Child Support      |
|                                   | needs to determine their income   |
|                                   | and include it in the estimate    |
|                                   | review.                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If Child Support finds the        |
|                                   | customer’s income for the         |
|                                   | remaining period is likely to be  |
|                                   | $0 – it is appropriate to record  |
|                                   | this as their income for that     |
|                                   | period. An example of a zero      |
|                                   | income can be when a person is    |
|                                   | incarcerated.                     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If Child Support cannot be        |
|                                   | satisfied of the customer’s       |
|                                   | income for the remaining period,  |
|                                   | a review and amendment would not  |
|                                   | be appropriate.                   |
