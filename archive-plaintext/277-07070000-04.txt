Authorisations and delegations

Child Support Services, Delegations and Authorisations

The authorisation for accepting or refusing an estimate election is at
the Service Officer (SO4) level or above. This does not prevent an
officer at the SO3 level who has support of their team leader from
carrying out this type of work as long as the final decision to either
accept or refuse is made by an officer at the SO4 level or above.
However, the authorisation for accepting or refusing an estimate
election is at the SO3 level for staff in SAS SETs.

The authorisation for accepting or refusing a retrospective estimate
election is at the ASO5 level.

All authorising officers should complete the authorising checklist and
paste a copy in the estimate approval notepad.
