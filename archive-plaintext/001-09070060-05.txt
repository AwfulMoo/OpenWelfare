How voluntary work and suitable paid work can satisfy mutual obligation requirements

This table outlines how voluntary work and suitable paid work can fully
satisfy a job seeker's mutual obligation requirements for a job seeker
who has been getting income support for over 12 months. Note: the amount
of $20.33 used for the minimum wage is the 1 July 2021 rate and is for
illustration purposes only.

| 1                                 | Mutual obligation requirements    |
|                                   | met with a combination of         |
|                                   | approved voluntary work and paid  |
|                                   | work                              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Ted is over 55 years of age and   |
|                                   | has been getting JobSeeker        |
|                                   | Payment (JSP) for over 12 months. |
|                                   | Ted is currently doing 10 hours a |
|                                   | week approved voluntary work and  |
|                                   | has taken a part-time job 1 day a |
|                                   | week for 5 hours.                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Ted is paid $10 an hour working a |
|                                   | part-time job and earns $50 per   |
|                                   | week. This will not satisfy the   |
|                                   | sufficient work test, as the      |
|                                   | remuneration is insufficient. Ted |
|                                   | needs to earn at least $101.65,   |
|                                   | which equates to 5 hours at the   |
|                                   | minimum wage rate of $20.33 an    |
|                                   | hour.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Ted increases his part-time job   |
|                                   | to 10 hours and now earns $203.30 |
|                                   | per week. Combined with Ted's     |
|                                   | volunteer work, this is more than |
|                                   | the required number of hours, and |
|                                   | as this pay now exceeds $101.65,  |
|                                   | the remuneration test is          |
|                                   | satisfied. The mutual obligation  |
|                                   | requirements are being met in     |
|                                   | full as Ted is doing a            |
|                                   | combination of approved voluntary |
|                                   | and paid work of at least 30      |
|                                   | hours per fortnight.              |
