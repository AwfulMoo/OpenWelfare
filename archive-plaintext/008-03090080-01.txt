This procedure does not apply to:
- Customers undergoing a risk-based medical review of eligibility, see
Medical Risk Based reviews of current Disability Support Pension (DSP)
recipients
- DSP new claimants required to provide medical evidence to support
their claim, see Streaming a new claim for Disability Support Pension
(DSP)

This document explains action when a customer receiving DSP fails to
reply to correspondence.

Written requests

A DSP recipient may receive a written request to contact or provide
information to Services Australia. The customer is required to reply to
this request within the timeframe specified in the letter. If the
customer does not respond to the request, their payments may be
suspended.

A manual suspension of DSP for failing to reply to correspondence can
only occur where:

-   the written request to contact or provide information has been
    issued prior to any suspension action being considered
-   the written request to contact or provide information includes
    details as to the information/action required, a reasonable
    timeframe for response, the consequences of non-compliance, and a
    reference to the relevant Act that the request has been made under
-   the timeframe specified in the written request has passed
-   2 genuine attempts to contact by phone have been made to contact the
    customer first to discuss the reasons for failing to reply and to
    consider other options before suspending DSP. For DSP customers,
    failure to reply to correspondence could be a result of the
    customer's medical condition or other circumstances, for example an
    acute psychiatric condition, Acquired Brain Injury (ABI),
    hospitalisation or remoteness, and
-   a suspension letter is issued which clearly outlines the reason for
    the suspension, its date of effect, the impacted payment, the
    relevant section of legislation and review and appeal rights

If customer’s DSP is to be suspended, use appropriate reason code.
