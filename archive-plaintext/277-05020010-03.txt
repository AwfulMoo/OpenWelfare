|                                   | The reason for this is, if a s143 |

|                                   | there may be a need to calculate  |
|                                   | the overpayment. The s143 order   |
|                                   | may state that the ‘overpayment’  |
|                                   | includes the liability raised     |
|                                   | during any non-collect periods or |
|                                   | there may be a need to isolate    |
|                                   | just the collect periods. As      |
|                                   | non-collect period details are    |
