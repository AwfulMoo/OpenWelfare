This document explains information about the Identity Confirmation
required for job seekers registering for services as Volunteer Job
Seekers with Services Australia.

Identity Confirmation requirements for Volunteer Job Seekers

The Identity Confirmation requirement for job seekers is not the same as
the Identity Confirmation requirements for income support claims. It is
important to remember that identity documentation is required before
registering the job seeker and additional identity documentation is
required if the job seeker is also claiming income support with Services
Australia. The job seeker must provide one of the following:

-   Certificate of Australian citizenship
-   current passport
-   Birth Certificate or Extract
-   driver's licence, (including provisional licence and learner's
    permit)
-   documents showing registration of a change of legal name,
    accompanied by evidence of use of the current or prior name for the
    preceding 12 months
-   divorce papers
-   group certificate(s)
-   insurance renewal document showing current address
-   Australian Marriage Certificate issued by a government department
-   accounts held with Financial Institutions: ATM or credit cards
    showing full name and signature or account statements showing full
    name and address or current passbooks showing full name
-   motor vehicle registration papers, showing their current address
-   overseas documents, if they are offered with a passport stamped for
    entry to Australia
-   Trade Certificate

Requirements for Identity Confirmation for jobseekers who register
directly with jobactive are different. Job seekers are required to
provide either photo identification or other approved documents that
prove identity such as credit cards, Medicare card, bank statements,
birth certificates or extracts, Australian marriage certificates,
citizenship certificates, motor registration papers.

Recording and coding of identity documentation

The job seeker's identity documents are recorded on a DOC using the
keyword JOBNET.

It is not appropriate to code the identity document using the guided
procedure because it is not sufficient for Services Australia claim
purposes.
