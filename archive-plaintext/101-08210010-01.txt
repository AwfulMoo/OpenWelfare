-   notify they intend to stop receiving an income support payment, and
-   book a participation appointment to transfer to the YA Jobseeker
    activity test (if they are YA full-time or concessional study load
    student and under 22 years of age)

(if eligible), when adding a new course or editing an existing course

YA job seekers returning to study

Customers receiving YA (job seeker) are able to use the Manage Study
Details service to provide their course details if they are returning to
study. Depending on the circumstance, once the study details are
provided the system may automatically transfer the customer to YA
(student). If the system is unable to complete the update automatically,
a Change of Circumstances (CoC) will be created for action by a Service
Officer.

customer:

-   had a previous student end date 14 days in the past
