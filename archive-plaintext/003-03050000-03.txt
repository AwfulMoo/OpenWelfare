This is a Family and Domestic Violence Interaction Point. If the
customer is with another person, on speaker phone, or already identified
with family and domestic violence concerns, continue with the current
business conversation. Otherwise, go to the Family and domestic violence
procedure to conduct the risk identification and referral process.

For the New South Wales Floods – July 2022, DRA and NZ DRA claims cannot

Coding NZ DRA claims

Table 5: how to process a NZ DRA claim on a customer's Centrelink
record. For help to progress any steps, contact the Technical Peer
Support.

NZ DRA claims cannot be finalised until evidence of participation in the
Australian tax system is provided.

Before coding the NZ DRA workflow, make sure that the residency screens
are checked. The Legal Residence Details (RSLEG) screen must show that
customer holds a 444 non-protected Visa to claim NZ DRA. Customers with
a grandfathered or protected 444 Visa must claim DRA.

For Disaster activations from February 2022, if the customer has claimed
NZ DRA and should have claimed DRA, see Customer has claimed the
incorrect event or payment. Do not launch workflow for NZ DRA in
Customer First.

NZ DRA must not be paid using the !FFAP screen.
