Delegations and authorisations

Service Officer (SO4)

-   Generate a provisional notional assessment on the request of a
    customer
-   Make all decisions in relation to provisional notional assessment or
    notional assessment
-   Accept or refuse to accept an agreement
-   Final responsibility for ensuring the agreement is loaded, processed
    and finalised correctly

Note: this does not prevent an officer at the Service Officer (SO3)
level from recording the agreement and speaking with customers. However,
the final checks and decision to accept or refuse to accept is made by a
SO4.

Service Officer (SO5)

-   Accept or refuse an estimate that is made to vary a provisional
    notional assessment

Note: a SO4 can record the provisional notional assessment estimate and
speak with customers. However, the final checks and decision to accept
or refuse the estimate must be made by an officer at the SO5 level or
above.

Support Services, Delegations and Authorisations.
