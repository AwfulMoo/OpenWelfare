|                                   | the order may specify an event or |
|                                   | action that will end the stay     |
|                                   | order. If so, that will be used   |
|                                   | to identify the date the order    |
|                                   | ceases. For example, the order    |
|                                   | may say ‘until the sale of the    |
|                                   | matrimonial home’ or ‘until X     |
|                                   | becomes employed, or until        |
|                                   | further order, whichever occurs   |
|                                   | first’.                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Generally the stay will be in     |
|                                   | effect until further order of the |
|                                   | court or until the relevant       |
|                                   | matter is resolved, for example   |
|                                   | at the end of the appeal period   |
|                                   | that is relevant to the           |

|                                   | The purpose of this type of stay  |
|                                   | is to prevent any action on the   |
|                                   | assessment that is subject to the |
|                                   | stay. As Cuba does not have the   |
|                                   | functionality to suspend the      |
|                                   | assessment in this situation, a   |

|                                   | The current workaround is to load |
|                                   | a formula modification and adjust |
|                                   | the annual rate to $0 from either |

|                                   | If it is clear the order intends  |
|                                   | to stay the whole operation of    |
|                                   | the CSA Act, rather than just     |
|                                   | current or future assessments,    |
|                                   | load the formula modification as  |
|                                   | above and also treat this as a    |
|                                   | stay on collection of the         |
|                                   | liability for any earlier         |
|                                   | periods. This is because staying  |
|                                   | the entire assessment has the     |
|                                   | effect of suspending the entire   |
|                                   | liability. For the duration of    |
|                                   | the stay there will be no         |
|                                   | assessment in force, meaning that |
|                                   | customers will be unable to lodge |
|                                   | any applications and there will   |
|                                   | be no liability to collect.       |

|                                   | Note: when implementing a stay    |
|                                   | that relates to the whole         |
|                                   | operation of the assessment, do   |
