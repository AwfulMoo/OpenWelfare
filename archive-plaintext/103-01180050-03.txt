Determining an exclusion from VWPR Youth Income Management

Customers who do not meet the automatic exclusion criteria can still
request an exclusion. If the customer requests an exclusion, they must
be referred to an Income Management trained social worker within the
declared Income Management area where the Income management commenced
who will assess the exclusion request.
