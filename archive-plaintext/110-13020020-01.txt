For staff conducting Unearned Income Interventions only.

This document outlines the process for requesting verification from
either the customer or a third party for Unearned Income Interventions
(UII). It includes action to take if there is no response.

Customer verification

When the customer responds to a request to contact, trust and accept the
information provided over the phone unless the income/asset type or the
discussion needs documented verification.

Compliance Officers (CO) must be satisfied the compliance triggers can
be explained and the verbal updates will result in an accurate record of
the customer's circumstances.

If the customer is unable to provide the information verbally, they must
be given the opportunity to provide suitable documents for verification.
If the customer is unable to provide verification, third parties can be
contacted.

Third party verification

Contact with third parties is necessary when the customer:

-   fails to respond to a request to contact letter by the due date
-   fails to provide suitable verification documents by the due date
-   cannot provide information and requests Services Australia obtain
    verification directly from third parties, or
-   income/asset type requires verification

Third parties have an obligation to provide information under section
192 of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999.
