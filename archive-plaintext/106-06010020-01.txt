This document outlines the residence rules for New Zealand customers in
Australia that came into force on 26 February 2001.

Residence rules for New Zealand citizens

A person arriving in Australia using a New Zealand passport is generally
allocated a Special Category Visa (SCV). An SCV holder can remain
indefinitely in Australia and have access to Australian services similar
to that of a permanent visa holder.

The social security rules relating to SCV holders are in line with those
that apply to all other migrants to Australia. There are special
provisions to make sure SCV holders who were already residing in
Australia on or around 26 February 2001 are not disadvantaged.

To be entitled to most social security payments, New Zealand customers
who take up residence in Australia after 26 February 2001 need to:

have a permanent visa, or

have Australian citizenship, or

be a protected Special Category Visa (SCV) holder. To be considered a
protected SCV holder an SCV holder must have been:

-   in Australia on 26 February 2001, or
-   in Australia for at least 12 months in the 2 years immediately
    before 26 February 2001, or
-   issued with a 'Certificate of Australian Residence' AUS223 form
    (formerly XOB073) by Centrelink International Services (CIS)

Certificate of Australian Residence

Services Australia originally issued the certificate to customers
between 26 February 2001 and 2004, for the purposes of possible future
claims for social security payments and to support applications for
Australian citizenship. The certificate represents a residence decision
made by Services Australia under section 7(3) of the Social Security Act
that either the customer:

-   began residing in Australia within 3 months of 26 February 2001, or
-   was residing in Australia on 26 February 2001, but was temporarily
    absent from Australia on the day

The agency only issues the certificate to customers who have been, or
should have been, assessed under transitional SCV provisions.

CIS can reissue these certificates if needed. New assessments may be
considered if the customer made contact with Services Australia within
required timeframes.

In 2018, the AUS223 form replaced the XOB073 letter representing the
certificate.

Confirming New Zealand residence status

All customers who are New Zealand citizens must have a New Zealand
residence status, protected/non-protected, recorded before a claim for
most payments can proceed. If a customer does not already have a status
recorded, their immigration records will be automatically checked in a
new claim activity or when New Zealand citizenship is recorded.

The system will automatically verify the customer as a protected SCV
holder if the immigration records show they were an SCV holder in
Australia:

-   on 26 February 2001, or
-   for 12 months in the 2 years immediately before 26 February 2001

If the customer first arrived in Australia after 26 May 2001, the system
will automatically record them as a non-protected SCV holder. If the
system cannot automatically assess the status (for example, customer
arrives in Australia between 27 February 2001 and 25 May 2001) it will:

-   generate an automatic activity, and
-   send the activity to CIS

Note: the new claim action cannot proceed until CIS manually records the
status.

Customers who are correctly assessed as 'protected' SCV holders will
never lose their 'protected' status. These customers will continue to be
considered legal Australian residents, unless their visa is cancelled or
revoked. See Step 5 in the Legal residence verification and recording
table in Recording legal residence status.

Note: New Zealand citizens who were present on Norfolk Island on 26
February 2001 or in Australia (including Norfolk Island) for 12 months
in the 2 years immediately before that date are considered to have held
an SCV at that time. CIS staff will assess these cases manually. For
more information see Requesting and recording additional residence data
for Norfolk Island claims.

New Zealand residence 'Status active' indicator

The Status active: field displays below the New Zealand residence
status: field on the Legal Residence Details (RSLEG) screen. This field
is display only. It indicates if the New Zealand residence status is
active or not at the system date.

The field will display:

Y if the customer has a current 444-visa subclass

N if the:

-   customer's 444-visa subclass has ended and they have no other
    current 444-visa subclasses, or
-   RSLEG screen has been manually updated with an entry of NCV (No
    Current Visa)

Blank if the customer has no value recorded in the New Zealand residence
status: field

Non-protected SCV holders

Non-protected SCV holders generally do not qualify for income support
payments. They may qualify for parental leave payments, family
assistance and concession cards, certain disaster and emergency payments
or for a payment under the Social Security Agreement between Australia
and New Zealand. See New Zealand Agreement and foreign pension
information.

Under the New Zealand 10 year residence exemption they may also qualify
for JobSeeker Payment (JSP) or Youth Allowance (YA), if they:

-   are a non-protected SCV holder, and
-   have lived in Australia and/or Norfolk Island continuously for at
    least 10 years immediately before making their claim
