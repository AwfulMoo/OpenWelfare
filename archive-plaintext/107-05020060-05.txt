Customer claim process

Customers can lodge a claim for a refund of FI fees or charges they
incur from an incorrect Centrelink direct debit. Centrelink will accept
the claim for any direct debits wrongly initiated by Centrelink. If a
claim is accepted, Centrelink will:

-   make every attempt to resolve the dispute within five (5) business
    days
-   advise the customer of the outcome
-   refund the customer or arrange for payment of expenses if such a
    decision is made

If a customer contacts their FI to lodge a claim, the FI should refer
the customer back to Centrelink. If the FI does accept the claim the FI
will forward the claim to the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). The RBA:

-   may request Centrelink to produce evidence of the direct debit
    authority (for example, a copy of the direct debit confirmation
    letter)
-   must respond to the FI advising whether the claim is accepted or
    refused within five (5) business days
-   will advise the customer of the outcome of the claim
-   will notify Centrelink of the outcome of any claim it handles

If the claim is successful the RBA will request Centrelink to make a
refund and/or to arrange for payment of expenses if such a decision is
made.

If the FI does not receive a response from the RBA within the specified
period:

-   the FI may refund the customer the disputed amount and advise the
    RBA
-   the RBA will advise Centrelink that it will draw on Centrelink's RBA
    account to reimburse the FI
-   the RBA will provide Centrelink (in writing), customer details to
    refund the money
