This document outlines information about provider registration for the
My Health Record system.

Register for the My Health Record system in HPOS (providers)

If a healthcare organisation registered in the Healthcare Identifiers
(HI) Service has an active Healthcare Provider Identifier – Organisation
(HPI-O), the Responsible Officer (RO) or Seed Organisation Maintenance
Officer (OMO) can register the organisation to participate in the My
Health Record system through Health Professional Online Services (HPOS).

Once registered, authorisation links for individual healthcare
professionals can be linked to their organisation. The RO and any OMO
with authorisation rights over the registered HPI-O can perform this
task.

The Resources page contains contact details for Healthcare Identifiers
(HI) service, and further information for health professionals about the
My Health Record system.
