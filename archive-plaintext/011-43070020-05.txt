|                                   | For example, if 2 segments were   |
|                                   | adjusted within a claim and one   |
|                                   | segment resulted in an            |
|                                   | overpayment of $50.00 and the     |
|                                   | second segment resulted in an     |
|                                   | underpayment of $30.00, then      |
|                                   | total adjustment result will be   |
|                                   | an overpayment of $20.00.         |
