This document outlines services provided by the Australian Government
Mobile Service Centres in rural and regional communities.

Mobile Service Centres

Mobile Service Centres travel to rural and regional communities to
provide people with information and access to government payments and
services. The Resources page contains a link to the Services Australia
website for the current schedule.

The Mobile Service Centre Program aims to maximise opportunities for
access to Services Australia for people living in regional communities
that are greater than 50 kilometres from a service centre. It will do
this by periodically visiting locations to provide a face-to-face
service, and at the same time promoting digital services that will
enable continued access after the visit.

Mobile Service Centre staff include:

-   Mobile Service Centre Manager and Mobile Service Officer
-   at least 2 Service Officers to provide customers with general access
    services
-   specialist staff nominated by the Zone based on community need, for
    example Farm Household Case Officer (FHCO), Financial Information
    Service Officer (FISO), Indigenous Service Officer (ISO)
-   social worker

Mobile Services Centres are equipped with laptops, printers, self
service terminals and a satellite phone. This allows staff to begin
processing applications or refer customers to relevant services.
