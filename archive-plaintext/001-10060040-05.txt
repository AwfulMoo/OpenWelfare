|                                   | (UNPP) start date when a CDP      |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Uri resigned from full-time       |
|                                   | employment because the work       |
|                                   | schedule was making hanging out   |
|                                   | with friends difficult. Uri's     |
|                                   | last day of work was 6 July. Uri  |
|                                   | claimed JobSeeker Payment (JSP)   |
|                                   | on 20 July. The Service Officer   |
|                                   | with a UNPP security resource     |
|                                   | determined that the work was      |
|                                   | suitable for Uri and there is no  |
|                                   | reasonable excuse for ceasing     |
|                                   | work. Uri was not receiving a     |
|                                   | participation payment at the time |
|                                   | of becoming unemployed therefore  |
|                                   | a UNPP will apply from the date   |
|                                   | of unemployment, 7 July.          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If Uri's employer included a      |
|                                   | leave payment within his final    |
|                                   | pay, the date of unemployment is  |
|                                   | still 7 July, regardless of the   |
|                                   | amount of leave (entitlement) Uri |
|                                   | received. Note: an Income         |
|                                   | Maintenance Period (IMP) and/or   |
|                                   | other waiting or preclusion       |
|                                   | periods may also apply.           |

|                                   | Ursula was fired due to being     |

|                                   | by the employer. Ursula's last    |

|                                   | decision allowing Ursula a small  |

|                                   | participant and has also been     |
|                                   | working part time. After several  |
|                                   | recent warnings from her          |
|                                   | employer, Uma was dismissed on 15 |
|                                   | July after again arriving at work |
|                                   | drunk. Uma's last payment         |
|                                   | included 3 weeks of holiday pay.  |

|                                   | occurred. Uma must serve an IMP   |
|                                   | due to the holiday pay received.  |
|                                   | The IMP starts from 15 July, so   |

|                                   | applies the UNPP from the same    |
|                                   | date. This means the UNPP and IMP |
|                                   | are served concurrently.          |
