This document explains how to process JSP claims in Process Direct. This
includes online claims and Assisted Customer Claims (ACC).

Processing claims in Process Direct

Use Process Direct to review the JSP claim information and to process
the claim once all required information is available.

A claim ID is created as a work item when the JSP claim has been
submitted online or via ACC.

Process Direct:

-   contains information provided by the customer or their
    correspondence nominee online or recorded using ACC
-   loads provisional claim information into a JSP claim activity
-   lists documents the customer has been asked to provide
-   has functions to view scanned documents, request information and
    make referrals

RapidConnect

Job seekers who are subject to RapidConnect requirements are advised of
their requirements or an exemption to RapidConnect during their
Participation Interview.

Job seekers who are automatically selected and referred to an Online
Employment Service (OES) are required to agree to a job plan.

Job seekers who are eligible for a referral to a jobactive or other
specialist provider will have an initial appointment booked during the
Participation Interview. Attending this first provider appointment is
known as the job seeker's RapidConnect requirement.

In most cases, meeting RapidConnect requirements will determine the
start date of the job seeker's income support payment. Note: this is
subject to job seekers meeting any waiting periods and qualification
requirements.

For more information see RapidConnect.

Mutual obligation requirements

Mutual obligation requirements apply to all job seekers in receipt of
participation payments including JSP.

Mutual obligation requirements are designed to ensure that unemployed
people receiving activity tested income support payments are actively
looking for work and are participating in activities that will help them
into employment.

Job seekers will satisfy their mutual obligation requirements if they:

-   actively seek and are willing to undertake suitable paid work. The
    definition of 'suitable work' for PP job seekers is the same as for
    JSP/YA principal carers, or
-   undertake suitable paid work, or
-   participate in some other approved training, program or course which
    is likely to improve their employment prospects, and
-   enter into a Job Plan, if required, with Services Australia or an
    Employment Services Provider without unreasonable delay, and
-   fully comply with the terms of the Job Plan

For more information, see Mutual obligation requirements.

Mutual obligation requirements exemptions

Where a job seeker is unable to meet their mutual obligation
requirements, there are certain circumstances in which they may be
eligible for an exemption from their mutual obligation requirements.

For more information, see Mutual obligation requirements exemptions.

Automatic claim processing

The system may process JSP claims if they meet these criteria:

-   identity, residence, Tax File Number and employment status
    requirements met
-   known relationship details
-   known children details
-   no bereavement
-   no incapacity
-   homeowners on less than 2 hectares, or paying government rent
-   income and assets with no significant changes, no manual assessment
    needed

Customer contact

If a customer asks for an explanation or applies for a formal review of
the decision, the Service Officer must enter their own logon as the
Decision Maker when running the script.

If the claim was incorrectly granted, give feedback to the Business
Enablement and Quality Branch.

Streamlined claims

A streamlined claim is offered to some customers transferring to JSP
from another payment.

JSP claim following a DSP Medical Risk Based Review

Disability Service Officers initiate a JSP claim when completing the
Service Offer Interview (SOI).

Staff must not unassign these activities.

Reassessment of JSP claims

Customers can request a reassessment of their JSP claim within 13 weeks
of rejection.

Make sure all required information is available before re-indexing the
original claim.

Separate procedures apply if JSP was rejected due to:

-   not supplying documents (FSD)
-   not lodging or reporting on time (DNL, FRP)

If the customer contacts more than 13 weeks after the rejection letter
was sent, they must claim JSP.

Early claims

Customers can lodge an early claim for JSP up to 13 weeks before the
first day of eligibility. For the day they become qualified, the
customer must provide their:

-   bank account balances
-   employment separation details, and
-   any other income

If an early claim lodgement is accepted, the start date is the first day
the customer becomes qualified for the payment. See Early claims.

Pre-population of claim responses in the Job Seeker Classification Instrument (JSCI)

Responses to some questions in the JobSeeker Payment claim will be used
to pre-populate similar questions in the JSCI. The job seeker will have
the opportunity to review the responses and make changes where required
within the Jobseeker Snapshot (online) or JSCI (staff assisted).

Intent to claim for Vulnerable Customers

Customers are considered to be vulnerable if they experienced a
vulnerable circumstance at any time in the 8 weeks before contact and
this was the reason they were unable to submit their claim on the
contact date. See Intent to claim and vulnerable customers.

The Resources page contains a link to Process Direct resources and a
list of common screens for JSP claims. It also contains approved text
for Q888 letters sent to principal carers who may be eligible to claim
FTB.
