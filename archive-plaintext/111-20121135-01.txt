This document outlines mandatory information for quality checker
accreditation for staff in the Health Service Delivery Division.

Role of a Team Leader

Team Leaders give approval for a quality checker to start the
accreditation process. The Team Leader must ensure the:

-   quality checker is proficient in the work type they will be checking
    prior to completing quality checker accreditation process
-   quality checker meets the minimum standard for each requirement in
    the quality checker prerequisites table on the Resources page

Role of a Quality Checker

Quality checkers must maintain up-to-date business and technical
knowledge in the work types they quality check. Quality checkers must
not check their own work.

Quality checkers must:

undertake quality checking training (where applicable) and be accredited
before conducting quality checks

ensure consistent assessment of work items in line with Operational
Blueprint procedures

identify and record errors correctly and complete corrective action
where required. Analysing errors helps to identify:

-   trends
-   weakness in processing
-   gaps in business rules
-   system faults
-   issues relating to environmental factors
-   limitations in training or development opportunities

give consistent and constructive feedback to staff

work with leadership and program teams to ensure quality checks are
consistent

provide relevant feedback about systems, procedural, policy and work
flow issues to the relevant team

Providing Feedback

Prior to becoming a quality checker, a full understanding of the
feedback process is required.

The quality checker must give feedback using the method outlined in the
quality checking procedure.

Feedback must be provided for every identified error. The feedback must:

-   describe the error identified, and what was incorrect
-   explain the impact of the error
-   explain the action that should have been taken to correct the error
-   include any relevant reference material that supports the action,
    such as Operational Blueprint details if available
-   be to the point, non-judging and constructive

The feedback function can be used for positive feedback, but only when
the outcome of the check is error free.

Quality Operations & Technical Support

Quality Operations & Technical Support:

-   provide support and oversee the accreditation process
-   provide data/reports on quality checking
-   support the quality framework and relevant resources

The Resources page contains the Quality Checker prerequisites table and
links to the Accreditation assessment form and Quality accreditation
confirmation form.
