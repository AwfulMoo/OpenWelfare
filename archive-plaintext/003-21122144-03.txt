This is a Family and Domestic Violence Interaction Point. If the
customer is with another person, on speaker phone, or already identified
with family and domestic violence concerns, continue with the current
business conversation. Otherwise, go to the Family and domestic violence
procedure to conduct the risk identification and referral process.

All DRA claims:
- must be processed in Process Direct
- must not be processed in Customer First

If there is a need to contact the customer or issue a Request for
Information letter, review the entire claim to check all information
needed. This will make sure all information to assess the claim can be
addressed in a single contact.

For the New South Wales Floods – July 2022, DRA and NZ DRA claims cannot
be rejected if a customer has claimed for a non-declared Local
Government Area (LGA) in New South Wales and meets all other eligibility
criteria. All other DRA and NZ DRA claims that do not meet the
eligibility criteria can be rejected. See the Process page.

This page has information to help staff process claims for DRA in
Process Direct when the online claiming channel has been activated.

|                                   | more. Therefore, the income from  |
