This document outlines the process for contacting incarcerated customers
and processing income compliance refunds for them.

Contacting customers

A tailored servicing approach is required for incarcerated customers who
have an income compliance refund or are part of the income compliance
class action.

As these customers cannot contact Services Australia, they are unable to
provide the information needed to process their refund or register for
the class action settlement.

Where correction facilities allow, Prison Liaison Officers (PLO) will
make direct contact with these customers to:

-   inform them of their refund and settlement details (if available),
    and
-   obtain the information needed to process their refunds and
    settlement payment

The Resources page contains links to the Services Australia website,
Correctional facilities intranet page and DOC templates.
