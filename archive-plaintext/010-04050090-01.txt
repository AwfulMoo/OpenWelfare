This document outlines details of when non-award study may be treated as
approved study for Austudy and Pensioner Education Supplement (PES).

Eligibility for non-award study

Services Australia will only pay financial assistance for study to those
customers who are enrolled in and undertaking an approved course of
study at an approved institution. A general requirement for the approval
of a course is that it leads to some sort of academic award (e.g.
Certificate, Diploma, Bachelor, etc.). A person who is undertaking
non-award study would, therefore, not generally be eligible for one of
the agency's payments for students. However Austudy and Pensioner
Education Supplement (PES) customers may be paid for non-award study
under certain conditions.

Non-award study that may count as approved study

A customer’s non-award study may count as an approved study load for
Austudy and PES purposes where:

-   the customer has been accepted by the educational institution as a
    non-degree student in the first year or semester, and
-   the customer is guaranteed course enrolment on successful completion
    of the study, and
-   the completed study is credited to their degree study.

If all these conditions are met, the studies may be counted as part of
the Austudy or PES study load.
