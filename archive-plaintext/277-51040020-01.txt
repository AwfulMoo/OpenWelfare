This document outlines the procedure when particular customers have
periods of low income. During these periods, Child Support may cease
enforcement of a court order or court registered agreement for child
support for a Stage 1 customer if the paying parent is receiving an
income support payment and satisfies the Prescribed Income Test.

Child Support application

The paying parent must lodge an application with Child Support, either
in writing or by phone.

When Child Support receives the application, a request for Prescribed
Income Test Information is forwarded to the Child Support Unit (CSU) at
Centrelink.

Centrelink Support Unit (CSU)

The CSU will verify that the applicant is receiving a Centrelink pension
or benefit and that the payer's combined income from social security
pensions or benefits, (less Rent Assistance and other non-taxable
additional payments) plus any other ordinary income, does not exceed the
highest single rate of pension as prescribed by child support
legislation (Prescribed Income Test).

Child Support determines the date from which to cease enforcement of the
court order/ agreement, ensuring that an overpayment of child support
does not occur.

Child Support will conduct regular reviews to check that non-enforcement
should continue by liaising with the Centrelink CSU. The CSU will
determine if the payer still meets the criteria on the date on which
Child Support makes the request.

The Resources page contains contact details for Child Support.
