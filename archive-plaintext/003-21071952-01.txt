This document explains how to code COVID-19 Disaster Payment claims,
including income support payment customers' claims.

Workflows are only available when a claiming period for a relevant
period starts.

All online claims that do not meet eligibility requirements can be
rejected, except when the customer has a pending income support payment.

Do not process Abridged Customer Claims, as these are finalised
automatically. This can take up to 14 calendar days. Do not contact
Technical Peer Support about un-finalised abridged claims. Do not tell a
customer to withdraw an abridged claim and resubmit it, as this may
cause further delays.

Eligibility

All claims must be fully assessed before they are coded.

See:

-   Assessing COVID-19 Disaster Payment Claims
-   Assessing income support payment customers COVID-19 Disaster Payment
    claims

Recording and coding a claim and access needed

All claims must be coded in the Flexible Support Payment (FSP)
subsystem. See the How to access ISS subsystems task card on the
Resources page.

Staff process claims using the Disaster Recovery Payment Claims workflow
on a customer's Centrelink record.

If the customer is eligible, they will receive the full rate of $500 or
$325/$600 or $375/$750 or $450/$200, depending on:

The Disaster Recovery Payment Claims workflow is not run for phone
claims that do not meet the eligibility criteria. See Document standards
and COVID-19 Disaster Payment - rejecting claims.

Staff must select the correct workflow name and never change the payment
amount.

Workflows are only available when a claiming period starts. Resources
has a table showing event codes and workflow details.

The Resources page has links to attachments, templates, forms, task
cards, contact details, Services Australia website links and start date
