Confirm consumer details

Before linking a Donor Only entitlement to a consumer record:

-   make sure the organ donor registrant has supplied their Medicare
    card number or given permission to link their details to their
    Medicare record
-   confirm the personal and group details for their Medicare number
    match the details on the donor registration form
-   make sure any additional matched duplicates are corrected. See
    Delete duplication organ donor registration

Personal Details that must match exactly:

-   first name
-   surname
-   date of birth
-   gender

Group detail that must match exactly:

-   card address

If any of the above personal details cannot be amended because of any of
the following reasons, an unskilled Service Officer must reassign the
work item. Raise the proficiency in PaNDA with processing comments (see
Work Optimiser for staff):

-   name on registration form does not match Medicare Enrolment File
-   name in group and personal differs (check comments field for
    identification provided in relation to name change)
-   date of birth differs (and is a major discrepancy)
