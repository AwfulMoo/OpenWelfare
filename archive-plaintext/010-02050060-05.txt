| 1                                 | Isayah is a full-time student and |
|                                   | is studying a Master of           |
|                                   | Philosophy at the University of   |
|                                   | Queensland                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Isayah is employed full-time and  |
|                                   | is currently in receipt of        |
|                                   | ABSTUDY. Isayah has only received |
|                                   | Incidentals Allowance and no      |
|                                   | Living Allowance, as the          |
|                                   | employment income received        |
|                                   | precludes it.                     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Isayah has just submitted a       |
|                                   | letter from the employer advising |
|                                   | of no wages being paid for the    |
|                                   | period amounting to 4 weeks as    |
|                                   | Isayah took leave from work with  |
|                                   | no pay. Therefore, Isayah's       |
|                                   | ABSTUDY was updated and income    |
|                                   | keyed as $0 for that period. This |
|                                   | then gave Isayah a Living         |
|                                   | Allowance entitlement for the 4   |
|                                   | weeks.                            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Isayah also submitted an invoice  |
|                                   | from the University for payment   |
|                                   | of tuition fees amounting to      |
|                                   | $28,000.                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Isayah is entitled to payment of  |
|                                   | the tuition fees, as there was an |
|                                   | entitlement to Living Allowance   |
|                                   | for at least 1 fortnight.         |
